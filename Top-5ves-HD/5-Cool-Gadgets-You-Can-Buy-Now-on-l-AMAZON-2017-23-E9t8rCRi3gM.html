yet oh six and free your eyes fermented
foods are some of the healthiest things
that we can feed our bodies and making
small batches in mason jars is an easy
and inexpensive way to try different
recipes and flavor combinations I'm Phil
Baron founder of Mason Tufts and we want
to make mason jar fermentation as simple
as possible with our collection of tools
that make fermenting your own foods easy
and convenient we're extremely excited
to introduce our newest product the
pickle pipe a one-piece silicone self
sealing and waterless airlock designed
specifically for wide mouth mason jars
allowing carbon dioxide to escape your
jar safely without allowing oxygen to
contaminate your ferment delivering mold
free and consistent fermented foods with
these the lacto fermentation process
produces carbon dioxide as a by-product
that is what you're seeing when your
ferment is bubbling airlocks perform the
all important function of venting that
carbon dioxide without allowing oxygen
to enter the Fermin if carbon dioxide
cannot escape it can build up and
actually call it the jar to explode an
exposure to oxygen is what causes mold
to spoil fermented foods the pickle pipe
is a bpa-free silicon disk with a
specialised one-way valve in the center
it can be placed on top of any wide
mouth mason jar and simply fasten to
place with any standard screw bent the
specialized valve only allows gas to
exit the jar once enough pressure built
up inside and it will never allow oxygen
or anything else to enter the jar
guaranteeing a consistent mold free
ferment every time here's how the pickle
pipe can make your next batch of
sauerkraut a breeze after shredding
salting and pounding your cabbage
packing into any wide mouth mason jar
weighed it down and screw the pickle
pipe into place with any standard screw
bin that's it there's no need to burp
your jars each day no need to fumble
with multi piece plastic airlocks that
are difficult to store clean and still
need to have their water levels
monitored every day there's no
maintenance required whatsoever with the
pickle pipe once you screw it on you can
forget about it for days
even weeks resting easy that you're
super foots inside are being looked
after
the low-profile design makes a snap to
store your jars in tight spaces and when
you're finished simply pop it in the
dishwasher and reuse it over and over
again there's nothing easier or more
convenient don't just take our word for
it here's what some industry experts had
to say about using the pickle pipe I
don't have any suggestions for
improvement as I had a great experience
with this fabulous super functional
fermenting tool the pickle pipe was
great easy to store and best of all
there was no brine bubbling out of the
jar such a simple idea your pickle pipe
is super simple and easy the pickle pipe
is the easiest and most intuitive
fermentation lid I've ever used
so join the experts and let the pickle
type of make your next batch the best
yet London now convinced estimator
it's the wrong boyo that's a pretty good
idea yeah
