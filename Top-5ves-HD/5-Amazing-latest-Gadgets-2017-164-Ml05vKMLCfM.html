imagine all the ideas you could bring to
life with hi I'm julissa and I'm Qatar
check out what we made
there are all these modern health
challenges that extend beyond steps and
heart rate
we constantly hunched over our devices
our skin ages faster every time we go
outside artificial lighting messes with
our sleep we spend too much time being
still even at our standing desks there
wasn't a wearable that was really
holistic about health so we made one
ourselves pose notifies you by
smartphone to give you real-time
suggestions exactly when you need them
just put it on press calibrate and it
starts working pose vibrates when you
slept no more awkward positions that
strain your spine and SAP your
confidence no more wondering if you need
to put on sunscreen pose make sure it's
not too dim to focus and not too bright
to sleep and the battery life is seven
or more days post fixes posture and
collects data even without a phone
connected it can save your data without
syncing for up to a week it's also
water-resistant so don't worry about
showering with it
it's designed beautifully with
all-natural Benzes and can be worn with
any chain
damn that's smooth it's really just the
fact that you can just throw a camera in
between these little spots and crack so
you've never been able to do before it's
insane
priceless really hi I'm Andrea from Baro
where we aim to make the impossible film
shop possible introducing the next
generation table cam we enable easy
filming in places even drones can't go
this is the viral life the first ever
portable and easy to use cable camp the
light kit is the perfect extension to
your existing camera setup the viral
light is foldable making it easy to
carry with you in a backpack and with
the intuitive mounting system it can be
set up in less than three minutes we
wanted to create something that will
make people go WOW how did they do that
when they saw the video going through
windows cars really Packwood's or other
places where you would never imagine
flying a camera but at the same time
keep it so simple that anyone can use it
even though it's the first time
operating a cable camp you would
definitely feel successful
the viral light goes faster to follow
the action of high speed and slow enough
to capture the perfect time-lapse shot
and the battery will it last up to three
hours with lights indicating how much
you have left
that is so cool
exactly the tool that we needed in the
sport it takes less than a minute setup
and your way to go get the bangin shots
just like the pros with our background
from arranging and filming extreme sport
events and festivals we have seen that
more and more filmmakers from beginner
to pro level are seeking new angles when
capturing their most extreme and
memorable moments on video that's why we
wanted to make viral light available for
everyone and compatible with any camera
and stabilizer up to three point three
pops have to admit the first few times I
used it I got a little bit carried away
of the speed and it was gonna go as fast
as it did which is pretty damn far I
always came back up and kept asking for
more I've been shooting films
professionally for about seven years and
I've never seen a product I can do that
with our strong team of engineers
filmmakers and athletes we're bringing
this product to life here on Kickstarter
we've iterated and tested the product
with lead users from all over the world
and the product is now ready for
manufacturing but we need your help to
press play on production back us today
and you can start to be creative with
your filmmakers and to make that
impossible shot possible
does this situation look familiar you're
flipping your pillow at night
desperately trying to fall asleep
Munna is a unique device that
understands your sleeping pattern and
regulates your head temperature to help
you get the best possible sleep Munna
will help you to start your day feeling
fully recovered and energetic sleep well
live well hi I'm David and this is
Colleen and we're the founders of Munna
for years it took me hours every night
to fall asleep so we decided to do
something about it together we developed
a product that not only gets you to
sleep faster but also helps you get the
best sleep until it's time for you to
wake up so how do we do that
with temperature
temperature is the key to good sleep to
fall asleep our body needs to cool down
and lower temperatures help us get a
better sleep quality when we wake up it
is the opposite our body needs to warm
up and our head plays a critical role in
this temperature regulation that's why
munna improves your sleep by regulating
your pillow temperature simply place the
device on your bedside table insert the
pad into your pillowcase and use the app
to set the wakeup time the temperature
of the pad is regulated through a water
circulation system which cools down as
you lay in bed to help you fall asleep
faster sleep and environment sensors
combined with machine learning help
understand your perfect sleeping pattern
and regulate the temperature accordingly
when it's time when I will gently warm
up and wake you can actually with the
app you will get key insights on sleep
and how to improve it further we believe
that is not about how long you sleep but
how well you sleep so by improving your
night will not also improve your day
body temperature is very important for
sleep quality
so munna is one of the best sleep
technology to improve sleep we've done
more than 200 user tests and have an
ongoing clinical study we have spent the
last four months in Shenzhen China
working closely with manufacturers to
make sure we have a great design and can
ship a quality product on time to our
backers we've been working on this
project for nearly two years now and
we're finally ready for production we
want to bring you better sleep now all
we need is your support thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
