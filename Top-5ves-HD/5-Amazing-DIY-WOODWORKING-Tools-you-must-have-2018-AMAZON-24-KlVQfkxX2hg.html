with one saw one blade and no damage to
the sheetrock wires our plumbing one saw
what about this
forget about pulling out your beam saw
or making four cuts with two different
saws
I could do it with one saw in two cuts
bet your saw can't do this how fast was
that and without the waste of material
or ugly edges that can be graded by
reciprocating saw what if you could do
this
I just cut that rim joist without
marking or chalking any lines try that
with any other saw could you even think
about doing this with your circular saw
how many times would you have to pull
out your tape measure just to cut these
floor joists 10 20 times try doing it
without measuring at all and try doing
this with your old circular saw a you
have to do this by hand or switch to an
undercut so now I just rotate my handle
90 degrees for a perfect warm pass under
cuts and only a few seconds
a typical jobsite you'd need almost all
these saws to get the job done the
straight flush saw replaces them all to
do is fold up the front deck and I can
easily make a 1 a 9/16 nose cut 360
degrees around the room way faster than
a manual saw and without cutting into
pipe or a wire hate making ugly
inaccurate cuts with a router or
reciprocating saw the deployable front
deck is also the fastest easiest way to
cut out doors and windows look at those
edges they're clean beautiful lines that
don't need any extra attention
unlike the ugly uneven cuts that you get
with a reciprocating saw or plunge
router more importantly we've saved a
ton of material see all these plywood
scraps depending on the size of your
jobsite that's hundreds to thousands of
dollars worth of material you might lose
when you use one of these inefficient
saws to cut your doors and windows with
the straight flush all you'll save more
of your scraps even on a small house
that can easily turn into a few thousand
dollars this 505 P protractor from
steric tools is designed just for this
job place it in the corner and open the
wings until they come into contact with
the wall now and this is the slick part
simply read the miter saw setting
directly from the tool no calculating no
transferring measurements and
practically no chance for error
in most cases the crown molding bottom
is the edge that has the most detail one
thing is common to both inside and
outside corners and that is the molding
must be placed into the saw with the
bottom edge up in other words the bottom
edge will always be against the miter
saw fence it's also important to keep in
mind whether you're cutting the
left hand or right hand piece of molding
okay here we go when cutting the left
hand piece of an inside corner swing the
mitre arm to the right and place the
workpiece on the right side of the blade
to cut the right hand section of an
inside corner swing the mitre arm to the
left and place the work piece to the
left of the blade
the Ehrlich steam generator was designed
for all wood workers from the novice to
the expert and works great for many wood
bending projects like colonial chairs
guitars boats tennis racquets shaker
boxes skis sleds and even really crazy
looking pieces of furniture or arts the
Earl lacks steam generator is simple and
safe to use and even includes
instructions on how to build a steam box
no need to fear the hassle or the risks
of rigging up an old teakettle or
propane heater to generate steam the
relaxed steam generator makes bending
woods safe with the exterior water level
indicator to thermal protectors 12-foot
cool to touch hose automatic suck back
valves and pressure relief valves fill
with clean water hook the hose up to
your steam box and plug in it's that
simple to use the Earl X steam generator
includes a 1500 watt elements and a 1.3
gallon tank that takes 23 minutes to
steam up and provides over two hours of
steam per fill also included with the
steam generator is a steam box adapter
to quickly and easily attach the steam
generator to your steam box take on new
exciting woodworking projects using the
power of steam to bend wood drawing
straight lines can be challenging when
relying on a tape measure and a scrap of
wood as a straight edge now there's a
better way with the new wood peckers
t-squares
whether working off a factory edge or
not you will draw a straighter and more
accurate parallel lines in less time
than you can imagine
woodpeckers t-squares are available in
three sizes the 12-inch size is ideal
for work with solid lumber and furniture
parts the 24 and 32 inch are intended
for cabinetry work in the layout of
sheet goods
each woodpecker's t-square consists of a
precisely machined aluminum blade
perfectly fitted to a solid billet
handle with a machined edge for true
square as well as support steps to
prevent tipping both critical parts are
fastened together with screws offset to
create tension between the blade and
handle for mechanical soundness the
laser engraved laid has precisely spaced
one millimeter holes machined every 1/16
of an inch apart and will fit both
pencil or mechanical pencils also
included are additional holes on one
inch centers for marking shelf pin
locations the blade edges are formed at
a 30 degree bevel and engraved with
precise in scale markings graduated at
1/32 of an inch the bevel design reduces
parallax and increases measuring and
marking accuracy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
