on how to use your touch points basic
when you get your kit you'll have two
touch points inside first you need to
decide which touch point is going to be
your lead device simply use the button
on the top to turn that device on when
the green light comes on you'll know
that it's on it's important that you
choose right away which setting you'd
like to use if you turn your device on
and then use blue you'll get to your
sleep setting toggle it again to get to
green which is the setting for calm and
a third time to get to the setting for
anger in order to now pair the devices
you're simply going to turn on your
second device with a green light turn
the window so they face each other the
second device will pick up the signal
from the first device you'll know your
touch points are properly working when
