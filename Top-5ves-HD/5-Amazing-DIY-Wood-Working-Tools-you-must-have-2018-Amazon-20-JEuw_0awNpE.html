assembly is square or to transfer to
mentions from one workpiece to another
many of us turn to the trusty tape
measure but sometimes clamps can get in
the way where we start measuring at one
inch and forget to subtract the one inch
from the final measurement well you can
put those problems in the past and make
marking simpler and more accurate with
rocklers 3 and 1 bar gauge the bar gauge
comes with two durable aluminum bodies
and three sets of interchangeable tips
that triple its versatility letting it
serve as a squaring stick a story stick
and a trammel scribe the gauge bodies
are designed to work with easy to get
3/8 inch diameter wooden dowels or metal
rods and because you supply them you can
customize a gauges range to fit the job
at hand
the rods or dowels secure into the gauge
bodies with set screws using an included
hex wrench the length of the gauge
adjusts by moving the gauge bodies
closer together or farther apart large
knurled knobs on top let you easily lock
in the settings all three sets of tips
fit onto the 3/8 inch rods or doubles
and secure by tightening set screws with
another included hex wrench the angle
tips are perfect for fitting inside the
corners of box assemblies to check for
square if you're building a drawer
they're also narrow enough to fit in the
grooves of the bottom so you can size
your panel precisely the flat tips allow
you to transfer dimensions directly from
one part of your project to another no
measuring means no time or material lost
because of mistakes with a tape measure
and the flat tip sit flush with the
bottom of the gauge bodies so they won't
tip over while you're working with the
trammel tips you're no longer restricted
by the limited capacity of your compass
you can draw arcs and circles of
practically any size you need and the
tips fit standard sized pencils so if
you want greater accuracy in a variety
of applications without the trouble of
double and triple-checking your
measurements
the crew squared is unlike any tool you
see it's a combination square a speed
square bevel gauge death and height
gauge and more the brainchild of teacher
and inventor Jonathan Schwartz the true
square will be the most versatile square
in your shop the stainless steel
triangle travels and pivots along a 12
inch length of aluminum t-track so you
can find or lay out any angles from zero
to 90 degrees and simply flip the true
square to find complementary angles the
true squared t-track boasts three
engraved sixteenth inch scales and the
triangle has two seven-inch scales in 16
inch increments the precision laser
engraved scale along the edge is a
reference to the interior angle scale
which features a series of scalloped
detents that lock in common angle
settings
the triangle also features marking
diamonds at every hinge which assists in
precise layout work then there's the 1
to 2 ratio scale on the bottom of the
triangle that allows you to set the tool
to divide measurements in half also use
true square to check depth then the set
table saw blade or router bit height
your setups will be spot-on every time
continuous adjustment needed set your
pressure pushed out to engage and now
you have your hands-free to focus on
your project vertical pressures applied
by armors horizontal dog the auto adjust
technology in conjunction with a seven
and a half inch post allows the user to
select the desired pressure and clap
materials of heights up to five and a
half inches above the table surface and
you can use the rubber fitting to reduce
marking on any delicate pieces with the
inline dog clamp and accompanying fences
you can apply horizontal pressure up to
550 pounds outfitted with the same auto
adjust technology the in line clamp
features a push bar that's adjustable up
to three and a half inches before
engaging the one-handed clamp the
pressure will always stay the same even
after disengaging and adjusting the bar
the clamp also features a non marring
foot that provides firm holding pressure
and won't leave marks on your projects
the foot also features a notch that will
allow clamping of corners armored fences
can be used as guides or together to
form corners they feature adjustable
dogs that slide on the underside of the
fence to allow the option of mounting a
straight edge or angle the fences are
reversible with a high side and a low
side to accommodate variations in work
Fitness on blank for sanding and routing
the
is an incredibly handy multi-purpose
measuring tool perfect for a wide
variety of applications in your home or
on the job site trim work setting
reveals laying out mitered corners
transferring measurements gauging blade
Heights alignment control and much more
loads of functionality packed into one
compact handy little tool the key to the
multi mark is it's sliding metric and
imperial marked scale that can be
positioned in three different
configurations standard 90 degrees and
45 degrees each position can be locked
in anywhere along the scale to provide
accuracy and repetition for a wide
variety of project solutions
the base of the multi mark is an exact
six inches so set in the standard
position the multi mark can be used
cumulatively by extending the scale to
grab measurements up to ten and a half
inches perfect for repetitive marks are
transferring measurements finding the
correct measurements for mitered corners
on door and window trim while setting
the proper reveal can be difficult and
time-consuming the multi market limits
this guesswork by setting the industry
standard 3/16 inch reveal for you with a
built-in reveal edge molded right on its
body simply live the multi mark up into
the top of the door jamb and Mark the
reveal this gives you the accurate
reference point of layout and
measurement for confidently cutting your
trim to length
the built-in reveal also lets you
reference your trim at the perfect 3/16
inch reveal along the entire run to the
piece while nailing in place no need to
measure and align the trim to Mark's
just position the multi mark against the
door jamb and align the trim to the edge
and nail into place set in the standard
or 90 degree position the multi mark
serves as a precise transferrable depth
gauge excellent for capturing profile
depths and transferring that depth to
router bits and saw blades also set in
the standard position the multi mark is
perfect for capturing measurements and
transferring them to your saw or layout
without the need to take an actual
measurement take tile for example simply
pick up the distance needed between the
wall and the last tile and then transfer
that distance to the tile for shorter
distances you can easily scribe the mark
directly across the tile no measuring no
guessing no hassle the Craig multi mark
makes repetitive work a snap installing
Hardware on cabinet doors can require
the use of a pre-made jig or making
separate measurements on each door with
the multi mark scale on the 90 degree
position at the desired depth and height
quickly mark the hardware location by
referencing the bottom and side of each
cabinet door this guarantees exact
location of every piece of hardware in
your kitchen and cuts your time in half
no more misplacing earplugs and you'll
have hearing protection with a noise
reduction rating of 25 decibels whenever
and wherever you need it
the earplugs are connected to the frames
by cords just slide the toggle to
retract them and they store in
compartments in the earpieces the
glasses themselves are top-notch they
carry a high impact safety rating and
are hard coated to resist scratches they
also have an anti-fog coating and
provide protection against both UVA and
UVB rays available as regular safety
glasses or as fit over prescription
glasses to incorporate rubber temple
interiors for superior comfort and fit
to top it all off a microfiber pouches
included to store and protect your sound
shields when you're not wearing them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
