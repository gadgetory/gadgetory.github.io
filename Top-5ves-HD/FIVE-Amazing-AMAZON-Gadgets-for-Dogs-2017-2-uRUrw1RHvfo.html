world's coolest new fetch toy it's time
to reinvent your game of fetch with this
100-plus foot gravity-defying flying
ring Roger dog owners already loved the
hurricane eye hi this is my dog Sharkey
and these are your average dog toys
frisbee
no interest Chucky gets bone as soon as
I come out look he goes crazy
the hurricane 9 ring launcher built to
give your dog maximum exercise in just a
fraction of the time it's made from
durable
evie a foam which is built to withstand
the sharpest teeth so you don't have to
replace the rings after just one game of
fetch forget about the slobbery tennis
balls
the hurricane 9 works indoors it floats
and yet you could take it to the dog
park all dogs love the hurricane 9 even
if your dogs not typically the type to
chase a tennis ball within months after
launch the hurricane 9 was already
featured on the news and it was selected
as a top 5 must-have toy at the San
Diego pet expo did I mention it was
invented by a rocket scientist hi I'm
John Hunter co-inventor of the hurricane
9 I work at high-speed airplanes solar
airplanes and now the world's most
bodacious dog to life and one day I was
working on a sporty good that would fly
a really long ways based on an airplane
wing like this we take an airplane
wrapped into a circle and fly as a
country mile I took it to my daughter's
house and just for fun I tried it in
front of her dog Amos and he was went
crazy so I immediately realized after
about 20 more shots that he was really
like this thing we had a great dog toy
in our hands
here we go dogs aerodynamics 101 while
we've been teaching dogs we've been
talking to dog trainers to something
really great about this toy is I also
float so if you have an active dog who
likes the water would be a great idea as
well
like most of us Emma's owner is a busy
person and so she doesn't get that daily
exercise a study show is proven to make
a healthy happy pub and so she's left a
dream of that blissfully exhausting game
of fetch
after just two launches your dog has
already run the length of a whole
football field and it's easy to use you
just load the ring pull it back and
release if you use it inside just pull
it back part of the way and if you're
feeling old-fashioned just throw it
without the launcher you go tiger it
also doubles as a great training aid
the hurricane 9 comes with three rings
with six rings or with six rings sold
separately
the hurricane nine is now for sale at
hurricane 9.com so your dog could be
flying through the air with a better
workout a better toy and a lot more fun

your other dog owning friends he ends up
