over the last 15 years not much has
changed from the first masonry saw built
the 1930s the masonry saws of the day
the challenges are still very much the
same slurry bulky design and limited
mobility now that's all about the change
iq powertools is raising the bar with a
true innovation the world's first
sixteen point five inch dry cut may seem
soft with integrated dust control this
is the IQ ms 362 this is not your
grandfather's Mesa result especially
engineered 16.5 inch blade gives you a
5.5 inch depth of cut in a pull 24 inch
length of gun providing precision dry
cutting on all mason materials and 40%
faster cutting than all the competition
equipped with soft-start technology the
IQ power management system allows for
smooth uninterrupted operation it runs
off a standard 120 volt and 20 amps
eliminating the need for a 220 volt plug
adapter or high output generator where
the gas shot is dynamic stand raises and
lowers with ease you'll be able to move
positions without even breaking a sweat
did we mention it has fully integrated
dust collection featuring a 270 degree
dust reduction system dust is captured
within a blade guard rear dust storm and
downdraft louver table via high-powered
integrated vacuum with a three-stage
cyclonic filtration system this allows
for up to 99.5% dust collection
how about effortless clean up yeah it's
got that
this is the IQ ms 362
and it's not your grandfather's may see
yourself rigid the number one selling
proton saw brand introduces the new
ultimate mud mixer professionals no time
is money
that's why rigid gets you on the job
faster just add your material select
your setting and return when it's done
it'll let you know when it's ready once
it's locked and loaded the mixer does
the rest automatically keep on task with
a confidence of knowing you'll return to
consistent working material you can even
program custom mix settings for
materials suited to your preference and
working condition rigid is built to work
hard but not hard to work with
engineered to help lighten the load and
cut down time the ultimate mug mixer
doesn't require all the extra tools like
the other guys stool and when a job
requires a more hands-on approach detach
it and take it where you need it
built-in technology increases the motors
longevity and keeps you working day in
day out at max we've been developing
innovative tools for the construction
industry for decades in 1993 max changed
the steel reinforcing industry with the
introduction of the world's first
battery-operated rebar tying tool the
max rebar tire has forever transformed
jobsite safety and productivity for
ironworkers now max is raising the bar
again with its new rebar tire the twin
tire rb4 for one team the twin tire can
tie rebar with greater efficiency than
ever before the twin tires name comes
from its innovative dual wire feeding
mechanism which increases its tying
speed and improves jobsite productivity
it's low power consumption design and
higher capacity battery gives the twin
tire the ability to type four thousand
ties per charge the twin tires enhanced
wire pullback mechanism dispenses the
precise amount of wire needed to form a
tie reducing wire consumption and
delivering more ties per spool for
additional cost savings we've redesigned
the twin tire jaw to tide number three
by number three up to number seven by
number seven rebars allowing you to tie
bigger gauges while maintaining the
ability to work in tighter spaces than
previous
models the twin tires quick load
magazine makes changing wire spools a
piece of cake and the relocated magazine
provides enhanced balance and ergonomics
making flat work easier with three tie
wire options to choose from the twin
tires new wire bending mechanism
produces a shorter tight allowing for
shallower concrete pours and positions
tie ends downward to increase safety for
years max has developed the world's most
advanced rebar tying tools and now
offers a full line of products for the
steel reinforcing industry the right
fall protection equipment can help but
it has to be used correctly
that's why Honeywell designed the Miller
air core harness innovative fall
protection designed to deliver comfort
in the air with a breakthrough design
that uses breathable open core padding
technology air circulates freely through
and around the packs reducing heat and
moisture build-up so workers stay cooler
and drier padding is applied
strategically reducing surface area by
up to 16% contouring prevents chafing
and irritation and our patented dura
flex stretchable webbing provides
greater mobility and flexibility but
unless a harness is easy to adjust it
probably won't be used properly to
address that concern
we put cam buckles on the shoulder
straps now workers can make quick
precise adjustments with one hand the
chest buckle is convenient to it
features a quick-connect quick-release
design that lets workers get into and
out of the harness in seconds weight is
always top of mind
we used a unique mix of materials and
components
and created a harness that's up to 20%
lighter than similar competitive models
the Miller air core harness is light
enough to reduce worker fatigue and
increase productivity style matters
workers tell us they like the way the
Miller air core harness looks and feels
and safety managers appreciate the high
vis color scheme one glance and you'll
know if harnesses are being worn whether
your team is working close by or across
the site the Miller air core harness
incorporates many other great features a
stand-up back d-ring
a mesh vac shield the removable belt and
clip-on finials it's the most unique and
innovative harness on the market your
team will be more apt to wear it
properly and work safely and
productively when your team is working
at Heights give them comfort in the air
give them the Miller air core harness
another innovation from Honeywell safety
products as a masive

extension of yourself it's a symbol of
the quality and perfection you put into
each job and defines your commitment to
hard work and dedication
Marshalltown has continued the tradition
