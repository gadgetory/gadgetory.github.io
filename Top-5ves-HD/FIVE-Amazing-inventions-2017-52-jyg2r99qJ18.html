you
after two long years of work many hours
of development design planning
programming and testing following a
successful Kickstarter campaign in
global media attention
we finally finish the dewclaws
if you're fed up with overpriced adapt
or your macbook use the do box to get
back all the fort's at once with just
one cable you can natively use the hdmi
land and USB ports with full speed do
box is much more than an accessory
when your iPhone storage is full you can
easily save your pictures to the
internal storage of the Duke box or to a
microSD card you can backup your photos
videos and documents wirelessly and
securely offline
now you can leave your macbook at home
and control it remotely with the help of
the do box create a fully featured
laptop from your iPad for the first time
ever you may even use a traditional USB
mouse on ipad we give you the freedom of
full connectivity
if your battery is about to run out
during travel just charge your iPhone or
iPad from the do box we integrated its
function so deeply in iOS that it just
feels natural
or use it with any projector monitor or
TV through HDMI do box is capable of
creating a private hotspot so you can
share your files anytime anywhere
without an internet connection or you
can even ask Siri to control the do box
for you hey Siri start a slide show on
my cue balls
we give you everything you've been
missing from your Apple devices so far
it's a problem everyone can relate to
nobody likes making the vet whether
you're young professional without the
time to spare have a teenager who
doesn't want to bother or simply
struggling with mobility issues we can
all relate to feeling the dead after
walking away from an undated we invented
the smart debate because there's nothing
better than getting into a bed that
feels like it was made just for you our
patent-pending design uses air chambers
made of space-age fabric that attaches
to your do vet in a non-permanent and
fits inside your duvet cover using the
app you can set your bed to be made
while you're awake so that shortly after
you have a hotel quality made bed every
time once we realize the simplicity and
effectiveness of our design it opened
the door to many other benefits first of
all we added a duvet placement boat this
makes the smart duvet rigid so you can
easily attach the device to your own
bouvet solving once and for all the
age-old struggle of placing the duvet
and its cover also our smart attach
system allow smart devet to place both
duvet and sheets simultaneously smart
duvet is fully compatible with most
duvet and duvet covers if you do not
have a duvet yet check out our
advantageous bundles so there you have
it a simple invention which works with
your existing bedding and makes your bed
automatically
we completed the design and have a fully
working prototype hey guys this is chris
with smart duvet live at CES 2017 smart
do vent right now on indiegogo check us
out we need your support to make been
making a thing of the past
I've been waiting for a long time now i
started my comedy demented as a way to
get my inventions for public you may
have heard some of my emotions like the
solowheel and hover tracks
a lot of news was generated around the
products called hoverboards but most of
the all of the products you have seen a
knockoff of mahavir tracks which was
funded in kickstarter 2013
my team and I started to develop the
idea of Yoda because the feedback from
the solar wave and how attracts users we
sell a need for community solution for
light applications which is easier to
learn lighter weight and still
practically
I really enjoyed seeing people using and
loving my emotions I hope you liked this
one too
you
this is control the robot it has the
same DNA as sophisticated
hundred-thousand-dollar industrial robot
arms elegantly reduced down to desktop
size and made as affordable as a coffee
machine now anyone can own their own
robot just plug in a laptop and take
control with a full range of
articulation through six axis controls
users are as unlimited as your
imagination from teaching your children
to code through play too clever
applications for small business to
science and education uses control the
robot provides endless opportunities it
works right out of the box and the
completely open source interface means
you can control it with your favorite
programming language or simple
conversation or text commands or use
physical manipulation to teach it
repeatable tasks you can also connect
multiple arms to work together end of
arm tools are easy to change and will be
available for endless uses including
grips laser engravers suction pads spray
nozzles 3d printing and more with a
camera control can also find and
recognize all users will be able to
write their own application and share
the code globally creating your database
of control the robot programs from
creating a miniature factory for your
business to raising the next generation
of genius inventors control the robot
means anyone can now control a robot
