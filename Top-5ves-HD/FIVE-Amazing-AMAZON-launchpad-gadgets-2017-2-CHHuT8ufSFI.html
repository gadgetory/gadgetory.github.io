we do it in the morning we do it in the
car we do it at work and even when we
get home sitting we do it for over nine
hours every single day and because of
the way we're doing it ninety percent of
us will get back pain in our lives
seriously when we hunch and slump it
affects our mood our happiness even how
optimistic we feel look at yourself
right now how are you sitting how's your
back and your neck probably not too
great huh hi my name is Catherine and I
started working on my posture two and a
half years ago when I started having
terrible sciatica pain I have spent so
much time and money on doctor's visits
therapies special pillows and all these
ridiculous products but I couldn't find
anything that just worked so for the
past year I've been creating a real
solution with the most amazing designers
and prototyper Zand dozens and dozens of
people with really bad backs it was
important to create something small
enough I could fit in my purse and
something effortless so I could just
count on it working in five seconds flat
something reliable and something that
would help me improve my posture even
when I wasn't wearing it this is better
back it allows you to effortlessly sit
in perfect posture easing back pain and
training yourself how to sit use it when
you're sitting at your desk on an
airplane watching a game or even when
you meditate basically use it anytime
you have to sit you don't have to go far
to find people with bad posture or back
pain a friend a parent someone you work
with or even people you meet product
testing around San Francisco every
Friday here's what people think about
better back Oh
oh so let's kind of elaborate I feel da
feels awesome it's so easy to just sit
up straight this could sound weird back
and like feel my my body you know I can
feel my my organs not being squished I
can feel that it's right here but it's
not like oh I have all this on me it's
just like I am just like relieved pain
free I'm sitting straight up right
there's like it forces your torso to
stay upright where can I get one of
these can I have this one simple it's
easy I put it on and I feel immediate
relief so that's how it feels and this
is how it's actually helping better back
gives you better posture it allows you
to not fatigue the muscles that you use
when you're sitting down so when you do
stand up your postures literally changed
good posture can change who you are it
affects your attitude it affects your
decision making good posture changes who
you are literally sitting correctly over
time does more than stops pumping stress
on your spine it also retrains your
body's natural default posture so
whether you're standing or sitting
without better back your posture is
greatly improved let me show you how it
works better bag zips itself into a
portable case throw it in your bag and
unpack it when you're ready to sit wrap
the back pad around your back and the
knee straps around your knees all
there's left to do is to pull on the
adjustable leg straps to stack your
spine into perfect posture so if you're
going to spend nine hours of your day
sitting you might as well be doing it
right when you're pain free and your
body is perfectly aligned you feel
happier more confident and you regain
your ability to focus on whatever it is
you want out of life now is a time I
need your help to hit the minimum order
quantity and to produce the very first
run of better backs so please hit the

hi I'm Anthony and I'm Luke and we are
the creators of torch the universal co
heater I came up with the idea for torch
a few years ago when I was flying to
northern Michigan for my little
brother's wedding in december now
there's a saying that we have out there
there's no such thing as being cold only
being unprepared so I didn't want to
show up to the wedding is something huge
and bulky so I started looking around
for a heater that I could put in the
coat that I had and to my surprise there
wasn't anything out there that's when I
called up my old friend Luke from
engineering school and we started
developing torch what makes torch so
special is that it's thin and flexible
enough to be installed in almost any
code and it transfers between coats in
seconds the torch unit comes with the
torch Co heater itself a battery a
charger and multiple installation kits
the torch has four heat settings and can
last for up to five hours on a single
charge over the past two years we have
developed towards with our own money and
we've already manufactured our first run
of functional prototypes in order to
make torch of success we need your help
to complete the patent process and
manufacture our full-scale production
run to bring to market we are excited
about the future and we know that
together we can make torches success

how the sticks always had potential to
be a lot of fun growing up but the
technology just wasn't good enough to
let us do what we really wanted back in
1997 we set out to turn pogo sticks into
a whole new sport our concept was based
on the idea of having a portable
trampoline something you can jump 36 or
even 10 feet high on but also take
anywhere you want to go the v4 is the
portable trampoline we'd always dreamed
up with the v4 you have the ability to
add a remove air and completely change
the stiffness of the bounce someone who
weighs 300 pounds can jump on the same
exact v4 as someone who only weighs 80
pounds all you need to do is change the
air pressure in less than a minute you
can perfectly tuned the v4 to each
writers preferences pumping more air in
to jump higher and taking air out to
jump lower this makes sharing it with
friends and family of fun-filled
experience that everyone can enjoy you
can also collapse the v4 to make
transportation a breeze whether you're a
pro or just stepping on to the v4 for
the very first time you'll love the
weightless flight like experience you'll
get the basics in minutes and from that
point on there's no limit to how far you
can challenge yourself with the v4
you'll be able to jump up onto ledges
downstairs and over gaps of all sizes
while nailing down some pretty awesome
tricks after playing around on the v4
you'll never look at your surroundings
in the same way again obstacles and
features that are too high for bikes and
skateboards are perfect for the v4 so
those of you looking for a fun way to
stay in shape the be four will work most
of the muscle groups in your body and
get your heart pounding immediately it's
a killer cardio workout and the best
part is that while you're having fun
bouncing around you won't even realize
how quickly you build a sweat in order
to achieve superior build quality and
maintain the high tolerance is necessary
for the v4 to work we manufacture and
assemble it right here in our Southern
California shop we work closely with our
suppliers to become a part of the build
process and as each component is made
or right there to test them this
streamlines are manufacturing and
ensures that every v4 we make is up to
our standards if you're looking for the
portable trampoline that we always
dreamed of v4 is going to knock your
socks off whether you want to use it
simply for exercise or to jump eight
feet high and do crazy tricks on is up
to you and we know you'll love every
second of it join us and help change the
way pogo sticks racine forever
