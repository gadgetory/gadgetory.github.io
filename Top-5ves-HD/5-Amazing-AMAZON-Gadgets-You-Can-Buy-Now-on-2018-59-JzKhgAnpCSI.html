Travel humidifier ever wonder if your
air purifier is actually improving the
air quality in your home where are you
unsure about which settings to choose
for the best results I'd like to
introduce you to air response for its
new collection of air purifiers design
with dustin's this purifier monitors
your home environment detects particles
and responds to deliver cleaner air
simply set it to auto mode and air
response does the rest by adjusting its
settings for optimal results but how do
you know dust sense is actually getting
the job done
the air quality indicator bar switches
between blue purple and red depending on
the amount of particles detected in the
air so you'll always know the air
quality in your room at a glance plus
it's built with powerful two stage
filtration an activated carbon filter
helps to reduce unwanted odors in your
home while a HEPA media filter captures
the small particles that could be
floating in the air let's see how the
air response purifier works right now
dust senses detecting a low amount of
particles shown with a blue light watch
what happens when I blow out this candle
dust sense detects the smoke
automatically changes the light to red
and
fan speed too high for quick and
efficient removal of particles from the
air so if there's an increase of pollen
and dust in the air or if you're cooking
or playing with your pets the air
response will be working to keep the air
in your home clean plus it's powerful to
show you the HEPA filtration in action I
remove the front cover of air response
watch what happens as this chamber is
filled with colored smoke and when I
turn it on wow look how quickly air
response draws the smoke in and traps
the fine particles in the filter in fact
this HEPA media filter captures 99% of
unwanted particles down to 0.3 microns
like dust allergens pollen and pet
dander you can actually see how dirty
the filter is after it clears the smoke
just imagine what it could do for the
air in your home and with three
different sizes you can have cleaner air
throughout every area of your house in
fact in the correct size room air
response will circulate the air about
every 12 minutes choose small for rooms
such as bedrooms or dens medium for
larger spaces like kitchens or living
rooms or choose the large air response
for open layouts or studio apartments so
if you're looking for an easy way to
clean the air without the guesswork
there's an heiress moon in my room see
the moon come to life in your own room
with brilliant moonlight and authentic
detail activate it with the remote
control and see a different lunar phase
each time you touch the button choose
from 12 different phases of the Moon
crescent moon half moon full moon you
decide or choose the automatic function
and watch the moon shift through all the
lunar phases on its own look outside
each night to see what type of moon it
is then match your moon to the one out
in the night sky it's also an amazing
nightlight with auto shutoff for bedtime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
