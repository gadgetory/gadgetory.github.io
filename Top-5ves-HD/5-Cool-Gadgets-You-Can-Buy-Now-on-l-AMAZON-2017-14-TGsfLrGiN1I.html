Lovelock keep track of your luggage keep
the journey alive
hi I'm Katherine I love riding my bike
and I do it every day but I really hate
having to think about how to carry all
my stuff around I want to accept me and
that's fine
flexibility of my open bike basket with
the storage and security of a car
compass so I teamed up with the
designers and engineers of cuts and
glory and tomorrow lab to create Cebu
salute the first bike mounted storage
system to address the needs of the urban
biker that is as functional as it is
beautiful
we designed the blue salutes to be able
to carry large sink when it's open
and smaller things when closed knowing
that we wanted to be able to leave
things inside the boot when we left our
bike we designed a unique locking
mechanism that runs through the entire
boot securely locking in both lives in
place it also attaches to any standard
bike racks on the inside there can't be
removed without first unlocking and
opening the lips we wanted to keep our
things dry in the rain so we created a
sealed lid and we molded the bottom of
the boot out of a strong plastic to
expand wear and here instead of worrying
about the things you have to carry with
you what if you could focus on what
really matters like more adventures more
picked more late nights and sunrises
more beers with friends more fun and
more freedom with your help we can free
you from your stuff and make it easier
for you to ride your bike every day
