more than any other nation in the world
almost 900 per person but that also
means we have 350,000 bike related
injuries now imagine that we would make
biking safer smarter and easier by
applying self-driving technology to bike
we taught herself driving bike to figure
out where it is what's around it what
will happen next and what it should do
we leaned on Google's expertise in
self-driving cars but we had to adapt
the technology to work on a bike
we decided to add two additional
features first you can request the bike
to pick you up wherever you are and we
developed a comfort mode adjusting the
pedals to a perfect resting position
I think the self riding bike could
really give a boost in the economy
because people could also work on their
bicycle you work in your office you work
in your home you work in your car you
can even work on your bike I have so
much more time my kids love it they're
just freed it can go anywhere they want
anytime they want it's amazing at the
features point we feel that this is the
biggest invention since the invention of
the bicycle itself at Google we always
put our users first with the launch of
this bike we believe we do that again
Gmail blue was part of the initial
conception for Gmail when it was
launched at the time the technology was
simply not there the culture of Google
really is to incorporate moonshot
thinking to every project it's taken us
six years to develop the technology to
achieve Gmail blue our major challenge
was how do we make this intimate
intuitive realistic and organic in
trying to bring email into the 21st
century we are faced with the challenge
how do we completely redesign and
recreate something while keeping it
exactly the same
the answer is Gmail blue
you click on compose the button compose
the blue the word compose itself blue
bold faces blue underline is blue
italics is blue as well you write in the
body of the email the font comes up blue
you don't have to make it blue it is
blue it just is flipped the little lines
there in blue when you go in to help
it's blue it's Gmail holy bluer
we experimented with a lot of different
colors we tried two orange brown browns
a disaster we tried yellow the
inspiration of blue came from nature
ocean sky blue whales a blue that was
reminiscent of nature but better than
what nature are created female blue is
it just opens a lot of doors that
haven't been opened before I think the
first thought that's gonna come to the
end-users mind is I can't believe I
waited this long for this
with Google Express we're constantly
looking for ways to improve home
delivery like everyone in our industry
we were intrigued by the idea of drones
but we also asked ourselves what if
there's another way drone technology is
exciting but it's not ready and that's
when the breakthrough happened an
autonomous delivery service that not
only brings our users packages but also
brings them joy the answer parachutes
we're proud to announce the launch of
parachutes by Google Express quiet
reliable gentle they're the perfect
marriage of form and function this
parachute technology is going to change
the way we think about parachute
technology people only know what they
see in TV and movies but it's not all
shouting Geronimo and barrel rolls its
science our controlled hover utilization
team of engineers researchers and
scientists spent years developing the
parachutes function from the apex vent
to the suspension lines to the canopy
Gore's but the question remained does it
actually work the answer is yes
beautifully Google Express has always
been about delivering people the things
they need and the stores they love with
parachutes by Google Express our users
are constantly connected from placing an
order to tracking delivery to the moment
they catch the package out of the sky
delivering you the things you need when
you need them and forget the obstacles
of ground delivery the parachutes you
can receive deliveries anytime
anywhere parachutes are a lot like mines
they work best when they're open how do
we get the parachutes into the year we
use drones
you
hi my name is Ben Segura and I'm on the
Google Fiber team we have heard a lot of
rumors that we've been building a
fiber-optic network that will deliver
internet speeds 100 times faster than
most Americans have access to today and
while we are humbled by these
speculations we have focused our efforts
on developing a different kind of fiber
google fiber here at Google we try to
solve big problems using technology we
have done everything from building
self-driving cars to developing Street
View technology
we strive to use the advances of
technology to help our users live better
and more effective lives however we have
seen an even bigger problem when it
comes to our bodies as we still rely on
outdated sources of fiber and nutrients
to give us energy help our intestinal in
colon efficiency and sustain us
throughout our busy lives prior to
Google Fiber I never felt like I came
close to my full athletic potential I
was sluggish and tired now I'm racing
winning and feeling great this is not
just fiber it's Google Fiber for short
weeks after eating the Google Fiber bar
the bar actually can take feedback from
the body determine which nutrients are
needed and target delivery to the
specific organs that need those
nutrients google has revolutionized
preventative health care
Washington you have to take a look at
this we have spent a long time
perfecting Google Fiber and are excited
for its potential to positively impact
the health of our users it's not just
vitamins and it's not just fiber it's
Google Fiber and it's like nothing else
out there let us help you make the most
of your health one bite at a time for
more information about how to get your
very own supply of Google Fiber please

I'm going to show you a new Android
application that's been developed
through our translation technology our
new app Google Translate for animals
translates animals speech into human
vernacular the handset records so the
animal sounds and then transmits them to
our server where the speech recognition
and
translation engines analyze the
neurobiological acoustics the voice
recognition software then checks itself
against the millions of sounds in our
animal linguistic database and produces
a translation in plain English let's see
how Google Translate for animals works I
activate the Translate app as you can
see there's a large range of animals to
choose from
I choose Pig then I make a recording see
here it transcribes it but if I push the
speaker button we can actually hear what
Bela said that's amazing let's find out
what's on Donna's mind
you to get Google Translate for animals
go to Android Market and search
Translate for animals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
