Apple TV is really small in fact it's
even shorter than your iPhone Apple TV
allows you to access a lot more content
for example you can download movies and
TV shows and get access to Netflix
YouTube and even Flickr Apple TV allows
you to get content from your iPhone iPad
and computer and watch in your TV for
example you can watch part of the movie
on your iPhone and finish on your TV
play a slideshow for your friends or
even listen to your iTunes library from
your TV sound system and it's just $99
it's really hard to go wrong with Apple
TV I'm a huge fan of Allen TV has a lot
of advantages in fact you can transform
how you use your television in your home
but there's a problem how do you mount
your Apple TV if you're out of cable
from your TV somewhere else
well the expose cable just looks sloppy
if you try to wrap the cable through
your wall so it's no longer exposed that
can damage your wall it's a huge hassle
and you could run into the electrical
system in your home and do some real
damage so we want to know the mounting
system to get around these problems like
a trouble-free Apple TV mounting system
one tool taught here at the design
school is to try to envision an ideal
solution without worrying about what's
possible so let's start by visualizing
the ideal solution we pictured an ideal
solution that will allow you to attach
your Apple TV to the back of your TV
this way you wouldn't have to worry
about wrapping the cables through your
wall or having any exposed wires you
also want to make sure that you could
mount your Apple TV without of course
using tape or glue after a lot of
prototyping we were able to develop a
solution that met the requirements of
our ideal solution and the way it works
is by clipping on to the vents in the
back of your TV
we've test on over 50 TVs and it works
great it's very secure it doesn't
require any tools and it clips on almost
instantly really happy with how total
mounts turned out it's a very simple
solution but yet very effective and very
reliable
but will not actually includes three
mounting options you can choose
whichever you prefer the first is that
it clips onto the back of the TV the
second is that it can clip onto the TV's
mounting system and the third if you
really want to you can screw it to the
wall
but our personal favorite is just to
clip the total mount to the back of the
TV if it's fast tool three and doesn't
damage your wall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
