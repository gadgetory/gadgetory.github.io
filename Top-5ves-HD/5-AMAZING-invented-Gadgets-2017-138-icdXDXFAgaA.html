we have designed and built an origami
robot that gets up and goes in other
words the robot forms itself on the spot
accomplishes tasks and then it
disappears by degradation
there are BOTS self-assembles using a
folding process that is triggered by
heating after this the robot can run
along designated trajectories it can
carry objects it can clear obstacles it
can swim it can execute a variety of
tasks and when these tasks are done the
robot can recycle itself by dissolving
its body into liquid this is the first
robotic device that completes a full
lifecycle from its birth to its death
typical robots consist of electronic
devices our robot is made based on
control materials this is the biggest
difference the robot's body has embedded
in it a small magnet and this allows us
to control the robot by programming a
magnetic field in other words the robot
has external programmable actuation
currently the robot is controlled
remotely by a person we'd like to
advance this robot and make it more
intelligent such that it can make
decisions by itself origami inspired
robot designs have the potential to be
faster cheaper and easy
to fabricate the robots created using
traditional manufacturing processes it
is easier for such a system to be used
closer to humans such as in the human
body for example you could regard this
robot as a contourable drug capsule or a
surgical tool which can be removed after
it's used in the body can imagine
ingesting these robots and then
controlling where they travel in the
body and once they arrive at the correct
location they could form themselves into
active instruments that can actually
manipulate and help through the healing
processes for the short term we see
these robots as potentially extremely
useful in inspection tasks because they
are small and they can travel through
very intricate small narrow pipelines
that are difficult to inspect with
today's technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
