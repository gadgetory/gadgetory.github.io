building a better future we create tools
for global citizens of tomorrow we make
awesome stuff at the intersection of
fashion technology hey I'm Adrian the
Canadian in September 2015
I met an incredible girl just two months
later we were sitting at a cafe in
Barcelona and her bag was stolen right
from between our chairs inside of her
bag was her laptop passport iPhone all
of her valuables since it was my idea to
be in Barcelona in the first place I
felt really guilty so I set out to
impress her by making bags would never
be stolen again a couple of months later
on a tiny budget with help of friends
designers and models I launched life
back on Kickstarter we raised six
hundred and thirteen thousand dollars
from three thousand seven hundred and
five backers I quickly had to assemble
an awesome team of people to help
fulfill all of these orders today we've
shipped over fifteen thousand life hacks
to people all over the world and from
these customers we've had some great
feedback and what kind of product I'd
like to see in our new collection both
bags is your insulin drop fruits laptop
storage secret you secure pockets for
your passport credit card to travel kite
and our patented locking system it
allows the bag to be locked to something
and lock shut instead of being worried
about someone taking your stuff this
gives you peace of mind and allows you
to focus on what support in the backpack
specifically is really cool features
like this priority pocket for your
everyday essentials
there's magnetic closures they can get
super fast to close the bag and not
worry about it fun there's an easy
access UFC for powered by the solar bag
so you can charge your phone on the
super organized storage pockets on the
inside and test them Hardware just
double through the models on the
shoulder bag there's quick access
directly to the ports in the folder bag
there's a nice big pocket for your cable
so they don't get tangled up with
everything special pocket there's
glasses or sunglasses soft plush handle
even straps need to mount it onto your
suitcase special hook for your key and
of course a bottle opener

these bag and we're still complemented
the quality that we're giving them a 5
years guarantee and no questions asked
30 day money-back guarantee for all of
our backers from Kickstarter its 2017
life got busy working remotely is up
over 500 percent since the 90 and this
year alone we're up from 39 percent to
43 percent of people working remotely at
least once a week we're living in an age
of unprecedented freedom we can work
anywhere we go on top of this the
average person uses their phone between
75 and 150 times per day no matter what
you try to do your phone is always dying
both of these bags include our brand new
solar bank this is a two-in-one power
bank with a built-in solar panel these
are the most efficient compact solar
panels available in the entire world in
just four hours of Sun it'll generate
enough power for a full charge of a
smart phone and if you live in a place
that doesn't get that much than all year
round I'm from Vancouver Canada the
solar bank can even generate some power
on a cloudy day and you can even charge
the solar bank light plugging it into a
wall with micro USB or USB see

the future and a fraction of the price
please back with project today share
with your friends share it with your
family share with your coworkers we
really appreciate your support
meat clips it's the first magnetic phone
mount that uses software to make your in
car experience more seamless
Slick's connects to your phone using
low-energy blue shoes once connected the
clicks app automatically launches
opening up ways to or Google Maps you
can customize the app with different
widgets such as Spotify or weather and
the app is compatible with both iOS and
Android devices place the clicks mount
on an air vent or anywhere using our 3m
tape mount
clicks uses safe magnets to secure your
phone by connecting to the magnetic
plate you place on the back of your
phone and the magnets are strong enough
to hold your phone through regular
Street Journal's speed boats or the
toughest off-road terrain once parked
flicks will pin your car on the map so
you'll always know where you left it
clicks is beautifully designed and comes
in a variety of colors gain a minute
daily with clicks
hi I'm Alex and I'm Eva together we
created the clicks mount not just any
mount stylish and smart mouth we are
rather and what four users will get
tired waiting time using both mouths
mouths that were constructed to make our
life easier
so we designed the combination of a
magnetic phone holder and a clever and
adoptive software we can spend years
perfecting clicks to save time and make
your entire experience more comfortable
and safer proposals today don't let
other car mount interrupt your flow the
world is full of things to explore and
regaining understanding about our world
through sight taste touch but sometimes
our senses don't give us all the
information we want now there's a
solution that can help identify things
around you with the click of a button
introducing Linc square SDK
a portable spectrometer and development
camp link square uses visible light to
determine the exact colors of objects
and it uses near-infrared light to
detect a molecular makeup included in
your link Square SDK is a link square
spectrometer a user's guide a set of
sample color chips
you must be charging cable and central
data collection software connect link
square to a Windows PC using a Wi-Fi
next place the link square in contact
with the object of interest then press
the button on the side of the
spectrometer the links panel will gather
data on how the object responds to light
and transforms the data into a spectrum
graph as a developer you'll be able to
use the graphs to collect clicking
applications for personal use you can
free apps to distinguish between
medications validate the authenticity of
gemstone and much more link square can
be deployed in a wide range of fields
such as research pharmacy education food
and environmental studies straw tales
engineers have tested the software Auto
type the hardware and selected
manufacturing partners
all that's missing is you small
spectrometer big possibilities links
where SDK strontium our winners are
getting warmer and wetter which means
that insects like disease-carrying
mosquitoes and annoying garden pests are
coming out earlier and in greater
numbers the only solutions available in
the market are unnatural chemicals and
pesticides that burn our skin and
endanger local wildlife the solution
that a common back we need up to a
thousand feet aside insect and garden
pests in a single hour they came back
being be home to one of nature's
greatest forms of pest control
hi I'm Harrison and I'm Chris we're here
in Lexington Kentucky and we've been
developing that VMV for over a year now
our mission is simple we want to help
get bat houses into people's yards to
keep families safer from mosquitoes and
tests and in turn offers safe homes but
that's to raise the pub
one of my favorite word's as a
conservationist is symbiosis humans and
plants and animals can live together
with mutual benefits when bats got on my
radar or my sonar my echolocation I got
really excited because you know what
where my mom lives in Long Island
there's a big mosquito problem so I'm
going to get one of these bat houses so
that they can live with us and help us
reduce our mosquitoes whoa whoa hold on
just a sec aren't that scary and
dangerous well they're not and here's
why there are hundreds of thousands of
bats already living in American bat
houses and there isn't a single record
of a bat house owner having been harmed
by a bat in fact if you treat bats with
respect
they'll keep to themselves and reward
you by eating lots of harmful insects
it's so important to get along with bats
now more than ever because they need our
help
bats are dying due to the spread of
white nose syndrome disrupting their
hibernation wind turbines causing
bleeding in their lungs and
deforestation which is destroying their
habitat you're really to help use a safe
way to read for me there is more doing
the facility we rented our bat B&amp;amp;B
because we had a bit of a bug problem
but honestly it was a little more than
that our children became scared of bats
watching them on cartoons they just get
a really bad reputation we wanted to
teach them the bats are an important
part of the ecosystem they help control
the bugs and they're really good for our
yard all of our product specifications
are based on decades of scientific
research into the most successful bat
houses as well as on cutting-edge input
from researchers and fields hi i'm
merlyn's oh I've studied bad for more
than 50 years and I've been involved in
development
at B&amp;amp;B product line since its inception
frankly I don't know of any bad houses
anywhere that are better designed to
accommodate bats last longer or look
better your home in your yard are
reflections of your style which is why
we want you to have options when it
comes to choosing your back can be we're
going to be offering three different

harmful pesticides by making this
investment you're not only getting a
