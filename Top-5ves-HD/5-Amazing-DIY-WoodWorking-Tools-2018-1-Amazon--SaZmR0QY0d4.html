offers a fast reliable easy-to-use
solution that anyone can use to install
doors and cabinets or built-ins or to
refresh kitchen cabinets with new
updated doors that's because the
concealed hinge gig makes it easier than
ever to mount concealed hinges that give
doors a clean uncluttered look and the
jig lets you do it with the accuracy of
a drill press
but using nothing more than an ordinary
drill the jig makes the process easy
thanks to indexing cams and built-in
measuring scales that ensure exact hinge
cut positioning plus a removable guide
for the included carbide tipped bit
using the concealed hinge dig makes it
simple to figure out the two main things
required for mounting these hinges
determining how far from the door edge
the hinge needs to be located and how
far the hinges sit from the top or
bottom of the door how far from the door
edge the hinge sits is called the offset
and the measurement varies depending on
the hinge type and brand usually you
just have to read the hinge instructions
measure and hope for the best but the
concealed hinge dick has indexing cams
that take out all of the guesswork and
uncertainty just turn the cams to the
appropriate setting and the jig will be
perfectly positioned when you place it
against the edge of the door that means
all you have to do is use the concealed
hinge IG's measuring scale to position
the hinge at the desired distance from
the top or bottom of the door clamp the
jig in place and the hinge cap hole will
be positioned correctly every time after
the cup hole is correctly located
you still need to drill a clean hole to
the proper depth doing that usually
requires a drill press and a specialized
bit the concealed hinge gig comes with a
high-quality carbide tip 35 millimeter
bit that's specifically designed for the
task the bit shears the wood cleanly
without tear out for perfect holes time
after time to ensure the hole is
straight that bit rides in a drilling
guide that lacks quickly and accurately
into the jig a stop collar ensures
correct hole depth every time - once the
cup is drilled the concealed hinged jig
makes it just as easy to drill the holes
for the hinge mounting screws just
remove the drilling guide and you
the two holes in the jig to guide an
ordinary 1/16 inch drill bit unclamp the
concealed hinge dig and the hinge drops
into place and mounts accurately every
time whether you're installing hinges on
one door or adding new doors to an
entire kitchen that means all you have
to do is Mount the door to your cabinet
and the job is done confidently quickly
and with professional quality results
