from pareo and I'm the director of user
experience for the east of micro an
electric toothbrush made especially for
babies and children I have six years
experience in children's oral care with
three years experience in teething I'm
an expert in what babies like and what
they don't like they don't like brushing
their teeth but they do it toys so we
created a toothbrush that's plumb like a
toy here's our innovative design the
toothbrush was inspired by a rocket ship
because rocket ships are super cool
three two one blast off and you have
lots of soft little scrubber step buzz
and tickle your teeth and go they look
just like octopus legs and they even
light up with happy and sad faces so
mommy and daddy know of you've rushed
into you and now here's Antonius from
Freya to explain how it works and why
it's special the ISA micro is a complete
redesign of the baby toothbrush it has
soft ultra high genic silicon bristles
and gentle vibrations to deep clean
teeth while soothing guns this unique
combination has never been done before a
baby oral care the inspiration for the
ISA micro came from when I was playing
with my little nephews over the summer
Sodom queuing on this little giraffe
teething toys for hours but a first and
struggled with the simple act of
brushing even for 30 seconds that's when
it hit me why not make a children's to
fright you that is
as fun and safe is their favorite either
since place we knew our sonic technology
work but we wanted to make something
that babies would actually enjoy using
so after thousands of design iterations
and relentless safety testing we created
the es mi chrome it will first electric
toothbrush that makes rushing safe
effective and fun existing products just
aren't working watch cloths don't clean
well traditional nylon bristles are
harsh and guns in harbor bacteria an
electric children's toothbrushes are too
abrasive and can chip teeth or cause a
choking hazard but the breakthrough is a
micro is made of soft one hundred
percent food grade silicone our tests
found at the ISA is 10,000 times more
hygienic than that plus it's completely
encases ighness no sharp edges or
detachable parts that's extremely safe
for a child not only is the ISA micro in
a band solution to existing children's
to brushes it also gets our little ones
excited again about brushing and helps
great good oral hygiene habits early on
we found a kid spend on average fifty
percent longer brushing your teeth with
the ISA micro and with normal
toothbrushes both children and parents
really love it I love the use of my
grill because it's really hygienic and
safe it comes in a variety of colors
that are really appealing to children it
comes with a vibration that they're not
quite used to and that they really seem
to love it soothes their gums there's so
many things about these two micro that
we love but at the end of day it makes
our lives easier brushing our children's
teeth it makes their lives easier
brushing their own teeth well we were
looking for a toothbrush that was had
the same technology as our tooth
brushing or child's toothbrush and our
kids were looking to use the same thing
as mom and dad were using so it was an
easy sell to them we would absolutely
recommend
to all the parents out there we all used
it in our family every one of us has a
different color toothbrush and so we're
one big instant family and I think that
it's been so instrumental and getting
our kids to brush the teeth and get
excited about the whole challenge of
brushing teeth get the ISA micro right
now with a special offer only available
on IndieGoGo you'll be one of the first
to get your hands and your baby's hands
on this revolutionary toothbrush before
its retail launch to join us on our
journey to spread the word and promote
better infant oral care with the ISA
micro because healthy teeth means happy
t
our sleep is very important to us so we
decided to do something about it and
redesign every aspect of how beds and
mattresses are made and function
we're beluga comes from is that we're
trying to utilize modern design and
technology to produce beds that you have
full control so you can customize it
anywhere you wish the SL suspension
system is very unique because it allows
you to control its firmness and it stays
as new throughout the lifespan of the
bed it acts like a spring but it's very
soft and it yields itself around you
rather than resist you our climate
control works by using ambient air
already in your room which we then are
able to either heat or let pass through
to in the summertime ventilator to keep
you cool and in the winter time to
actually warm the bed so it's not
chilled when you come to use it we've
incorporated a vibro massage that's
pressure point rather than a bed being
vibrated it's directly placed in
vibration sensors beneath specific
pressure points in your body because I
was developed to help you navigate your
way in the dark without disturbing your
partner it automatically comes on and we
use an external wireless sensor that
allows the light to come on for a
certain amount of time to help guide you
to and from your bed we also have a
variety of colors that you can choose or
what ambient lighting you'd like when
they come on anti snoring system we
developed because it's just one of the
most disruptive experience you have with
a partner we use our very specialized
air suspension system to change the
angle at which you sleep when snoring is
monitored we have a built-in sensor
within the mattress that is specifically
tuned to pick up your frequency of sound
when you start snoring it will change
the tilt of your head and your neck the
both partners separately the idea of
technology in a bedroom is a challenge
and we felt that it was very important
to keep the ambience of the bedroom
technology free and everything we design
is designed to be invisible and unseen
everything you'd normally have in your
room to create the ambulance you want is
the most important thing our control of
the bed is either through an app or you
can have our own touch screen remote
control if you wish to use that beyond
that we have obviously the sleep
monitoring system which can interact
with your existing sleep monitoring
technology as wearable or as something
you have on your smile
phone or tablet with the help of the
IndieGoGo community we'd like the
opportunity to bring Beluga beds to the
mass market we already have
manufacturing in place and we're ready
to take orders for any size of bed for
any continent worldwide
remembering to flush your teeth is hard
you practically need your own personal
dentist to remind you on a daily basis
wouldn't it be awesome if you had
someone who could not only remind you
but also encourage you to floss your
teeth regularly well now you do meet
floss time your personal floss reminder
floss time is the first smart floss
dispenser designed to help you build
daily flossing habits it simply mounts
to your bathroom mirror and acts as a
visual reminder to clean in between your
teeth with the push of a button floss
time automatically dispenses the perfect
amount of floss dentists recommend you
floss at least once a day so if used
regularly floss time lights up with a
fun smile for a job well done but if a
period of 24 hours passes with
inactivity floss time frowns at you with
a reminder light we know we're supposed
to floss but most of us forget
traditional floss designs are built on
century-old technology and are dependent
on us remembering to use them which
means they don't get used enough floss
time is a habit forming device that will
make flossing easy yet nearly impossible
to forget the device comes with an
entire years worth of floss has a dual
user mode and includes colorful animal
snap bonds to make flossing fun for kids
as well so we all met at a Stanford
biodesign course and wanted to address
the problem of how do we get people to
floss a more consistent basis the lack
of flossing can lead to build up a
bacteria and between your teeth and gum
and peer down to diseases these have
been linked to heart problems diabetes
and other serious medical conditions a
research shows that the biggest problem
is simply getting the floss into
people's hands once it's there almost
everyone flosses their teeth pop
we wanted to marry form and function
when we first started thinking about
design plus time may look deceptively
simple to use and in fact it is but
truth be told it took many sleepless
hours in nights to develop the product
today there is a great deal of focus on
treatment instead of prevention we
believe that good health starts with
small daily habits do you realize that
those of us who floss everyday can live
up to 6 years longer at floss time we
set out to build a device so good you'll
want to use it every day and so
beautiful and elegant that you'll never
want to put it away so we have the
design finalized the engineering
completed and we are ready to
manufacture if lost time to move to the
next stage requires money to pay for
tooling equipments and to purchase key
components at a volume discount with
your support floss time can help
millions of people with better oral
hygiene be one of the first owned this
great new product floss time time to
floss

Oh
at our practical we love high voltage
shooting sparks and lighting up the
party after bringing this Tesla coil too
wide we knew it was time to put one in
everyone's pockets introducing the
sparker a plasma wider and flashlight
and one the flashlight is a 1 watt
dimmable LED that can run for four hours
on fulbright the removable lid doubles
as a diffuser transforming the light
into a lantern the plasma lighter uses
electricity to create a windproof
solution that requires no flame butane
or fuel
the sparker is great for any of your
outdoor adventures
lighting your barbecue around your house
or simply being prepared
Parker is also USB rechargeable please
back or share our project and light it
up
