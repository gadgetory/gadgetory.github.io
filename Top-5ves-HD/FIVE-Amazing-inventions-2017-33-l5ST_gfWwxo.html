typical scene following a dramatic rain
foam broken and torn umbrellas all over
the streets you want a quality umbrella
that is small compact and lasts a
lifetime introducing the Cypress we
developed an industry-first a clean and
robust telescopic rib design the Cypress
features another industry first a fully
interchangeable canvas quick snap
connections along the ribs allow an
infinite array of colors and patterns to
combat against chaotic wings we
developed an independent suspension
system to improve stability and prevent
the umbrella from flipping inside out
the handle also features an easily
deployable pop-up enclosure we went back
to basic engineering principles we have
tested disassembled and broken countless
umbrellas spend thousands of hours
designing and fabricating and testing
hundreds of prototypes refining very
last detail very last component until we
were satisfied also available as a
Cypress classic a full-length umbrella
with the same features durability and
build quality as the Cypress

hi I'm Kim with tiny circuits we've been
developing the tiny do we know family
for the past year we've gone through
four major design iterations we've got
these in beta testers hands now we've
gotten great feedback from everyone
that's used the board so far the design
is solid and we're ready for production
and with your help here and Kickstarter
will be able to make these available to
everyone you're backing will allow us to
do a production run of these boards and
also the help fund the next generation
of tiny circuits products if you think
these are cool just wait to see what we
got planned next but we need your back
and make this possible we hope you'll
join us thanks
you
cars are an essential part of
we love the freedom they give us but
they are taking their toll we pump out
huge amounts of carbon spend years of
our lives in traffic and thousands on
fuel but most of us can't just stop
driving or buy a price in your car every
time a more efficient model comes out we
need a way to take any car new or old
and get the most out of it we need go
far dhofar is an intelligent in-car
device that empowers you to drive your
current car smarter cutting your time in
traffic your emissions and your fuel use
it works by utilizing the science behind
your car's engine for every engine speed
there's a sweet spot an optimum throttle
position that maximizes your power and
minimizes your fuel consumption it's
where your car runs best driving in the
sweet spot saves fuel which saves money
and cuts emissions but the sweet spot is
different for every engine and unless
you are part of a Formula One race team
it's very difficult to find not anymore
go find your car's unique sweet spot and
uses real-time feedback to guide you
there the display glows blue when you're
in a sweet spot and red when you're
wasting energy real-time feedback works
and in trials go far cut fuel use by
thirteen to twenty two percent it's easy
to install my seven year old can do it
for an ice cream once installed go far
just works no need to fiddle with your
phone all you need to do is get in and
drive much safer go far analyzes your
actual driving patterns telling you
exactly when to leave the house so you
spend less time in traffic your car I
can't do that in fact it's the most
advanced car computer on the market it
plots you're driving in 3d space and
measures every single Joule of energy in
and out of your car we spend a lot on
our cars and now you know exactly where
it's going to the send it makes tracking
expenses of reeds and unlike your car
computer go far stores all your trip
data for you automatically when
designing the go far product the
challenge was to create a form that
would fit seamlessly into any car
interior it had to effectively
communicate to you while not distracting
you while you drive
we've created what we believe is a
beautiful product that will fit
effortlessly into your driving
experience because Stefan measures your
dragon performance you can turn driving
into a game beat your best challenge
your friends all compete in a global
League who's the best you're the best
we've been working on go far for two
years developed powerful new
technologies and built a team of
passionate people but to get go far into
production we need your help by backing
our campaign you get rocket science in
your car you'll save big on your fuel
bill you'll spend less time in traffic
you'll cut your carbon footprint and
you'll have it a smartest car industry

I thought it was coming from the two
speakers and when you revealed what was
actually happening was very surprised
its chords it's like kind of nothing
ever really heard I was a ghast and I
haven't been that in a lot of years
really expert on bro the core is the
most advanced wireless speaker system
ever developed five digital signal
processors allow us to render the audio
in a way that is totally revolutionary
you're getting stereo sound from this
one tiny little box the convention right
now is that for true high-end listening
you have to have two speakers the core
changes that you can have one and it
truly sounds like to for a little boss
like this or trade although imaging is
very impressive leveraging a combination
of wave field synthesis and beam forming
allows us to create an acoustic bubble
in the room so that the image stays
stable no matter where you're sitting
you can almost see each person in the
band in the room with you I can move my
head around and the location of the
sound source remains intact as if it was
a you know a hologram there's no speaker
that can do anything like this
everything is smart but sound systems
aren't and this is the thing that we're
doing at mass fidelity is creating truly
smart sound systems if you have an NFC
enabled phone just touch the top of the
core and you're automatically connected
high-density battery gives the core a
solid 12 hour battery life the core is
built-in microphone allows you to
remotely answer calls without having to
touch your phone and if that phone is
about to die the corrs USB connector
will recharge it for you the cores
control input makes it home automation
compatible
in fact the core has all the inputs
you'll ever need any smart device will
work instantly via bluetooth hook up
your Apple TV to add pristine sound
quality to all of your favorite music
and video streaming services you can
even connect your turntable and
regardless of where the music is coming
from you can broadcast it and up to
eight rooms at once for the past 18
months we've been developing the core
with engineers and factories to make
sure that we can deliver to you a
perfect audio product we're a small
company used to doing small production
runs the demand for the call has been
overwhelming we need your help to
accelerate the tooling that will allow
us to bring it to market so join us and
you'll get a beautifully designed
wireless speaker that gives you true
stereo sound for any room in your house
the core will be the only wireless
speaker you'll ever need and the most
exciting audio product you've ever owned
you know sometimes being a kid isn't as
easy as you might think I mean we have
the ideas we have the motivation and we
have all the potential in the world but
sometimes we just don't have the tools
you need that's why we've decided it's
time to make our own tools so we created
yeehaw the only three printer design of
us kids in mind we made it easy to use
or one hundred percent safe for kids
it's controlled directly by its cloud
system either online or did an expertly
designed app so there's no need for
manually adjusting anything you can
create unique and original design pixel
by pixel an app or you can choose from
an always growing library of more than
2,000 ready to print toys all you need
to do is pick your color press print and
Neha does the rats it's fully enclosed
by a safety door so there's absolutely
no danger when the machine is printed if
the door is open or the machine is
tilted or anything else goes wrong the
machine will automatically stop printing
and retract it's novel you are a sleek
compact and see through all around which
allows you to see our gears come to us
from any angle all four filaments are
eco-friendly and non-toxic and they come
in 12 different colors we wanted to make
sure that yeehaw allowed kiss towards
further creativity in whole new ways we
can be innovative in our problem solving
we could dream up new and exciting world
we can help each other learn grow and
achieve our potential and don't worry
they made it safe for grownups to
support us on IndieGoGo and share our
campaign with family and friends Neha
the 3d printer designed with kids in
line
