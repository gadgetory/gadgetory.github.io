keeping you awake
no that's it that's the sound of knowing
you won't sleep tonight you are not a
born snore it can develop at any time up
to 64 percent of couples have a snoring
partner and it makes 25% of couples
sleep apart and it's not just your
relationship that's in danger
your health is - when you fall asleep
your jaw relaxes and drops back closing
down your airway to the point where it
vibrates as you breathe this doesn't
just keep the whole house awake it also
stops you from getting the deep
refreshing sleep you need and that can
have serious implications for in your
life such as fatigue irritability
headaches restlessness poor
concentration diminished productivity
and adverse effects on your heart and
brain you could spend hundreds of
dollars on quick fix solutions with bold
claims and disappointing results
you could just grin and bear it or you
can try Snorlax these super simple
strips are easy to apply and comfortable
to wear and they're quick and painless

its normal position and your airway open
