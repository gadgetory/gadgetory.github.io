the goateesaver is a shaving template
for goatees place it over your goatee
and bite on the mouthpiece shave around
it with your favorite razor for a
perfect goatee purchase the goateesaver
at goateesaver calm the hopeless with
podcasters to transform how we all see
electronically think about how you see
visual information when you're not in
the same locations as the device you
know typically to narrow view a normal
lens will give you fifty to eighty
degrees perhaps ninety and that's been a
constraint for a long time pretty much
hence video was invented Hana cast
changes all that one advantage with our
surveys or with our integration for
Microsoft Skype for business is that in
addition to sending it to everyone we
give each person simultaneous individual
control without interfering with each
other so that makes it a very unique and
a very personal experience and helps
people communicate and engage much more
effectively
another key features for the tanika's
two camera is the USB plug and play and
majority people are used to using a
preferable cameras which are USB
interface among other things that we
wanted to achieve with I guess two words
a 4k resolution which we've made
panoramic 4k is 340 pixels for example
and 1080 pixels
welcome our camera provides ultra wide
field of view that fills up to 1080p
displays with a single panoramic spring
iMac a still camera can be used as a
regular webcam or as an enhanced
panoramic camera when used with Skype
for business and now you have the
capability to stream a very high
resolution panoramic video to remote
party when we are approximately 10
months ago we had a desire to bring the
panoramic views
but if you think of having a camera
design that is based on the single and
single optics and then puts the optics
in the single housing so their
complexity becomes exponentially more
severe so it for most had to be achieved
high quality and manufacturability but
also being aesthetically desirable one
of the things that I've been very
interested in the last three years is
building a global classroom that
experience has been significantly
enhanced by our use of panic as cameras
that give remote students the ability to
join and contribute to class in a much
more meaningful way we think one of the
great use cases for the panic has to
will be for companies that have a lot of
huddle rooms or small conference rooms
that will hold a number of people from
two to maybe even twenty upgrade your
campus with panic has two hello again
I'm Jenna and I'm here to show you the
phone so excel this angle duty was
designed to kill germs on all kinds of
devices like iPads phones folks my
multiple knife keyboards through not
keywords yet let me start from the
beginning
you get your box from the mail and it
will look something like this
karate chop your bottle Aaron
all okay just open it from the top like
this inside you will find two things
your phone so Excel and the power cable
for the excel remove all the protective
packaging from your device plug in your
device like this this other end goes in
the wall you are now ready to be
verified everything you own
here's how it works open the very doors
insert your tablet close the door when
you see the lightning bolt start to glow
you know the germs are dying inside
that's a good thing
germs bad after 15 minutes
the lightning bolt will shut off and
your tablet will be cleaner than the day
you bought it
yes cleaner if you want to charge your
tablet at the same time just plug your
tablet charging cable into the back a
phone sub XL and thread it through the
slot here reach in to the other side and
pull the cable through and hook it to
this nifty cable holster after you pick
a paladin you can unhook it and plug it
in you don't really have to use the
holster but that's what is for you can
now close the door the lights will shut
off when it's done but your tablet will
continue this charge until it's all
juiced up and then you have it folks the
phone 6 XL saving the world one
germ-free device at a time unless you
put three phones inside then it's three
phones at a time or 2010 you get it
