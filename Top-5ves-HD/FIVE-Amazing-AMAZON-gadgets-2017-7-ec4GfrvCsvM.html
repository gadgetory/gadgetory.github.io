the goateesaver is a shaving template
for goatees place it over your goatee
and bite on the mouthpiece shave around
it with your favorite razor for a
perfect goatee purchase the goateesaver
at goateesaver calm the hopeless with
podcasters to transform how we all see
electronically think about how you see
visual information when you're not in
the same locations as the device you
know typically to narrow view a normal
lens will give you fifty to eighty
degrees perhaps ninety and that's been a
constraint for a long time pretty much
hence video was invented Hana cast
changes all that one advantage with our
surveys or with our integration for
Microsoft Skype for business is that in
addition to sending it to everyone we
give each person simultaneous individual
control without interfering with each
other so that makes it a very unique and
a very personal experience and helps
people communicate and engage much more
effectively
another key features for the tanika's
two camera is the USB plug and play and
majority people are used to using a
preferable cameras which are USB
interface among other things that we
wanted to achieve with I guess two words
a 4k resolution which we've made
panoramic 4k is 340 pixels for example
and 1080 pixels
welcome our camera provides ultra wide
field of view that fills up to 1080p
displays with a single panoramic spring
iMac a still camera can be used as a
regular webcam or as an enhanced
panoramic camera when used with Skype
for business and now you have the
capability to stream a very high
resolution panoramic video to remote
party when we are approximately 10
months ago we had a desire to bring the
panoramic views
but if you think of having a camera
design that is based on the single and
single optics and then puts the optics
in the single housing so their
complexity becomes exponentially more
severe so it for most had to be achieved
high quality and manufacturability but
also being aesthetically desirable one
of the things that I've been very
interested in the last three years is
building a global classroom that
experience has been significantly
enhanced by our use of panic as cameras
that give remote students the ability to
join and contribute to class in a much
more meaningful way we think one of the
great use cases for the panic has to
will be for companies that have a lot of
huddle rooms or small conference rooms
that will hold a number of people from
two to maybe even twenty upgrade your
campus with panic has two hello again
