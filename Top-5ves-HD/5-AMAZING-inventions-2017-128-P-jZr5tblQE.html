been treated with chlorine and it's
continually getting harder to hydrate
ourselves during the day when the tap
water we drink lead the glitzy artifact
in considering more than part of our
body is made up of water at a crucial
supplement like energy levels and a day
to day function reducing refill and
activated charcoal filter that removes
chlorine and other organic contaminants
from tap water engineers but on the 65
15 of the plastic bottles you'd find in
the city market over the last two years
we've been studying the science of
activated charcoal and the filtering
qualities that has been kept what a
positive for the pool and it's proven to
remove selected missiles and chemical
contaminants so we wanted to utilize the
science and design a product that was
benefit everyone
each filter contains an aggravated
charcoal sticks made from coconut shells
they can filter a 700 ml bottle 150
times or four hundred and five liters
activated charcoal is made of a small
globally important and one gram of the
surface area of 100 meters squid which
he became 2000 with football skills the
paws contain negatively charged ion
which attract the positively charged
elements from tap water present lead
copper and chlorine it effectively
removes contaminants but retains the net
mineral resulting in a fresh and flower
penetration we visited the five main
supermarket here in New Zealand and we
found we could store filter under 65
percent of the bottles they could bark
the shell was Anna global matrix will be
pleased of thousands of different photo
and more a bigger body than a reef
opposable adapted this means that it
encourages people to keep reusing their
clean up plastic bottle activity the
sins of the world
bottles Garland's good and we believe we
fill with another step in the reduction
of service water consumption worldwide
the encasement has a hexagonal
and mixed old design achieving extreme
line and steady flow it have made from
recyclable plastic the 28 millimeter
Supercat means it can screw into a huge
range of beverage bottles all around the
world for any person which means it
makes it the ultimate travel accessory
and anywhere you go you can have access
to filtered and payslips a product with
a hundred and fifty refills of 700 ml
bottles you can save hundreds if not
thousands of dollars on bottled water
each year we've spent a countless amount
of time perfecting and finalizing the
design to get it to the point of
manufacture no we need now is your
support to make this product the reality

this
brushing in the tooth growth Direction
can protect the enamel and effectively
remove flack iego is designed to help
you perform the technique effortlessly
Kido uses its special designed rotating
head to brush each individual tooth
according to its gross direction you can
easily operate yoga with three buttons
to the upper tooth row press the upper
buttons and the bristles will rotate
downwards for the lower deep row press
the lower button the bristles will
rotate upwards with a super soft purple
and an optimal head spinning speed
you'll experience the gentlest yet most
thorough cleaning experience the
bristles are very very soft compared to
a lot of brushes that you buy in stores
and they don't or they don't hurt your
gums they don't hurt your teeth they can
be really really and I think it's a
really good job
dentist a real Rahman today because
digital outreach will prevent the
preinstalled mental decision by in
divider Soul Train - and it's very good
registers client rated a one through a
one to five I would honestly give it a
five but this is probably one of the
best page brushes I have ever tried very
helpful keep it clean very fresh
afterwards and I really enjoy this new

transforming impossible concepts and
designs directly into end use ones at
any scale make the impossible carbon
allows designers and engineers to create
freely simplify complex assemblies
produce unmold able lattices with the
widest range of mechanical properties

anything is possible design it engineer
it make one make a million with carbon
make any number of end use parts
economically
a factory for each part every person at

innovating the speed of cloth by design
means production dramatically compress
the product development time and greatly
reduce expense over product lifecycle
carbon is making the impossible of scale
unprecedented flexibility iterative

solar paper is super small and slim so
you can conveniently carry the solar
paper when traveling or even in daily
life a new solar energy anywhere under
the Sun it can fully charge iPhone 6
within two and a half hours also Solar
paper is the world's first solar charger
that can auto reset by a comparison
operator so you don't have to worry
about shadow or cloud on solar panels
also it allows users to know exact power
amount via numbers displayed on the LCD
screen various devices such as GoPro
external battery Bluetooth speaker
digital camera double a battery charger
flashlight smartphone and even tablet PC
that requires more power can be charged
by adding additional panels magnet
connectors help to conveniently add or
