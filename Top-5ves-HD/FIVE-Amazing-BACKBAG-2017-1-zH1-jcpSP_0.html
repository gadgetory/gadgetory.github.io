hey I'm Adrian the Canadian and welcome
to life pack the anti-theft
solar-powered backpack that keeps your
phone charged and your stuff safe let's
check it out the 21st century has
redefined the way that we live our lives
you're no longer tied to an office 37
percent of US workers say they work from
home in the past month that's up over
400 percent since 1995 I'm pretty sure
that your phone's been upgraded since
then and it's time that your bag was to
good life pack we've reinvented with the
mobile office does your phone battery
ever die are you ever worried about your
bag getting stolen or broken into do you
have a hard time keeping organized well
lucky for you life hacks here to save
the day let's start with why you're
never gonna have to deal with a dead
phone again the solar bank is a
removable unit which has a solar panel
and a battery with enough power to
charge an iPhone 6 up to 12 times you
can charge the solar bank via USB then
when you're out and about the solar
panel keeps the power topped up the
solar bank also has built-in Bluetooth
speakers so you have great sounding
audio with you when you're on the go
life back has an integrated lock this
means you can lock the zipper shut when
you're on the go and what's really cool
about this lock is that you can actually
unlock the bag to something when you're
sitting still because of the unique
design of the zippers you can also lock
the zipper shut while locking it to a
fixed point the bottom of the cable can
not be removed and the exit point is
reinforced so it's super strong also the
end of the lock works is a bottle opens
Cheers Oh some things go the work zone
is incredibly organized is a separate
section for your laptop iPad there's a
space for your wallet there's a key hook
business cards pens there's also a
section for loose papers and a separate
pocket so you don't lose receipts
in the life zone is a protected pocket
for your sunglasses there's room for
clothes and any of your non work stuff
because you don't want your undies
falling out into work because we all
know about that
is that just me that's happened to there
are 4 hidden compartments on this bag on
your shoulder straps or two pockets
these are big enough for credit cards
travel cards for the subway or Metro
cash loose change or even your
headphones pressed up to your back or
two more hidden pockets these are ideal
for your passport and boarding card when
traveling these pockets are even big
enough for an iPhone six-plus and on one
side there's a USB plug that connects to
the solar mass so you can charge your
phone up while you're on the go we have

hi
we are paper we create bags with a
minimalist design combining fashion with
sustainability
why because fashion is one of the most
damaging industries in the world with
low ethical standards animal cruelty and
increasing environmental pollution
that's why we aspire to make a
difference by being responsible
sustainable and transparent the only
source of produce in Europe this way we
can reduce our carbon emissions while
ensuring high ethical standards we aim
to be as sustainable as possible not
just with all our materials that will
solve our manufacturing process
to prove all of this we are open about
who we work with and how we run our
business our design is minimal and
therefore timeless professional so our
bags in Europe with the highest quality
standards we only use vegan materials
our main material is a durable paper
just from Responsible forestry in
Scandinavia it is not only less harmful
than leather but it also has similar
attributes
hi Kickstarter we have paper and we
decide Rock sex with a minimalist design
okay we're basically pre selling our
backpacks for us it all started when
we're looking at the current state of
production industry we couldn't only
find either uninspiring designs or
backpacks that were way too expensive so
we ran Kickstarter to let our treatment
project become reality
after having invested over a year of
time and all our funds on this project
we now need your support we don't want
to be dependent on a bank and rather
create a community of individuals that
also want to make their world a little
bit better join this low fashion and
let's change something together
you
Shh

what challenges do most commuters have
in common they need a bag to store their
daily needs and deal with a constant
rush traffic jams walking miles to get
to public transportation or having to
carry more than just a backpack are all
challenges commuters have in common this
is why we created the best solution for
the urban commuter a backpack that you
can wear roll and ride meet the all-new
move pack
we've we engineered move back to
implement not one but two motors inside
the wheel
this makes move pack more powerful and
safer than ever before combined with a
beautiful and clean design
we took the time to do what we do best
we design you we prototyping
re-engineering basically reinventing so
we could bring back to you our best
product yet with our exclusive app you
will be able to connect your phone
wirelessly to move back and with a new
built-in speaker and mic you can speak
to move pack directly like asking for
directions turn it straight

a powerful speaker why not connect to
your favorite app and listen to your
favorite playlist while on the go move
pack provides a built-in USB charger
that can charge your phone over 10 times
on top of that move pack will now have
built-in tracking capability for
security in case your move pack gets
stolen
or lost
every little detail
is important such as internal lighting
that will come in handy when looking for
something in the bag and as far as the
backpack itself goes not only is it
swappable with different colors and
styles but now you can wear your
favorite backpack independently of the
mood pad
move pack is one of the
easiest vehicles to master and you don't
have to be a skateboarder to write just
stand on the board using the backpack
for extra support and use the remarkably
small remote for speed and braking and
in case of an emergency
move pack is pretty easy to get off so
there you have it a backpack a personal
transportation a smart luggage and a
personal assistant if you were to buy

over two thousand dollars but with move
pack you'll save over fifty percent of
that through this exclusive crowdfunding

manufacturers the thumbs up and start
