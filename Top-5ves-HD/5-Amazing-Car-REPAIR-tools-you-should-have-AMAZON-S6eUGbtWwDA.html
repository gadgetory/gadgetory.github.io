you're in for a long fight time for the
old heat and beat well at least that's
the way it used to be yeah it was news
to me too
a tool that would help me get the job
done in minutes instead of hours
Tyger tools heavy-duty u-joint puller
has the brute strength to take apart the
most seized u joints in minutes designed
to work with up to a one-inch impact gun
gets the job done fast without damaging
the drive shaft jokes
joints or bearing cups Plus at the end
of the day you're safe from burns and
flying shrapnel precision engineered
high-grade steel that's built to last
this is the original Tiger tool u-joint
puller made right here in North America
from equalizer introducing Raptor Raptor
a quantum leap and Winchell removal
designed to dramatically improve the
surface adhesion power of the vacuum cup
creating a solid base to cut from uses
all equalizer wire and cord products
like squire 2 and ripcord requires no
pumping just power the tool on and watch
it draw a constant vacuum raptor uses an
omnidirectional ratchet to perform your
cut allowing for optimum use even in
tight areas the SKF internal bearing
puller kits are designed for dismounting
bearings from housings where the fit is
on the outer ring the pullers are
constructed for optimum strength and
durability and suit a wide range of
bearing bore diameters a sliding hammer
allows high impact forces to be applied
and is ergonomically designed to enhance
user safety the TM IP series has a
unique patented SKF design and can help
reduce the time to dismount a bearing
unlike most internal bearing pullers the
spring-loaded extractors can be quickly
and easily fitted to the inner ring in
just one quick action
the TM IC series has an expandable call
it design made of high-strength steel
and is designed for applications where
there is a limited space to grip behind
the bearing the OT sees 65 96 brake pad
gauge allows for definitive measurement
of brake pads to determine their life
it's unique design permits measurement
of the vehicle without removal of any
components in most cases place the tip
of the tool against the brake rotor and
rotate the gauge finger back against the
brake pad backing plate the measurement
is displayed on the opposite end of the
tool in millimeters or color-coded the
OTC brake pad gauge allows you to
measure the upper and lower pad
thickness on the outboard side and
easily measure the inboard side of the
brake rotor and caliper to
you
for removal use these parts of the
adapter set
the tool can be used with the standard
workshop press but when used with the
VSC one - 7h hydraulic ram the job can
be carried out in situ on the vehicle
saving valuable time and effort however
for improved clarity we have removed the
wishbone from the vehicle
assemble the tool as shown then turn the
ramp handle clockwise to push out the
ball joint
now you can dismantle at all
remove the ball joint from the wishbone
and that completes the removal procedure
for installation use these parts of the
adapter set
push fit the new ball joint then
assemble the installation components as
shown
now press the joint home using either
the vse 1 2 7 H hydraulic ram or
alternatively a workshop press turn the
ram clockwise till the joint is fully
engaged the VSC 1 2 7 8 0 5 makes a
tedious job quick and easy and that
completes the installation procedure
