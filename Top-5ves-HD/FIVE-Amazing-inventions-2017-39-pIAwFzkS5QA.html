I'll is a clear boost for energy levels
without potential customers to test our
decisions and reassure food satisfaction
what I'm really proud of is that we
managed to create a highly functional
stylish and user-friendly product I
expect with the amazing features my
favorite ones are the Hana link and the
up to you
this however just the beginning as we
plan to release an open API and there
are many more of those great additions
the technology behind IO is based on
scientific proofs and research
breakthroughs developed over the past 20
years by leading institutions worldwide
io is a first step in personal and
judgment of the internal body clock and
will help us to improve our lifestyle to
remain healthy and to keep the doctor
away our team has spent the last two
years developing this technology and
soon you will be able to enjoy it we
believe we have created an amazing
product that will help many today we
need your support with our IndieGoGo
campaign it will help us speed up the
development delivery of new features and
starting production by supporting as
soon
you
make steamed roast and saute nothing is
off-limits plus it tastes great the
secrets of this technology is a vacuum
tube which absorbs light and acts as a
perfect insulator holding heat to the
harshest conditions with this technology
go son is revolutionising cooking for
people around the world we invite you to
join the next evolution in cooking
welcome to the fuel free frontier
well my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simply
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them two years ago
we asked our engineers at steadicam
headquarters in Burbank to create the
best electronic handheld stabilizer with
no limitations we took our Steadicam
technology that's been used in Hollywood
for the last 40 years and coupled it was
Steve wagging his genius software design
and by partnering with aerial drone
manufacturer unique it allowed us to
create the Steadicam vault the best
electronic handheld stabilizer with no
limitations the study can volt like all
its predecessors is a expanded system
with the center of gravity right at a
gimbal it accepts any phone any case
that allows you to walk around precisely
frame the things that you want to see
and move the camera in the way that
we're used to seeing on a feature film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study cam for smartphones that weighs 1
pound with the inertia and the feel of a
big 40-pound rig
three axis gimbal they're not terrific
at following action one two three one
two three there's a little lag there the
study Kimble gives you stability and
agility and that's the key the Volt
effectively puts study cam technology in
the palm of your hand our mission has
always been to help people create the
world's greatest images
so back us today we can't wait to see
what you guys are going to create
you
hi Kickstarter I'm Jeff Renner I put a
designer from London and the creator of
the barrister the barrister is finally
here to redesign your morning
introducing a whole new way to wake up
and begin your fresh new day promising
to renew your morning routine the
barrister combines ultimate convenience
with a century experience wake up to the
invigorating aroma of freshly brewed
coffee or tea at your chosen time before
going to bed for the blast boiling
vessel with enough water for your chosen
morning drink
place the bung in the top of the boiling
vessel securely if you take milk with
your drink for the specially designed
milk vessel next we're ready for you to
add the good stuff to bring the freshly
ground coffee into the filter on the
sealed storage compartment set your
alarm time then set the brew tamp for
your drink before at the alarm or after
the barrister can be used for tea as
well as coffee charge your phone of the
USB port located in the base my research
was inspired by the psychology behind
sleep and relaxation
I learned that adopting a nightly
routine can encourage a more restful
night's sleep whilst gently stimulating
one senses can lead to better awakening
another branch of my research was
looking at function versus aesthetic my
aim was to design a beautiful product
that people can proudly display in their
home but that also engages the user
physically
the barrister uses induction heating for
maximum safety and efficiency the
induction coil induces an
electromagnetic current that heats the
content of the vessel when the vessel
balls
it creates steam which pushes the water
out and into the coffee simple science
however this hasn't been a simple
process it has taken a year of hard work
and dedication to get it right the
barrister has been endlessly refined for
manufacturing purposes the induction
heating element has been the biggest
challenge to overcome there are no
off-the-shelf parts that fit their
required specifications of the product I
have been working with an experienced
team of electrical engineers to design
code and build an induction heater that
produces the output required whilst
keeping it small enough to integrate it
into the product what we have refined
and developed a built-in Peltier cooler
to ensure milk is kept cool overnight
the filter arm has three magnets to keep
it in place for your convenience we've
redesigned a higher quality filter for
more efficient during the boiling vessel
has been redeveloped with a stainless
steel base for improved connection to
the induction coil a max line has been
integrated on the boiler vessel
the LED displayed now includes a light
sensor to regulate the display
brightness adjusting to your environment
why we need you gearing up for
manufacture means huge resources and
financial support we are a self-funded
start-up and have funded as much as the
project ourselves as possible now we
need your support with the barrister
quality is our main concern
and we refuse to make any compromises we
have been working with the top safety
experts to ensure that we meet all the
health and safety requirements we have
world-class sourcing companies with
years of experience lined up who are
standing by to coordinate all stages of
production and logistics I cannot think
of anything better and see this product
becoming reality and have people all
over the world waking up to the
barrister I haven't come this far to
only get this far so please back the
barrister and join our mission for
better mornings
