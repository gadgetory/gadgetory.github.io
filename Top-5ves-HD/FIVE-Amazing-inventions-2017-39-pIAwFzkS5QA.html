years we have been developing I owe an
amazing product that puts you in charge
of your energy is a master key for
controlling your internal rhythm so you

revolutionary that it will fundamentally
change the way we look at sleep being

without potential customers to test our
decisions and reassure food satisfaction
what I'm really proud of is that we
managed to create a highly functional
stylish and user-friendly product I
expect with the amazing features my
favorite ones are the Hana link and the
up to you disco era just the beginning
as we plan to release an open API and
there are many more of those great
additions the technology behind io is
based on scientific proofs and research
breakthroughs developed over the past 20
years by leading institutions worldwide
io is in first step in personal
adjustment of the internal body clock
and will help us to improve our
lifestyle to remain healthy and to keep
the doctor away our team has spent the
last two years developing this
technology and soon you will be able to
enjoy it we believe we have created an
amazing product that will help man today
we need your support with our IndieGoGo
campaign it will help us speed up the
development delivery of new features and
starting production by supporting a
thing
you
no sense
bake steam roast and saute nothing is
off-limits plus it tastes great the
secret to this technology is a vacuum
tube which absorbs light and acts as a
perfect insulator holding heat to the
harshest conditions with this technology
go sun is revolutionising cooking for
people around the world we invite you to
join the next evolution in cooking
welcome to the fuel free frontier
well my grandfather not founded the
Tiffin company his philosophy was simple
find out what the customer wants and
give it to them two years ago we asked
our engineers at steadicam headquarters
in Burbank to create the best electronic
handheld stabilizer with no limitations
we took our study camp technology that's
been used in Hollywood for the last 40
years and coupled it with Steve Wagner's
genius software design and by partnering
with aerial drone manufacturer unique it
allowed us to create the Steadicam vault
the best electronic handheld stabilizer
with no limitations the study chem volt
like all its predecessors is a expanded
system with the center of gravity right
at a gimbal it accepts any phone any
case that allows you to walk around
precisely frame the things that you want
to see and move the camera in the way
that we're used to seeing on a feature
film
it's an electronically gyro augmented
study can for smartphones that weighs
one pound with the inertia and the feel
of a big 40 pound rig
you
3-axis gimbal they're not terrific at
following action one two three one two
three little lag there the study chem
volt gives you stability and agility and
that's the key the Volt effectively puts
Steadicam technology in the palm of your
hand our mission has always been to help
people create the world's greatest
images
so back us today we can't wait to see
what you guys are going to create
you
hi Kickstarter I'm Jeff Rena the product
designer from London and the creator of
the barrister the barrister is finally
here to redesign your morning
introducing a whole new way to wake up
and begin your fresh new day promising
to renew your morning routine the
barrister combines ultimate convenience
with a century experience wake up to the
invigorating aroma of freshly brewed
coffee or tea at your chosen time before
going to bed for the blast boiling
vessel with enough water for your chosen
morning drink place the bung in the top
of the boiling vessel securely if you
take milk with your drink for the
specially designed milk vessel next
we're ready for you to add the good
stuff to bring the freshly ground coffee
into the filter from the sealed storage
compartment set your alarm time then set
the brute um for your drink before at
the alarm or after the barrister can be
used for tea as well as coffee charge
your phone off the USB port located in
the base my research was inspired by the
psychology behind sleep and relaxation I
learnt that adopting a nightly routine
can encourage a more restful night's
sleep whilst gently stimulating one
sensors can lead to better awakening
another branch of my research was
looking at function versus aesthetic my
aim was to design a beautiful product
that people can proudly display in their
home but that also engages the user
physically the barrister uses induction
heating for maximum safety and
efficiency the induction coil induces an
electromagnetic currents that heats the
content of the vessel when the vessel
balls it creates steam which pushes the
water out and into the coffee simple
science however this hasn't been a
simple process it has taken a year of
hard work and dedication to get it right
the barrister has been endlessly refined
for manufacturing purposes the induction
heating element has been the biggest
challenge to overcome there are no
off-the-shelf parts that fit the
required specifications of the product I
have been working with an experienced
team of electrical engineers to design
code and build an induction heater that
produces the outfit required whilst
keeping it small enough to integrate
into the product what we have refined
and developed a built-in pelletier
cooler to ensure milk is kept cool
overnight the filter arm has three
magnets to keep it in place for your
convenience we've redesigned a higher
quality filter for more efficient
brewing the boiling vessel has been
redeveloped with a stainless steel base
for improves connection to the induction
coil a max line has been integrated on
the boiling vessel
the LED display now includes a light
sensor to regulate the display
brightness adjusting to your environment
why we need you gearing up for
manufacture means huge resources and
financial support we are a self funded
startup and have funded as much as the
project ourselves as possible now we
need your support with the barrister
quality as our main concern and we
refuse to make any compromises we have
been working with the top safety experts
to ensure that we meet all the health
and safety requirements we have
world-class sourcing companies with
years of experience lined up who are
standing by to coordinate all stages of
production and logistics I cannot think
of anything better and see this product
becoming reality and have people all
over the world waking up to the
barrister I haven't come this far to
only get this far so please back the
barrister and join our mission for
better mornings
