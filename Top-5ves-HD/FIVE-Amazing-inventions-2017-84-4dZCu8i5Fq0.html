you
hi this is expired ex-fighter can go
where you can't under the desk around
furniture and more ex-fighter is
powerful as it is beautiful it can be
programmed easily to perform all sorts
of robotic tasks point-and-click in an
object on screen and CX spider navigate
to it automatically we've open sourced
all of the exploiters 3d models you can
easily modify and improve your ex later
3d print anyone not only connectify to
reprogram it could also be trained
thanks for the powerful neural network
inside Intel 3 you can make x-fighters
even cooler at a half a do not take the
case imagination is the limit with
exploiter hello everybody this is mike
i'm very happy to introduce yourself
things we have been working on for the
past nine months it's powerful and the
beautiful robot is like spider but
before we get into the details we'd like
to show you the team behind the vac
spider and the how it goes of the idea
to start this project ex-fighter was
created by the river which team the robo
if team is passionate about making
robots most of the team members came
from team water one of the top college
robot teams in china we won four
championships and robocup one of the top
robotic competitions for college
students
in November 2015 got the team back
together to create a robot that is a
beautiful inanimate figure and deserving
to be sellin scale it also has to be
powerful for such academic competition
the nine months we worked hard when she
doesn't the designs and hundreds of 3d
printed partner testimony we made
several iterations at sliders audition
too long distance without such a good
response that we got invited to the
brick show we went back to refining and
improving ideas again and again going
through more than 26 redesigns 100
manuscript and over 500 3d models proves
our passion and persistence for robotics
and our expired project for making
available for more people we need your
help a crowdfunding campaign has been
lungs on IndieGoGo so now you can make
pre-order from website we are so
grateful for all the exposure friends
that is supported as we encouraged us
thank you all that has been amazing
hi can you imagine rolls with all better
resisting weekend
no button no batteries just touch it and
heat of your hand will be converted into
your life and the greater I asked myself
situation so do I pray something new
something you can buy no of thought that
makes plan key features of lumen
resumo ultra-bright LED luminix capable
perform all of everyday death everson is
packed in a tiny and lightweight
aluminum body say when I am learn
something I always think how two
electrodes will be useful the lumen
don't need batteries it uses one of the
more green energy surface your body heat
no buttons no batteries just touch it
and heat of your hand will be converted
into a light illumine is a body heat
powered flashlight crowd of the device
is TAC unit that convert heat into
electric current excessive energy is
stored into a super capacitor and
voltage converter boost it up into a
usable range yeah this stylish lock is
not among the most powerful web / on the
market but it will easily solve most of
every data let me show you allow battery
on smartphone and you're in a dark route
not a problem anymore need for ever less
than light source for reading for
everlasting light in your senses can be
useful in magnification or Utley Gary of
ramp on a big name
