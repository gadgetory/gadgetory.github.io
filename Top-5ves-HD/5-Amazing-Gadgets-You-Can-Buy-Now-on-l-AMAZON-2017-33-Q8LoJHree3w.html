and performance arey is a world-first
that ensures was surrounded by good air
arey is a unique internationally painted
air cleansing system that uses the
detoxification potential of the house
price the problem indoors the pollution

reaction to clean my view it's used in
two years so ten years ago I began to
search for a solution to this problem
the idea comes from space travel where
the use of plants to clean air has been
researched for decades the result up to
the 90% of the air is purified by the
roots normally however these roots are
covered up
hold it needed least just a plump pop
that ventilates the roots and from this
simple idea
a whole range of eclipse was created
that ultimately landed in this pot with
Airy the air enters the pot through
slats and is then sucked past the roots
thanks to the chimney effect in this way
the roots absorb environmental toxins
significantly more quickly transforming
them into usable nutrients and emitting
fresh oxygen like this one plants in the
area can replace up to eight plants in
regular parts and all
completely naturally without electricity
noise all filters its efficiency has
been scientifically confirmed for better
