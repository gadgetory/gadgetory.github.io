bolo is a true innovation combining two
of humanity's most important inventions
to date the knife and the wheel creating
a one-of-a-kind rolling knife your
perfect kitchen accessory bolo makes
preparing your meals faster and easier
the engineered circular blade coupled
with bolo sturdy construction allows you
to achieve chef quality precision in
your cutting and bolo easily tackles
many of the jobs your other knives can't
do the ergonomic handle makes bolo more
functional and more comfortable than
your regular kitchen knives as a chef a
product designer and a housewares
manufacturer I've worked with been
studied nice for over 30 years and I
find they all have one common deficiency
the angle of the blade and the grip on
the handle puts too much stress on your
wrist and hand bull changes all of that
by placing the force of your hand
directly above the blade you get better
precision cutting while relieving your
hand and wrist from unnatural movements
the result perfectly cut food each and
every time fast and easy and this
special blade break even turns bolo into
a chopper
and cleaning bolo could not be easier
just open at both ends remove the blade
and rinse
