you
two years ago my girlfriend asked me to
give em all bye so she could ride it to
work which I did and then I got scared
scared because large cities are not
always a safe place to ride a bike you
have to slalom you weigh between
Platteville's the size of a truck and
urban drivers are not always the most
patient or diplomat citizens so I
started asking myself how could I make
this better for her and I made a list of
all the basic specifications that a
perfect urban mobility system would need
to eat you need maneuverability which
means a short wheelbase and a steep head
too to reduce your turning radius so you
can manage extremely tight corners a
large front wheel to overcome any
obstacle the city puts in your way a
small motorized rear wheel to increase
acceleration and climb steeper roads you
should be standing in an upright
position because there is a lot going on
in the city you need to keep an eye on
your surroundings and be able to get on
and off very easily it needs to be
simple easy to use intuitive and almost
maintenance-free
after months of brainstorming the basic
idea of the sneaky bike was born a
vintage concept with a modern twist a
lot of sweat and tears later with many
talented people who join the project we
ended up with an amazing product and now
with your hub the snick if I could be a
game-changer
tim loves his bike well-loved
tim has been looking for the best way to
protect his bike
but he hasn't been very lucky
Tim feel safer now with Sherlock
Sherlock is a small GPS tracker hidden
in the frame of the bicycle it's
connected to a mobile app that lets him
know where his bike is at any time we
want sub cyclists free from the fear of
theft which is something we have all
experienced we've been working on the
design and the electronics of Sherlock
for about a year now for the printing
the first prototypes and studying how to
make it as small as possible so it can
be hidden inside the frame of the
bicycle Sherlock is designed to be
easily installed in the handlebars it
can fit any shape of tube thanks to its
flexible design and it is completely
invisible from the outside so the design
of the bike is not altered and thieves
cannot see that it is there if your
bicycle moves and it's not you moving it
you will receive an immediate alert on
your phone

bicycle directly on your smartphone to
help you be reunited once again we are
