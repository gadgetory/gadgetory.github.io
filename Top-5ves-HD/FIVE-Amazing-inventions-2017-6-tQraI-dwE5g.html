my PhD I realized that 60-second could
change the world that's because it only
takes 60 second of UV LED light to kill
the germs that have plagued humankind
since the beginning of time just 60
seconds underdeveloped immune systems
are unable to fight off deadly germs and
viruses which is why there is le the
world's first portable medical grade
sterilizer just place your baby's bottle
pacifier or teething ring into le and in
60 seconds it's germ-free
UV light particularly UVC which is a
particular type of UV kills all sorts of
germs including viruses bacteria and
fungi by damaging their DNA or RNA Ellie
runs on a rechargeable battery and it's
very compact so you can take it anywhere
and while it's grateful bottles and
binkies Ellie can sterilize anything
that fits into the chamber including
water for mixing formula small toys or
even breast pump accessories just put it
into the Ellie and in 60 seconds it's
safe to use Ellie's true violet UV
digital technology kills germs and
viruses at the core by breaking their
DNA strand including
antibiotic-resistant superbugs we
clearly do need to have available
portable devices for when we're carrying
around food or other items such as baby
bottles or other types of things that
might become contaminated and
particularly with the more vulnerable
populations such as a very young child
true violet technology also has many
promising applications that address
global concerns such as air and water
sterilization especially in areas
without centralized water supply or
electricity and 60 seconds is all it
takes thank you for your time
hi I'm Sean and I'm Frank and this is

proof of concept created an elegant
beautiful industrial design and laid out
a development roadmap for finishing the
consumer ready device we've teamed up
with world-class designers and engineers
and lined up suppliers and manufacturing

hi my name is Yasim umrah I'm jazz
drummer I used to work for visual record
company music lover like me live in the
city we always use the headphones
headphones gives you a good sound
mobility and silence but sometimes I
couldn't stand it headphones are painful
leave them on for more than an hour and
they hurt when running it gets
uncomfortable and sweaty I thought why
not to design a headphone and solve
these problems this is yi shi Beshear's
3d molded open air frame design allows
you to interact with your environment
while you're listening to your audio
this is the first pain-free bluetooth
headphone it doesn't press on your ears
which can cause discomfort instead the
3d geometric frame sits around your ear
with minimal body contact this allows
air flow and makes them comfortable to
wear for long periods of time b shares
core audio technology comes from
yamaha's mach 5 module one of yamaha's
most advanced codecs and enables us to
provide superior sound quality our
headphones have an onboard 3-band
equalizer that works with all your music
apps and allows you to customize the
sound to your own personal taste
it's important that you and only you can
hear the sound of your headphones V
share is designed with directional flat
speakers that produce amazing sound
quality and yet focus the sound directly
to your ears to keep what you're
listening to private can we get this all
right let's go the airframe keeps you in
touch with the sounds around you so you
notice when other people approach or
want to talk with you and without
removing your headphones or adjusting
your audio you can carry on a normal
conversation when you want to be
undisturbed that VCR headphones have an
interchangeable closed frame as well for
when you want to concentrate or when
you're in a loud environment each
headset is able to broadcast or receive
from other headsets so you can use V
share to share your audio with your
friends without disturbing others around
you we hope you can find places where V
share fits your lifestyle we've
partnered with a major Japanese audio
company to help us manufacture the
highest quality headphones possible our
plans are set and we have a scheduled to
deliver be sure to you on time we need
your help we need funding to cover the
cost for moles and tools for
manufacturing with your help we can
