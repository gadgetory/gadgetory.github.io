can custom build to create your own
layout a marketing tool the system
starts with the patented v1 for set and
match ruler one of Kapos most popular
creations the three one for second match
is a professional quality ruler with two
Spidy markers for the horizontal and
vertical violet this patented feature
lets you easily measure transfer and
mark anywhere we went for as clear and
durable markings along the rulers edge
and angle markings on the rulers face
there are two scales ranging from 1 to
30 centimeters and one to 60 centimeters
with a zero point marking for easy
centering the 3:1 floor set in bachelor
comes in lengths ranging from 20 inch 50
centimeter model to a 48 inch 127 meter
model you can begin to expand the system
with a 3 140 square accessory which
turns a set and match ruler into a
versatile t-square with a built-in
storage compartment and handy magnetic
strip for holding nails and screws the
t-square head lofts firmly into place on
the end of the ruler in one of two
positions the ruler flush from the back
of the square head or elevated for
placing on a surface edge a built-in
ledge keeps the t-square a head in place
when the 3 1 4 is placed on an edge
allowing you to move the ruler with one
hand and cut our mark with the other
moving the 3 1 4 is easy with a sturdy
handle which slides along the rulers
face and has an integrated auto lock
mechanism which keeps the handle in
place for a sure grip the 3 1 4 also has
a horizontal and vertical knife guides
that smoothly slide along the rulers
edge and lock in place for a safe and
accurate cut the 3 1 4 set match system
is an ideal tool for a wide range of
do-it-yourself jobs including setting in
the lining shelves cabinets and mirror
stencils in the wall paper marking and
cutting long lines on walls wood drywall
and cardboard
marking in cutting angled lines and much
more cap rows three one four set match
system one the most unique and smart
do-it-yourself tools available but just
put a common number two pencil in the
center hole place the tool on the board
twist it until the posts make contact
and then slide just like that you have a
perfectly centered line on boards up to
one and a half inches thick the second
job is marking offsets or reveals four
jobs like installing moldings just flip
the tool but it against the board choose
the offset and slide the tool to draw
the line
it marks offsets from 1/16 to 1/2 inch
from the edge in 1/16 increments when
you're done you can take advantage of
the built-in magnet to store it on a
metal surface for easy retrieval next
time from the creators of time BOTS the
world's easiest tie down comes Jabba's
jaw boss is an innovative tool that
makes cutting firewood safer faster and
easier on both the operator and his
equipment easy to use you just slide job
boss into your receiver hitch and you're
ready to go once jaw boss is in place
simply insert your firewood log and
start cutting John moss holds the logs
securely and at a height that makes
cutting safe and easy right down to the
last piece no more dulling your chain on
dirt and rocks when cutting on the
ground
no more risking injury to your toes
cutting that last piece that twists and
rolls under your foot jaw boss can
handle logs of less than 2 inches in
diameter which is ideal for cutting
kindling or smaller wood for a campfire
jaw boss can also handle larger wood up
to 9 inches in diameter from short
pieces up to logs 30 feet or longer
as a construction tool it holds
dimension lumber securely for measuring
and cutting it's like having a sawhorse
with someone holding the other end of
the board a one-of-a-kind product jaw
boss would be a welcome addition to
anyone's tool chest Jabba saves time and
effort for the operator
it saves wear and tear on the equipment
and it makes many jobs easier and safer
so we're gonna hit a new starter out
double stack feather Pro and I'm going
to assemble it and we're going to run a
board through and make a cup and fill
just how it works
it's got all the same features and
benefits as a single Thunder problem it
is designed to have independent movement
a small amount and it will come with the
ultralight feathers reserve the ideal
inserts to use with a double standard so
we're gonna set it just like you would a
single that's it
you've probably done it you need to
round off the sharp corner of a table
top so you scrounge for something a can
a lid a coin that you can use to trace a
curve that's reasonably close to what
you need rocklers corner radius routing
templates offer a quicker more accurate
and more easily repeatable way of not
dis tracing but also cutting precise
curves on sharp corners the set includes
three durable inputs that provide 12
different radii along with a fence that
offers excellent control when working in
a router table with the bearing guided
flush trim bit using them as easy pick
the radius you want a machine on the
corner and snap the fence into place
clips and posts on the fence allow quick
alignment and rubber strips on the
bottom of the template help prevent
shifting
put the template on your workpiece and
set the bit height so the bearing will
run along the edge of the template make
sure the posts and clips are tight
against the edges of the workpiece grip
the finger hold then route in the
direction indicated on the fence
keeping the bearing against the edge of
the template you end up with a precise
radius on your workpiece that requires
only a little finish sanding if you want
to quickly easily and accurately shape
curves on the corners of tabletops
countertops and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
