fives HD here are some fantastic ideas
that upgrade your home in July number
six
aquascape waterfall first scan the area
and mark out with a bright color
spray-paint use a shovel and dig a hole
in the marked area at least 17 inches
deep now we need to mark a location for
water pump placement for accurate
marking you can use some aqua blocks
before install underlayment
clean the surface and make sure there is
no rock or debris then cover the fabric
underlayment by overlaying EPDM rubber
pond liner push the underlayment gently
and place aqua blocks around the pump
pump build the backsides of a basin with
the soil take the large small and medium
size of rocks and place them carefully
around the mouth of the pump vault get
the aqua pump ready with necessary
attachments after placing the pump dig
shallow drainage for water pipe extend
the pipe through the drainage and fix to
pub
now with the help of some rocks and
rubber pond liner hide the entire
foundation so next step and go smoother
cut out a circular hole insert the
spillway nozzle and secure the liner by
refitting rubber and nut
we need some sealant to seal gaps and
joints to prevent the water flowing
beneath the rocks wrap the edges of
under lineman and hide making soil layer
here it is the natural waterfall feel
the joy of paradise
number five stick at tiles give your
kitchen and bathroom new look in less
time with stickit tiles first clean the
wall and remove bumps sockets or
switches peel off the backside and place
it on the area you want to cover
cut out unnecessary fingers of the tiles
so that the application can be more
accessible now apply the silicon on the
parts where the wall and the tiles come
together your kitchen is ready to shine
removing tiles is as easy as applying
use a hairdryer and peel off
number four new DIY hot tub
Felder group first we require siberian
larch as starting material due to
weather resistance and toughness
qualities it appears as the first choice
take it to the saw blade and cut up to
three feet next process is trimming and
leveling all edges
now the boards are given tongue to frame
a group the square tongue used to
assemble the bottom of the bathtub and
the round tongue used to build a
circular wall around the tub bottom
the broadest large panels are kept a
priority to assemble the floor now mark
the center point cut the floor following
the mark and use planar if you find any
bumps now we can start the wall
installing process due to accurate
cutting and finishing it has done in
less time to improve durability and
strength we use the iron belt that holds
the tub wall last longer
now it's time to install accessory a
heater place the heater as center as
possible and tightly screw with tub wall
we now need a barrier that keeps you
safe from any injury
finally it's time for bench installation
the hot tub is ready to make you feel
relaxed and stress-free
number three Canuck DIY a stylish TV
stand
start with tracing lines on the wall put
the profile following the lines with a
galvanizing cutter now get the profile
ready inserting a screw fasten a hollow
wall anchor in the hole and tighten the
profile following the same process fix
all profiles on the traced lines the
basic structure has done using small
blocks we can join the separate
structure with the base before fixing
the MDF board panel prefer using
countersink drill bit so later you can
hide the holes keep following the same
process for building the remaining frame
the blocks help to join the profiles at
corners the MDF panel is much light
weighted so you don't need to put
forceful efforts cover the open edges
with MDF panel when the framing finished
apply acrylic cement screw it and remove
the excess cement fill the holes and
gaps with wood and acrylic filler apply
final component for a smoother surface
in the end finish the job by applying
your choice of color number 2 mod pools
introducing the mod pool which moves out
of a shipping container
this mod pool is the best example of
recycling this fabulous mod pool is 8
feet wide and 10 meters long with a
depth of 1.5 meters the founder Paul and
Denise Rothman turned a giant container
into a giant hot tub a mobile app can
control the pool temperature mod pools
is not just a pool for more fun this
container come pool enhanced with jets
and lights
number one rain deck first we need to I
at the backyard to figure out the
perfect area for rain deck the next job
is to level the fields by removing rocks
and soft upper soil and then frame a
large circle the next step is the
installation of the water tunnel and of
course the water tank the tank is a
burial grade engineer tank that comes
with the splash pad kit once the
foundation process is over remove the
excessive pipes get ready to recall your
childhood memories here comes the
favorite part of all of us the rocket
ship the rocket weighs over a ton but we
can manage it with the excavator
successfully su rocket was positioned
and now we moved to apply a rubberized
coating to the top of the pad
so finally we turned an ordinary
backyard into the mesmerizing scenario
it's time to be a child and enjoy space
