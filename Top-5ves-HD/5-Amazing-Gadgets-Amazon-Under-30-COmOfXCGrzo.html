hi guys I'm Lorenzo hi I'm Carlo every
day smartphones are becoming smarter but
the battery life remains critical we'd
like to use our phones without the fear
of running out of battery of course
there are solutions such as power cases
and extra batteries but they're either
not portable enough or easy to forget we
designed a product so compact that will
follow you everywhere a cable the size
of an inch we call it in charge it's a
very simple product it's so useful that
we believe everybody should own one
that's why one of our main goals was to
keep it affordable
a tiny product at the tiny price
we spend an average 70% of our day next
to a USB port and every time it's a
chance to top-up for batteries there are
over five billion USB ports around the
world in charge will fit into your
pocket
and you won't have to fight with timer
cords ever again thanks to its
remarkably compact design you can snap
it onto your keyring and there's no
chance to forget it at all we spent the
last three months designed the product
and testing the prototypes and now we
are finally ready to start the
production in charger will be available
with both lightning connector and micro
USB so it's compatible with most of the
devices out there we are really excited
about this and we hope you are too now
we need your help to bring in charge
into your pocket as a supporter you will
get your own in charge at a special
price so please consider backing our
project and share it with your friends
thanks for watching we really appreciate
your support thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
