anywhere you want to on the sheet
without relying on following the edge it
does this by guiding the song along a
long aluminum track that you simply lay
on the sheet where you want to cut that
means you can cross cut a sheet right
down the middle cut at an angle or make
a rip cut up to 48 inches long using the
egg you cut is easy just make a couple
of marks where you want to cut then
align the edge of the IQ cut with the
marks it stays in place without clamps
make your cut and the track guides
yourself perfectly straight the track
also offers a great advantage when
you're cutting across the grain of a
sheet of plywood when making these cuts
using a circular saw freehand the blade
can easily splinter the fragile face
veneer but the guide strips on the ank
you cut that help align the track and
hold it in place also prevents
splintering they do this by hugging
tight against the saw blade to protect
the fragile veneer layer and hold it in
place
the enqueue cut is also great for
projects with angles to make the angled
sanctions just mark out each end and
then lay the egg you cut track on the
marks guide your saw along the track and
you can cut those angles with perfectly
straight
splinter free edges whether you choose
the RIP cut or the IQ cut you'll get
better performance and accuracy from
your circular saw than you probably ever
thought was possible if you have bolt
you can even move your saw back and
forth between them that means you can
use the same saw on both tools without
having to change Sun up
hi my name is Griffin berry product

going to show you a powerful new
professional demolition and renovation
tool the bulldog bite recipe at the core

specifically designed for removing deck
boards wood siding and palate
deconstruction the double forge provide

planks or when demolition is above
ground level the bull bar has a
patent-pending center nail port offering
better balance and more leverage great
when removing ring shank nails and
stubborn longer nails the nail puller
utilizes the round portion of the
indexing head this design acts as a cam
to allow the head to rock against the
wood rather than dig into the material
the result of easy smooth removal
precision tips with gripping teeth are
designed to easily fit between boards
and are wide enough to straddle two
floor joists reclaimers salvagers and
