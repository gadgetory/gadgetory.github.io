yeah
hello IndieGoGo we are onion as makers
we use development boards to build all
sorts of cool stuff but most development
boards on the market fell short of our
expectations they are bulky confusing
the setup and overcomplicated we usually
spend far more time reading the
documentation than actually using them
to build things today we're changing
that say hello to the Omega 2 the
world's simplest development board the
Omega 2 is tiny at less than a quarter
of the size of your credit card it can
easily fit into any project but don't be
fooled by its size the Omega 2 is
powerful it is a full Linux computer
that's right this tiny purple thing runs
the same operating system that powers
some of the world's most mission
critical infrastructure the Omega 2
works out of the box it comes with
built-in Wi-Fi and onboard storage so it
comes to life the moment you power it on
the Omega 2 is familiar you control it
with apps just like your regular
computer we even have an app store so
you can discover apps created by the
community the Omega 2 is easy to program
in fact you don't even have to read any
code it supports node-red
a graphical tool that you can use to
create programs by simple drag-and-drop
but if you are into writing code the
omega2 supports many programming
languages pick one you're already
familiar with and start building the
Omega 2 is called connected so you can
remote controller securely from anywhere
in the world the Omega 2 is expandable
we have created many plug-and-play
expansions so adding new features to
your project will look something like
this the Omega 2 is affordable starting
at only $5 yep 5 it is cheaper than this
Frappuccino we want to lower the barrier
to entry so everyone can join the maker
so you see guys the problem is that the
tools for building amazing hardware are
just not accessible for everyone and
that is why here at onion we have worked
so hard to make the Omega 2 really easy
to use
but we need your help to make it
affordable as well so please pack our
campaign and tell all your friends we
can't wait to see what the amazing
things you'll come up with thank you
you
you see amazing isn't it this is the air
selfie the only portable flying camera
integrated into your mobile phone cover
micro and ultralight it comes with it's
very own device for storage and charging
with an easy one-hand control from its
own where did the idea come from
well I'll show you look at this what an
epic day out of bonafide selfie time as
they say just need to squeeze a teeny
bit no oh never mind ah more manageable
group just two guys actually they want
to take a selfie to remember this
wonderful place well I guess they can
just describe the view to their friends
back home right okay one more try this
time a good old barbecue outside on a
sunny day with lots of friends let's try
the selfie stick strategy still can't
fit everybody in annoying situations am
i right we've all been there buddy
that's how air selfie was born a perfect
team gathered together working in London
Milan and Shanghai to combine micro
flying technologies ultralight HD
cameras with in flight stability systems
our selfie can travel in a 20 meter
radius and hovers for up to three
minutes it's easily controllable from
both iOS or Android smartphone apps it's
only 52 grams and it slots into its
phone cover and recharges so what if the
guys had an air selfie with them they
make it hover find the perfect angle and
leave the controls finally snap an
amazing photo with the selfie delay
timer mode while it is autonomously
flying and keeping its position in the
air awesome what about the two explorers
they select the classic flying mode from
the three options available control air
selfie through the app by holding the
phone horizontally and take both
memorable photos and videos and what
would have happened at the barbecue
enough with the squeezing just select
the selfie mode use only two buttons to
find the right distance to shoot and
take a great picture
what about an indoor location whatever
it may be a party at somebody's house or
a night out in a club there are no
issues there selfie fly's easily it's
simple to control and very safe and once
you shoot a great picture don't keep it
to yourself it's so easy to share it
right from your phone as easy as
grabbing the air selfie safely while
it's still hovering in the air so this
is air selfie the only portable flying
camera integrated into your mobile phone
cover ready to explore new perspectives
let's take a look at its technical
features power bank inside its own
custom phone cover a battery that
charges itself in only 30 minutes 5
megapixel HD video camera to suit social
media optimized images sophisticated
sensors and its own Wi-Fi control unit
in flight stability systems to hover
autonomously the smallest and most
powerful brushless motors it's safe to
grab while it's still hovering and of
course its own 4 gigabyte microSD memory
ultralight with a solid italian-designed
case compact and easy to carry with you
anywhere you go ready for the revolution
air selfie is on Kickstarter help us to
get it into production become an air
selfie ambassador by pre-ordering now
you
hi everyone I'm Benson founder and CEO
of ours each type of coffee bean has
their specific way of extracting the
best favour for me depending on ground
size water temperature and a lot more
however today's coffee machine doesn't
provide you the level flexibility to do
so and bring it by hand is not precise
and consistent enough so we created ours
to brew the best vapor of coffee to you
in the most specific precise and
consistent way all this might sounds
complicated but ours has simplified
everything into a simple machine and an
easy-to-use smartphone apps you can
download all sorts of recipe or even
create your own one like a professional
now with the type of button you can brew
coffee like you were lansbury status now
we can have complete control of our
coffee tastes while learning of new ones
at the same time and sharing with people
all over the world at any time any place
arist is an intelligent coffee maker
it gives master baristas complete
control over coffee no matter where they
are from fine-tuning the grinder to know
exactly when to pull the shot making
great coffee requires accuracy
consistency and years of practice RS can
adjust each element of the brewing
process from temperature and pressure to
milk foam and syrup brewing professional
coffee can never be easier than this
you can control RS from your smartphone
day and night from customizing your
coffee to brewing it with a simple push
of a button all can be done without
interrupting what you are doing simply
enjoy your favorite coffee with the most
convenience your local barista may have
a hard time spelling your name but RS
remembers you and offers you
recommendations based on your tastes it
can introduce you to brews you've never
heard of it introduces you to recipes
based on the coffee beans you have on
hand you can even program artists to
remember a specific cup and brew the
same beverage every time you use that
cup with orest you can say goodbye to
frustrating scenes like this forever and
this
we're rewriting the rules this is the
new normal
world class brews on demand and we're
not the only ones who are excited we
already have several world-renowned
baristas ready to offer their signature
drinks on artists hi I'm Vincent a
biotech engineer and a barista I love
experimenting with different kinds of
coffee beans to create new coffees Paris
is actually very easy to use it helps me
find to my recipes in a very accurate
and systematic way and once I found that
flavor that I'm looking for
it lets me rebou the same cup
consistently every time my favorite part
about this machine is that it's very
convenient
there's a mini cooler inside so the milk
lasts much longer and when I'm done for
the night all I have to do is turn off
the machine and it cleans itself it's
perfect for when I'm feeling extra lazy
hi I'm Chris as a professional barista
and curator it is very rare for me to
like an all-in-one coffee machine the
reason is because this machine has very
precise and accurate controls over water
temperature grind size water flow and
pressure I believe a lot of baristas
will enjoy this machine we put every
waking minutes in the depression of
Erised
our team of baristas designers engineers
and operations experts are all coffee
lovers now after various attempts and
trials we now have a fully working
prototype we believe we found the answer
for the world's craving for truly great
coffee we are based in San Francisco
with our engineering team in Hong Kong
Science Park where we have received a
ton of support from the Hong Kong
government we have experts on the board
to make sure that we comply with all the
safety requirements our manufacturing
partners are ready to get to work we
