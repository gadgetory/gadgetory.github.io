and rugby player I created viral mostly
out of necessity bumps bruises strains
and lactic acid buildup are just part of
living an active lifestyle there are a
lot of other products out there to help
roll out the larger extremities of your
body but getting on the ground and
rolling around as a hassle until now
there really hasn't been anything to
target the smaller extremities of your
body and that you can use with just one
hand
now I knew I wanted something durable
yet highly effective de target areas
like your forearms shins Achilles deep
knee area shoulders and net and we knew
we can accomplish that by force alone
which is why we added the three mode
vibration to vibro which is powered by a
lithium-ion rechargeable battery viral
is revolutionary because it is small
enough to throw in your gym bag or even
your desk at work yeah it is
scientifically engineered to be even
more effective than those large and
bulky rollers it also has
interchangeable wheels want to target a
large area and the other to target a
more direct specific area of your body
everybody deals with muscle or joint
pain in one way or another vibra was
created to target those areas that have
been ignored by all the other products
out there so everyone looking to zero in
on those tough to reach extremities with
high effectiveness and simplicity with a
tool that is small and compact please
back our patent-pending product viral
here on pitch levels
we are surrounded by technology it's
entering our homes and helping us
automate daily tasks but I find myself
thinking there has to be a more natural
and accessible way to control the
devices around us if the goal of
automation is to simplify our lives why
does it feel so complicated our goal is
a company is to solve this say hello to
naki naki is a small elegant device that
instantly transforms ordinary surfaces
in your environment and to remote
controls using naki couldn't be easier
simply take it out of the box pick a
place to put it select a surface to
attach it to and then define all the
things you like Nike to do naki can
control a wide variety of devices around
us but the true beauty of our technology
is that what it can do is only limited
by your imagination
put one in your living room or the
kitchen or even your bedroom I mean
imagine rolling over in the morning and
tapping a simple pattern anywhere on
your nightstand to snooze your alarm and
start the coffee maker without even
opening your eyes you just bought 10
more minutes in bed and you'll
definitely want to put one in your kids
bedroom it's exciting to think of how
naki will spark their imagination as
they figure out all kinds of ways to use
it using Wi-Fi which is proven to be far
more reliable and what better reach than
bluetooth you can enjoy using naki from
anywhere the number of devices and
software that knock the interact with is
rapidly growing every day it currently
includes nest Phillips you lifx smart
things ifttt and more but even if you're
new to the smart technology world you
can still use naki for simple functions
around your home
other technologies the rely on sound or
voice control can be unreliable and
confusing to use they can be triggered
accidentally and don't always work as
expected our patent-pending technology
uses non acoustic sensors it's able to
distinguish deliberate tap or knock
patterns from random vibrations in the
environment the beauty of our product is
that it makes any regular environment
into a user interface think about the
surfaces around you so many of them
serve one or two purposes add an aki to
them and you instantly have a hub for
automation we carefully chose every
material and finish Funaki we've gone
through series of different tests and
prototypes to make sure that naki blends
in in your environment and also looks
beautiful on your surfaces we're doing
our first production runs here in the
USA because it's important for our
entire team to be there on the ground
floor ensuring that we're manufacturing
the best possible product it's not some
far-fetched idea we have finalized our
designs we have beautiful working
prototype and we need to raise funds to
actually get it in a production and
immediately start shipping them to your
door we couldn't be more excited about
how this product is going to change
lives and bring joy to people everywhere
naki accomplishes what technology is
supposed to do instead of taking over
our life it enhances it allowing you to
put more thought and effort into the
things that really matter
tap into the world around you with the
magic of naki

simple perfect solution to clean the

I'm flash for iphone in all these years
of taking smartphone photos we've been
missing a crucial element to capture an
incredible photos that's lighting xenon
flash is the industry standard for
professional photographers smartphones
come with a standard LED because they're
cheaper to produce and they consume much
less battery but a xenon flash is up to
1,000 times brighter than the standard
LED flash that comes on the iPhone low
light images on a smartphone produce a
lot of noise and a lot of grain xenon
flash virtually eliminates all the noise
and grain and even motion blur from the
photos that you take we've designed the
flash shell to be able to clamp directly
onto the phone with or without a case or
you can thread it onto any standard
photography gear with a quarter inch
thread this includes tripods
articulating arms and any other
photography gear like that this
flexibility allows you to get creative
with where and how you set up your light
in xenon flashes are famous for their
ability to freeze a moment and to
prevent blur the flash shell is
controlled through an app that allows
you to use the front or rear camera it
also allows you to determine how strong
the burst of flash needs to be for your
specific shot you can get between 200 to
400 flashes on a single charge and it
only takes just over an hour using a
micro USB to charge this we've spent a
considerable amount of time and energy
and resources into research engineering
prototyping tooling and everything to
get to where we are with a flash shell
but we need your help to take the flash
shell from the stage of development it's
a full mass production a $55 pledge will
include the flash shell and the free app
for your iPhone or iPad
aside from the standard $55 pledge we're
also offering three bundle pledges the
bronze pledge includes the flash shell
and our smartflex flexible leg tripod
this will allow you to get very creative
with your lighting since you have the
ability to attach the flash shell to the
flexible legs and then wrap the flexible
legs around virtually any surface the
silver pledge includes both of the
bronze items plus our Bluetooth pocket
shutter remote that can activate the
flash and the shutter from up to 40 feet
away again increasing your ability to
get creative with the shots that you
take the gold pledge includes the flash
shell the smart flex tripod the shutter
remote and our mini standard sized
tripod that you can use for your
smartphone for the flash giving you
essentially everything you need to go
out and make the most of your smartphone
