and it runs out of juice
this is preserve the world's most
energy-efficient mobile phone charger
and power bank combined the way it works
is amazingly simple you connect your USB
cable to preserve when charging once
your mobile is fully charged the
electricity stops going to the phone and
starts preserving the energy in the
power bank magic preserve is not just a
power bank but also has a removable
battery that fits nicely into any wallet
it will give you an extra 30% juice when
you need it most
this feature makes preserve the first
power bank in the world that can be used

more charge than they actually need a
practice that is extremely inconvenient

time and increase the efficiency and
longevity of your phone hi
I'm have done a year ago we started off

music reproduction has progressively
evolved from vinyl the tape to CD and to
the popular mp3 unfortunately sound
quality is fallen while you can bring
mp3 files everywhere quality is
compromised in favor of a portable music
library fortunately due to innovations
in digital technology today we can now
listen to high-quality music tracks on
the go so what is high resolution or
high res audio when music in its
original recorded format gets converted
into mp3 format large amounts of
information gets lost in the compression
process compared to mp3 and CD high res
audio formats such as WAV FLAC and DSD
packs so much more information and music
data into each second leaving little to
compromise with high res audio you can
hear and discover subtle details and
nuances within the music and feel the
same way you would if you are actually
at the recording studio or live
performance
it is truly music as the artist intended

professionals of the 82 90s the pager

Bluetooth wearable you've been waiting

the pager of the future
we introduced to you the you old watch
we rely heavily on technology to keep us
connected and productive in our daily
lives and a dead phone battery could be
costly
the you volt watch is our way of solving
this problem in a way that also helps
preserve the environment the watch is
equipped with a solar panel that
possibly captures energy from the Sun
that energy is then stored inside a
removable compact power reserve under
ideal light conditions watch's power
reserve could reach its full capacity
within a day
low battery just pull out the power
reserve from the watch and start
charging your mobile device we are also
including a wireless charging dock if
you need to start your day with a full
charge simply place the watch on the
dock and it will fully charge in under
45 minutes to save energy
the dock only uses power when a device
is placed on it and automatically turns
off when it reaches full charge our aim
with the you volt watch was to create a
simple yet highly functional object it's
minimal lines and analog interface makes
it an easy fit for any wardrobe it is
meant to be a comfortable and personal
everyday companion that supports our
values as well as our mobile lives we
chose a mechanical watch instead of
digital because it would draw less power
while providing precise time the watch
hands have a minimal width to maximize
the performance of the solar panel which
covers the entire face of the watch it
is also covered with a thin sheet of
anti reflective mineral glass to further
enhance the solar capacity the power
reserve combines a custom circuit that
handles the electrical flow of the watch
with a high density lithium ion battery
the reserve has an integrated Lightning
port for Apple devices or microUSB B and
C for Android devices it could even go
entirely aquire this
the charging wire stays inside the power
reserve so it's virtually impossible to
forget or lose it at the bottom sits the
wireless receiver for inductive charging
through the included dock
it all fits in a durable aluminum body
and on top of that we filled the band
with batteries to add more capacity
allowing a second charge after the power
reserve has been used to achieve this
addition we developed the custom hinge
that lets current go back and forth
within the body of the you've old watch
today we need your support to bring this
project to life and together step into a
sustainable and accessible future
