tickled some are abused some are dressed
up and some are kiss but none come to
life until now introducing the
levitating cup the world's first
gravity-defying drinkware
alright that's a wrap
from a very young age I got interested
in plants my dad was a botanist so he
wrote a lot about plants and worked in a
botanical garden and as a kid I would
look at plants in and see them as like
many universes and there's so much we
don't know about plants about a year ago
I began exploring these concepts of
levitating plants and what's so cool
about magnetism is his force that we we
can't see but we can feel we're
levitating the plant from the ground in
midair and rotating so that it gets
sunlight from all different directions
the idea of a plant not needing soil to
grow really fascinates me and that's
when I got interested in air plants air
plants are plants that grow from the air
they don't require any soil they they
literally take particles from the air
and get nutrients from them I wanted to
create an experience for people in their
homes where they can enjoy plants but in
a new way house plants don't always have
to be the same what happens if I
levitate this plan in the air will it
grow differently will grow more who
knows maybe we're going to discover a
new way of growing plants
our hands move which is why a static
stationary wrist support can only get in
the way and cause more problems than it
solves but what if wrist support was
like a cat that could chase down the
computer mouse touchpad or keyboard what
if it was so evolved that it moves just
like we do freeing us to make all of
those keystrokes gestures motions and
movements while providing the comfort
and support we need to protect our
wrists well this is exactly what we've
done and after two years and more than
100 prototypes we've developed the
ultimate wrist support for all computer
users especially coders gamers designers
and office workers who spend all day
with their hand attached to a mouse
touchpad or keyboard and it's called
Ristic at the first and only wrist
support with magnetic levitation
suspending your hand with a therapeutic
magnetic barrier that eliminates
friction and resistance while absorbing
the repetitive stress that can harm your
wrist wrist ekkada navels fluid cat-like
movement across your entire desktop
while keeping your wrist straight and
resting comfortably and a specially
designed support cradle that continually
flexes adapts and conforms to gently
support your every movement so whether
you click a mouse tap a keyboard gesture
on a touchpad or spend time gaming wrist
account was created to be your hands
best friend
rishta cats ready for production with
everything in place to begin
manufacturing right here in the USA the
only thing standing between arista cat
and your desktop are the substantial
production costs and include tooling
manufacturing and materials so that we
can make Ristic at affordable for
everyone we need your help to reach our
funding goal and spreading the word on
social media about our mission to
reinvent Chris support with the rishta
kap hittin our stretch goals will open
up color options and other incentives
but the true reward will come the first
time you slip your hand into the
comfortable therapeutic embrace of the
rishta cat and feel exactly why it's
your hands best friend we've put a lot
of time and energy passion and
dedication into making Ristic at the
ultimate wrist support for all computer
users we wanted to be the best wrist
support ever made but we can't do it
without your help thanks for supporting
our campaign by letting rishta cat
support you
you
art laser mode we
designing and building unique next
devices for many years about three years
ago I had an idea that led to our
craziest project yet suspending a fully
functional lexie clock in midair
powering few LEDs are a single small
nixie tube fire induction coils is
trivial but could it power an entire
clock with a lot of work and a few
prototypes I managed to make my idea a
reality we present our levitated
wirelessly powered necks o'clock
[Laughter]
it has all features you'd expect find in
a typical gravity vault clock which with
all the wires</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
