construction works requires a huge
footer roll first the footer is inserted
from a side of the mending machine the

footer they cut it out and carry the
pole of v-shape footer to the next
machine that helps to curve the beep
hole

curve you require this scientifically
design profile is ready to shape any

furniture horn Bock we initiate with
building a tough base trace the location
we need to dig the depth needs to be at
least 1 foot drill and make 2 holes to
insert a screw that will hold and bear
the entire weight fill the holes with
cement before inserting the screws cut a
one side iron wire and frame it with two
iron poles
now as we have done with the other side
of the fence we can fill the remaining
part of the pit with cement
for some small particles of sand and
rock so the land has the natural look
fill the empty place between both sides
with small and medium rocks also fix
both frames applying iron clips now flow
water over the rocks and still find an
empty place at the bottom of the fence
you can put some rock there too there is
your beautiful fence it's for viewing
