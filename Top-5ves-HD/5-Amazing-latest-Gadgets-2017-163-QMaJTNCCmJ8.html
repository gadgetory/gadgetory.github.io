prior code new bar is compatible with
Windows Mac OS and Linux and it can be
programmed with the Arduino software and
processing IDE users will easily adapt
to the artificial intelligence robot
regardless of their level of experience
both new liners and experienced
programmers will start controlling Nova
by coding in just a couple of hours
tutorials and educational guides are
provided through culture to make users
experience smoother and more fun a screa
code our aim is to bridge the gap
between hardware and software education
prior to getting into coding we want our
users to understand the working
principles and hardware fundamentals of
a device by building it a good balance
between hardware and software knowledge
provides a comprehensive understanding
about devices and Nova has been
developed with this ideology in my
prayer code mini mega development board
is fully compatible with the Arduino
software and offers the same technical
specs as an Arduino mega with the
advantage of being extremely compact
nova is an entertaining and easy way to
learn for new beginners and an
unrestricted way to exercise their
knowledge border prize
vortex is the first environmental
simulator for all your favorite PC games
videos and VR imagine feeling the heat
of a flamethrower when you're playing
battlefield one got a great since the
heat it's interesting cuz immediately
makes you sweat so it's really quick to
immerse you into it I know what an
explosion is gonna happen I'm gonna feel
the flame so I'm already scared about it
happening but it makes the world more
tangible whatever I'm watching you're
playing like it actually makes me more
fearful this is like the flame that's
gonna hurt me and it's missing through
our hardware and software the vortex
system is able to respond to any kind of
stimulus on demand I'd say the coolest
thing is how fast it can switch between
temperatures so like watching the shadow
mode or and that ice a part of the scene
is which it's like the fire it kept
switching else like buckets it's
actually really cool so what's exciting
about vortexes we're taking a large
amount of input data in audio-visual
format and we get to turn that
information into usable feedback that
creates an elevated level of immersion
for the users it kind of caught me off
guard after we started putting some of
this work into play because the unit was
a blast to use it was genuinely fun and
it is it makes almost every piece of
content that you consume better it's
just a whole lot of fun oh my god you
feel like you're in the environment that
you're watching the plane the vortex
enables you to understand the atmosphere
at another level it gives you more sense
and more attachment to what you're doing
seeing people having to face light up
when they have that experience for the
first time is like everything personal
satisfaction of that is just
amazing we know there's a huge void in
traditional gaming and video that's why
we started whirlwind FX we want to get
it into your hands the content creators
the gamers VR enthusiasts action lovers
now with your support we want to breathe
life into your entertainment experience
feeling is believing live the action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
