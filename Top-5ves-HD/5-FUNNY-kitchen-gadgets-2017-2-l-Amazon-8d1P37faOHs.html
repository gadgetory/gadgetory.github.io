boom squirt isn't just a spoon it's a
revelation with its simple easy to clean
two-piece design you just unscrew the
base of squirt fill it with up to three
ounces of your baby's favorite food then
screw the spoon back on and you're ready
to go squirt dispenses food into the
spoon for perfect bite sized portions as
you gently squeeze its sides making four
happy parents and babies because feeding
time should be simple and if there's
still food left over after feeding time
squirt comes with a cap that clips onto
the spoon so you can store it for later
or take it on the go without worrying
about the mess
you
have you ever thought of how coffee was
discolored here is the story that is by
creation of our product this origin goes
way way back in the history once upon a
time there was a man who owned some
goats
well lots of goats his goat stumbled
upon a bush of pretty red berries ate
them and then went bonkers that man can
come up with the idea of brewing the
berries which resulted in a rich
chocolate colored beverage that made him
feel out of this world this story and
dedication to coffee brought us together
to design something special the goat man
it's amazing in all aspect how it looks
how you carried and how your assembly
it's also sustainable bpa-free and 100%
legal
the goat math is so special and so
different that we need your support to
make it come alive if you love the goat
story - we would be more than happy if
you share it among your friends we only
have one chance so support us and get
your own goat
you
sorry do you mind if I grab some of this
out of here real quick I just want to
grab a hit I just want to grab some of
them no just this so I just grabbed some
boy fertilizer out of this thing and now
I'm actually gonna eat a chicken wing
but I'm not gonna wash my hands I'm just
gonna eat a chicken wing I have on my
hand
most people don't wash your hands when
they eat I'm meeting a chicken wing and
just touch renewer now most people do
not wash their hands this is what you
can do with trunks
what's a trunk it's a cross between a
tripod Tom so it stands up it can help
you grip things all kinds of things
including food things who thinks for
which there were no good you tent so it
till utensil yes why don't you just say
so the trunk is a completely new type of
utensil invented by these guys
forefinger fourth of Iong
Fork forsaken foo you with the f-bombs
like buffalo wings and barbecue ribs
Trump's teeth tear wings apart and they
rip ribs right off the rack songs are
like chopsticks on steroids okay okay I
get it but I like getting my fingers
dirty no you don't that's the Stockholm
Syndrome talking got a grip if you
really like getting your fingers dirty
then why do you go through like a
bazillion napkin whoa that's a lot and
why don't you eat steak with your
fingers no I'm sorry that's okay people
gave this guy a hard time too when he
introduced the fork to England in 1611
it wasn't that long ago before that we
ate everything with our hands but as we
grew gray matter and became more
civilized we invented tools for being
more efficient but wouldn't it be more
efficient to pick up a steak or most
food for that matter yes if you just
consider the act of bringing food to
your facehole but if you consider the
entire real-life eating process which
includes touching other things like your
glass and utensils are the way to go now
the stakes are even higher not those
digs it's your computer and your tablet
and your phone all these things need
your fingers at the ready
we're trongs invented by my wireless
service to get me to use more data
plausible but now trongs are all about
finger free here's how they work using
these three fingers you grip the finger
channels that are flexed open then pick
them up then you pinch your food and you
move your food then you stay
trongs up then you could do something
else like feed your phone or answer the
baby change the channel
take a drink shake hands trongs is just
an interface between you and your food a
first order interface no new angles off
your hand like other utensil that's why
it's patented trials are going to be
huge cuz they'll be used all around the
world
warding the spread of anything from
general inconvenience to deadly viruses
and countless other nasty hand born
illnesses that's a whole lot of human
productivity thirty Seconds here plus
six days there and a whole lot of people
who goals wrongs are great and that's a
lot less napkins and head washing you
just wash the trunk when you're totally
done because they're reusable and the
trunk is not just for eating trongs up
perfect for writing chicken cutlet I
used to use a fork get the fork out of
here now you just grip it dip it flip it
and the best part is your fingers say
clean well I get the benefits of keeping
my fingers clean the window just use a
glove well for one you would have to
take the glove off to touch other things
like your phone or your glass and gloves
require another hand to put on that's
the simple brilliance of trongs you can
pick them up and put them down with one
hand and one-size-fits Nega nine point
nine nine nine percent you know how to
use trung's just by looking at them
they're so intuitive and super durable
use them for years and years they nest
into each other so they take up less
space at the table and in your drawer
and in shipping lower carbon hand brands
now we need to get trongs out into the
world by we we mean the big we all of us
on this site smart or we're thinking
make the world better one tweak at a
time as fast as possible kind of people
life is short fund a project that you
could see all over the world the rest of
your life you know when I was your age
we didn't even have trunks
dude that was only like six years ago
I give my wings back let me take one of
them the trogs project is not the next
time the sky years away if we're lucky
kind of thing it's a very simple
low-hanging for which totally doable
you'll soon
so far we've identified the problem
designed refined researched and patented
a great solution so please help us
really get trogs off the ground well I
hope you enjoyed watching this video we
had a lot of fun making it this is your
opportunity to be part of something huge
so fun finger freedom now and feel the
future faster thank you you're welcome
no not you think down oh thank you let's
go build these things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
