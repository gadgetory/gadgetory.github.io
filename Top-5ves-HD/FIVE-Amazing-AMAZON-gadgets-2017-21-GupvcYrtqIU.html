can send a picture instantly to anyone
in the world we can't come up with a
solution to help people who are not
getting a good enough night's sleep if
you have ever struggled with sleep you
know the negative impacts it has this is
why we invented the sleep Shepard simply
put the sleep Shepard works by slowing
down your brain rate until you fall
asleep
it takes advantage of engineered tones
called binaural beats that have been
proven to have a direct impact on your
brain rate because the sleep Shepard
monitors every aspect of your sleep
you'll be able to see exactly how it's
putting your brain to sleep and what
kind of sleep you're in throughout the
night for the first time we have a real
solution for sleep we think that's
something to get excited about since

MIT scratch you can give the robot a
series of commands then immediately say
the magic happen
this provides a safe and easy
introduction to the language and mindset
of computer programmers in free play
mode you can just start playing every

what's up guys this is the miniature a
Miam tool pen this has 16 different bits
that it comes with and it replaces that
drawer that's just packed with tools and
screwdrivers and different bits and
things like that and it all comes in
this really nice package here we have
actually have the pen which holds I
believe six different tools we have one
two three four five and then the end one
is six and what's really nice is they
have a window here you can see which bit
you have and you just pop it out like
that and they go in through the back and
what's nice about this is that it won't
it doesn't go back down that way so you
can of course apply pressure and things
like that
now the bits that are included we have
everything from Phillips to flathead
metric hex Square and star bits the pen
itself is made from a high-grade
aluminum
magnet does not stick to it and the bits
I'm not sure exactly what they're made
out but they seem very good quality and
it's just really it's a really neat pen
that you know obviously it's going to
replace a huge footprint that you might
have in your drawer already but there
you go definitely some cool gear here
