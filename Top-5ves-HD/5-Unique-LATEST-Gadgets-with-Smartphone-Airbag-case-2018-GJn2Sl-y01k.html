standard boring charging cable as we all
know bending is breaking bending while
lounging docked in the car on the move
or in tight spaces plus they're slow
charging unattractive and tangly
the reign of this outdated overused
cable is over meet USB 93 it doesn't
Bend it rotates making it the world's
first unbreakable fully flexible cable
USB 93 is the only USB cable with
90-degree rotation and three directions
with USB 93 is innovative design you get
straight and l-shaped functionality in
one cable more savings less cables now
you can use your devices worryfree in
all situations the USB 93 uses nylon
braiding so you've got a tangle free
experience giving you more time to
untangle things that really matter it
uses premium fabric wire that is durable
and flexible plus it manages to fit into
tight spaces and is fashionable at the
same time they also come in stunning
color options to fit your style we have
a working prototype and need your help
to bring USB 93 the world's first
unbreakable and truly flexible cable to
you the drink induction chiller no
longer will we have to deal with melted
ice and lukewarm soda let me introduce
you to my one-of-a-kind patent pending
invention I wanted to build something
that was incredibly simple but something
extraordinarily good at its task it
needed to fit on a desk and look modern
on a nightstand it doesn't stand out it
doesn't connect to your phone or collect
your data
it makes your drink cold and it keeps it
gold will it change your life
probably not but is it worth the small
investment to have a refreshing cold
glass of water in your nightstand every
morning and to not have to dump out ice
drinks I think so glass cup can of soda
or nice coffee no matter what you drink
this can keep it cold
we custom-designed all our prototypes
from the ground up to get to unit that I
felt comfortable leaving in my bedroom
we decided to use thermoelectric cooling
a proven technology that requires
minimum moving parts while producing a
high output freezer today we have a
final product and and begun the
tooling and manufacturing process by
supporting this campaign you aren't
buying an unfinished prototype hoping
it'll become reality in a few years time
this is a real product that will be
manufactured by top-notch suppliers so
that we can get it delivered to you as
soon as possible
cut okay we need to be precise Oh miss
the moments within the choreography what
can we do different to make this work we
need to rethink how we're gonna shoot
all these action scenes see that yeah
yeah yeah okay
hi this might work okay places everyone
c14 success
and cut Wow fantastic all right

smartest self monitoring installing

adapts to it it even knows when you're
sleeping or awake if you're home or away

Alexa or any other existing system you

habits and provide the highest level of
home monitoring now can Fido do that and
installation is easy simply peel and
stick the alarm monitors to whichever
portion of your house you'd like monitor

trusted third party like family and
friends notifications in case there's
trouble yeah mom you know just burned a
bagel that's all
