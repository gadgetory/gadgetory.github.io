wrench in their toolbox now rigid is
proud to introduce the next generation
of this iconic tool the innovative new
rigid telescoping basin wrench puts
every job within easy reach no more
crazy contortions to see a faucet
fitting or a retaining knife or
stumbling and fumbling to see what
you're doing the rigid model 2017 is the
first basin wrench to provide you with
light exactly where you need it thanks
to its integrated water-resistant LED
light the light also has an automatic
shutoff timer to conserve the batteries
when not in use the 180 degree pivoting
t-handle makes positioning easier in
tight spaces the removable t-handle can
be detached to expose a standard 3/8
inch square drive connection which lets
you use a ratchet or breaker bar for
additional leverage and maximum torque
on those hard to loosen nuts the
ergonomic textured handle increases
leverage and improves grip compared to
the standard square metal you are used
to gripping our new body design and
spring-loaded push buttons enable
effortless telescoping from 10 to 17
inches and the wrenches improve jaw
spring significantly extends the life of
your tool
this wrench is designed for fast
one-handed performance on small to
medium diameter pipes from 5/8 to
one-and-a-half inches the quick self
adjusting head instantly grabs and
releases pipes simply position the
wrench around the material press the
head forward or pull up the jaw to
release and re-engage if anyone knows a
thing or two about wrenches its crescent
gripping and slipping are the biggest
issues with quick adjusting pipe
wrenches to overcome this we developed a
unique angled tooth design that allows
the jaws to bite deeper and hold tight
under heavy torque the Crescent 12-inch
self adjusting wrench works on almost
all common pipe including black iron
galvanized PVC and copper and is a
convenient fast ratcheting tool for
tightening and loosening nuts bolts and
couplings a black oxide finish resists
corrosion and a dual material grip
provides added comfort and durability
this wrench works where other wrenches
won't fit with an exceptionally slim
profile design the Crescent 12-inch self
adjusting wrench is the tool for tight
spaces and awkward angles
combine that with its one-handed
operation and lighter weight than
standard pipe wrenches and this becomes
an incredibly useful tool contractors
and plumbers can take anywhere and use
all day long thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
