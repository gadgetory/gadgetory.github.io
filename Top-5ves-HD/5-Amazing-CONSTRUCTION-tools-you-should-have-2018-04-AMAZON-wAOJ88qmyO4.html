lock was born by asking real pros out on
job sites what they didn't like about
the current high chairs they've been
using and what they would like to see
changed we then solved those problems by
developing prologue prologue high chairs
work on rebar and remesh so that no
matter what the requirements are for
your job we've got the support you need
with a complete line that is d-o-t
approved and also contributes to earning
your lead points our patented locking
head means that you don't have to use
tie wire or bar ties to secure rebar to
the chair it locks in automatically the
head posts are tilted inwards with hard
plastic nubs to generate additional
pressure around the bar and aggressively
grab the rebar so if you adjust your
rebar the prologue chairs move with it
not only do prologue chairs lock in
rebar but they also have a dedicated
secondary hole designed to lock in mesh
as well the structural eye beam design
and oversight based maximizes strength
and stability the prologue chairs are
also specially designed to snap into
place when you stack them on top of each
other no matter how many layers of rebar
you're setting you can be confident that
these chairs will be standing tall

and your time imagine the hours you save
on every project if you didn't have to
tie all your rebar prolog high chairs
Eyebeam structure and specially designed
faces produce a more simplified flow for
the concrete versus other bulky designs

especially important when working on
