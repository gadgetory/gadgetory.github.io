or not it's still a mess and a mess like
this can't be clean with just paper you
need water to get the job done right
whether you're cleaning your car or your
hands so why when it comes to that do we
use just toilet paper bathroom goers
meet your new best friend what oh sorry
Pete not you buddy bathroom doors meet
your new best friend the swash 1400 it's
a new seat for the toilet you already
have that will give your butt the royal
treatment it deserves with a heated seat
dual positionable stainless steel
nozzles adjustable warm water spray at
the touch of a button and a warm air
dryer your butt will think you've died
and gone
you get it so what's so great about bran
Del's new swash bidet seat it's simple
wash don't wipe it uses water to clean
the messes that can't be clean with just
paper he's always doing stuff like that
and with bran Del's bidet seat he can
because it has a citable lid you'd think
that'd be standard issue with bidet
toilet seats right wrong unlike most
bidet seat lids brondell supports a
person's weight meaning Pete can use it
however he wants another great feature
stainless-steel nozzles there
positionable because they got to hit you
in just the right spot and there's
self-sterilizing I mean they're washing
my butt they're washing Pete's but you
got to make sure those things are clean
man what's up Pete
or
oh yeah that's another feature of
rondelle's new seat it has a nightlight
did I mention Braun Dells new swash
bidet seat has customizable memory
settings that means I press one button
and get the seat temperature nozzle
position and water temperature I want I
don't have to remember anything because
my swash does it for me
are you kidding me
I think it's pretty clear now to
everyone that when it comes to this
stuff wash don't wipe if you're ready to
change the way you clean click the green
back this project button and pre-order

now along with us and dimensioning
features of the light app we give you
Pro app the fastest most affordable and
most portable way to scan pretty curves
and we're including five years pro for
free only on IndieGoGo my 3d peeps
this one is for you and I'm the founder
of dubs Labs in 2011 we introduced our
first product bed phones headphones
specifically designed for sleep and it
was a big success
enter bed foam bed folds you can play
music or any masking sounds we've spent
over six years refining the design of
bed phones to create the most
comfortable and adjustable headphones in
the world based on our patented bed
phones design we're here to introduce
versa fit incredibly thin lightweight
infinitely adjustable sweat proof
Wireless on ear headphones that allow
you to both hear your music and hear the
world around you
versa fit headphones are incredibly thin
less than a quarter inch thick this
allows you to listen to your music under
practically any helmet perfect for your
days out on the trails or the slope
so why would anyone want headphones that
allow them to hear their surroundings
they're safer and they're more social if
you are a runner or a cyclist out on the
streets versa fit allows you to hear
oncoming traffic such as that car that's
coming up behind you a skier or
snowboarder versa fit allows you to hear
others on the slopes to avoid collision
working out in the gym versa fit allows
you to talk to your workout buddies
without having to turn off your music or
take out an earpiece playing with
friends and don't want to stop your
music to talk to them versus if it
allows you to do that we're combining
the best design aspects of bed bones
with silicone ear pads sweat proofing
and Bluetooth connectivity for a wire
free workout versa fit headphones can
last up to 10 and a half hours on a
single charge enough for an entire
week's worth of workouts our custom 23
millimeter drivers have been retuned by
one of the best acoustical engineers in
the world to offer deep bass clear
treble and no sacrifice in sound quality
covered in silicone rubber Bursa fits
drivers like flat and snug against your
ears using infinitely adjustable memory
wire ear hooks ears come in all shapes
and sizes so our ear hooks can be
adjusted by hand to any ear and then
readjusted for perfect comfort without
falling off we finalized the design and
need funds for tooling and materials for
mass production please help us bring
versa fit to life so that you too can
listen to your music and hear the world
around you thank you so much for your
support
our robotic engineering student and a
commuter everyday I take the train going
to my University
it takes me one and a half hour of
walking every single day really too much
time I think a lot of you are in the
same situation and we all know that
commuting is both stressful and
time-consuming this made me think I'll
to move more quickly and with less
effort and if it's something portable
that I could carry on train and even in
class for this reason I created vault
there's more less and lightest electric
vehicle in the world vault is more than
just an electric board is the most
portable vehicle out there it's an
amazing mean of transport powerful
lightweight easy to use as marked as
more great revolution in the world of
mobility
both to let you save time on your daily
commute and three more for your favorite
activities it has a top speed of 21 km/h
and it's just as fast as a bicycle it
has a range of about 10 kilometers more
than what you need for the short daily
commute in the city with a length of 60
centimeters is the smallest electric
skateboard in the world and with a
weight of 4 kilograms is light enough to
be carried even when not in use with no
effort on your backpack or by hands to
build the balls I got help from my
father a photographer electronics
engineer and drones maker after one year
of prototyping and testing this is the
final version the battery and
electronics are embedded in the wooden
body he has a powerful motor of 2,000
watts of power and it can go up ill and
start from a full stop the inside
batteries are so powerful that can
recharge your devices on the go to the
built-in USB port you can even recharge
completely your iPhone up to 20 times
with the remote controller rising bolt
is easiest playing a video game
whoa I see thank you
well it's Italian design bold is both
modern and practical and it's deck is of
the right size for a comfortable and
safe ending it also has the brake to
stop safely you can think bought like a
compact longboard
he has larger track for more stability
he has bigger wheels to overcome every
obstacle on the street mode is marked
with bluetooth for connectivity we are
going to develop a smartphone app and
also integrate it with wearables Paul
has extremely low running cost and lets
you save money on fuel a complete
recharge for an entire year will be less
than five dollars on the bill and when
the Sun Goes Down turn on the lights and
continue to skate we believe that
everyone deserves a better way to move
we want to make both the most affordable
for anyone but to cut down cost we need
an economy of scale our manufacturers
are ready but now we need your help to
stop production applause that's why
