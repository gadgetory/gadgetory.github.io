Bavaro alias it's a quartz movement
watch with a stainless steel case it's
an emergency

cable for when you are with your friend
Oh at work
all where you are alone in the dark
forest and the dark force is following
you only else can see
and you can recharge different device

one flashlight with diffuse light on
dock
so what a quick way to measure stuff
what if you could measure anything just
by walking this is Moser one it can
measure as far as a 1,000 foot tape
measure measure through walls and
obstacles as if they weren't there
measure winding cable lines or tracks
measure angles and curves calculate the
area of a room volume for storage or a
shipping package get the right game
Klein for your decade more stairwell
photos find the right horizontal level
and distance for your poster frames
measure circular objects cylinders even
irregular shapes all with one hand just
need to move it from one point to the
other pin you're done other measuring
tools fail when there's too much light
wrong surface or if the space prevents
them because it doesn't use lasers or a
camera Moser one isn't restricted by
light or space use it anywhere anytime
no matter the circumstance Moser one is
waterproof dustproof and shockproof
your recordings are immediately saved in
the app which is already being sold in
the App Store the app also turns your
phone into a rudimentary Moser device
and already has 70,000 downloads and a
solid 4 star rating from users so how
does it work
Moser one uses an advanced technology
called motion measuring motion measuring
is the same technology used in rocket
guidance systems to accurately track the
movement and locations of Rockets in 3d
space using gyros accelerometers and
magnetometers Moser one plot is
three-dimensional position in any space
to measure distance angle level and much
more Moser is the first motion measure
device ever made for consumer use it
puts the same technology found in
rockets in the palm of your hand so what
are you waiting for back our campaign
now and step into the future of
measuring with Moser one
