hi I'm Ken and I'm the creator of the
tempest code I released the first
tempest code three years ago as an open
source project when I was looking for
ways to feel the tropical skies in my
debut life and ever since I received
overwhelming interest from people all
over the world I which is why we're
excited to announce our first campaign
to actually get the tempest crib into
your hands our team consists of
engineers and design is based in Tokyo
and we now have everything we need
other than the actual fun to get Jen
into mass production
I really need your help to get this
exciting new product into reality
so thank you very much for your support
hi I'm dr. diva Tommy and this is Lucy
the flagship member of our Salonika
family say hi Lucy at Salonika we
believe that if the sun is shining we
should never have to turn the lights on
day lighting is the illumination of
indoor spaces with natural light and we
want to invite you to join the day
lighting revolution Lucy lights up your
home or office with sunshine the first
ever of her kind
she's solar powered portable and Italian
designed this is how Lucy works place
Lucy in a sunny spot indoors or outdoors
point her towards the area you want to
illuminate and turn her on
Lucy will do the rest she will find and
track the Sun for you and redirect that
sunlight back inside turn off the lights
and turn on Lucy Lucy is also earth
conscious powered by solar cells she
never needs to be plugged in and think
of how much you can save by turning off
the lights for half of your day last but
not least Lucy has been built to be
beautiful Italian designed through and
through Lucy will never look out of
place in your home or office
besides the magic of day lighting made
simple what else makes Lucy special in
one word sunshine Wow whoa this is an
entirely different room right now I
completely changed the actual house
itself I can read you can actually see
the color of that wall which you
couldn't do before
Lucy is no longer just an idea born from
the dark corners of my office at
Cambridge our engineering team has
already gone through multiple designs of
Lucy and we have a fully working
prototype the one that you see in this
video we have also started testing Lucy
in the field with our better tester
community and Telemachus head of
manufacturing is already hard at work
with a top-three massive
sure to bring Lucy to market that's why
we've come to IndieGoGo we're so excited
about bringing Lucy and all the benefits
of the sunshine she provides in indoor
spaces everywhere we really hope that
you will love lucy as much as we do and
want to join the daylighting revolution
you can click over here to make a pledge
or scroll down to learn more thanks so
much for listening and let the Sun Shine
in as most parents would agree
monitoring a child's fever using a
traditional thermometer can be a very
laborious process check my temp a
wearable thermometer is an entirely new
way to monitor fever check my temp is
simply worn as an armband it records
temperature accurately and continuously
and sends the data directly to your
smartphone or tablet it uses our
patent-pending multi temp technology
sensors embedded in the device reeve not
only body temperature but also the
outside temperature in addition it has
an accelerometer to track body movements
so check my temp can tell you when your
child is awake or if they've fallen out
of bed your child can get a full night
of much-needed sleep when sick and you
can monitor their symptoms wherever you
are
weather in the next room or from your
desk at work the free app allows you to
set thresholds so you can be alerted
when the body temperature runs too high
or too low you can securely share the
data collected with your pediatrician
and family members you can also create
or join local groups to connect with
others and receive local health alerts
with its embedded sensors collecting
over thirty data points every 30 seconds
check my temp is simply the world's most
advanced thermometer
you
isn't it weird that we still use these
fiddly old keys to secure our homes we
at bold are all about making your life
easier and safer we are proud to
introduce our first product the ball
smart to begin with the lock is keyless
your phone is the key that you can leave
it in your pocket the lock senses you
are approaching the door and activates
itself you can simply walk in locking up
just as easy with a bold app you can
invite anybody and decide exactly when
they have accessed close friends and
family permanent access housekeeper
every Thursday more
Airbnb guests this weekend everybody
else no access talking about security
did you know that the weakest part of
the door is actually the cylinder lock
we redesigned it from scratch and
amended a new construction
making it super secure on digital
security we work with a specialized
company to ensure the highest level of
security in the industry the bold smart
lock installed just like a regular
cylinder lock unscrew the retaining bolt
slide out the old cylinder slide the
smartlock in and place the outside knob
on them now except the lock in the app
and you're done the lock has elegant
minimalistic design because we believe
it just has to look good on every door
you could put a knob of your own choice
on the outside or even get rid of the
handle do you need a smartphone not
necessarily we've included a remote as a
backup or for your kids electronic locks
have been around in professional spaces
like airports and hospitals for decades
but they use a better system we bring
the same technology to your house or
office but without the hassle but
entering and locking your home has never
been so simple and secure as with a bold
smart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
