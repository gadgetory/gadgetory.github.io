art has the ability to change the
feeling of any room digital art
specifically has the ability to bring
life and movement into a room it can
change that feel many times over with
the push of a button blacktops mission
is to make art accessible into that and
we've created a distribution platform
for digital art blocked up jets - the
future of digital art is now and they
have created this platform that allows
for the circulation of art to extend
outside of just the white box makes it a
lot more accessible to a lot more people
digital art is traditionally very
difficult to collect it used to be we'd
sell something and they'd get a DVD and
then it changed to a USB Drive and so
now having this universal system is
fantastic Samsung makes black does
vision to bring digital art to living
rooms and commercial interiors a reality
well one thing that I find so exciting
being both an art lover and a
restaurateur is the ability to really
bring the gallery experience into my
restaurant the ambiance of a Cho and
Dumbo is engineered to reflect the
contemporary arts culture of Mexico the
digital canvas allows our artwork to
change as our tastes might the black
dove digital canvas is the best solution
for me to share digital earth this being
an old house I like to contradict that
by having more contemporary works in the
space and I think there's nothing more
contemporary and new than digital art
one of the reasons I think the black
platform is going to be so quickly
adopted is because of ease of use
whether I'm here alone or if I'm hosting
guests at my house I'm able to change
the entire feel of the room with the
push of a button using
the platform the collaboration between
black dove and Samsung creates a
standardized platform it's a great
platform because you can see they are
the way that the artist had intended and
that's really fantastic we want people
to be able to share artists and artwork
like people are sharing other things
like music or photos it's now possible
to do this through the black dove app
we've seen in television in movies and
music that they have embraced the 21st
century and now we're finally at a time
where visual artists and the visual arts
also has that opportunity with a
platform like Black deaf where they can
reach a global audience where it can be
shared it can get art out there into
more of the public realm and just become
a lot more accessible I think it's a
wonderful thing
