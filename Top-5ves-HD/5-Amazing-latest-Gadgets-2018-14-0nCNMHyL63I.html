of Seoul had a worst air quality in the
world areal stayed inside where
sometimes the air was even worse my team
was already working on probable indoor
air quality monitor but this inspired us
to make one that's even better that's
how I created Piko Piko combines
numerous sensors into one tiny I mean
really tiny packs that attaches to your
smartphone it includes your laser based
particle sensors for measuring cancer
closing p.m. 10:00 and PM 2.5 find us
sensors for carbon dioxide and VOCs on
hygrometer for measuring humidity we
even threw in a thermometer for to
measure we made it our smartphone
connected device so you can measure and
track everything through the app because
is almost ready for mass production we
have fully tested our prototype with
have front and an institute of
technology with finalized design and we
lined up great factory now we just need
heard from in the global trackers like
you to help us bring people to the world
oh yeah if you curious about our
technology we have details on everything
on our IndieGoGo page
we live in a world of invisible beauty
electronics are everywhere
a mysterious life is hiding inside these
black boxes party machine sheds light on
it more than a book
poppy machine is a series of six
experiences where electricity paper play
and graphics meet to unveil the
invisible aesthetics of electronics it
all starts with paper you will get it
fold it assemble it draw on it build
with it and above all you will play with
it printed with silver ink its
possibilities are extended while
beautiful this special ink also conducts
electricity with web the machine you
will bring failure to life you will play
music mini girl challenge gravity you
will create a whole family of toys with
a simple button cell a sound component a
mobile role and your pencil Hey
we are puppy machine from Paris this is
me onions on your right and these are
her fail and mayo both designers running
their own studio we've been working on
patty machine for almost three years now
intrigued by those black boxes around us
we started exploring our day to day
devices and we discovered an invisible
world made of materials graphics and
even smell circuits hide a surprising
narrative potential that we wanted to
make visible we studied a list of all
the existing components and try to
rebuild them ourselves MacGyver style
that's when we realized the potential of
combining paper with electronics
we learn about conductive ink we managed
to get some unmade experiments to master
it it meant testing testing testing and
testing we know circuits in a functional
way in puppy machine we consider them as
any kind of print so we designed them
playing with colors and shapes our first
prototype of Pocky machine received the
red dot design award later on thanks to
the Audi tan in the world we had the
opportunity to exhibit that The Wizard
is a decorative in Paris
thus testing puppy machine's effect for
the first time with all your feedbacks
we went back to work to make this
project become a real product we made
choices to reach high quality
expectations paper binding colors
reliable partners everything had to be
perfect and in this really feasible and
here we are ready to produce on a large
scale the first volume of puppy machine
a series of six interactive experiences
to show electronics in a singular and
accessible way and because we believe in
learning to play puppy machine is
designed to stimulate your curiosity and
most of all for you to have fun
introducing the sim tech smart sensor
reinventing security for the things that
you care about it's a small light motion
detector that alerts you when someone
gets into your things every day millions
of guns and other valuables are
supposedly secured and things like
closets jewelry boxes gun safes and
storage units but who's watching your
stuff when you're not around and how do
you truly know it's safe every year up
to six hundred thousand guns are stolen
and many are used in suicide accidents
and crimes despite the growing
popularity of gun safes here are the
problems kernel arms are designed for
houses and not saves gun owners don't
want smart technology that could
restrict the use of their firearms I
decided to change that and that's why I
developed sim tech a simple and
effective way to monitor
any enclosed space like your gun safe
the moment your safe is opened Simtek
sends you a text alert over a cellular
connection which is more reliable than
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi it's an extra layer
of security for the things that you care
about it's sleek and portable and it
uses infrared motion and light so there
are no false positives a common problem
for other sensors the battery can last a
full year on a single charge and because
it uses cellular connection you can take
it anywhere in the world without
additional setup I created sim tech to
help people understand what's going on
with their guns and their valuables
someone close to me almost took their
life with a gun and as an alumni of
Virginia Tech I understand all too well
what can happen when guns get into the
wrong hands
my gun running friends tell me that
there's no easy way to reliably monitor
their saves but nobody wants a product
that could potentially restrict the use
of their guns and that's why I developed
sim tech a smart sensor that can be used
anywhere in anything to help keep you
and your things safe gun owners around
the country have been testing sim tech
and we've received great feedback
engineering and design are complete and
we're ready for mass production
so back us today and know when your
belongings are accessed wherever they're
stored
life is not measured by the number of
breaths we take but by the moments that
take our breath away
our team is dedicated to creating the
perfect gear for your biggest adventure
meet Ali light
360-degrees source of light and safety
we're taking it on a journey with you
its primary objective is to bring vision
emitting high luminescence made for the
most difficult journeys and crafted with
precision
unleash the power by the touch of a
button
the light placed economically in a
revolving manner around your waist makes
you visible and safe from every
direction no matter where you focus all
obstacles on the go are well illuminated
Alley light is uninviting
water-resistant and smart
in case of emergency beacon message
anyone you select
when you explore the magic of the world
alley light gives you freedom to get the
most out of it and brings you back home
