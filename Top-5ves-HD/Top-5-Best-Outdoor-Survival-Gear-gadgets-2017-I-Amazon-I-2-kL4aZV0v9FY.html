ledger conveniently bright today we're
going to be breaking down Rothko's water
bottle survival kit so let's uncap it
and suit we've gotten side first off the
compressed tab while measuring an inch
and a half by 3/8 inches compressed
opens up to eleven point eight by
nineteen point six inches we also have a
little sewing kit in there as well as an
existing rothko item the five and one
survival tool with the survival tool you
get a fire starter right here on the
side it's also a whistle and the cap is
a compass if you were to unscrew the cap
you would notice a capsule in there a
little waterproof area for storing small
items such as matches and inside of the
cap you'll find a signal mirror and no
survival kit would be complete without a
multi-tool so here we have a three
feature multi-tool with a file a small
knife good for cutting power cord or
rope and a pair of scissors and here we
have two band-aids pretty standard for a
survival kit as well as one of the most
vital pieces to a survival kit some
paracord this is 33 feet of the three
hundred and thirty pound paracord comes
in just about any color you want
as long as that color is black next up
we have a carabiner multi-tool not
designed for climbing but it is great
for strapping onto gear either to a
backpack or to your belt loop it has a
compass right on the side and at the top
of the carabiner you'll find an LED
flashlight the batteries are included
and although it is small it is also as
you can see very powerful we also have
an emergency blanket which will reflect
90% of body and the 50 by 80 emergency
poncho which is one size fits most
lastly we've got one more carabiner
again not for climbing and the 33 ounce
or a thousand milliliter water bottle so
head to rothko calm and find an
authorized dealer near you and comment
below and let us know what you think of

the ultimate outdoor survival tool
at Bushnell outdoors every product is
evaluated by one simple standard
performance is everything when it came
to designing the new powersync portable
power line
Bushnell worked tirelessly to build the
hardest-working line of portable solar
devices on the market
when it comes to collecting solar energy
it all begins with surface area the
larger the panel the more cells
available to collect energy from the Sun
you know unfortunately until now that's
left consumers with less than ideal
options like the rigid bulky solar
panels that are tough to pack into the
outdoors or those miniature panels they
just don't have the capture capacity
thanks to the new power sync product
from Bushnell outdoors that's all about
to change using the thin film solar
technology that's rollable or foldable
power sync gives consumers a portable
lightweight solar option that can be
quickly and easily deployed unlike the
crystalline style panels on the market
today power sync continues to collect
solar energy even when full sunlight
isn't available making it the most
versatile and efficient solar product on
the market and it gets even better an
integrated lithium-ion battery system
allows the power sync device to be
charged even before you depart for your
next adventure giving you your very own
portable power station right from the
moment you step off the grid and once
you've reached your destination it's
simple plug and play to recharge devices
thanks to a quick charge circuitry that
charges devices at the speed of a wall
charger and with its expansive solar
collection capacity it's easy to refuel
the power sync battery and ensure that
you'll always have power available when
you need it day or night when
performance is everything count on power
sync by Bushnell outdoors
power sing by Bushnell outdoors it's a
simple way to power your device off the
grid
