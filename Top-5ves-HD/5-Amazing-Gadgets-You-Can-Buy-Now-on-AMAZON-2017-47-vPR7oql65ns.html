from while we eat sold separately long
breaks included this is a core use it to
charge iPhones like this one cords are
frustrated they get tangled you can't
use them when you're on the move it's
time to cut the cord
enter Co battery Co battery is an iPhone
case with two swappable batteries one
put the case on your phone to pop the
battery in the case 3 live your life
while your other battery charges for
swap for a fully charged battery cell
phones are easy that means no more poems
that means no more sitting awkwardly in
the corner of a party waiting for your
furniture that means no more pulling the
cord too hard and accidentally hitting
someone in the face with your charger
that means 100% of the time so ditch the
cord get Co battery
to have the technology at our disposal
gives us more comfort and feel like
we're more controlling how to help our
children
I love the Nokia thermo it's super easy
to use it's just a quick little swipe
that makes it fun
they take the temperature almost every
day just for fun they like that it's
personalized it has their names on it we
put on Hari it says all right it's
almost like magic every time they use it
it just links right to my phone and it's
recorded if one of our children are
really sick and I have to take them in
to see a doctor we would have all that
information right on my phone right in
the app having the thermo will
definitely make it easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
