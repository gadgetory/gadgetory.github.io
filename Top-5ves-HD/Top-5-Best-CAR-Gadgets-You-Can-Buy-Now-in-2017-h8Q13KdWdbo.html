affordable car rack that easily fits on
most four-door cars for me it was the
perfect way to transport my skis on top
of my small sedan
unlike the hard plastic for typical roof
racks it's made from lightweight foam in
canvas but the design is durable it can
handle up to 165 pounds of whatever you
need to move the extra strength straps
span the roof weaving through 9
reinforced loops on the racks then
fastened securely inside the doors using
whichever loops you need you can
customize the racks to secure your cargo
it can secure things like skis a kayak a
ladder or even a surfboard when you're
done soft rack packs down completely
into a slim carrying case founder Connor
Mooney an avid skier and snowboarder was
tired of cramming equipment into the
backseat of his car instead of shelling
out hundreds of dollars for a roof rack
he designed the soft rack the weather
here in Minnesota can get aggressively
colder and recipe warm so we put
together our rack and we're excited that

to the snowboards paddle boards and
beyond with ease to set up you set down

per hour with whatever you're hauling

adventure or something practical soft
