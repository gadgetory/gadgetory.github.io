on the iPad we can draw write and share
our art with the world the pen is one of
the first tools we learn to use as a
child so creating with a pen is second
nature to us current smart pens on the
market are expensive this bothered us
for a very long time so we created the
sonar pen it's a smart and intuitive pen
that works on all iPads sold after 2010
and all for the price of five cups of
coffee the solar pen is a patent iPad
tool develop using minimal electronic
parts it's equipped with all the
features of a smart pen without the need
for batteries or bluetooth the
tangle-free cable simply plugs into the
earphone jack it creates a solid link
between your sonar pen and ipad let your
creative energy seamlessly flow from
your fingertips to your ipad cables come
in a range of colors for every style
we've made sure that the sonar pen is
one of the most socially responsible
smart pens on the market the only part
you will ever have to replace is a tiny
plastic tip the sonar pen is portable
and for our backers each pen comes with
a magnetic holder that attaches to your
iPad so you won't have to hunt for your
sonar pen in your bag we have spent two
years developing the technology and we
are very excited to get the Soner pen
into mass production by backing this
project your contributions will go to
the initial production costs
more importantly you're making content
creation more financially accessible for
the next generation of creatives let the
sonar pen be your companion on your
creative journey and share your
creations with the world hey everyone my
name is Luke and we are flex the team
behind the edge we have been immersed in
the swimming world for as long as you
can remember and credit the sport for
playing a huge role in who we are today
for the past two years we have dedicated
all of our time to developing a swimming
tracker that would change the way we
train something that would help us take
our performance to the next level shared
passion for the sport has brought us
together and now that passion has
allowed us to build an incredible team
of people committed to achieving the
same goal from a stellar team of
engineers
it's an incredible community of coaches
and swimmers our team understands your
needs the journey started with the idea
of seeing how technology could be
implemented into swimming we noticed
there was a lack of training tools in
swimming compared to other sports like
running and cycling so we asked
ourselves how can we use technology to
benefit swimming we spent thousands of
hours working with hundreds of athletes
and coaches collecting data to develop
and train our machine learning
algorithms the motivation behind the
edge is to make you a faster more
educated and efficient swimmer the edge
features a combination of tools designed
to improve your training and technique
you simply thread your goggle strap
through the edge press the button and
start your workout the edge tracks your
strokes distance
heart rate and understand sets to give
you a complete overview of your training
for real-time feedback you simply press
a button and the edge lets you feel your
heart rate
following your swim our cloud-based
algorithms
process your work out for review the
Flex app gives you insight on your
training presents your latest workout
and enables you to monitor your
long-term progress with goals and
workout history a flex app even offers
thousands of workouts designed for all
levels the product was developed with
the help of a larger swimming community
that we have cultivated through all of
our time in the pool we worked with
coaches and swimmers from various
segments of the sport ranging everywhere
from recreational and master swimmers
all the way to multi time Ironman
triathletes and Olympians
we saw this massive network as an asset
to the company so we collected feedback
from hundreds of swimmers to create a
product that we would personally use on
an everyday basis learning the needs of
all these segments was the most
important part of the project no matter
what you're training for we're counting
on you thanks for your support
you
you
imagine a healthy delicious gourmet
dinner cooked in your own kitchen from
scratch all with just the simple tap of
your finger some might describe it as

when you are imagine the freedom and
time you'll save hi I'm Kevin a former
Apple engineer and I'm Robin founder of
review.com two years ago we set out to
design a revolutionary cooking appliance
that was beyond anything on the market
we were tired of takeout and delivery
and we found that traditional meal kits
took too long to prep and cleanup we
knew there was a better way and that's
when we invented Suvi the smart
refrigerated multi-zone cooker that
works with meals of fresh raw ready to
cook ingredients we estimate that with
Suvi you can save an average of six
hours per week that's six hours you
could be spending with your friends or
family or just be more productive and
getting more things done you can always
put your own food in Suvi but if you
order Suvi meals
there's no prep required you can pick
one of our chef's design meals that
serve two to four people or customize
your own from over 10,000
combinations meals are made up of raw
proteins fresh vegetables raw starches
and delicious sauces created by our
gourmet chefs to cook your fish chicken
and meat Suvi uses the French MasterChef
technique of sous-vide heating them
vacuum sealed in a water bath to the
perfect serving temperature pastas and
grains are boiled and steamed vegetables
are cooked flawlessly using steam and
then roasting and soomi even
automatically drains pasta for al dente
perfection unlike traditional sous-vide
systems su V has a broiler that roasts
your vegetables and proteins right
before it's time to serve your meal and
our award-winning chefs have created
sauces and garnishes to give your meals
a five-star finish over the past two
years we've tested and iterated on
dozens of prototypes now we're ready to
bring sous-vide to you and we're looking
for your support to help us
revolutionize dinner together

the time and gourmet healthy meals you
deserve the future is here to join the
