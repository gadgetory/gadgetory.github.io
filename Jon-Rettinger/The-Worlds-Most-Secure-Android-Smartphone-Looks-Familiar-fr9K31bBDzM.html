thing to say but it exists at least in
the form of the Prive I really liked it
so BlackBerry's back with they're just
very unsexy Lee named D Tech 50 if
you're using the previous Android
BlackBerry devices D Tech is a software
the BlackBerry uses to help keep your
device secure the more stuff you do the
score is going to change lets you know
how secure your devices this phone might
look eerily familiar to some and spaced
on the TCL reference design which is
used for the Alcatel idle for seems like
a weird pairing it's like when Toyota
and Subaru randomly paired up to the BRZ
and FRS but it did enable blackberry
keep their cost down didn't have to get
paid for designs so 29 for this guy
you're getting a averagely SPECT phone
I'll let you say so go and peel the
plastic off this 5.2 inch 1080p display
three gigs of RAM 16 GB of internal
storage but it does have a micro SD card
slot somewhere on here a 13 megapixel
camera on the back and a twenty six
hundred million power battery that will
charge a fast do to quick charge 2.0 so
as a thing what's up you're gonna have a
key on the side here you look oh that's
a weird spot for the power and lock key
that is not the power and lock key that
is a convenient key Alcatel called it a
boom key but essentially you can program
to have to do whatever you wanted to do
but I keep thinking it's the power
button so I'm probably program it to
just do that otherwise internal power
buttons live very oddly on the top on
the left hand side here this one boots
up peel off the plastic let's keep some
genuine first impressions here so also
bear in mind so 300 all our phone and
you can get a lot of phones now in that
price point so that ring a very crowded
market it feels extremely light a screen
looks pretty decent you do get a lot of
nice things here with blackberry I think
there on-screen keyboard is kick-ass
although if you were so inclined you
could probably find an APK the keyboard
and put on whatever android device you
want you do get though the DTEC software
like i mentioned that's going to give
you a score for out secure your devices
the more stuff you do the more apt to
download that our sort of unsigned then
the score is going to go down it doesn't
do much other than really just tell you
how secure your devices so it's up to
you whether or not that's a useful
feature for you we're looking for a
phone though in that sort of 300 hour
price point looks like a pretty decent
option to compare this phone is GSM
unlock so it'll work in the US on AT&amp;amp;T
or t-mobile if you are Sprint or Verizon
you are out of luck you're not familiar
with BlackBerry's Android software I've
done a lot of really cool things while
keeping the general look and feel close
to stock Android you've got things like
widgets almost inside of the icon to
swipe up on an icon you actually get
widgets that'll show up it's kind of
cool if you swipe in from the right-hand
side you'll get productivity view you
can sort of see kind of your day at a
glance you've got some things like
BlackBerry's unified inbox a blackberry
hub is really solid there's some cool
visual UI things that'll happen when you
charge the phone up they did a really
nice job I think with their Android
software keeping it at least the look
and feel of native Android my favorite
feature about it is even if you put on
another launcher you still get most of
those features something that I've
really appreciated so looking at the
design of this I mean I wouldn't
actually discount this as oh it's just a
cheap Android phone there shouldn't
consider I think you might want to give
this guy a look so design is kind of
cool the bezel looks like it ends
towards the bottom and below the bezel
they've got speaker girls it kind of has
a neat look too haven't seen that before
I guess for the idle looks to be a
pretty solid phone I said the 1080p
screen looks good it looks like one of
the higher quality 1080p panels that
we've seen that couple with a 13
megapixel camera and only one Giga RAM
less and we've got under the flagship
phone like say the note 7 you've got a
pretty decent phone obviously the
processor is a little bit lower -
snapdragons 617 we're looking for a
unlocked phone for 400 bucks you can
give this guy a look and what do you
guys think give you a thumbs up let us
know to next time Jon Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
