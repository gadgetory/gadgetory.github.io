TechnoBuffalo and before I jump into the
review for the Panasonic Lumix DMC FC 47
I wanted to wish you guys a happy
Valentine's Day and I even wrote you a
Valentine roses are red violets are blue
you guys are the best darn subscribers
on all of you to book
so happy Valentine's everybody I hope
everyone has their special someone and
I'll be keeping my Valentine for you
guys right close to my heart all right
so enough of the mushy stuff let's jump
into the review panasonic lumix is DM
cfz 47 what the heck is this Panasonic's
long ass model names aside from that
it's a big super zoom camera though not
as big it's a little more compact and
it's a little more budget-friendly it's
got a 24 X optical zoom lens it has AVC
HD 1080 60 i recording in this camera
chords in stereo and one of the greatest
things about this camera is that is just
stocked from lens to LCD with camera
controls before we get into that let's
talk about image quality image quality
with the FC 47 a typical point-and-shoot
performance what you have here is you
have a 12.1 megapixel CCD sensor now the
thing about this camera is that in
bright light when you shoot in bright
light results are very good details
pretty impressive colors are fairly
accurate I've always liked colors coming
out of Panasonic's point-and-shoot
lineup however when you get into the
low-light when you start shooting at any
ISO that's past 400 this camera brings
on the noise and the grain now the FC 47
has a lot of different ISO boosting
modes you could shoot at like 32 or 64
hundred please don't use those modes
it's just gonna be a pixelated noisy
grainy mess the same thing happened in
HD video mode
bright light very impressive for a
point-and-shoot low-light anything past
ISO 400 800 started to be a noisy mess
check out my review on our site I shoot
at ISO 6400 and video and you get a
taste of that grainy noisiness so that's
the major drawback to the FZ 47 now when
we talk about design and we talk about
features we're talking about a whole
different ballpark this camera offers a
lot more than
many cameras in its class first of all
the design button layout super easy to
race around and get to things ISO levels
right there self timer is right here
we've got a function key we've got a
control wheel in the back that you could
actually depress to click and select
different options we've got a big mode
dial here we've got HDMI mini port here
designated video record button so this
camera on the outside strewn about with
manual controls and external controls
very impressive as far as shooting
features on the FC 47 I don't even know
where to begin let's start with the zoom
24x optical zoom with power
oh is this is Panasonic's image
stabilization system optical image
stabilization is one of the best in its
class so what that means was I was able
to zoom all the way and still keep the
camera fairly steady now the FZ 47 at
full resolution is kind of slow it can
capture 3.7 frames per second but when
you go down to the sports modes and the
high burst modes you can actually
capture a higher frame rate or I think
it's around 8 or 10 as far as manual
controls you have a shutter speed that
goes all the way down to 60 seconds and
that is a big benefit and I'll tell you
why you can actually set it on a tripod
do a long exposure shoot then you don't
have to worry about the you know the
poor ISO performance the FC 47 also
offered a lot of creative modes and
creative digital filters and the good
thing was in video mode I could actually
take advantage of those digital filters
and I could shoot you know using pinhole
or expressive mode while I'm talking
about video mode it's important to note
that this camera has a full manual video
mode with ISO control also has shutter
speed control and aperture control in
this price range and in this class
that's almost unheard of so overall the
Panasonic Lumix DMC fzy 47 is stocked
with features and has a great external
control the only thing limiting it for
more advanced shooters is its low-light
performance it's more of an entry level
camera so if you're a soccer mom or if
you're a skateboarder kid who is used to
just shooting in bright light
can't go wrong with the Panasonic Lumix
DMC FC 47 advance shooters low-light
seekers high ISO hunters are gonna want
to look at the higher and super zoom
cameras like the Canon Powershot SX 4
ths and the Lumix DMC fz1 50 Sony also
makes a very nice super zoom as well so
check those out and be sure to check out
the whole review at TechnoBuffalo comm
I'm Mike Pearlman I hope you guys have a
lovey-dovey Valentine's Day and I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
