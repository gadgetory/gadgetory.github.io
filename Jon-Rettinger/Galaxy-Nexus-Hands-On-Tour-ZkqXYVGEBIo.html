technobuffalo with an unboxing of the
highly anticipated Galaxy Nexus mobile
phone one of the first mobile phones to
hit the scene running google android for
also known as ice cream sandwich let's
get this unboxed and have a look at what
we get inside the box so super excited
to unbox this one now this has got a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor Texas
Instruments q map 4461 gigabytes of ram
16 gigabytes of internal storage and
look at that stunning handset this has
got four point six five inch screen
Super AMOLED display and a resolution of
1280 by 720 wow this looks like a
stunning stunning device look at that
actually the back was not even on the
phone when it came out of the box but
nevertheless this is a sexy looking
phone let's pop this just a one side we
have a closer look at the handset in a
moment let's see what else we get inside
the box this was obviously on the back
so a little protective film that didn't
stick to the back very well and we have
got a quick start guide it's going to
take us getting everything up and
running then we have got warranty
information we have got a USB micro USB
cable for charging and synchronizing the
device little tiny headset from Samsung
have a little look at this so we have
got in ear earphones and then somewhere
around here in line with it all control
to talk
clicky button to make and take calls and
a little pinhole microphone in this side
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
on the end there and then we've got the
battery let's crack this patch reopen
this is the battery for the unit it is a
3.7 volt 1750 milliamp hour battery so
plenty of power to keep that four point
six five inch screen running and then in
this section here we have got the
charger so it comes without the tip
installed it so going to be a
multi-voltage charger no doubt so you
can get different tips for it and a USB
socket on this end this pops out like so
and then I assume that this goes in like
so so clips into place and then we have
got a three pin UK charger this is going
to be country specific so if you're in
the US or it's somewhere else in Europe
you will get a different charger in the
box so that's all the contents let's get
this powered up and we will have a first
look at the Samsung Galaxy Nexus so here
we go we've got the Galaxy Nexus all
powered up with a sim card in it before
I wake this up for the first time I just
want to give a quick shout out to klove
technology big thank you to them for
supplying this handset you can check
them out at clove co uk they can see
even in its sleep inform there's a
little pulsating light here this is a
status led to show that I've got some
messages waiting for me let's hit that
side power button and we have got the
lock symbol here and I can either go to
the left to go straight into the camera
or go to the right to unlock the handset
fantastic super amoled screen let me
give you a close-up look at that this
super amoled screen as i say is running
at 1280 by 720 resolution very very nice
finishing to the text looks absolutely
fantastic and you'll notice down the
bottom here that the buttons here are
actually part of the displace then off
the display so the 1280 resolution runs
from about here all the way up to the
top now we've got the familiar Android
interface but with the ice cream
sandwich goodness on this one and it is
super super fluid absolutely love it tap
here to gain access to all of the
content on the handset and then we can
swipe from left to right and right to
left with that really stunning animation
between the screens we've got little
button here that we can tap to go into
widgets and this gains its access to the
widgets and as with all of the google
android operating systems you can tap
and hold to place widgets and shortcuts
to act on your desktop let me give you
example of that now for example we've
got Evernote pre-installed and Google+
so let's tap and hold Evernote and we
can drag that down and put it up here on
our home screen then we go back in and
then let's drag Google+ and we pop it
just down there on our front home screen
and then we've got direct access to
these one of the big tips i will give
you guys and girls is you see the
settings one here i added that as a
shortcut there is no easy way of
accessing settings from the sort
shortcut here so i would very strongly
advise you to add a Settings icon to
your home screen and that allows you to
dive straight in and control all of the
various preferences on the handset let's
go back out to that home screen I
mentioned Google Plus yes we have got
google plus on this handset and i wanted
to show you this because this is a nice
bright white background on here very
evenly lit display absolutely stunning
at the top of the handset we've got all
of the sensors and we've got things like
a light sensor proximity sensor etc all
at the top and this is obviously where
you're going to get the incoming voice
calls very good quality I'd a quick
listen to these before coming back on
camera
and round on the side here we've got
something for a doc maybe you're going
to get a multimedia dock and then you
can dock this in when it's on your
bedside table for easy viewing and
charging while you're watching videos
power on/off button on the side around
on the top it's completely clear on the
bottom we've got that micro USB charging
dock microphone pick up three-and-a-half
millimeter audio jack and then round on
this side we've got the volume rabac
five megapixel autofocus camera with the
LED flash there and this is but some
texture to it so it's nice and grippy in
the hand down the bottom here we got the
speaker grill little chin at the bottom
as well set sort of nice curved design
along the whole side of the handset and
then this little sort of chin at the
bottom this is probably where the
speaker and the antennas live this is a
nice looking handset this is the Galaxy
Nexus mobile phone the very latest
android based handset it feels really
fantastic in the hand it's got a whole
host of goodies inside including of
course GPS 802 11 BG and in Wi-Fi and
something I forgot to mention is
obviously a front-facing camera 1.3
megapixel front facing camera for video
conferencing etc this is a stunning
handset thank you very much for watching
please do stay tuned to the
TechnoBuffalo channel and i will see you
all in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
