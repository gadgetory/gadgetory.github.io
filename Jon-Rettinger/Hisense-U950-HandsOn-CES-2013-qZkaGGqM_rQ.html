continues how's it going friends I'm
Aaron Baker from TechnoBuffalo I've got
another mobile device here for you a
little bit lower key than some of the
stuff we've seen from Sony from ZTE
things like that but this is the Hisense
you 950 it's packin android 4.0 so it's
not updated to jellybean just yet
android 4.1 or 4.2 vini on your angles
got 1.2 gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm
processor MSM 8225 snapdragon 4.5 inch
qHD IPS Paston multi-touch display it's
got 4 gigabytes of internal storage 768
megabytes memories are clearly you know
it's in it they push this attainable
technology at an affordable price kind
of mantra at high set but you know what
this is the device
I imagine appeal to the masses in select
markets this is obviously not a device
that I would imagine seeing in the
United States there are some
customizations that is dual sim capable
as well it's packing a 1,900 million
power battery there I go again with a
packet 5 megapixel rear-facing camera
Wi-Fi 802 got 11 BGN 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack microUSB and more so a
neat little design here massive button
to the bottom menu haul them back and
search although not the new menu button
that we've seen for Android 4.0 devices
it's a little bit interesting their
volume rocker button there on top you
got power button 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack your micro USB charging
port at the bottom phone craziness
continues not just phones but TVs
technology and more to keep it locked in
TechnoBuffalo for continuing coverage of
all the goodness that is CES 2013 I'm a
twitter at aaron c baker facebook
facebook.com slash hi Aaron Baker and
facebook.com slash TechnoBuffalo keep it
logged in the site
keep it live our updates from CES 2013
I'll see you next time we're on location
at CES 2013 in Las Vegas hanging out at
the Ford booth no one likes getting lost
when you're driving or having to ask for
directions Ford vehicles with sync and
optional voice-activated navigation
helps solve that problem get
turn-by-turn directions over your car's
audio system so you know where you're
turning next to save time you can even
plan your route ahead by saving an
address as a favorite or searching
through your previous destinations
thanks again to Ford for powering this
TechnoBuffalo CES special and for giving
us a behind the scene
I see he has 20 13
