wild products announcements um you'll
see on the market some not I'm here at
the LG booth and it's been a ton of
attention sits like displays that roll
in and out of cabinets there's a lot of
other really awesome things at the LG
booth then at CES in general that maybe
you don't see unless you are here so I'm
gonna try to write that wrong and I'm
gonna show you some of the awesome
products that LG's got here and CES 2019
before we start showing the products I
want to thank LG for sponsoring this
video so if you got a laptop you
generally have it on your back and
you're carrying it with you so LG's had
the gram lineup but it's getting
super-sized here so there's a 17 inch
version and you have to actually like
hold this but this thing weighs under
three pounds for a 17 inch laptop like
to put in perspective it feels like LG
just forgot to put the battery in or
like it's a display model you'd see like
a retail store obviously they didn't
forget the battery you had a 72 watt
battery built in you can get up to 19
hours of battery life but also the rest
of the stuff that you'd want from like a
computer you really want to use you got
the 8th gen whiskey like CPU up to 16
gigs of ram also pretty nice resolution
it's wqxga so that's 2560 by 1600 and
it's a IPS display you get up to a
terabyte of SSD storage I mean you're
not sacrificing anything for the weight
and also I'd like to point out it's got
USB 8 ports as well so you've got all
the modern IO with Thunderbolt 3 but you
have to worry about living that dongle
life
this out little box is the LG Sinha beam
laser for cable shows a short throw
projector you don't to put it very far
to get the projector actually if you put
this just about two inches away from the
wall you're gonna get 8090 inch screen
and if you back it up like a little over
seven inches you're going to get a 120
inches obviously one of the Noxon
projectors is like you need perfect
scenario for it to work you get a dark
room they've got it in the room behind
us but there's obviously a lot of really
harsh light coming in harsher than you
would ever have in a house here at CES
and it looks pretty bright
it's got 2500 lumens built-in you also
don't need a screen you can just project
it onto a wall obviously the rest of the
stuff you'd expect 4k UHD can also mount
it on the ceiling and just for a
perspective like that's about two inches
and that's gonna get you a 90 inch
screen so just for a second look at that
all right so this is LG's new sound bar
obviously it's not gonna go like this
when it's on your wall but you can put
it either way you can mount it flush on
the wall if you've got a components and
you can put it on top and you're not
gonna have any loss of audio experience
if it actually bounced the sound off of
you and beyond that because it's gonna
sit below your TV LG wanted to make sure
that it didn't sound like the audio was
coming from like below your TV it will
bounce it up off the TV and then out to
you so it sounds like it's coming from
where the picture is I had a chance to
listen to it obviously you know you're
not gonna hear it but I can tell you it
sounded absolutely incredible
it's got Google assistant and built in
together things like 4k pass-through
it's also Wireless around reading kind
of all the rest of the stuff you'd
expect LG's working really closely with
Meridian so you know the sound is gonna
sound pretty ball there's also the other
stuff like Dolby Atmos and DTS supported
so if you want a sound bar it's not
gonna take up a bunch of space you don't
want to do a full surround sound system
and you want the flexibility to like
either have it on your components and/or
bounces on the wall
I so the sound bar is not the only new
product for LG the X boom line is new
and so we've got the X boom a I think
you've got a smart speaker you've got a
smart display and LG's worked with
Meridian like you did with the sound bar
to make the sound sound awesome
and then also you got the X boom go you
got different sizes of X boom go
depending on how much boom you want for
your go got a 49 inch ultra wide and
just to give some perspective this is
what 49 inches of monitor looks like I
mean I've got a little bit of monitor
and B this thing's got a 32 by 9 aspect
ratio you SPC for power delivery so it
can can charge your laptop - before I
tell you try to guess the resolution
5125 1440 that is a lot of pixels she
also got gaming monitors here with the
ultra gear it's got these stuff you'd
expect from a gaming monitor it's 144
Hertz so you can actually overclock
there's RGB lighting built into the back
of it you can sync with either the audio
or the video of the movie or the game
you're playing got G sync technology
nano IPs and it looks absolutely awesome
so if you guys enjoyed this kind of tour
of the LG booth didn't show you some of
the other products that they've got here
as a mistake you're the one that you
guys are most pumped about it isn't the
laptop it seems like the batteries on so
a short throw projector is it the 49
inch ultrawide monitor or did some of
the audio options leave the comment sit
down and below and let me know until
next time i'm john r Ettinger and i'm
probably gonna take a nap
