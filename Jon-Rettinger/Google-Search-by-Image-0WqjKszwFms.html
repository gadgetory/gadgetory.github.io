try to describe it in words but what I
said I would say there's a guy he's on a
path a rocky cliff well it's pretty hard
to describe this in a way that you hope
it understand but I have the picture and
if I have the picture why not just use
it and that's why today we're also
announcing search by image on desktop I
have with me here Peter Leslie our new
product manager on the image search
who's gonna help us see some demos of
how this works
okay thanks Johanna so let's just pull
up that image you were looking at and I
want to give you a little bit of the
backstory behind this image it's
actually came from a software engineer
at Google
his name is Gabe and he was on holiday
in Greece 10 years ago
Aylin comment they took a whole lotta
digital photographs and asked for 10
years who's don't to his collection
it couldn't Micra call where this image
was taken now how would you know new
clients solve this problem you probably
a bunch of friends much like not like us
might ask you that right now does
anybody recognize this place but what is
the metaphor when you have that query
for a certain perhaps what you want to
do is to be able to pick up image drop
it in the search box
pretty cool so let's take a look at
what's going on here as you had
mentioned earlier this is an image that
hasn't been published online do not have
this image in our index yeah we were
some Haven somehow figure out Island in
Greece we return the results Wikipedia
they're seeing more about it as we've
also returned literally similar images
which appear to be the same Island but
take forever literally taken by
different people can you show us another
example sure so we have another good
example that came from internal testing
this rather glaring looking logo was
picked up by Jack a sales engineer at
Google at a conference that he attended
several years ago and there was
something around the logo the quarters I
had long wondered about the origin so
again during the internal testing of
search by image he was able to pick it
up in the search box what's really cool
is you can click on these results here
so Peter these examples you showed have
been interesting but I'm wondering if
this technology can help me with the
problem that I have so that at Google
and at work there's all these pictures
floating around they have a cute little
animals on them and they these block
white letters with them with captions on
them and I'm trying to figure out what's
going on here sometimes I feel like an
old lady at work and I just want to know
what a what this is all about okay well
I think I know what you're talking about
fortunately because I anticipate the
question I prepared this for you
earlier today now some of you may
recognize this guy so we can don't I get
one of these images overnight so we'll
go ahead I have to admit you know it's
very difficult stay on top of all these
so next time you're having you come
across an image like this just drop it
at search by an agent you'll get results
so by looking through the results page
we can see that this is the why you know
guy and you can click on know you're
mean
find out more about it more about the
origin why I went popular how when
popular and I want you to look at the
literally similar images here this is
interesting because this is where you
kind of get the crux of it this is an
image it's an ending that gets reused
when people change the text across on
top on the bottom tab there are kind of
funny captions here is that the
Dieselworks we take an image we break it
down into fundamental points or lines
textured so on and so forth this query
which we sent up this step returns
results which we could rank to the end
user something like this now just to
wrap up I want to tell you a little bit
about how this pictures getting all
about so it's rolling out globally on
Emma just a little calm over the next
few days and when you see a little
camera icon in your city or search box
that means you have access to search by
image and they're always yeah so there
are four ways you can access this
feature you can copy and paste an image
URL and you can upload images
from your desktop and you can also drag
and drop images right into the search
boxes identity demo and fy'y were also
announcing Chrome and Firefox extensions
which means certify images won't like
the white with images as you discover
them on the web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
