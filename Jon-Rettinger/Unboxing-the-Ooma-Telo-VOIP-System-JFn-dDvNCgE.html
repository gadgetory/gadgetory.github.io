here at an unboxing for you of the Ummah
hello this is a voice over IP option so
it's an Internet phone essentially but
it's got a little bit of a different
twist you buy the box for a one-time fee
of $249 you get a local phone number or
you can port in your landline number and
that's it no additional charges you can
make unlimited calls anywhere in the US
for no monthly fee so I was looking for
a home loan home phone lying alternative
I didn't want to sort of pay the monthly
fee especially if I'm gonna be moving in
a few months and I want to be able to
keep my numbers I thought the uma tell
would be a good option I just went out
and bought this you can pick it up from
Best Buy again about two hundred fifty
bucks you can plug in your own landline
phone and really use it anywhere you'd
like some kind of interesting to see how
it works
supposedly the voice quality is pretty
good I'm cautiously optimistic a bit
skeptical I had the best experience with
voice over IP options I've had some
dedicated Skype phones I've tried
Vantage now them have been the best but
the goo Mattel has gotten very good
reviews some quite curious to give it a
whirl
let's go ahead and unbox it and you can
also get a 911 one service call waiting
caller ID and the rest sets up so break
the break the seal in there and before
we do that take a look at the box so
you've got the picture of the device
right there the uma Telos are a sleek
black hear the difference bundle
features caller ID call waiting a 9-1-1
keep your number if you have a landline
you can keep it I think for an
additional fee use existing phones
that's nice and easy set up who wants
hello on the front some info on the back
let's go ahead and open this thing up
and see what we got
you know I do a lot of work from from
home and always using my cell phone up
to my head or on a headset then I might
get the best reception quite a bit of
drop calls so I need some sort of home
phone alternative so you've got just a
black slide-out box underneath and this
is not a review unit this something I
went out and purchased on my own open it
up thank you congratulations on your
purchase Quick Start Guide for your
standard array paperwork no CD in there
in you've got your accessories got a
decent small wall plug it's like a
standard you know cell phone plug
you got a Ethernet or phone cord rather
and then there is for your cable
ethernet cord here's the Montello itself
it sort of got a slim slim look to it
sort of a wedge shape
um so what this does is it plugs right
into your router or cable modem and then
you can push the phone line out you can
actually go from the Internet to your
phone line that will make all the phone
lines in your house but they're called
hot so you can plug in your phone and
use the teller device so it's got email
and not email voicemail and through your
standard playback functions it's all
capacitive right on the front you can
see on those buttons and on the back
you've got a USB port for now that your
own power device there's power option
your home network to internet phone and
wall so kind of curious how this is
gonna work I will keep you guys posted
and stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo
for a full review I'm John Retton Jorn
I'll see in the next video actually
while I have yet captive on camera let's
do another about a surprise unboxing for
those that stuck around to the end we've
got a VTech expandable cordless phone
system that I'm going to use as well
this is interesting phone at 79 bucks
picked out from Best Buy it's all touch
sensitive buttons
kind of neat but it's got bluetooth
built-in see actually if you're you want
to use your cell phone and actually
treat this phone as a say a headset so
you can use your cell phone's connection
but talk right through this and also if
you want to use it as a standard
landline you can as well quite nice and
it's expandable let's go ahead and dig
into the VTech should be pretty nice
sort of a slick looking feel to it you
know being a tech guy I wanted to have
something that looks kind of neat
I mean Lister a reasonably priced you
don't send the item on I wasn't gonna
break the bank for the landline and I
may or may not like on a system like the
umma that I may or may not use owner's
manual okay talk I don't think it's a
cloth to clean it here's the base it
also comes with you know voicemail
answering system and all that capacitive
touch sensitive buttons power back to
the phone and battery here is the actual
phone itself which is kind of cool
looking
it's pretty slick all touch buttons
pretty thin as well and it looks like
it's actually a spot for a SIM card in
there you can see that I'm not so a
battery indicator let me kind of neat
though if you could just let a SIM card
right in there make this your cell phone
as well um nice phone bring these dudes
in quality from when I read on the
reviews nothing terribly fancy just a
standard land phone I know guys John
Rhett enger' and I'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
