technobuffalo here is a full review for
you of the latest from Motorola this is
the Moto X it brings a lot of
customization options to the table let's
go ahead put it through his paces and
see if it's worth your phone by and
dollar as I do with all my phone reviews
I want to begin this with a disclaimer I
use this device as my daily driver for
five and a half days so it gave me
plenty of time to get to know it and
learn it and then for another to nap
days using it in conjunction with
another phone to really feel like got a
chance to know what it can do and what I
can't do before I get into all the specs
and everything the phone's got under the
hood let's talk first about call quality
this is coming to all four major US
carriers I did test it in Southern
California on 18 team call quality was
outstanding it seems to be the case with
almost all phones now I experienced one
drop call during my time with the device
if I could have been the area i was at
everything worked very well call claudia
was pretty loud as was speakerphone
let's start with the mission here about
the Moto X it's not your typical
flagship phone you're not looking at a
Snapdragon 800 or XE nose octa core chip
or anything you're looking at a pretty
standard dual core phone look at it just
from the outside on the specs might be
very underwhelmed Motorola's made this
not about the specs at all about the
experience and you can say it's a lot of
sort of the Apple approach so I know
what the phones got under the hood it's
how well it works for you so the big
ways of doing that firstly with
customization you can choose really ton
of choices probably not your phone to
look you can pick from 18 back colors
you pick from seven color options for
the buttons on the side and the accent
ring around the camera and all
customizations are done the other pretty
intuitive and surprisingly awesome moto
maker GV lets you log into your Google
account and set your wallpaper so
essentially your phone is all set up and
ready to go as soon as you turn on which
kind of a neat approach the phone works
very very well and I'll talked about
that when i get to the hardware but the
experience was pretty incredible and
really exceeded my expectations so let's
jump into the hardware first the phone
feels premium it doesn't have sort of
the flashy medal back at the HTC One but
it's got the heft of the Nexus 4 and it
feels really really top quality I give
motorola a lot of credit serve a soft
touch back it's got some plasticky parts
we really feel like you're using a
top-tier device the 4.7 inch 1280 x 720
ml LED screen is surprisingly good and
well it can sometimes historic colors
but things look
decent and hide Fe one of the coolest
things about having a Mets screen is
motos active notifications actually what
that is if you pick your phone up when
it's facing down you pick it up you can
see notifications right on your home
screen you can see what the time it is
you can unlock your device and you can
jump right to particular notification if
you've got a text message or an email I
wish you could have scrolled through
notifications but only shows the last
one that came up but it's a really cool
start I love to see that function
perhaps even be built in to some Android
devices I really think Motorola nailed
this one here so the Moto X take
advantage of on-screen buttons and they
still annoy me like to do on pretty much
every device that has them not
functionality they work very well for
taking up precious precious real estate
why can't there be capacitive buttons
like have an extra row of icons on my
home screen I find that really really
annoying everybody sit has it just seems
to get me more and more upset so on the
next one moto maybe capacitive buttons
please let's jump into software next so
I found it really interesting that
Motorola didn't get special treatment
from google the X ships with Android 4.2
point2 not even the latest version of
jelly bean 4.3 so I like that Motorola's
done here they focus a lot on the
experience not throwing everything that
could add it it's mostly stock Android
with really really good tweaks one of
the coolest things is google voice it's
always listening you have to train it
with your voice using your ok Google now
and it works it very well and only with
your voice I'll give a demonstration
here so the phones off ok Google now
what's the weather in irvine california
in 76 degrees and partly cloudy in
irvine there it goes and if somebody
else comes up and tries to mess with
your phone ok Google now changed my
language to Chinese it's not going to
work I just launched it right there
really is tuned right to your voice I
get them a lot of credit at work can
recognize and very crowded meeting
spaces Motorola did a really really
awesome job I would love for that
feature to make its way into just
regular Android house every device can
take advantage of its pretty awesomeness
it's also got a really cool feature to
it's an app that you might not even
notice Mike just think it's bloatware
but it's called moto assists and it is
beyond awesome especially when you are
in the car texting and driving is one of
the worst things you can do kills tons
of people in jerz lots more you
shouldn't be doing it when your car
though if you turn this on essentially
what you get is it'll read your text
messages out loud or continue playing
music it makes life a lot easier it's
got
functionalities as well if you're in a
meeting in the mute if you want to go to
bed it'll turn everything off for you
just a really cool features and motor
oil has done a very awesome job on we
first kind of saw that with previous
Motorola devices and they really
fine-tuned it with the Moto X so they're
cool software features obviously you can
launch the camera with the camera button
but that's so last year what if you want
to launch a camera but another way can
do that by twisting your wrist like a
training a screwdriver so there's a
simple that give you some haptic
vibration and the camera will launch up
the UI is pretty super simple that's way
moto wants it so talking about the
camera let's jump right into that it's
got a 10 megapixel clear pixel sensor on
the back motorola saying they've added a
fourth clear pixel to let in 75% more
light than other phones pictures look
pretty good but mold like they have a
ton of artifacting if you want to know
more about the pictures what it looks
like check out the full review on
TechnoBuffalo com we've got a ton of
images up that it might help you decide
whether or not you want to pick this up
based on camera performance alone and
talking about performance they're
actually pretty good thing you guys
welling up the quadrant score won't suck
and blow anyone away what it was a score
of eight thousand nine hundred and
eighty one but don't let that fool you
this thing performed as well as any
quad-core devices loaded up apps super
quick loaded up games really fast it
scrolled through what pages that hold up
I never had a worry or do any sort of
management I would processor or any sort
of RAM it's got two gigs in there
everything here was really really fast
if I picked up this phone and someone
told me had a quad-core chip I wouldn't
even bat an eyelash I worked very very
very well so what has been made about
the price coming in about 200 bucks and
I know it's a tough one to justify but
here's where the price comes from this
phone is assembled in the United States
there's been a huge call for more phones
built and/or assembled in the US and you
build something in the US you've got to
pay unions and labors more expensive so
the phone is going to cost a little bit
more if you want a phone that's gonna
cost less you want when it's assembled
elsewhere police now you've got the
option to have a phone completely
assembled in the United States you
generally purely pay a premium for that
the phone feels really nice and he got
happily signed my name to a one-year
contract on this phone two years though
might be a bit tough to justify all the
specs are pretty good now and will be
good in 10 11 12 months I don't know if
games and apps in another year going to
require quad-core device those are
becoming more and more standard leaves
for next year a fairly comfortable
recommending this phone so last but
definitely not least let's talk about
battery it's
a 2200 milliamp hour battery one of the
nice things of having the lower clock
speed processor and louis lesce cores is
battery and battery life was absolutely
outstanding my daily usage take out the
phone around seven-thirty about an hour
two hours of phone calls constantly
checking to email inboxes every five
minutes some light web browsing some
decent social media doing I and some
youtube watching usually go to bed on
most phones throughout twenty-five
thirty percent I had over forty-five
percent battery life on the Moto X this
thing is an absolute beast of a phone
I'm not a removable battery though so
you want to make sure that it's going to
work for you but I also didn't feel any
heat coming from the battery the
processor as well which is really nice
so this thing just knocked battery right
out of the park so what's the final
score on the Moto X you can guess it's a
pretty good one final score of 8.5 would
have preferred a higher definition
screen but I can understand why it's not
in here I would have liked to have not
had those capacitive buttons really
really just annoyed me but there's
nothing wrong with this phone at all I
can't say don't get the stone because of
X really i can say get the phone because
of a myriad of reasons it works well I
feel like to customize your phone it's
gonna be a great device for you you know
who you are for the kind of person that
needs the latest and greatest specs this
is clearly not the phone for you to pick
but you're the kind of person just wants
and user experience to work well work
cleanly and work smoothly just want your
phone to work right out of the box this
is gonna be a great choice for you thank
