unleashed the touch bar on the world and
it's been met with I think to say mixed
reviews is an understatement there's a
very clear line in the sand that's been
drawn and you were most likely on one
side or the other you can watch our full
review but essentially it boiled down to
this though the too long didn't watch
version was mmm I missed the ports touch
bars nice battery life's bad graphics
performance is good better than it's
been before but not overwhelming
I just summed up the whole video for you
if you want but I use the computer for a
month there have been software updates
ten 12.2 has been out and then by the
time you watch this who knows what OS is
going to be out but that's the most
recent version of Sierra as of this
filming and it did a couple different
things that I want to talk about first
it got rid of the time remaining in the
status bar so you don't necessarily know
in the time went frame how much longer
you gonna have and I get that maybe
wasn't all that accurate in the first
place but I did use it as a measuring
stick for about how I can use a computer
or if I had to go you know search for an
outlet in an hour two hours why up will
remove that only only Apple knows
perhaps it was a sweet battery life
issues under table perhaps there's a
grander plan I don't know I find it
annoying and I really didn't like it one
thing I do like about the new s it did
improve my super crappy battery life I
had to go to the Genius Bar to see if I
had a bad computer battery life was so
bad
three to four hours kind of max on it it
has been improved which is nice to say
with the new OS update getting about an
hour more which is no small feat I mean
cooking at four hours an extra hours
twenty five percent increase in battery
life so that's nice presumably it's
gonna get better and better and better a
software update to come so battery life
again not thumbs up but not like like
this anymore it's kind of like like that
so I thought it was only fair if I made
a video saying how bad battery life was
updated to say it has been improved it's
not classy eating money stretch the
imagination but better the touch bar is
interesting
I still don't think it's necessary but
it does add a lot more than I thought I
wished I would work across more apps
it's kind of inconsistent for when it
shows up even across a book or apps or
what it's going to show but it is
helpful you know in calendar you get all
the dates up there I did have the touch
bar freeze but one time Omni that was
kind of fun but it did bring itself back
on its own it doesn't make or break the
computer for me at all it's kind of a
nice addition but if you're thinking
that I want to get a computer just for
the touch bar it's probably not worth it
even editing in Final Cut I found myself
just for reverting back to using a mouse
and keyboard as opposed to touch bar but
if you do want to use it for things like
that it's great for scrolling and
scrubbing it my favorite is to scrub
scrub through YouTube videos that I'm
watching or to scrub even through a
timeline Final Cut if I remember that's
there I don't have a closed kind of in a
docking situation at my office still my
opinion USBC is the same as it was I
wish there was some legacy options Apple
is trying to push it towards future i/o
so it is what it is you know when you're
buying this computer it's only gonna
have USB C port so I guess you can't
really complain about it if you know
that going in so you didn't know be
aware a lot of negativity surrounding
the keyboard leads to launch for me -
keyboards been great
I had no keyboard issues at all in fact
I'd even think that much about the
keyboard I would have liked to see an
improved performance on some third-party
apps by no that's not really in Apple's
control things like the Adobe suite
could be better and should be better
hopefully Adobe will bring that so if
you edit a lot in Premiere you might
want to wait on this until Adobe goes
ahead and updates it so things have
changed a little bit since our initial
review a month ago I'm still using the
computer and I still want to learn it
and see if things improve and experience
gets better but we're worse than a lot
of you guys debating whether or not to
buy one of these this is a big
investment anything else you guys want
to know about the computer let us know
down below if you want to see us
continue to do update videos about the
MacBook Pro the best way to do last
video a thumbs up till next time
John Rangers and TechnoBuffalo now
you've been updated on the MacBook Pro
time to relax and take your favorite
shows with you and perhaps some of your
favorite programming is from the Science
Channel maybe you're into how the
universe works or like me you like to
know how it's made you can take it with
you anywhere you want a link to it down
below but just science channel go app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
