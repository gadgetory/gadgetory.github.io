technobuffalo here one of the big
features that Steve Jobs and Apple
touted with the new macbook air was its
instant on capabilities so I wanted to
sort of put that to the test and
demonstrate it I'm going to compare it
with a first generation macbook and see
if there really are any differences the
instant on that the macbook air utilizes
comes from its flash memory it actually
took the flash modules out of the
container and actually put them directly
on the motherboard supposedly making for
a bit of power saving and weight speeds
so see if that really is true let's go
ahead and get started alright so let's
check out the specs of these two guys
this is an older computer and certainly
has been used a little bit more so we'll
check out about this mannequin to review
we have here 1.4 gigahertz intel core 2
duo two gigabytes of RAM on the macbook
air on the math book we have 2.4
gigahertz intel core 2 duo two gigs ram
so noticeably faster here at speed-wise
let's go ahead and close the lids on
both of these and we'll put them to
sleep naturally then we'll sort of force
the issue so put that guy to sleep and
put this guy so you can give him a
second to sort of get into their
hydration mode you can also see the size
difference here quite a bit smaller on
the fitness is really impressive all
right so let's start with the macbook
garrix go ahead open it up and it's on
seeds kind of the internet just try and
go into a website so there's apple kind
of the internet right away so that was
pretty quick let's go ahead and see if
the macbook does the same thing go ahead
open that up pretty quick let's go ahead
and check out Firefox and fix the
internet as well so as far as being a
huge feature this thing turns on
instantly like it would on a iphone or
an ipad not really seeing it but maybe
the computers didn't really go to sleep
maybe we have some weird power mode
setting it wasn't
test let's go ahead and put both of
these to sleep so we'll go to the apple
menu and I'll hit sleep on a macbook air
and i will hit sleep here on the macbook
and both of them will take a nap and now
one of the difference is to note between
sort of the sleep mechanisms on both
computers that the macbook air sips
power a little bit of better than
supposedly at least the macbooks might
have had in solana early tests but they
say you can get almost 30 days worth of
battery life with this in this heavy
hibernation mode aterna it's not the
case with the macbook line so they are
both sleeping you probably hear you
snoring let's power both of them on and
see if things are a difference on the
buttons at the same time i will see if
they both kick on so the macbook air
came on a little bit sooner cheap skype
at the internet it is once the
anticipate that the internet it is as
well so not really seeing the huge
advantage of this instant on let's try a
boot up time since any sort of
difference here with boot up speed this
computer his macbook has been used for a
little while how to fresh install about
eight months ago but certainly as the
programs on it and stuff is on there so
it might not be the ferrets prepare some
brand new macbook versus a brand new
macbook air but it's what we got so
we're going to work with it let's go
ahead and quit everything and will shut
them down I might people try shut down
test two and we'll try a boot of tests
and we'll see you leave an assured
difference between them so shut down at
the same time go ahead and hit the enter
key and they're off to the races ideas
install and shut down that was it very
much meetings all up its let's just shut
them all right so let's try a boot up
test and see if we can actually get some
fair results that way let's go ahead and
hit power on both and see if we have any
sort of speed difference between the
macbook air attorney came on I came to
life a little bit sooner it's probably a
reminiscent and showing the solid-state
memory that has certainly boots a little
bit quicker that's been a hard drive or
spin apply or find the operating system
and that put it up actually very very
very quickly actually booted up faster
than my
imac with the solid state drive so from
a boot up standpoint a macbook air
clearly a speed increase you know you're
suckin get sent Sarah Leah apples to
apples comparison here when you're
looking at a macbook with a standard
spinning of hard driver to the macbook
air video input time for example when
you're headed a lot of video are going
to be much faster on the macbook air
despite the slower processor because of
that solid state drive so something to I
think you definitely keep in mind so
whether or not to be worth it to you is
going to be yet to be seen I'll put
these things through a ton more tests
want to give you guys just a bit of
demonstration of the Buddha and that
instant on I am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo be sure to check out the
website for all your macbook air news
and check out the youtube channel
youtube.com slash John for lakers and
i'll see you guys in the next video bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
