Florida this is my second non-apple
unboxing so I know you guys like these
so I hope you enjoy what it is is my new
Toshiba HD a 2 HD DVD player HD DVD
player Best Buy and Walmart two big-box
retailers here in the states were
selling these kind of a one-day special
for 98 bucks
friend 8 bucks it was kinda hard to turn
down
even if Bluebird ends up winning so I
went down my less than hundred bucks so
it seemed like a no-brainer so I'm able
to pick one up so let me show you guys
the box here sorry I'm using my eyesight
so let's see if it's unboxing will work
open her up and see alright now one
thing to note if you buy an HD DVD
player and you fill out a form online to
Hugo will send you five free HD DVDs you
can choose from a list of like 10 I
think alright let's see what we got in
the box
remote control I'll show you guys that
in a minute
important notice congratulations how to
obtain your firmware update is a form
where update they have Ethernet based
broadband connection essentially plug it
into an Ethernet connection when you get
it it's almost you mean sky and that's
the player so let's take a look the
player here's that notice by the way
about updating your firmware again this
is the model HD a - I think it was so
cheap because it's been replaced by the
HD a three hey yeah looks like an
instruction book component cables power
adapter and it's like two triple A
batteries and I'll show you guys the
remote real quickly if you're curious
here is the remote looks pretty full
functions looks like you can use it for
a TV - I'm not going to but that's
remote just link then nothing terribly
fancy alright let's get to the player
they're wanting an HD player either HD
DVD or blu-ray for a while but there is
no I was gonna buy one when they were
five six hundred bucks especially since
you don't know who's gonna win the
format work alright so here is the
player let's take out this last piece of
all right there is the player guys click
the back of it here first
oh look at it with you and see we can
find get that on frame alright so there
is Ethernet port looks like it's got
optical audio component like even an
optical component and audio s-video HDMI
and power over there and fan nothing
terribly fancy and on the front I think
that this and I've seen that's where the
frame for you yeah the skip pause looks
like there are two extension USB ports
right there
I'm not sure what those are for but
there they are eg DVD player I can put
your experience with HD DVD what it says
on this thing so guys that was my HD DVD
player I'm gonna hook it up I'll let you
guys know what I think if you're
interested I'm pretty excited in
addition I also bought Unforgiven one of
my favorite movies hold on
just kidding it sneezed
oh my favorite movie so I'm excited to
watch that if you want to see what a
cheeky vide looks like here's at the box
it's a little bit smaller than a
standard DVD box there's a disc looks
just like a regular CD or DVD in the
back of the disc looks the same case you
guys are wondering what HD DVD is or
blu-ray it's high-definition video I
think it's something like six times the
resolution of a standard DVD so pretty
cool can show stuff the videos can be
shown in 1080p I think this player only
goes to
I just fine my TVs only 720 so my guys
that's the player hope you enjoyed
asking questions on behalf can answer
them hope you guys are doing well and
enjoying your day wherever you're at
alright guys talk to you soon until next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
