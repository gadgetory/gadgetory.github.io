from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of the Droid Charge this is the newest
4G phone for Verizon Wireless let's go
ahead dig in I kept trying to think of
any charge jokes but I just couldn't
come up with any so insert your own
charge joke here put them down below
let's go ahead and unbox this guy so
presumably we are going to see a release
very soon on the next few days at least
in the month of May so go ahead and pull
off of the paper you've got that robot
looking droid I rip this off here
nothing very exciting on the box I will
say it's me take a fit of skill to get
the lid off there we go and here is your
charge this is a device that we first
saw at CES it didn't have a name then it
was rumored to be called the stealth we
even got some hands-on time with the
device when it was pre-release it was
actually one of my favorite phones from
CES 2011 so I'm really looking forward
to getting in there and seeing what
we've got so we've got some Samsung
media hub credit I will actually put
this out to the first one to claim it
can have it there you go
okay so droid charge we've got some
reading material don't think people are
gonna read that but you've got it you're
sort of now standard accessories there's
a wall charger so we've got a micro USB
to USB cable we do and don't have any
sort of headphones in there okay let's
go ahead and take a look at the phone
and because I know my audience I'm just
going to leave the plastic on here while
I film you guys won't mind right um
alright so we'll slide it out of its
plastic baggie and we will rip this off
if we get to whooshing noise no
whooshing noise I'll do that to a camera
accident there some sort of whooshing
noise zoom in a little bit and let's run
through these specs first to see if
there's a battery in there it feels like
there is I will power it on while I'm
talking assuming I can find the power
button which looks to live
on the right-hand side of the device see
if we have enough of a charge please you
can watch something while I'm talking
all right so this is the Droid Charge oh
there's my joke he came charged get it
okay so it's got a 4.3 inch diagonal
Super AMOLED plus display but Wow you're
not gonna want to turn this on when
you're in class or in a meeting it's a
Super AMOLED plus display if you've seen
the beautiful Super AMOLED screens on
the Galaxy S series of devices this
takes that beautiful screen takes it a
step further you may have noticed that
the Galaxy S or any phone the Super
AMOLED screen had a little bit of a
bluish tint to it I talked about in some
of my videos it wasn't anything that
really competed you but it's something
that we definitely cognizant of when you
were using the phone this takes care of
that so you are gonna get really really
bright colors you're going to get some
rich images go ahead and unlock that
dark color don't look bright black
you're gonna look black great visibility
in direct sunlight this is a gorgeous
screen I'm ever coming away from CES
really really impressive it's a Super
AMOLED display resolution of 480 by 800
so it's a very very very high res screen
on the phone as you can see it is
running Android 2.2 or as you can see at
least it's got TouchWiz no Gingerbread
here but being a new phone presumably it
will get a taste of tasty tasty
Gingerbread if we check out the rear of
this guy and there's another sticker
I'll go ahead and remove this before I
start talking it's going to see where
that is there we go
boom removed because I read the comments
and you guys hate stickers with a
passion so we got an 8 megapixel camera
on the back with an LED flash and it
does have auto focus business in it
which is kind of cool that will shoot
video at 1280 by 720 which is 720p we've
got a front-facing camera right there
for all of your video chatting needs
that's 1.3 megapixel one of the nice
things about this phones is 1600
milliamp hour battery that lives right
under here this is an LTE 4G phone
LTE sucks in battery life unfortunately
the way that LTE is done right now is
there are two seperate radios a 4G radio
and a 3G radio and that can definitely
be a drain on battery however Samsung is
claiming you're gonna get 11 hours
talktime and 280 hours of standby time
so that's pretty nice it's being powered
by a now tried-and-true 1 gigahertz
Samsung processor there is no dual-core
action here unfortunately but on the
upside it does have mobile hotspot
capabilities for sharing all of that hot
4G action which you can see I have right
there 4G that is one extra G than most
folks might be used to you can share
that mobile hotspot for up to eight
devices so awesome there it is very thin
and surprisingly light device so let's
take a quick tour of it so there's that
front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera we've
got the Baba's and logo and we've got
some physical buttons nothing capacitive
here the typical Android I really like
the physical buttons actually we've got
your menu button home button your back
button and your search button on the
left
volume Muraki up and down there is your
charging port micro USB that's now
become standard really nice for that
sort of charging and syncing standard
looks like there's a microphone on the
side as well another dual microphone on
top 3.5 milimeter headset jack that is
non recessed so any headphones that
you've got will work even your Hello
Kitty headphones as I know you guys use
the power button is going to reside as
we just discovered on the right hand
side of the device power and lock and
right above that is right below that
rather is HDMI out under a door
unfortunately that is going to be a
separate cable they're gonna hook this
guy up to the TV you can do so the back
of it is hard plastic it's not stuff
soft touch you can see it's got a bit of
a reflective look to it and it is a with
a Google device a little bit of a hump
in at the back you can see your right
towards the bottom right there when it's
sitting on a flat surface it's got a
little bit of a rock to it but it does
feel nice in the hand so let's do a real
quick size comparison here is another
four point
device this is the inspire 4G for 18 t
similar to the desire hd or the Evo it's
a 4.3 inch filament you can see the
difference from a size comparison just
for thickness
let's bring in an iPhone 4 in case you
are on Verizon and you're considering
perhaps this phone the Droid Charge or
the iPhone 4 you get a size comparison
certainly the size of the Droid Charge
can be larger kits got a much larger
screen but that exercise doesn't come
with much extra thickness this is a very
very thin phone I've got to say it feels
really nice in the hand I think that if
I had to pick a phone on the verizon
network to pick up right now this would
probably be the one that I would choose
go ahead and unlock it our pricing is
gonna vary depending on what outlet you
choose whether or not you go to Verizon
or maybe Amazon's having a deal that day
or your local retailer I think ideally
just don't know I will say though with
the screen here looks really pretty
although I'm sure that's not gonna
translate onto camera let's go ahead and
jump in see if I can find a gallery and
open up an image for you this won't
waste just put it up for the first time
it's fine gallery and you guys are
probably gonna see it it's right there
it's right there but sometimes I crack
into the pressure I don't see these
things when I'm looking so let's see
what we got a voice search navigation
you take a look at all the applications
that are going to come on here if you
like touch where they don't like
TouchWiz when the great things about
Android is that you can totally
customize your device to make it look
however you choose so it's like we've
got the stock Android gallery
application here it is loading and this
is going to be expandable so if you want
more storage you can put up to a 30
gigabyte card in there looks like
there's nothing stored in here
unfortunately so there's a camera app
and speaking of that there you go you
can see what that would look like you
see my boxes hit the home button micro
SD card slot is going to live in the
back here so I can get the top off okay
can see the jokes already today I'm
going to slide your fingernail if you
have any all the way around and
presumably that will get the back of
this off let's see
theory theory it'll do it
I'll keep this in it's in the video so
you guys can make fail jokes there we go
alright so 4G SIM card kind of still
strange to see a SIM card on Verizon
devices you do not have to take out the
battery though to get the expansion card
slot which is quite nice it looks like
it's going to come with a big card in
here very nice 32 gig card so you're
gonna have that choice of purchasing
option so you can have a lot of storage
here I love the fact that you can swap
cards if you need and get a ton of space
and there is our 1600 milliamp hour
battery still very strange to see the
SIM card as I mentioned but I love the
fact that it gives some tasty tasty 4G
action if you guys are in area where you
have arrived in 4G go into a Reisman
store and try it it is incredibly fast I
was using it over the weekend in
Southern California not this one I was
using the Novotel hotspot when I was
getting 12 megabits down and four up
which is really fast and a lot faster
than most home connections so until a
network at saturated presumably those
speeds go down a little bit you're gonna
get lightning fast speeds this has been
a very long unboxing video I felt like
we got a chance to talk and get to know
each other a little bit better um this
is the Droid Charge for Verizon Wireless
presumably it's going to be available
very very soon so check at Verizon
Wireless calm to get your droid charge
