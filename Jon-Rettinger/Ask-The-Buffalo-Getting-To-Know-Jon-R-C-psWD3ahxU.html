with the series i like to call ask the
buffalo where you can ask me anything
you want from the world to tech and even
my personal life these questions are not
screened before hand so they are coming
right from my mind out my face hole and
on to your screen you can ask questions
one of two ways we put up a post on
technobuffalo calm and you can ask your
question there in the comments otherwise
you can send the message to at
TechnoBuffalo with the hashtag ask the
bee and you can ask whatever you like
these are going to be a weekly segment
so we're going to answer you know eight
to ten questions appending on the answer
so if you see me good answer right words
because I got the questions over there
let's go ahead and get started the first
question comes from the website and is
from user Lambo 6 do you think the
iphone five will come out in june or
july should i wait to get the iphone
four i can't wait out of all the
questions that I get this is probably
one of the most popular should i buy the
iphone should I not buy the iphone and
it seems to be true with every single
Apple product they generally have about
a year release cycle so if you don't get
it in that first three months back your
mind if you're a nerd you're probably
thinking a new ones coming out
traditionally apples release cycle has
been every June we've seen a new iphone
announced since 2007 at Apple's
Worldwide Developers Conference however
if rumors are to be believed it looks
like we might finally be breaking that
tradition and we might actually see the
iphone 5 announced in September for
release in the late September early
November timeframe certainly before the
holidays come around in the US so should
you wait if you have to have a new phone
if your phone is shattered into a
million tiny foam pieces then don't wait
if you have a phone that works you just
want one could spun shiny new and now
comes in white then your best bet is
going to be to wait until launch day get
in line and get one of the new iphone 5
or the iphone 4s who knows what they're
going to call it alright so the next
question comes also from the website
this is matt Kersey
ski hey John with all the different
phone unboxing you do with the majority
being Android is there really anything
dramatically distinguishing between them
or do they all seem to run together
after a while that's a very good
question so TechnoBuffalo we get our
hands on almost every Android phone out
and oftentimes I can do those unboxing
with my eyes closed so check it out
we've got a 4.3 inch screen with a wvga
resolution of 800 x 400 for capacitive
buttons at the bottom we've got your
menu button your home button your back
button your search button on the left
hand side you've got a volume rocker on
the right hand side I've got your power
and lock switch top 3.5 millimeter
headset jacket on the top and bottom
we've got dual news canoes cancelling
microphones on the back of gotten 8
megapixel shooter that can shoot video
and 720p and a front-facing camera that
can shoot pictures in 1.3 megapixels the
fact is a lot of these phones look
exactly the same to have exactly the
same specs with very little
distinguishing factors to them so they
do tend to blend together when you see
so many of them that doesn't mean that I
don't enjoy doing them I'm a huge phone
nerd before I started doing these videos
I used to go out and try and buy every
phone that I could and then I've used
them for a couple months and I'd sell
them on eBay or Craigslist and I lose
about a hundred dollars that buy
something new I love these phones and
even though they all do kind of blend
together doesn't take away from the
excitement of trying something new
however I do love when there is phone
that tries to break from that
traditional form factor something like a
kyocera echo might not be a phone that I
would want to use on everyday basis but
I love the fact that it exists and it's
new the HPV rats something tiny and
small we haven't seen before at
something unique so I love when these
phone companies innovate the sony
ericsson xperia play is another example
it's cool to have a gamepad there
especially if you want to get your
emulator on you can rock some super
nintendo a lot of fun so I they do blend
together but I like when things are a
little bit different as well spices up
the phone flava if you will that was my
spicy hands alright let's go to the next
question this one comes from Dahlia what
kind of kid were you in high school
nerdy I've always been on the nerdy side
of things I played sports all over
report early on high school you are
talking to a third string quarterback
right here who got in i believe two
games so I played a little bit of
football I'm not the tallest guy in the
world i'm like i like the same 5 10 but
i'm really like 59 ish I don't weigh
that much maybe a buck 65 it's always
never giant I'm from Southern California
and there were some big big kids I
remember I think was probably the first
game ever got in i went back to throw a
pass and i got sacked by a guy that
looked like a house but that's more
information than you they asked for I
was nerdy I tried to be nice sometimes
you know certainly in high school you're
not always as nice as you want to be if
I could go back I would try and be much
nicer to everyone high schools aren't
realize how hard high school can be for
a lot of people so try and be nicer
there's my general bit of advice alright
so the next question comes from patrol
Ian how do you get to naming
technobuffalo I think he's asking how
did I name technobuffalo the answer that
I like to say is I did my undergraduate
went to university if you're outside of
the US from the university of rochester
in upstate new york right near Buffalo
but the real answer is it was an
available URL I wanted to have techno in
the name and I wanted a strong identity
of strong iconography and the Buffalo
kind of liked strong you know what it
was and eventually I want to branch out
the TechnoBuffalo name so we don't want
it to just be consumer electronic I like
to have a tablet focus site I like to
even have a car focus site at some point
and I want to use that same Buffalo name
spend so long sort of branding it I
wanted at something that would be
identifiable so that is your loan answer
to your question I tend to do that the
next question comes from magic geek
magic how would I be able to get a job
like yours I am the I had I've said this
many times I wake up with a huge smile
on my face every day because I get to
live my dream I get a talking about
technology for a living now there's some
things that are hard and I don't always
enjoy it every day
but the fact that I get to do this for a
job the fact that you guys in the
audience support me enough to give me
the opportunity to do this for a job
means more to me then I could ever ever
communicate what any giveaway could ever
show it you guys are just let me live my
dream I got to do this about ninety
percent because of luck I'd good timing
I was one of the first tech guys on
YouTube that we're doing this there were
a few that sort of paved the way guys
like Chris Pirillo for example sort of
doing the tech TV thing beforehand and
they really sort of paved the way but I
was one of the early guys at least on
YouTube right now it's a very crowded
field and it's hard to sort of get in
and get noticed we've done a whole
series of advice videos on TechnoBuffalo
on advice for aspiring youtubers and how
to get noticed and how to get products
the best advice that I can give is find
your own voice be unique show your
personality brand yourself you didn't
have to go out and spend all the money
for products you can talk about trends
you can take advantage of youtube search
functionality and tagging to get your
videos to come up really the best advice
that I can give though again is just to
be yourself and let your personality try
and come through in your videos like you
watch my videos and you know that guy's
nerd and a true alright so the next
question comes from Carlos Baba John
what are your thoughts on the next
Android Ice Cream Sandwich from what you
know about it will it be a key upgrade
for users if you saw my android ramped i
ranted about android being fragmented
ice cream sandwich is going to bring the
tablet world the phone world together in
harmony there you go synergy finally
hopefully we're going to see a unified
platform hopefully they'll be carrier
support they claim that there would be
so yes Ice Cream Sandwich should unify
the platform that should greatly reduce
fragmentation which should be awesome
for developers put better apps on your
phones and should make it a little bit
easier for some of the other software
developers so let's go ahead and move on
to the next one this one comes from
twitter from gavin let's then what what
do you think mobile phones can do by
2020 hashtag
I asked to the be well if you look a
trend for mobile phones right now
they're kind of a couple cool things
going on first I think we're going to
see pico projectors and everything tiny
mini projectors that you can show
hopefully at that point it'll be full
1080p video on a bigger screen as you
want turn your phone into a full 55 inch
flat screen I guess it'd be super flat
if your wall is display I think that's
something we're definitely going to see
3d is really becoming more and more
popular by then hopefully we'll have
some sort of glasses free non
headache-inducing 3d technology
certainly will see faster and faster
processors was a quad-core octa-core
whatever 16 oak or what comes after that
30 20 core chips just gonna be faster
and faster and more RAM and more ram but
I hope that we see though is better
battery technology battery hasn't always
caught up to the phone business so
hopefully that will change and bigger
screens will have 10 inch phones 20 inch
phones you'll have to have a briefcase
to carry around your phones like you're
Zack Morris again the next question this
is the last one comes from punky pong
zeor this one's also on Twitter I didn't
extra head nod for emphasis do you think
android OS would be less laggy with
future updates had a thunderbolt and had
some issues with it for easing android
OS I don't think is very laggy I think
oftentimes what you see with Android
because it's not vertically integrated
and meeting Google doesn't make all the
hardware and the software is oftentimes
the software is not optimized take
advantage of the hardware and your
particular Thunderbolt might have been
one of those cases I know that HTC has
issued a few updates you know with
verizon service speed up that process I
don't think android is very lucky I
think oftentimes you have to do a bit of
application and resource management to
get the fastest experience possible some
people route their devices and put on
custom roms but if you just want to deal
with a stock phone i think android can
generally be pretty quick sometimes
people think it can be laggy in the
browser and oftentimes that's because
flash is on but with flash 10.3 now that
should reduce it just turn flash off
oftentimes that will really improve the
lag enos pinch-to-zoom especially with
your browsers so if you guys enjoyed
this was a long waited
the Buffalo where i answer any kind of
questions so we talked about phones we
talked a little bit about tablets
touched on them talked about how big a
nerd I was in high school we got a lot
more fun stuff coming up so stay tuned
be sure to ask your questions anything
you want some of them I might not answer
but these all these answers come
barreling out of my head i am jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and I'm
pointing again for emphasis I'll see you
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
