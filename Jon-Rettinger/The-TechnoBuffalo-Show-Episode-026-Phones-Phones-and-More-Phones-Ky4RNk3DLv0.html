of the TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your
to house for today Sean ani
editor-in-chief of the site and i'm
joined by executive editor mobile Todd
Hazleton everybody how you doing today
Todd I'm good because you know usual
yeah you and I don't ever talk before
the show ever so now I have no idea how
you're doing but I actually I listen to
this one podcast called how did this get
made and two of the three house are
married but when you first listen to the
show you don't realize that because the
husband asks his wife and Harry today
June and once I learned they were
married I was like that's the oddest
opening ever hey but just to be clear
Todd and I are not married no not yet
Christy might have some things yeah so
we're back after a short break I what
last week Todd was sick unfortunately
and was not in any shape to be doing a
podcast yeah but we are back this week
and there's not anything going on in the
world of technology nothing except for a
million things my phones and I don't
know how it works we're struggling we
have so many we have today how we're
gonna review them all bye I have I have
no clue how you guys were going to get
through all the room I mean Joey and his
crew and that's why Joey stood out here
is there in the middle of meteor view
season and now all of a sudden fall has
turned into phone review season yeah
you're saying it's unbelievable how many
phones are out there but and I guess
just in general I mean we have so much
stuff so yesterday I was at Google's
meeting in New York see where we got to
check out for the first time firsthand
because they made the Nexus
announcements online you have to see the
nexus 6 the nexus 9 though we'd seen
that a little earlier with HTC about
last week I guess and the nexus player
for the first time so it was cool to see
them all together
and we're really excited they actually
should be arriving on store shelves what
started this of November and pre night
the Nexus 6 were open yesterday so
that's crazy I forgot that you got to
see the nexus player I've ordered one
but I have not seen yet how was it oh
it's so cool like so it was basically
like set up in a demo station so they
already had it on screen and stuff like
that but um it was really awesome so you
can search for not just like by movie
but you could say like oscar-nominated
movies for 2011 and it'll bring them all
up on the screen so really cool stuff
like that so it's not just searching
like movies with the word Oscar in it
it's smarter than that and then it has
its own sort of app system so it's it's
obviously based on Android but it has so
like you know like PBS absence they're
sort of what you find on like an apple
TV right like you get your Apple TV apps
there are these apps that are dedicated
for that and a lot of them are games too
which is cool because they work with
that gaming controller and they also
would work with just the remote that
comes with it some of those games so I
thought that was neat and I'm kind of
excited to see sort of that app
ecosystem grow and so like HBO Go wasn't
there yesterday but they were like well
don't forget that it has the chromecast
functionality built in so you can always
just cast HBO GO from your Android
device to it anyway so it's just really
cool kind of super robust platform I'm
excited I don't look really great too I
might want to pick one up myself now
yeah i'm looking forward to testing out
one real quick note to charles who just
asked a question could you be a little
bit more specific i want to get to your
question but i'd like to just know a
little bit more about exactly what
you're speaking of on the problems so
yes you you've now gotten Todd to play
with the nexus 6 again everyone these
are what we're going to discuss here
today does not count as our reviews
these are from momentary hands-on with
the devices we have not the Nexus 6
we'll have more time with soon a droid
turbo I'm not sure when we'll have more
time with it but we got that we put up
our market point yes yes so that's out
okay
California I played they have it but so
we should have more coverage on us you
know yeah yeah we should okay droid
turbo looks spec-wise to be an absolute
beast yeah this crazy um but
hand-in-hand like having played with
both of these literally sort of
back-to-back day-to-day droid turbo is
cool on paper it's amazing you know I
love that there's a promise of 48 hours
of battery life which is pretty
incredible obviously you have to test
that and it says mixed usage and stuff
like that but there you go um but I
didn't get to like play with the camera
very much a 20 megapixel shooter on it
so that's exciting but when I held the
Nexus 6 I was like you know wow this is
an android phone that I I really want um
it's big but it's not I mean I'm a
phablet guy I've been carrying the note
for iphone 6 plus so to me I was like
wow this is great but I know some people
are gonna be like it's a little too big
you know write the code name I was
joking about this with Jacob actually
like the code game with shamu so it's
like a whale of a phone right but but it
just it feels awesome it's got that same
aluminum kind of framed that the Moto X
2014 has the camera I tested I was like
shooting it briefly while I was playing
with it seemed to be really really good
they had some demo pictures on there
that they'd shot Google at shot in New
York City and those looked really nice
to like zooming in it was really clear
um I don't know and and lollipop looks
really cool it's just like a total fresh
coat of paint if you have a nexus 5 i'm
sure you already played with it already
or in some fashion but i think it just
google set this to at Google i/o I think
when they talked about it like they just
made these like small animations like
when you open up a nap or like do
something and all just feels really
fluid and alive and I think that's what
I like so much about it so I'm very
impressive what I've seen so far we saw
the nexus 9 2 which excited to actually
have our review 'not nearby but we can't
review that yet we're just we're only on
first impressions right now so we'll
have to wait for for more information on
that in the coming days and weeks yeah
we have a like a double embargo on the
Nexus devices we we can unbox them
but we can't review them yet he's not
yet yeah yeah so so yeah it's just it's
interesting and you know I've never
really seen it work out this way before
that there were so many in the fall
which almost makes me wonder if the
phone companies are starting to think of
these as holiday gift-giving items yeah
and I think so in Google actually said
yesterday they kept saying in time for
the holidays in time for the holidays
this is very much you know what was once
a developer brand is so very much a
consumer brand now which is really
interesting how that sort of transformed
for Google and I saw that yesterday the
way they had the products on display
around the room they had you know sort
of like the living room here's our Nexus
player and art and you know Google's
partners can build off of that platform
and then over here our watches and over
here our phone in our tablets and it's
this whole consumer ecosystem now you
know they came out of just a couple
years ago Nexus was basically just for
developers can you can you imagine
though trying to buy someone else's
phone no I know that's what's always so
strange about like holidays right like
buy one get one free phones like I guess
you know if you're getting your wife one
and you could be like okay we're both
gonna get it let's kind of it's kind of
hard right you're gonna get a contract
excuse me yeah I just I've always put I
would not even from the contract
perspective but a phone is such a
personal item right you know because
what if the person doesn't like iOS and
you buy them an iphone and vice versa
for an Android device or even in the
Android ecosystem what if they're a
samsung fan but not in LG Fanning you
buy them a g3 right gonna have to know
I'm never gonna go down this road you
know the same with tablets I would I
would never do this right my wife's been
using HTC for a while now she's on the
last year's mom m7 um so I know excuse
me I'm still getting over this call I
know that she would she's an android fan
and she loves raised TC phones so I know
that that's probably the rad i would go
but i know it's hard yeah I i I'm
I give somebody a gift card and say this
is for a phone right but I would never
go out and buy them the actual phone I
just yeah I'd phones are way too
personal I know probably one of the most
personal thing do you have money right
exactly exactly ayo because o most I
mean people stress over these decisions
I I just thought it would never even
crossed my mind to try to do that but
speaking of all these phones there was a
very interesting tidbit of new stay out
of Samsung do you want to obey audience
in on that so Samsung marketeers down a
bit and profits from their their
smartphone division i think that's why
you know in the past we'd hear like we
sold 10 million 20 million you know
galaxy x smartphones and this year was
they were very quiet on that front and i
think ultimately now we're seeing that
in the latest earnings samsung said
they're going to switch their strategy
with their smartphones and i think in
the past what we've seen this day they
would sell you know 4 inch 5 inch 6
inches you know all these different
phones at different price points you
know like you have galaxy series then
you have other ones like their galaxy s5
or whatever that flagship and the note
and then other smaller versions in
between and now this year I think
they're going to consolidate that sounds
like they have a new strategy about
moving forward so yeah this is a very it
almost seemed apologetic mmm their
comment and you know that's what i'm
reading into it it's it seemed very like
okay yeah we know a guys we gotta change
things which is fine you know what might
have worked before it might not always
work for a company but i gotta say I've
been note for a year we just put up our
review it is a fantastic device and the
day if they stick to a strategy where
they focus on these kind of products
like that focus on materials and stuff
like that i think you know we'll see a
lot of really good things going on a
samsung yeah by no means is jumping out
of the game I think they're just there
they're really focusing a bit which I
think we can all agree they've needed
for some time
now but they have a screen size for
everything which is cool I mean
obviously I guess it's not sustainable
which is what yeah there was one tablet
release they did a while back or well it
was at CES when I went to the samsung
demo and I was I was getting so lost
trying to shoot those videos because I
was like wait which screen sizes this
one there's three different right vice
is running already here's the Galaxy
Note pro 12.2 tab for Galaxy Tab 4 7
point oh and you know so many ya know so
we're getting a lot of questions here
several about Apple pay so I want to
jump into those uh from Sean the man 34
and I know the answer on this one have
you guys used apple pay ya todd has i
have not had the chance go yeah so I've
used it twice now and all I have two
different experiences so yesterday I
tweeted Apple pay depressed me because
by the time the awkwardness and fear of
failure of using my phone to pay set in
I'd already paid and that was that uh
mcdonalds where I was like I don't look
how does this work you know I haven't
used it yet but I'm just going to do it
when I just held my phone up to the NFC
terminal and all of a sudden Apple pay
opened up it starts getting my
fingerprint that was it today have to
open the app yeah you don't do anything
like you just got pulled the phone over
it and with your with your finger on
touch ID it's really cool but then today
I was um same thing I went to McDonald's
for a coffee and I went to do it because
I was confident from the last time it
worked so well and I tapped it and I
wanted to switch the card it was using
and that it kept fumbling like because I
was I held it over the terminal and it
had like my default debit card but I
wanted to switch it and then when I went
to switch it I pulled it off and like
Apple pay disappeared and I was like ah
and then I just took out my credit card
inspectors I think that's what's gonna
happen to a lot of people yeah well the
thing is like if it's if it's not
working immediately and you're not used
to like I kind of just want to get used
to it you like my fears there's people
in line waiting behind you
come on stop fumbling you know just yeah
hey dude like how I look at people now
that write checks right yeah same thing
yeah I i I'm amazed how many people I
still see writing checks that like my
local Walmart I'm just like are you
kidding me in my generation I don't
think I've ever written a check for
anything besides like rent hey I
actually I used to carry check McClendon
on when I was like 16 to 19 or so I had
to check my wallet my checkbook with
with me everywhere hmm yeah so I I
remember those days we would get a weird
write on a piece of paper what we are
paying yeah so true it we were when we
were at it when i was at an irvine we
were going through a box of something of
John's from his brother-in-law at the
bottom there was a 45 record mm-hmm now
Todd I'm going to I'm going to hope that
you know what a 45 is yeah right I had
to explain most everyone else in the
office 1 45 s right I think there's a
couple songs about this yeah but I was
speed right it was the number of
revolutions per minute Yeah Yeah right
but yeah they're smaller records and
they had a bigger hole in the middle and
you had to put an adapter and I'm unless
your record player had an adapter built
in okay but yeah I was just like I feel
so old right now I feel so old so follow
me on that Apple pay question we have a
to hear from Charles bayonets the the
first one saying thoughts about Apple
pay and problems with it and I asked him
earlier in the show to explain what he
meant by problems and he clarified that
such as most retailers not wanting to
take it anymore CBS's backing out and
not taking it while CBS actually never
agreed to it walgreens did the CVS and
Rite Aid never were announced as
retailers yeah I think the thing um that
happened right is that where there were
NFC terminals Apple pay sort of happened
to work right like I think it works in
didn't actually is New York City I
haven't tried it yet but but these these
groups like CVS and other companies are
part of the merchant customer exchange
mcx which i guess is is working on their
own sort of mobile payment service using
QR codes called currency and I guess so
they have this consortium and the deal
is like how you you're not going to
support these other systems and I think
so they just disabled it sounds like
right like CVS I could they're no longer
taking anything that would have accepted
Apple pay because Apple pace or just
worked yeah which i think is weird like
I don't know and then but mcx says like
the retailer's know what their customers
want I think it's the other way around
customers know what they watch give
choice everybody but exactly you know I
think in the NFC payment space it's
going to be very much a whatever the
customers the customers are going to end
up choosing the winning format and this
one I feel it's uh yeah I mean there's
been so many format Wars over the years
especially in a home video with VHS beta
blu-ray HD DVD and so on which means I
always back the format that loses yeah
so whatever NFC system I settle on don't
worry folks it's going away which I have
not settled on one yet but I think that
mcx is not going to find this an easy
fight also who you come on like QR codes
yeah that that boggles my mind if you
think if I think that it's somewhat
awkward like when I was buying my coffee
today to just tap my phone I'm not gonna
like take pictures or whatever with QR
codes like that's kind of takes so much
longer I mean the Starbucks app which is
a great that's great yeah I use that
quite often and that works you're
apparently seamlessly but still it's a
little awkward in yo holding because
sometimes I have to stand there and you
know twist the phone
a little bit to get the reader to hit it
yeah but it's still quick I use it every
morning like beep yeah no I I use it
whenever I'm out of town you know could
we don't have it well we finally have a
starbucks here it's in the IV grocery
store which means it's a pain in the
butt to get to but yeah I mean whenever
I'm traveling I'm like I love this yeah
and i'm sure i will love NFC you know
once it comes more to my tena i can use
it on a more regular basis but I as for
mcx I have a lot of problems with it the
fact that it's connected to your your
bank account it is connected you know it
it's transferring information which
Apple pay does not yeah there's d
neglected right yeah there's data
collected it's transferred via the cloud
including your card number and there's a
lot of big question marks here I'm sorry
not your card number because it doesn't
work with credit cards right yeah just
bang him yeah would you make a oh I
understand you know having been a
retailer it sucks you know a lot of
people don't realize that retailers have
to pay a percentage of every credit card
they take to the credit card processor
so yeah it as a retailer it'd be great
to get rid of that you're never going to
pry credit cards from your clients hands
it's not going to happen yeah you know
and now with all these cards that also
collect points like I use a hotel card
that you know earns me points with my
chain you know I don't want to lose that
right yeah so use a delta card yeah I
mcx has got some issues you know and I
I've not used mcx I am speaking only
from the information i bred you know but
it's not alluring to me at all yeah I'd
rather stick with google wallet and
Apple pay those out google wallets not
accepted everywhere but it's accepted at
least around me sort of in the same
areas where you can pay with apple pie
and I don't know it seems to work as
well but you just have to you know
answer a pin codes of the fingerprint
which I kind of prefer
yeah as Charles just pointed out mcx has
been in development for three years and
that's great but it's still yeah I I'm
not sure about that thing from Sean the
man 34 do you ever get weird reactions
when you explain what you guys do what
you guys do for a living yes yes every
single time so that number one answer is
you get paid to do that I get that a lot
and I also get a lot of so you just play
with bones oh yeah right yeah I imagine
what it's like for Joey he's play games
yeah it's it's not an easy job to
explain in the first place and if you
don't do an absolutely perfect job the
reactions or even odder yeah yes a lot
of times i just say i work in consumer
electronics yeah but the thing that I
get quickly is I'm automatically either
like a developer or an IT guy and I'm
like honestly I have no idea because I
don't deal with IT stuff at all like we
deal with like consumer products not so
much that other side of it and then
develop it looks like if you're in tech
and you must know how to like program
too yeah upon a time I did no longer I
you know the the other thing that I love
is once your friends and family know
what you do they assume that you know
absolutely everything yeah about every
tablet every phone how to fix every
problem they've ever had on their
computer yeah yeah I there's times where
my mentors yeah oh yes I printer in two
years I don't know what to do with it I
just went my mother's printer was at
work house like I feel its installed I
don't know I finally after like an hour
I narrowed it down to her the black
cartridge that was plugged but I was
like why do you think you know what I do
why do you think I am an expert on
printers see I stopped buying printers
when the
cartridges were just expensive is just
buying a new printer and honestly I you
know cuz I didn't do a lazer bond
announced I can't forget it there's a
male knock down the road I just go there
a lot of times it's just cheaper to buy
a new printer every time you run out of
ink yeah exactly this clunky thing which
is a blows my mind that there have been
times where i'm like i need anchor II
could just buy a new printer right yeah
because it's actually gonna be about
twenty dollars cheaper okay so funny
everybody is its kind of mind-boggling
hmm um Oh from Sasha Mahal good question
in the u.s. do you guys have chip and
pin for your debit and credit cards okay
here's the funny thing that's us okay so
my first trip to England was in 2011 and
every place I went to use my credit card
just looked at me what oh yes wipe I
have both online and I finally I finally
have pit or chip cards but here's the
thing a lot of our cards even though
we're finally getting the chip are not
chip and pin their chip and signature
right which I don't know why and they
saw the extreme right mind you I think
they still have yes they still have the
magnetic strip it's I I cannot believe
we're still working with magnetic strips
in 2014 but yeah so chip and we have
chip cards now and I think by next year
or 2016 every card has to be chipped but
for whatever reason we went with chip
and signature as opposed to chip and pin
because America likes to do everything
differently hey the rest of the world's
using this other measurements us up I
think we should come up with our own
okay that's true everyone's using
centigrade let's go fahrenheit from Sean
the man 34 and also from
Roman development both of you kind of
asked the same question that's on the
Microsoft fit band yay I was like you
know it's another one but I thought it
was cool that it's cross-platform um you
know because there's not many out there
if you if you look around I guess you
have that really synced up data you have
sort of pebble but it's not even like
real fit data unless you I mean you kind
of can with the latest update so I
thought that was cool but the format's
weird right like it's it's it's
rectangular on your wrist so it's kind
of like upside down like I naturally
kind of like look at my watch like this
I don't know I have to play with it
before our judge it but yeah there's so
many fit bands on the market yeah yeah i
i'm not writing that it just so everyone
knows I'm not you know but moaning this
because it's microsoft I'm just been
moaning it because I'm like another fit
band seriously yeah you know and I I've
thought about buying some fit bands and
then every time I go to and read him
like well it decided that me writing a
motorcycle was me walking so I had all
these fake steps I'm just like then
what's the point yeah it's like even
with Android wear and and Google fit now
the app that takes advantage of the
steps and stuff on your phone um they
give different readings which is
annoying yeah so just ring up and lie to
me but just sync up and see this is seen
as I just spilled coffee on my magic
trackpad uh Todd you tried to tell me
this was a no coffee zone I get but I
have one right here so yeah I'm here
here's the idea folks just get out walk
I mean it's just just just gonna walk
don't worry about it is sad when though
when I see how little i've moved all day
though that's what I'm funny I tried
I try to get up at least once every 90
minutes and you know just walk around
for a man like every time I get a phone
call in my lane in line I go outside
nice you know yeah i just i feared
that's it okay I'm on the phone this
person needs my attention but it gives
me an excuse to get up and walk around I
do enjoy that stuff like with s else
that's the s health point five on the
node for it and probably earlier
versions it's like you haven't moved for
an hour you haven't moved for two hours
even move for three hours it's like to
take a walk and I'm like uh yeah
probably yeah this job folks does
require a lot of sitting listening guys
didn't understand Jessica nevermind yeah
we did it's actually the dusk that
John's filming at now the white desk oh
nice yeah it uh it has a motor in it and
can go up and down I've actually I've
stood at it and that was an interesting
experience it was not as it wasn't as
difficult as i expected it to be hmm and
I actually I did it for like a half hour
so I'm one of my visits out there I knew
will be a half hour but when you've
never done it before I was like okay but
uh it's kind of an interesting
experience like I liked it uh from
Nicholas Pepin drow I hope I said your
name correctly iphone 6 plus or Nexus 6
that's so tough they're both really
great-looking phones if you have an
Android at all Nexus 6 is really really
cool yeah I really like that phone um
and if you hit half an iphone i say 6
plus i like but I said I like phablet
big phones that's what I carry two right
now I've been carrying the note 4 and
the six plus two phablets and this day I
don't get the complaints about like not
fitting in jeans I don't learn super
baggy jeans and I carry two phablets so
yeah Nexus I don't know Nexus 6 is an
exciting phone and I think just in the
same way that the iphone 6 and you know
it's what Apple does for all their
products but it'll get the updates
you know each year Nexus 6 is a good bet
to because you just going to get the
latest version of Android for a couple
years to come yeah uh from Roman
development i knows that techno Buffalo
has been receiving new banners and
artworks across the YouTube channel in
Google+ page is this hanging towards a
new website design maybe lastly we we
probably have weekly conversations about
the the look of things and designs I
will say this there will be at this the
current version of techna Buffalo is
called TB 3tb for is discussed
frequently but we have no current
timeline to it but we do have a list of
features that we want to add features we
want to tweak so that there will
definitely be a TV for at some point I
just don't have a definite timeline the
right now the artwork is just artwork
it's to freshen things up although I
think it all looks great I think that's
all been done by a mark at Irvine and
he's been doing a really nice job I feel
creative but it there will be a new TV
at some point I'm just not i don't have
a timeline so it'll happen at some point
great yeah and it will be another
weekend where the week and we launched
tv3 we had so many problems oh that was
not a full 30 yeah but wasn't the first
was the first TV that was the first tee
be completely crashed and 45 seconds tv3
that was managed by John kwacha myself
and we went home on Saturday night and
got we slept for six hours and we came
back sunday morning at 9am and we were
we were here for 25 hours yeah oh it was
awesome I went home and napped for three
hours of K back I was like all right
would you guys find broken like napped
because I knew this up they had two
broken logs gone oh let's see we got a
lot of questions here so let me uh oh
this is a this is a tough one from sasha
baja one plus one or nexus 6 and why
Nexus 6 I don't know what I could just
say that right after that I really like
the one post one I bought one myself I I
don't know man i'm in love with the
nexus 6 I think you're just like it
feels great it looks great maybe it's
lollipop maybe I don't know and I love
cyanogenmod to on on the wall post wow
that was great I don't know I got my
George is really kind of dropped when I
finally helped the next 26 yesterday I
was like wow we've actually got a
question here from Twitter someone
tweeted to me from shabam Kaylee I hope
I said your name correctly what Samsung
HTC or Apple make a cheap smartphone
like the Moto G Apple wooden without
doubt um I don't see why Samsung
wouldn't though I feel like team some
sort of has but not really I mean
they're not they're not like pure
Android and not targeted that way
they're sort of just released to
different markets yeah I don't know
maybe maybe that's what samsung's new
strategy this year will be though I mean
if they're tweaking the way they do
things they could potentially take the
motorola sort of model and have this
like entry level and then you know just
split it up between flagships instead of
having like 40 different phones yeah now
I I don't know oh here's a question from
sasha baja about when did each version
of t be launched I actually can remember
this fairly well nice tb1 launched
oktober 2009 db2 launched January 2011 I
remember that because we got the final
code as john and i arrived in vegas for
CES and we launched TV 2 from john's
hotel room etsy ad and it's now writing
joke between John I because that did not
work so
well it's been running joke between John
and I that we're gonna go to a hotel
every time we launched a new versions
tb3 was like a little over a year ago I
don't remember the exact time though but
yeah I can vividly remember the teacher
already over here ago yeah this is an
amazing how time flies yeah that's
unbelievable to me how fast time flies
anymore uh okay let's see here I saw 1
i'm on the other it is from charles van
ness do you have any thoughts on the
ipad air 2 in the mini 3 and why they
didn't upgrade the internal specs well
they did upgrade the internal specs on
the air too yeah satiate a8x processor
right I don't know why they did that I'm
still trying to figure out why they
remove the rotation switch yeah maybe
just to fit things in the right places
that's all I can figure but man does
that's not convenient um as for the mini
three blah ah I don't know what they
were thinking there is literally a
fingerprint reader different yeah and
then you color right cool oh well let me
let me just like get the two you don't
need a touch ID on exactly I will say
this after having touch ID on the iPhone
I do find myself quite often with my
ipad air going oh yeah right it's right
but there wasn't enough difference with
the ipad air 2 this year for me to
upgrade I I I was at an Irvine when it
was announced and I talked to John about
it when he got back from the apple event
and he's like don't do it cuz you know
next year there's going to be major
differences right so I I'm holding out
for a year and I'm not gonna have good
guy I've honestly what tempted me the
most upgrade wasn't touch ID but the 64
gigabytes now being the same prices 32
good yeah that's nice yeah cuz
I use my iPad extensively especially
when I'm traveling to watch movies and
stuff and so I'm always like uh I can
only fit three movies on I know first
world problems I know ah you know but
with like I've got a trip to England
coming up I'd like to have more than
three movies on my iPad mmhmm yeah I'm
not going to do that just for another 32
gigabytes of space and a fingerprint
reader yeah yeah uh speaking of movies
from Sasha be hall which Marvel
Cinematic Universe movie are you looking
forward to some or all of them from 2015
onwards um this is clearly more in my
wheel if anyone had come to me say ten
years ago and said there's going to be a
Black Panther movie and Inhumans movie
I've first said who are you and what are
you doing in my bedroom and then I would
ask them what hallucinogen they were on
I i love the fact that i'm living in a
time where people have finally realized
what I've known about comic books since
I was four years old that these are
great stories that they are a just a
endless well of great entertainment and
so it's very rewarding to me to see that
finally being recognized by mainstream
media I'm excited for all of them the
civil war story for Captain America's
should be a great one the idea that i'm
going to see the infinity war which is
the Infinity Gauntlet story in the
comics the idea that i'm going to see
that spread over two movies on the big
screen my brain explodes its concept I
mean I know nothing but still to see see
it actually up on a screen and say you
know part 1 and part 2 infinity war I'm
just like up so I'm excited for all of
them I really really excited you know at
marble has I remember when Marvel was
bankrupt I remember when there was a lot
of scuttlebutt in the industry that
marble was going to be a ram
did 12 months and they did everything
they could have pulled themselves out
and then Disney stepped in and bought
them you know so it's mind-boggling to
me to see Marvel going so we've done
seven billion dollars every 10 movies
and I remember when their stock was 25
cents on the Nasdaq Wow and I was trying
to sleep together money to buy as much
marble stuck as I could because I knew
that couldn't last yeah but yeah so now
I'm looking forward to all of them I i
think they announced a great slate and
I'm thrilled that characters like black
panther finally going to be known by the
wider world and in humans and Captain
Marvel and so I'm very very excited um
actually Sean the man we've already
answered this house the ipad air 2 worth
the upgrade from my ipad 2 3 no well no
I take that back from a 2 3 yes I think
so yeah from from an ipad 2 or 3 yes I I
would say it's worth the upgrade from an
ipad air no it's not enough there yeah
I'm sure there'll be a lot going on next
year uh let's see Oh interesting
question from Henry Kaler oh hi question
for a gaming user like me in gaming
terms should i buy the iphone 6 4.7 or
the nexus 65.9 please help if you're
gaming I'd get with the bigger scheme
but your screen definitely because then
you have to kind of consider that iphone
6 plus i think in terms of games
available they're pretty all the good
games are available on both platforms at
this point there's still some exclusives
on itune well it goes either way yeah
there's lose both drugs heck I saw a
fire phone exclusive game today right so
for all ages ago they were like oh yeah
there you go you got an exclusive game
guys I would just go with the biggest
screen you can for gaming I like gaming
on like I said three times or hit show
i'm a family guy so I like
outer screen especially for gaming and
movies on you know when you're riding
the train or something like that and so
I like big screens that I came that bad
yeah everybody ya go always go with the
bigger screen for gaming and to be
honest though um when i play android
games i really like the it's not game
center which it called play game google
play games i guess like the achievements
and stuff i think are a lot better on
android vs game center on iOS for like
they're kind of like worthless but like
as your gaming now and a lot of the
games have achievements in them you know
pops up and it's like you've done this
and now your level and like level 12 or
something in the android like Google
Play I like that aspect of it all yeah
exactly the achievement guy Android
seems like a freakin video from Sean the
man 34 or will amazon give up on making
a phone or do you think they will try
again little boy oh that's a tough one I
guess they're not gonna try again but
who knows I mean they took it back on
that they're sitting on 83 million
dollars worth of fire phones yeah I mean
if they do it again I have to rethink
the strategy sell it unlocked on their
site direct at a low cost like Motorola
model yeah and then I'm sure that'll do
well the phone's not very that was the
whole that was the number one problem
with the fire phone was that they did
not follow the motorola model yeah i
mean not that we're saying motorola came
up with the ultimate system but when you
think amazon you think lower price and
they came out with a flagship phone
price for a phone that didn't match the
price yeah exactly yeah I'd lucid ATT
and contract and all that was just dead
I really I don't know if they will try
again they took a huge bath they've got
success with the tablets they've got
success with the e-readers so why drag
themselves back down with another phone
yeah I read your like an Amazon
shareholder review like are you kidding
me you're doing this again and
they flop again that I don't think
they'll do it hopefully not I mean there
were rumors that they were building like
two or three phones right but now we
haven't heard anything and maybe those
are all yeah see uh from e wat buys
which do you think is better Nexus night
or iPad air 2 funky it's so hard
comparing android/ios just totally
different platforms and I use them both
and like them both um yeah I don't
really have an answer to that I again
that really that comes down to which
operating system you prefer more and
more we talked about on the show the
ecosystem that you're sort of in yeah
look it it doesn't make to me if you're
if you own an iPhone to me it doesn't
make as much sense to then buy an
android tablet and vice versa because
you might as well stay in the ecosystem
where you're already buying your books
and your movies in your music so that
you can access them on both you know
your messages are coming in on both your
email accounts I just feel like you get
the most out of your tablet and your
phone if you stay in the same ecosystem
for both and that's where it's going
across the board so I don't know that
there's an answer like which is better
because it's really which one are you
most invested in and do you want the
best experience from that a totally
agree yeah totally agree a fun question
from Sean the man 34 uh why do you guys
choose live where you are now and not
move out to irvine well the thing is we
California's beautiful California's
beautiful is absolutely nothing against
irvine I at least in my case being older
I was very very established in Missouri
when I got hired by technobuffalo uh you
know I have a home here I have property
here I have a farm here I mean I have
I'm very established here so moving for
me would be a major major change for me
also along with the fact that everything
out there's far more expensive
I was looking for me I'm right here near
New York City yeah I mean for me though
you know I whenever I get into urban I
go grocery shopping as soon as I get
there yo for the week you pick up stuff
you know water drinks whatever for the
room I look at the price I paid their
compared to what I pay here like wow
okay uh so yeah frying at least for my
case I was very very established here in
Missouri Todd a yeah I guess my age I'm
just born and raised on the east coast
my whole family's here my wife works
here as well right across we're right
across the river from manhattan so oh
we've just been here for a while and on
that note we actually have a lot a lot
of meetings in New York City so for me
and mobile I'm you know once or twice a
week at least going in isn't to meet
with somebody so you know I keep trying
to convince John that we need to have
one of the future right or summits you
know here in kirksville yeah we've moved
them around I just don't understand why
we haven't had one in kirksville yet you
should I we totally should and John's
Kyle stares at me blankly when I bring
