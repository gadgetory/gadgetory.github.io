wanted to be a demonstration of the
touchstone inductive charger for the new
palm create for sprint I should mention
that this does not come with every Palm
Pre it is actually $70 add-on well it
might seem a little bit gimmicky and
it's really just another way to charge
it does have some very cool uses let me
go ahead and show you what they are
first when you buy the touchstone you
get a new back for the Palm Pre it's
actually a matte back as opposed to the
stock glossy back that comes with the
device let me take this case off and
show you why you get a different one so
after some serious prying we got the
back of the pre off and let me show
differences between the touchstone
backing and the standard backing that
comes with the pre here is the standard
and glossy back definitely a fingerprint
magnet and notice that it's just
straight plastic with the speaker vent
and the camera and flash ports the back
of the touch touchstone backing is
actually matte like I said and I'll show
you why it is matte in just a moment
first thing you'll notice is a magnet
right there to help it stick to the
touchstone and those two metal pieces
which help make a connection to the back
of the device right there so this is
Matt to actually help it stick to the
back of the touchstone it's got a little
bit of a magnet in it as well but the
Matt helps it from sliding around let's
go ahead and put this on and give you a
demonstration as to how the touchstone
works so the touchstone itself is
actually very cool let me show you why
I'm putting a decent amount of pressure
here to try and hit it and it's not
moving you figure that it's sticking
there either via some sort of adhesive
or suction cup and actually neither of
those are the case Tom used what they're
saying as a simulation of gecko feet
what geckos use to climb up walls and
climb up trees and stick on leaves it's
actually very interesting it does feel a
little bit sticky but not much and this
is actually so tacky it you can stick it
almost to a wall let me give you a
demonstration of that I'm gonna go ahead
and pull the camera back here and here's
the side of a wood desk I'm gonna take
the touch down
and stick and it sticks very well
actually
sheelane to magnet on the Prius I'm
trying enough to stay there but that
goes to show you just how strong it is
and actually it is very nice
and it prevents prevents the Prix from
moving around when it's on the charger
let me go ahead and move the camera back
here yes can see my desk set it down and
zoom right back in so let's go ahead and
demonstrate what this is we'll take the
pre put it on and you casually feel it
stick with the magnet and make a
connection and you'll get a notification
that the battery is charging and that's
it when you wake up in the morning pull
it off and you're good to go if you want
to charge at night or put on your desk
you just throw it on and that's it
really is a very simple concept now the
touch zone itself is not wireless it
actually uses palms micro USB plug it
right in to the back of the device and
that's connected to USB which can plug
into the wall of en adapter really is a
very simple really elegant process it
definitely adds a touch I think it's
such a clasp to the Palm Pre and also
it's kind of cool that uses gecko feet
technology you know nature for the win I
guess anyway it certainly it's not a
necessity to get a pre but it is kind of
a cool thing to have and certainly
sparks in conversation
so just a real short demonstration of
the touchstone inductive charging
technology for the Palm Pre hope you
guys enjoy it for exclusive content be
sure to follow me on Twitter twitter.com
slash John for Lakers see you guys the
next one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
