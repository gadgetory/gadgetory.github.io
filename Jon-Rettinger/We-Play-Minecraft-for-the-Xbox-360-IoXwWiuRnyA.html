TechnoBuffalo calm and I'm here with a
look at Minecraft for the Xbox 360
alright so if you've played this block
breaking and placing came from the guys
at Mojang and you probably are
recognizing everything that you see
right now at its core minecraft in the
Xbox 360 minecraft xbox 360 edition is a
very very very much line craft there are
right now I'm actually changing my
settings I fell on a pit and I actually
had no torches on me decide to raise the
gamma all the way up to like hundred
percent in order to see made things
brighter but it also made things
extremely washed out when I fell down
I've been this in this game in this map
for maybe five hours I don't know most
of it's just been goofing around and
exploring with the Xbox 360 version of
Minecraft you're actually given a map as
soon as you start out so you have a map
and I don't think anything else in your
inventory the game actually has a
tutorial which is completely new to the
Minecraft experience and in some ways
that might actually be a downside
playing Minecraft for the first time if
you were a member of the early beta
stages or even the Alpha stages the game
was very much about not knowing you're
just sort of dropped into a world at
least when there were mobs you were just
sort of dropped into a world without any
supplies really only your fists and just
told to live as night falls the first
time in that world you find that Dom
bees come out and skeletons with bows
and arrows you try to murder you
which is kind of scary but they're weird
derpy groans but as you can see right
now from looks alone it is very much
minecraft I'll get to the inventory
system as soon as I get back to my cabin
but for now this is what the game looks
like
all right so those nights falling here I
didn't want to open up my inventory and
just show you guys what it looks like
this is actually the crafting system you
press X wherever you are to open this up
and this is either gonna make you cranky
or fall in love with the game with the
Xbox 360 version of Minecraft your
crafting system actually has every
single recipe built in rather than being
presented with a 2x2 or 3x3 grid you're
given a full list of everything that you
could possibly make in the game and then
the exact recipe for it in terms of
convenience this is awesome essentially
the furnace that I open up here in terms
of convenience this is awesome
I mean you don't have to remember any
recipes enough that they were that hard
to begin with but you don't have to go
looking up oh did I do I put the bow and
arrow strings on the right side of the
Left it's right there and it also tells
you what you need to build the exact
things that you're looking for so you're
not spending any time online it's all
contained to your xbox 360 you also have
this info pane you press the right
bumper whenever you're over and over
anything in your inventory and they'll
tell you exactly what that object is
what it can be used for and what it does
even with items like meat it'll tell you
how much health it restores when you get
into the crafting menu here just says
restores health for this single piece of
meat which I'm actually gonna cook up
the inventory system works the crafting
system works very well it does kind of
think that you're using a controller as
opposed to a keyboard and mouse I mean
it's the obvious drawback as soon as you
install this game as man I'm gonna have
to manage my inventory and all this
stuff with a controller rather than a
nice community keyboard and mouse in
some ways some things operate faster but
in most ways
they don't so and here's the full
crafting system so literally everything
that you could possibly make it just has
the recipes straight there for you
it's literally no time spent thinking
about things are wondering how to create
things it's just all on hand like I said
it earlier when I talked about the
tutorial you will either love this so
you hate it you might love the fact that
all this stuff is convenient and if
you're a veteran when in the Minecraft
world this might not bother you at all
cuz you already know all the recipes and
it's nice having this recipe book so
that you don't have to put everything
together in everything together piece by
piece if you're new to Minecraft you
might not know the difference from my
perspective you are missing out a little
bit here because there's none of that
mystery that you experienced when you
first played the game
finally the game does offer leaderboards
I've only played the game uneasy so far
like I said I've just fired up this one
Matt built a cabin and kind of explored
for a few hours
flooger boards are nice are a great way
for statistics to be represented and a
nice way for you to feel important right
now I'm in the top 100 but that's
probably because not very many people
have played otherwise I want to thank
you guys for watching and stay tuned to
TechnoBuffalo
we're gonna have more of these gameplay
videos as time goes on thanks guys I
appreciate it take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
