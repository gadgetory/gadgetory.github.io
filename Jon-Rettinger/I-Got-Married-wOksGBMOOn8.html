my life and I just wanted to sort of
share it with you I know a lot of you

technology news and maybe you're not
interested in this sort of personal
stuff but some of you guys I feel like
I've gotten to know you and maybe you
feel like you've gotten to know me a
little bit as well so I wanted to share
my excitement with you so what this also
means is that by the time you're

to be flying somewhere over the Atlantic
Ocean on my way to Europe for my
honeymoon we are doing sort of a
Mediterranean tour we've got a 10-day
cruise where we stomp in Italy we stop
in Greece we stop in Turkey and Croatia
and we're spending a few days before the
cruise in Rome and a few days afterwards
in Venice

about 16 days I've got a series of
videos that are sort of queued up
certain topics that I want to discuss
there we're necessarily time sensitive I
hope you guys sort of enjoyed the
content that we have coming that's a
little bit of a vacation for me as well
and is notice in my video track sort of
been going nonstop for a while looking
forward to sort of just stepping back
for a little bit when I return on the

normal schedule there'd be a lot of
stuff to sort of cover TechnoBuffalo is
