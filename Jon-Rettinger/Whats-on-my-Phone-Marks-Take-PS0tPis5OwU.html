from TechnoBuffalo and today i'm here to
show you what's on my android device I
know how much you guys love John's video
and I thought I'd share what's on my
phone and show you guys how it looks so
let's get on with the video so to get
things started for you guys I'm using
the one plus one is my daily driver and
CyanogenMod 11s is just amazing
definitely much better than stock
Android you can customize so many things
and I think that's what I love about the
oneplus one it's running stanitch amount
11s out of the box anyways you're here
to see what's on my android so let's get
started for the lockscreen
I wanted something simplistic yet
something that I could see myself using
on an everyday basis so I'm using AC
display the design is simple it displays
all of my notifications in a really cool
way and it just works for me there's
even an option to use the sensors inside
your phone so when you pick up your
phone the display would automatically
turn on it's a lot like active display
on the Moto X but I actually like the
design of AC display more now for the
launch here I'm using Nova Launcher
prime it's a great launcher and it works
really well on the oneplus one you can
pretty much customize almost everything
on your home screen and I love the
Android L animation when launching or
closing an app now moving on to the
first page of my home screen is my today
calendar widget this is probably my
favorite widget so far it's very
simplistic and it shows exactly what's
in my agenda for today or for what I
have for the next couple of days and the
second page is another widget and this
one's called dash clock it basically
shows all of my notifications in one
single page and it's an extension base
widget meaning you can add third-party
extension for certain apps and have
notifications display on here now for my
main home screen this is pretty much my
standard home page at the very top I
have my contacts calendars gallery and
camera then there's Google Maps and
YouTube right below it then at the very
bottom I have my Nova launch or Settings
app the Google Playstore Gmail and
settings now if we jump into the fourth
page which is where all my third-party
apps are we have facebook talon which is
a great alternative for the twitter app
instagram vsco cam then right below that
I have my Fuji Wi-Fi app for my Fuji xe2
I have snapchat and of course we always
have to have speed tests because here at
TechnoBuffalo we're pretty crazy about
our internet speeds the right neck
suid I have square ins to pick if I ever
want to crop a picture for Instagram now
don't play video games all that much but
since we have a twitch channel now I'm
really getting more into gaming so I
have Real Racing 3 PBA challenge which
is a bowling game quiz up which can be
really addicting and of course
clash of clans and the next page is
simply just a calculator widget if I
ever need to do simple calculations I
have that handy before I move on I know
you guys are probably wondering what
icon pack I'm using and I'm actually
using the Elune icon pack which you can
download from the Google Play Store for
a buck or two
I love the circular flat design and it
works well under 1+1 now my notification
area and settings app or themes sort of
like Android L and I actually downloaded
the orange lollipop apk on
xda-developers so if you ever want to
download it just do a simple google
search and I'm sure you'll find it you
do however need to be running Santa Jo
mod 11 to use this theme so just be
aware of that anyways that's it for this
quick video guys I hope you guys find
this video interesting and if you guys
have any questions just leave them in
the comments down below
a Marklin Sangam from TechnoBuffalo i'll
see you guys in the next one thank you
