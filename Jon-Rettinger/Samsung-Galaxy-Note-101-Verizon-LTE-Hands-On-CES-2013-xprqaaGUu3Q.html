car of CES how's it going guys I'm Aaron
Baker from TechnoBuffalo we're live at
CES 2013 in Las Vegas it's not even day
one yet we're at Pep calm which
historically has happens right before
the event and when it kicks off at the
show this is the samsung galaxy note
10.1 on verizon now we've seen this
device before it's been on other
carriers and been out in a Wi-Fi variant
but what we're seeing now is it on
verizon so if you can see in the bottom
right hand corner you've got 4g LTE
capabilities on horizon specs wise
you're packing a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core
processor a 10.1 inch display a 5
megapixel camera a front-facing camera
then you've got android 4.0 on here as
well as Samsung's TouchWiz user
interface let's take a look and see what
comes out of the box so one of the menu
and take a look at some of the
applications and really you know
fundamentally it's not that different
from the galaxy note 10.1 we've seen in
the past you're obviously going to see
the verizon wireless pre-installed stuff
stuff like mobile hotspot my verizon
mobile and of course we scroll back over
here VZ navigator and video calling as
well those are verizon applications then
you see the samsung applications like
AllShare Play amazon kindle crayon
physics just running android 4.0 the
Samsung's TouchWiz user interface you
can see really the TouchWiz elements
here in the menu and in the system setup
and you've got home right here and i can
scroll back and forth between my various
menus which i have five right now so
very similar terms the look and feel but
what you do get is the S Pen out of the
box as well so it's really a content
creation type device which is something
that I really like you can draw on the
screen you can take notes and its really
intended for multitasking so you can see
with this out I can quickly take
screenshots which is really nice I can
double tap and bring out a note and type
80 be like that and save that so it's
great for signing contracts great for
content creation drawing on the screen
and more you can use this pretty
natively in quite a few of the
applications and this is a great feature
to on selected applications within the
device itself you can multitask so for
example I have the web browser pulled up
right now I've got google pulled up and
I can move back and forth and shift it
backwards and forwards give it more
space on the screen and I'm done
multitasking I can just cancel it out
and go right back to the home screen so
like I said you can do this in email and
web browse
it really makes this device functional
I'm perfect from multitasking so if
you're looking at something in terms of
what has an edge of an iPad or even an
ipad mini this could be the device for
you and it's coming soon to verizon
wireless keep it locked on technobuffalo
be sure to follow us on facebook at
facebook.com slash technobuffalo i'm on
twitter aaron c baker the company's on
twitter at technobuffalo you know what
we'll see you next time much more
coverage to come from CES 2013 thanks
again to ford
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
