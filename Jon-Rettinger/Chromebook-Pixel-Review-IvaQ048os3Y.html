TechnoBuffalo here and today we are with
the $1,300 wonder this is the Chromebook
pixel Google's emphatically I'm not sure
who asked this guy does bring a lot to
the table as far as cloud computing
modern design and a lot of pretty killer
specs let's go ahead and take a first
look at the Chromebook pixel and see if
it should be your next laptop alright so
we are here with the Chromebook pixel a
fine example of Google's really
impressive industrial design but those
good looks actually go beneath the skin
this guy's got some pretty nice specs as
well so let me get this out of the way
first cuz it's really gonna be the giant
elephant in the room it's got a $1,300
price tag to go with it that's not the
LTE version it's actually $12.99 if you
want the LTE version you have to pony up
an extra 200 bucks to jump to $1500 so
not cheap at all this laptop is not
geared to the average consumer Google's
smart enough to know they're not gonna
sell these guys in bulk this is a
essentially a readily available
developer's unit that they might want to
get in hands for folks that want to
start coding for Chrome OS operating
system it's running
there are chrome boxes there are other
Chromebooks and other sort of chrome
products Google's hoping to get onto the
market and this is sort of the flagship
product for that Google is under no
disillusions that they're gonna sell a
billion of these it's gonna be a
mass-market item I just wanted to get
that sucker out of the way so from a
spec standpoint it's got a Core i5
processor clocked at 1.8 gigahertz
it's got Intel's relatively capable HD
graphics that's the 4000 that is
integrated from a port standpoint it's
got um it's not overwhelming with high
power it's got two USB 2.0 ports mini
DisplayPort an SD MMC card reader
unlike previous Chrome OS laptops or
desktops that we've seen there's one
actually has a pretty decent amount of
on-board storage
it's got 32 gigs of SSD which is gonna
result in obviously a very fast file
access but also incredibly quick boot up
times certainly you'd expect that from
an SSD but Chrome OS is really meant for
those quick boot ups and it works really
this is one of the fastest boot ups I've
ever seen on a laptop so the big deal
here it's named the pixel it's all about
this guy the screen this is probably the
best screen I have ever seen on a laptop
it's a twelve point eight five inch
affair with 4.3 million pixels it's got
a resolution of 2560 by 1700 it's
actually means it has the highest pixel
density of any laptop ever with 239 it
is absolutely incredible it's got a 117
inch wide viewing angle as well so you
can view it from really any spot
augmented with four gigs of RAM as I
mentioned 32 gigs on the SSD if you opt
for the LT version you're gonna get an
extra couple gigs and go to 64 all right
so let's talk a little bit more about
the screen it is beautiful it's also
incredibly glossy I can pretty much wave
at the camera and you could see it here
in direct sunlight this is going to be
borderline unusable so keep that in mind
depending on how you want to use it I
like most laptops coming out now this is
a touchscreen and it works very well it
supports multi-touch I'm pretty smooth
scrolling so I'm go ahead and give an
example go ahead and launch
TechnoBuffalo here and you can scroll
with your finger if you want to get the
same desktop experience that you get
anywhere else you can scroll down
multi-touch is here we have not been
able to get pinch-to-zoom are they
working on any website where it would
work ordinarily if you were on a tablet
so something to bear in mind here I'm
not gonna talk that much about Chrome OS
we've talked about it at length but
little bits will filter into this review
video looks absolutely tremendous on
here I'll show an example of some of the
most common videos you'll probably watch
YouTube and also if you can hear if it's
gonna translate the speakers on this guy
are pretty outstanding for a laptop this
is small and this thin let me go enjoy
you what its gonna sound like
so like that goat would say yeah it
sounds pretty good here it's very
surprising
what is also surprising is the battery
life it's got five hours of battery life
you'd expect much much much more from
essentially a web of only operating
system Chrome OS is essentially a Chrome
browser with apps there's a decent
amount of app support but not a giant
amount there all the stuff that you'd
want to do ordinarily on a laptop you're
gonna have a hard time finding an
equivalent here you have to go ahead and
browse a chrome store and even then not
all the apps are going to function
properly
Google is hoping though you can overlook
that they're gonna give you a free
terabyte of Google Drive storage so you
know that's kind of awesome if you want
to store all your files in the cloud
you've got sort of a taskbar launch bar
down here which is now totally
touchscreen you can have go ahead and
launch that up you can actually view
files and have a native file explorer
which is really nice addition to the
newest version here of Chrome OS and go
ahead and view your file just like you
would so if you want to minimize
something all you have to do is just tap
the icon down below either with your
finger or the trackpad and speaking of
the trackpad it is really good it's a
very large wide trackpad not sure what's
made out but it's got sort of a glossy
feel to it I know it works extremely
well for multi-touch scrolling as you
scroll up and down it is extremely
smooth so Google's done a very nice job
incorporating multi-touch into the
trackpad alright so the keyboard here is
absolutely outstanding it's a chiclet
style that was really made popular by
apple's keyboards but other
manufacturers have been using it for
years as well but there are some
oddities here gone is a caps locks and
got a chrome specific search button here
we don't have a function road dedicated
but you have a ton of function keys if
you don't have a typical f1 f2 but you
have some shortcuts that line the top of
its keyboard and typing experience is
really outstanding and it worked very
well I've got a 720p front-facing camera
here obviously for web chat or you might
want to do for our new Google hangout
I'm sure Google is hoping you will
utilize pictures here also quite
obviously very good-looking so I'm gonna
go and give an example I will use the
wallpaper here they're full HD
wallpapers so you have with your quota
number right
you go ahead and take two fingers tap
down I didn't go ahead and set wallpaper
and so give us sort of a nice sense of
how images look and they do look
absolutely gorgeous on the screen
assuming you're getting a nice high-res
image oh and go to the next one things
just look absolutely beautiful here
we'll keep that one it looks like a
Google serene Twilight so everything
else here is kind of as you'd expect
build quality is absolutely tremendous
here it's probably one of the best
feeling best-looking laptops I've ever
seen I love the glowing light on the
back it serves no purpose as of yet
other than is looking really cool and
it's something certainly unique to this
laptop so the chrome badging here is
really solid I like that you've got one
right above the keyboard and one on the
back on the piano hinge one nice thing
about the hinge is well certainly going
to deal with touchscreens it's pretty
tight hinge so as you're touching this
it's not going to move back too much
it's obviously a little bit of give but
certainly better than what I've seen on
some other laptops and sort of Windows
eight ultrabooks that also utilise touch
screen or Windows eight laptops in
general so the big thing here obviously
is price we talked about that when we
first started at thirteen hundred bucks
is it clearly not geared for the
mass-market you can get much better
value elsewhere you've got the Microsoft
Surface tablet so slew of Windows eight
ultrabooks Windows 8 tablets and Windows
8 laptops and desktops you're pretty
much a Macbook price here as well for a
few hundred dollar difference this is
not a computer you get if you want mass
productivity obviously want to play
games doing a service video editing who
is this good for really just developers
if you want to develop for Chrome OS
obviously this is gonna be the flagship
product to learn how to do it with
alright for considering picking one of
these up and you're not a developer
you're gonna get a great web only
experience you're gonna be able to you
know browse the web using Chrome play
videos doing Chrome but that's really it
you're probably better suited to pick up
a tablet whether you want a Nexus device
is going to stay with Google or look
towards an iPad but this is for media
consumption this is not media creation
at all but with that in mind Google's
done a really nice job they're not
masquerade eNOS is anything other than
what it is they're not saying it's a
laptop for everybody they're not saying
it's a laptop for gamers or heavy video
editors it doesn't pretend to be
anything else then it's an unpretentious
in doing it it's got a trim
this green it's got a great web browser
it's got one of the best keyboard and
touchpad experiences I've seen but this
is not a product that would ever
consider using on a regular basis and
you shouldn't either
unless you want to start coding and
creating your own apps for Google Chrome
there are way less expensive options if
you want to try Chrome OS very cheap
Chromebooks very cheap Chrome boxes and
soon we'll probably see Chrome on
televisions as well this is not the one
to get if you want any sort of
productivity but if you want a code and
you want a gorgeous screen you're gonna
enjoy the Chromebook just don't go in
thinking you're gonna play some games
