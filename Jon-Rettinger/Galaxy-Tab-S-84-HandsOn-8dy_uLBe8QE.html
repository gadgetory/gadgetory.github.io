TechnoBuffalo I'm here in a meeting so
it might be a little loud I might be a
little quiet but we're checking out the
brand new samsung galaxy tab s that's
the name of the family and what they're
going to be marketed under but this is
the 8.4 inch version you can see the
screen right there it's super amo led
some rumors have pointed to that and now
we finally have it's the first time in a
while that Samsung's added this
technology to its display you're looking
at super sharp it's 2560 by 1600 pixel
resolution and it's incredibly thin
samsung says thinner than about five
credit cards stacked up together you can
see the nice metallic look around on the
bottom there the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack with a single speaker
micro USB port regular home buttons
there that we've seen before 2.1
megapixel front facing camera another
speaker up top then on the right you've
got your power button the volume buttons
and this could be I guess the top two
course isn't like this you've got the IR
blaster that we've seen before that's a
micro SD card slot for adding up to an
additional 128 gigabytes of storage
right now there's going to be 16 on
board when you get it and then a sim
card slot which exists carriers but we
don't have any news on that just yet but
check the website will update as we go
on on the back here you've got the 8
megapixel camera and then this this nice
i dotted look that we had on the galaxy
s5 and then these new snap buttons here
that allow you to pop in new cases that
Samsung is going to be releasing I'll
just go through the software real quick
samsung said the goal is to create the
same sort of experience that we saw with
the galaxy s5 so the software is not
changing much but you do get
applications like paper garden which
brings you right to your magazines again
senseless trying to a show off just how
beautiful the display is and here's the
video we can kind of show you a stunning
it looks and the viewing angles is
another thing that Samsung's trying to
highlight here and the high contrast
ratio so you get a super dark blacks
there and some really bright whites this
is powered under the hood by three gigs
of ram and you also get a
she knows five processor and that's
octa-core so pretty awesome in there and
you can see I'm using it even with just
one hand moving it around really quickly
because it's so easy to hold just want
to give you a quick look here first look
at the galaxy tab s just how azle tune
with TechnoBuffalo thank you guys for
watching please subscribe right here be
the first ones to know whenever new
videos get uploaded we got a ton of
stuff we do phones tablets cars anything
has to do a consumer electronics that's
be plugged in or uses batteries we
