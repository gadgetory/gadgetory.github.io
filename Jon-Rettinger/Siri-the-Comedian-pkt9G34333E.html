from TechnoBuffalo here regardless of
how you feel about the iPhone 4s there's
no doubt that Siri is one of its most
intriguing new features well assigned
for making appointments and telling you
the weather syria has a decent sense of
humor as well and quite a personality
let me show you what I mean
alright so as I've been using my iPhone
4s I'm noticing that Siri well she likes
to talk and boy can she tell a story so
let me show you some of the funniest
things that Siri can do at least the
ones that I found if you found any that
are funnier or interesting leave me the
comments down below so I'm going to go
ahead and activate Siri how much wood
would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck
could chuck wood so sometimes you'll say
that sometimes she'll say something
different how much wood would a
woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
chuck wood I should give me the same
answer alright let's try another one
tell me a joke tell me a joke it'd be
funnier if it ended with and one person
left a prototype in a bar alright so
let's try one more question this is when
your parents should've told you where do
babies come from
baby stores got it clever alright let's
get to know her a little bit better here
what's your favorite color my favorite
color yes well I don't
how to say it in your language it's sort
of greenish but with more dimensions so
I have a little bit more personality
there let's try one more knock knock
knock who's there Jonathan Jonathan who
well I don't do knock-knock jokes Thank
You Syria so let's find out what she
looks like
what do you look like sorry I don't
understand what you look like what do
you look like
does my appearance matter to you sure
does Jonathan I don't understand sure
does
so alright let's try a few more and see
we can get some meaning of life what is
the meaning of life 42 so for new you
Douglas Adams fans you'll recognize that
from life the universe and everything
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy alright
so let's see what else series got in
store she's got a few more funny things
in here I need to hide a body are you
looking for I'll stop that stop it okay
where do you come from nope
where do you come from
I Siri was designed by Apple in
California so sometimes it takes a few a
few chances to get Syria right let's try
one more Siri who's your daddy who's
your daddy my daddy yes yes that's what
I thought
so a little bit skating there let's say
you get nice and personal with Siri and
you won't ask her to marry you will you
marry me my am Jews your licensing
agreement does not cover marriage my
apology so the moral is serious some
personality and there's a lot of fun
stuff and as you use it you can ask it
and you see what it'll say let's try one
more
do you like when I push your home button
and honestly you just ask it random
questions and Scott answers already
stored you can see that sometimes not so
accurate but it's definitely a lot of
fun Siri has an incredible amount of
answers to questions so if you have an
iPhone 4s you have a friend's got an
iPhone 4s try asking a question see what
it comes up with I cannot wait to hear
what you guys have asked Siri leave your
comments down below I'm John Rhett
