I got a Galaxy Tab I think we're in
business what's up everybody I'm Noah
from TechnoBuffalo comm and I'm at
Google i/o 2011
all right so if you follow such things
you've probably heard the news by now
Google i/o 2011 the keynote was this
morning and as they like to do with
these things last year they gave
everybody in attendance HTC EVO 4G on
Sprint this year a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10
one it is not a locked edition it's the
limited edition from the Google i/o
Developers Conference but then you're
also getting or everybody here is
getting you're not I guess but we are a
Verizon a hotspot tomorrow but they give
these things out to encourage you know
keep the developers happy because the
Developers Conference not really a
consumer or press thing although press
are here obviously and to encourage
development on the platform that kind of
thing they announced a bunch of stuff
this morning Ice Cream Sandwich probably
Android 4 they're gonna call it it's
coming in quarter four of this year it's
going to unify the experience across
tablets and phones and Google TV and
then honeycomb 3.1 know we're sealed up
here kind of unseal it
and then honeycomb 3.1 available today
to Motorola Xoom owners so I guess that
means that the tab does not have three
that one should be kind of weird by
giving out the dev conference without
the latest software on it but anyway
announcing also Google music beta all
kinds of stuff full coverage over on
TechnoBuffalo comm so you can check all
that out and to those of you who
suffered through my live tweeting rhyme
style of the keynote you know either
thanks for playing along or I apologize
anyway here's the tab though it won't be
on the market for another month they
said it was announced back at Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona but giving
them out today to all the devs will look
at the back here for the specs 32 gigs
in internal storage it's a dual-core 1
gigahertz dual core processor same kind
of the same basic specs as the zoom 10.1
inch display 1280 by 800
HD full 1080p HD playback it's got
bluetooth it's got Wi-Fi b/g/n the whole
thing but it is a little bit thinner and
lighter than the then the zoom for sure
so I don't know if we're juiced up with
a battery power here we'll see
you may not be able to actually know
it's starting up doing a little on the
scene unboxing for you from the Moscone
West Center there were they said over
5,000 developers or 5,000 people I
should say including press and others in
the room for the keynote this morning
and it was good it was probably the best
Google presentation I've ever seen a
little more a little more style to it
substance wise I don't know it's
arguable I think Android fans Android
developers will be happy but as in terms
of announcements you know sort of for
the general market a lot of stuff they
talked about isn't available yet and
then you know Google music beta kind of
lags behind the the Android movie rental
service I think lags behind some of the
other offerings already in the
marketplace from you know Netflix
certainly with the movies and Hulu and
everybody else and then you know a lot
of the online streaming music services
but that being said there's a huge
Android community to take advantage of
this stuff so it'd be very interesting
to see anyway so here's the device the
Galaxy Tab 10 one the lighting is not
optimal in here for an unboxing so we'll
keep it short and play around with this
later in better conditions let's see
what else is in the box
a health and safety information warranty
guide all your manuals USB cable I know
it looks like it's a proprietary so
there's a provider USB to proprietary
yeah proprietary is sort of almost Apple
style connector on the bottom there and
then an AC adapter can a modular AC
adapters you can snap different adapters
in there I would assume for
international global travel so there you
go I don't think that anything
underneath check just to be sure
and then tomorrow we'll come back and
we'll get the where is it
the Verizon mobile hotspot and SIM card
with three months of service so a quick
unboxing quick look at the Galaxy Tab
10.1 it it feels nice it's really
lightweight this feels like it's
probably more suited to one-handed use
than some of the other larger tablets
out there and I like the widescreen form
factor checked it out other devices and
me personally I you know it's optimized
for HD viewing this way but then you
turn it into portrait mode and easier
for to thumb typing I think so we'll get
this set up and we'll check it out and
I've got the limited edition and birds
all over the back very cool
live from Google i/o 2011 I'll shoot
some videos just walking around some of
the crazy stuff going on here they'll
just give you kind of an overview I'm on
the second floor there are three floors
and there's a giant cloud I'm knowing
from TechnoBuffalo comm much much more
on TechnoBuffalo on our Twitter feed on
our Facebook page all those places you
know where to go in order to look all
week Google IO</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
