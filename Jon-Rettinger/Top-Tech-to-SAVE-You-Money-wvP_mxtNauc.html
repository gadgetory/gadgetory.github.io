you've read the comments section of
anything iOS or Android you will see the
fervor that people have for technology
well it does sometimes lend itself to
disagreeing there's one thing we can all
agree on saving some money so in that
vein let's unify the tech loving
population and here's some top tech to
help save you some cash the big caveat
here that for a lot of these things
certainly you have to buy them so the
goal is to save money over the longer
term of the product the first one is a
smart thermostat nested ecobee tend to
get most of the price when it comes from
our thermostats those are expensive
starting around 250 bucks and going up
there are less expensive options from
Honeywell and a few others but these
smart thermostats do move the needle on
a yearly basis for an average annual
savings about 131 to 145 dollars
according to nest and eco bees own
findings so a lot of you guys might have
a landline bundled into your cable plan
or maybe your parents have a landline
phone it's time to drop that and go to
voice over IP or VoIP it is an
incredibly less expensive option that
gives you almost the same features if
not more than most standard landlines
there's a lot of options things like uma
and there's also lower cost options like
magicJack this next one's gonna seem
kind of obvious but shocked honey people
are still stuck at a contract
it's an unlocked smartphone mostly major
carriers now offer a plan we can pay
your phone off over time but you're
still paying interest on that device if
you can afford to buy a phone outright
buy an unlocked phones you're not to be
stuck any to your contracts you're not
stuck in payment plans and had the
freedom and flexibility to move carriers
if you choose unlock smart phones I
could go on for probably another 10
minutes its own video to why it's a
better option if you can swing it get an
unlocked phone this next one is
something I think a lot of you guys are
considering doing and that is cutting
the cord and going for a streaming
service for your TV coupled with an HD
antenna HD and 10s cost between 30 and
100 bucks do you access to local
channels all in HD and streaming options
are now becoming really easily available
you've got DirecTV now starting at 35
bucks a month which does have some
issues sling TV at 20 bucks a month and
also have on demand options as well
things like Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime
etcetera
you've run a good package of channels
that you watched it's not paper tails
you don't watch consider cutting the
cord
probably cutting off around 60 bucks off
your cable bill I'm gonna get a little
nerdy with you for these next ones these
are LED light bulbs when you think of
these a lot of folks think that color
dimming ones from life extra hue and
those certainly count as LED bulb you
don't have to get fancy light changing
bulbs to save some cash there are way
less expensive options
you probably think about outlets too
much plug stuff in stuff gets power
they're energy conserving outlets that
cost around thirty or fifty dollars that
will more than pay for themselves over
the course of a few years they allow you
to cut power to an outlet without having
to plug or unplug devices so you have to
worry about any sort of power draining
or paying for power to keep things I
know that you're not using tp-link smart
plug 30 bucks or vo has a Wi-Fi smart
socket 421 so you can get one really
good one in that thirty dollar price
range and last but not least buy your
cable modem stop leasing that thing
cable Internet companies really wanting
to lease their cable modem it can be as
purchased for as low as 50 bucks and
they are happy to charge you six to ten
dollars per month to lease one stop it
stop doing it
go out and buy one there's a ton of
affordable options starting from around
like I said fifty five bucks that will
pay for themselves in less than a year
net gears got some TP links got a few go
to Best Buy look online and we'll link
some down below to Amazon if you want to
pick up a new cable modem but stop
leasing it be surprised how much money
you can save so there's a lot of other
things you can do to help save money but
technology can also help you save some
cash if you guys like this video and you
want to see more let us know and we will
do more videos showing you some of the
cool stuff you can do to save some cash
now technology can unify us and not
fight over smart phone OSs
and for our comment of the day this
comes from our Tesla Model X one month
later review it comes from Cruiser
who says that car is a douche factor
plus 1000 thank you cruiser I appreciate
it if you want to be in an upcoming
comment of the day it's pretty obvious
just just leave a comment down below and
say something funny or witty or kids
this guy making fun of me and perhaps we
will feature you and will link to you
guys down below as well it's all our
subscribers video a thumbs up we
appreciate it
until next time I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
