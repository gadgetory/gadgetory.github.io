overview for you of safari for beta if
you don't know what safari is it's
apple's default browser it's been
tripping on max for years and just a
little under a year ago was with these
four windows so this version of safari
for beta is available for all macs
obviously and also available for pcs
running XP Vista those of you that are
testing windows 7 so when you open up
safari 4 beta you'll agree with this
topside grid view and it may look
familiar for those of you that use
google chrome this is a more 3d
representation though of your 12 most
viewed or more bookmarked web sites kind
of scroll through and see what you like
find a site you want to visit simply
double-click it and draw up to that site
to go back to the top sides of grid view
hit the icon upper left-hand corner and
you are back Apple gives you some
customization options to a safari 4 i'm
going out of the bottom left and hit
edit you can remove or add pages here
and if this 12 grid layout isn't for you
you can view more or view less i
personally think 12 is a very nice
number so i keep it here so one other
cool implementation and applluse is
coverflow you don't know what coverflow
is it was first pioneered in itunes and
then was later ported over as a file
management system in OS 10 leopard it's
another way to graphically flip through
all your files or songs or whatever it
is you're looking at so in this case
lets you flip through your web sites
it's actually very cool so go to
bookmarks and you can very quickly and
easily scroll through all your websites
there was youtube channel go through and
find what you like double-click it and
you're off to that website so one thing
that Apple did was safari 4 beta certain
design cute and I'm not so happy with is
there a tabbed interface look up top
here you can see the tabs are now on top
of the address bar I'll go ahead and add
a few more so you can see takes a little
while to get used to its very
counterintuitive all previous browsers
that use tabs were below that address
bar so it's definitely something that's
going to take a little bit of time it's
not impossible you
over but just something to be worried of
safari for beta was benchmarked against
some of the most popular browsers
including a Google Chrome Internet
Explorer opera and firefox actually
safari forwards found to be the fastest
out of all of those dethroning the once
king Google Chrome which is actually
still in beta itself so speed is your
thing safari for beta is definitely the
way to go I think once it gets out of
beta to release candidate status it
really will be a very solid browser I'm
relatively loyal to Firefox so it's not
going to make me switch but i am using
as a secondary browse and i'm very
quickly becoming used to it i may at
some point venture over to it so guys
it's just a very quick overview of
safari forbid i hope you enjoy if you
like the download this go to apple.com /
too far and you'll find a bear for your
platform of choice like some exclusive
content be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter com / John for lakers I will see
you guys in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
