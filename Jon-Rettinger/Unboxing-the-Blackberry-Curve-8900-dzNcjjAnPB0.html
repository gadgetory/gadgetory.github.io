unboxing for you of the blackberry curve
8900 for t-mobile this sucker will run
you 149 on a two-year contract it's been
a while because we had a black bear that
come through here so I'm excited to see
what this has to offer this is the
newest blackberry 40 mobile service go
ahead and carve into the pack there take
it out
see we got note from the friendly TR foe
and some info about the curve look at
that in a second let's take out the
phone itself there we go
throw that on the floor so this came out
I believe last month so it's been out
for a little while but first time I've
had a chance to get my hands on it so I
got the t-mobile logo on the front stick
together
picture a device on the side on the back
it lists some of the features
highlighted by a 3.2 megapixel camera
with a video capture game's high
resolution screen it's got Wi-Fi it has
GPS built in it does not have 3g however
it is only using t-mobile's edge network
got a full QWERTY board and all that
good stuff let's go ahead and dig on in
see what this thing looks like I've
always been a big fan of blackberries
dating back to my first pearl days and I
had 8700 so the device is right on top
actually is very small in hand we'll do
a size comparison in a minute see what
else we get in the box piece of
cardboard just lift that up standard
blackberry wall charger with qlik
they've used moved to microUSB but it's
nice they're using a standard we've got
a USB to microUSB cable got some
headphones
it looks like 3.5 millimeter headphone
so there must be a 3.5 millimeter jack
on the device we've got a carrying case
let's see what this carrying case is
made out of it
it's actual leather or just fake leather
see if any Nagas were killed in making
this naugahyde this looks like leather
not real leather
it's 100% genuine naugahyde got a little
thing in there and when you put the
device and actually has a magnet in
there and it'll turn off the whole thing
just the screen and buttons will
deactivate and finally we've got some
getting started material tips and tricks
and this and that let's turn the device
on and take a look at it should be
running the same OS as the BlackBerry
Bold and zoom in just a little bit here
get a better view of it okay so let's
compare it with some other phones you
might be familiar with let's use another
phone with a front-facing Corti keyboard
there is a trio pro they look to be
pretty close in size the BlackBerry is
nothing a little bit smaller
the trio pro is very thin let's see how
it stacks up almost the same dimensions
there with wise so that's nice goes to
show you how small the BlackBerry really
is here is the samsung epics for AT&amp;amp;T
much bigger certainly thicker but
Samsung puts in a monster battery on
this thing that counts for the increase
in thickness here is the iPhone most
people are familiar with the size of the
iPhone so it could be a good comparison
stack them up on top of each other and
see there is a significant difference
right there the iPhone is a little bit
longer I'll let you check the thickness
to be very similar in that dimension as
well and another blackberry that I
happen to have here it'll be more on
this one and future videos coming up
later on the blackberry storm stack and
book on top of each other and the storm
is noticeably thicker let's go ahead and
turn this thing on and see if it's got a
charge let's see what the boot screen
looks like it's a greener with the
t-mobile splash screen you don't think I
do like about blackberry it's definitely
have a short boot up time that was just
about it
and it does look like
the Bulls operating system does icons
across the bottom Wi-Fi is on if the
battery doesn't have much juice left in
it but I will do a full review and I'll
talk about the browser the operating
system itself keyboard have a screen
looks navigation and the usual things
that I generally cover my reviews so
stay tuned for that for exclusive
content be sure to follow me on Twitter
twitter.com slash John for Lakers and
I'll see you in the next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
