2011 and we are taking a first look at
the just-announced sony ericsson xperia
arc we've got Sony with us here to give
us a tour of the device
my name is Stephen Stephen sony ericsson
and the first thing i want to point out
is just the beauty of the product it's a
very thin there in the middle and it
tapers off on the ends so for when
you're holding it in landscape it feels
really nice to grip and it actually
important you too
very nice ergonomic field but just a
really cool concave design to you
noticed if we go around to the top of it
you do have an hdmi connection there now
and a really good easy hdmi experience
to show not only the videos and photos
that you've shot none of the videos and
show photos are you shot but also you
can see most of the user interface so
for example if you're playing a game you
can see them over the
as well
this has the new what Sony's calling the
reality yeah it has a reality with smell
reality spray Mobile BRAVIA Engine so
the same technology that we've inherited
from the bravia screen you'll have here
as well can you discuss specifications
up between size it was four point zero
four point two inches correct you know
the resolution the no I don't live as a
resolution don't have
and this is running the newest version
of android 2.3 up this is a new the new
timescape and may escape here yeah we
have we have Timescape in there you
don't see media escape now what you have
is what's called a media pain so if you
go through the five screens one of them
will have this media pain so I can start
playing music and then I can also scroll
and find images that I want to take a
look at or more play videos what sort of
hardware's is running from a processor
and ram standpoint you have the
Snapdragon 8250 okay I don't have the
rhythm in my head you know the
philosophy that's not dragging a 250 is
one year it's going to hurt here correct
Zedan that are making hammer that
adventure on the road to censor just as
a single 8.1 megapixel camera back to
maneuver sensors on the back with LED
flash yes we have the LED flash HD video
capture in a
megapixel and that's cool HD video
capture yes and from the hardware
buttons they are actual physical buttons
and you see Sony Ericsson's have got the
back button and you see from our
previous phone they kind of rearranged
them around a little bit but you have
the back key now on the left and you
have your options key there your menu
options be over on the right and the
home key takes you back to the home
phone is incredibly small I'd love to
especially with the 4.2 inch it's
extremely thin do you know the battery
the patient I mean it's amazing thank
you and put a battery that looked like
that you have a huge battery I'm sure
they looked at all the patients what's
in he had a milliamp hours event that
I'm undisputed a 1550 hundred million
our batteries I'd love to just do a size
comparison here with the fields can see
how thin this really it's almost 10
actually if you look at the very middle
of the phone this is actually thinner
than iphone 4 ya know it's an extremely
thin device do you have a teeny video
loaded up down there we can show some of
the new capability at the 4.2 in scram
sure if people would love to see that
see you much
and there are you guys prepared to
announce any US carrier information on
the kid no not not at this time so
there's a simple one of the moon
I back it up and let's play
oh here's good one there's final fantasy
playoffs
this play is really nice a person and it
performs very well out in daylight so
with the Mobile BRAVIA Engine you've got
a greater contrast we've got a brighter
screen but also this has a nose air gap
display in the hardware so it's you have
a complete seal around around the device
that keeps any reflection from coming
inside so that makes it brighter by
itself to fit for the hardware
phone is extremely chilly thin thank you
very much the time I appreciate it thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
