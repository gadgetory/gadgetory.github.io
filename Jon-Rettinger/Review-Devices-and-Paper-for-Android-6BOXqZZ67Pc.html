brought to you by Linda calm hello
internet and welcome back to another
episode of ask the Buffalo the show
where you can ask me Ashley ask ever any
question you might have from the wide
world of technology every tuesday we put
up a call for questions on TechnoBuffalo
calm you can leave your question in the
post comments otherwise send them to me
anytime of the day or night on twitter
at TechnoBuffalo or at ashley escada
just make sure you use the hashtag ask
the be so i can see it usually answer
around little 545 questions every
episode so let's get answering
at Ian Kennedy asks do you think the
overabundance of apps in the market are
hurting or helping consumers and phone
manufacturers this is an awesome
question I think that there are
obviously a ton of apps out there and in
some way yes they I think they kind of
hurt each other because obviously when
you have this over saturation you have
this problem of choice where it's like
gosh I have so many great apps to choose
from but then again it's actually really
good for consumers because obviously
competition baguettes better products so
the more competition that's out there
and the better those apps are the better
it is for us those people downloading
the apps but I think the real problem is
is the overabundance of apps and the
lack of good search results in app
stores so in the Play Store on the app
store for Apple like all of the
different manufacturers or os's have
this problem of search you can't find
good apps for example if you look up
paper this is a big thing going on right
now on iOS if you look at paper you may
not find 53's paper anymore because
facebook now has facebook paper and
there's some weird search algorithms
that go into that so I think in some
ways it's harder to find the little guy
unless it is viral and everyone's
talking about it so in that way I think
that that's the one thing that is the
detriment of overabundance of apps like
lots of different apps out there
obviously really good for consumers
because of the competition but maybe not
so great for the little guy who has a
harder time getting found in search
results in different app stores Antonio
cool Jack asks hey Ashley do you agree
with what the Microsoft investors are
saying about killing off the Xbox thanks
no I I think it would be a terrible idea
for Microsoft to kill off the xbox now
the thing is is if you look at it from a
financial perspective Microsoft has
never actually been profitable on their
consoles so the ex the original xbox
they were just getting off the ground
they had a lot of manufacturing costs
with the xbox 360 it cost them billions
of dollars the red ring of death scandal
cost them a lot of money so to an
investor it might actually seemed like a
good idea to spin off the Xbox but the
problem with that
is a we wouldn't really know if
Microsoft would sort of spin the company
off but still own it or if they would
completely sell the company and what if
somebody like EA body you don't want an
origin box that's a terrible idea we all
know how the SimCity launch went
battlefield 4 hopefully we're not going
to see the same thing with titanfall but
at the end of the day I think these two
investors are really into enterprise and
I think that you've heard the phrase
never change a winner or if it ain't
broke don't fix it and I think that
that's where they feel the money is
coming from with Microsoft but at the
end of the day I think it's a really
good thing that Microsoft is sort of
branching out into products and services
you know I don't know that Bing should
be around I think they may be they
should kill off Bing but at the end of
the day I definitely don't think
Microsoft should kill off the xbox and I
think a lot of gamers agree with me
because you know the xbox one's pretty
great Ryan bulli asks hey Ashley why do
you guys and many other tech reviewers
default to AT&amp;amp;T when reviewing unlocked
devices Thanks this is actually sort of
a not choice that we have we actually
get them from PR representatives who
represent those manufacturers or the
manufacturers themselves their PR
departments will send us phones and the
reason why usually it defaults to AT&amp;amp;T
is because it has the largest coverage
network with a device that can easily
have it sim cards swapped in and out for
different reviewers so we do send
devices back once we're done reviewing
them and then they go on to the next
reviewer so the easiest way to do that
and to be able to swap out your sim
cards is by using something like an 80
or an internationally unlock device
emits their bands are the most widely
available incompatible bands on the
planet so that's why they use those
those phones at beam are 234 asks hey
Ashley did you think android gets
facebook paper app soon or it doesn't
get it at all okay first of all stop
yelling this is the internet you don't
have to yell I saw yeah I think facebook
paper if you didn't know is it's
actually developed by a very small group
of people within Facebook who work on
sort of experimental projects so if you
haven't read that that's actually how
facebook paper kind of came about and I
think it's a catch-22 with Facebook page
because a lot of people really like it
because it's very visual and it has no
ads which is great but the problem is is
that if everybody uses facebook paper
and nobody uses the official app they're
going to have to put ads in to facebook
paper then people aren't going to like
that on top of that I think that they're
going to have to see some form of major
adoption on iOS it's sort of a test bed
now keep in mind it's not on iOS
everywhere in the world it's just here
so a lot of countries don't have access
to facebook paper even if they have an
iOS device so it's a very very small
percentage of iOS users that are served
using and able to try out facebook paper
so don't feel too bad i mean i don't
think android is being completely left
out in the cold and i do have a feeling
that if this is very popular and
honestly I think it'll catch on a lot
better than Facebook home so hopefully
this will be a thing that also comes to
android fairly soon I would say within
the next six months if we're lucky like
I said it's a really small team of
people developing facebook paper but
they're still making amazing things and
