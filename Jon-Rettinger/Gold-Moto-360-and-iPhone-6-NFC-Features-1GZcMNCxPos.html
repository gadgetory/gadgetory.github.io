to you by citrix gotoassist
the number one global market leader and
remote support what's going on guys the
Marklin sanger from TechnoBuffalo and in
today's rumor roundup we'll be talking a
little bit about microsoft's big office
update from Mac and I've seen the iPhone
and are we gonna see a gold moto 360
soon this is rumor roundup let's start
rounding those rumors
now we write a lot here a TechnoBuffalo
some of us prefer to use Microsoft Word
and some of us don't but if you're on a
Mac and love Microsoft Office suite it
turns out that the outlook for Mac
leaked a few days ago was only a snippet
of something bigger according to a
series of slides the new software suite
is expected to launch early next year
which will focus to give the apps more
of a modernized look similar to the
experience on Windows with full Retina
support and bring OneNote for Mac
alongside its suite
Microsoft is also focusing on
integrating their cloud services
including office 365 and onedrive and
Office for Mac hasn't really seen a
major update since late 2010 when the
office for mac 2011 was released and
with these rumors going around we're
really excited to try out the new office
for a Mac second let's talk a little bit
about Apple and NFC as of now the NFC
chip inside the iPhone 6 and the 6 plus
only serves one purpose and that's to be
used with Apple pay unfortunately Apple
wasn't very keen to use NFC for much
else which means you're either use it
for its mobile payment service or you
don't use it at all however Apple is
apparently talking to partners for
potential uses beyond Apple pay Apple
apparently has been in contact with hid
global in cubic which are responsible
for providing secure access to buildings
and transit fair system respectively
so it would seem that Apple wants to one
day have your iPhone 6 and 6-plus
replaced building and transit keycards
which if they do I would absolutely love
that idea apple's idea what Apple pay
was to get rid of your wallet and if we
could start doing the same with building
keys in I wouldn't have to take out my
wallet as much to get in and out of the
office let's take a quick break from
this video and thank our friends over at

little bit about this device right here
the Moto 360 may already be one of the
best-looking smartwatches around but
motorola could be gearing up to announce
two new design options for the Moto 360
product pages for champagne gold and
brown leather models popped up on Amazon
earlier today though by now they've
already been pulled from the site the
gold moto 360 will apparently come in
both twenty three millimeter and
eighteen millimeter size options while
the leather band smartwatches may only
be available in a larger 23 millimeter
model all three were priced at $299 on
Amazon which is the same as what retail
giants charges for the current mode of
360 models finally it looks like
motorola plans to offer a metal
SmartWatch strap for $80 which if it
looks anything like the gold moto 360
model then that would be a very classy
watch anyways that's it for this episode
