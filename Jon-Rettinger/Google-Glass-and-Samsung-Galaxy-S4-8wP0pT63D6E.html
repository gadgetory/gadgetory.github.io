to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of ask the
Buffalo I'm your host Jon wrenches to
show you can ask me any burning tech
question you've got deep down let it out
you'll feel much better up this week
we're going to talk about google glass
the samsung galaxy s4 HTC One and how we
make profits this is ass about flow it's
go ahead an get started Ray Ray Ray yes
hey John do you think Google glass would
be a big with cells to the average
person or does it look too advanced for
its time that's a really good question I
think one of two things is gonna happen
at Google glass think it's gonna change
everything when we interact with the
world or it's going to overly fizzle out
I don't know why every time so I'm
athens google glass i keep thinking back
to the segway I wasn't supposed to be
something that was gonna change the way
we transport ourselves the way we move
and then it kind of fizzled out I am
very excited to get our hands on our
Explorer edition on google glass we
should be getting them very very soon
and then I'll tell you what I think
about google glass at least from what
I've seen and what I've read what I've
watched it looks very cool but the big
thing for me is how it's going to
interact my daily life it's gonna be a
hindrance or is it going to add to what
i want to do wearing those glasses maybe
I don't need what Google glass can do
ninety percent of the day but is that
ten percent that I needed going to be
worth having to wear it and sort of
looking like I'm out of a bad
Schwarzenegger movie or a good birthday
I'm hey I'm what camper in and will say
though I'm really appreciative what
Google is doing with the new product
they're developing out in the open which
is not something that we've seen really
many companies do they're saying hey
we've got an idea for a new product if
you want to try it you can join us you
can just penned that crazy fifteen
hundred dollar fee you can see how
google apps are going to work you can
help a shape for the products going to
be the flat out into your question so i
get a lot of questions people ask about
money how TechnoBuffalo makes product so
i figured i would answer one question
here this question comes from you van
Oosterhouse who asks hex John how does
technobuffalo makes profits there's a
really simple process for us actually
step one you make content step 3
province alright the next question comes
from Twitter and user Haleh ho 20
for asks at john for lakers we only
cover phones and tablets what about tvs
and stereo systems so there's a lot of
areas that consumer electronics we can
cover sort of stereo system that certain
to be one of them covering more laptops
cover more desktops would certainly be
others unfortunately we don't have a
giant stash they kind of focus on with
the core of the consumer electronics
industry is that there's overwhelming
need or desire for us to break into
other areas let us know certainly we
will explore bringing some ground they
can help bring you the latest in stereo
systems we've done some speaker sets I
know Roy Choi reviewed the new so no
sound bar there's a lot of other cool
stuff out that we'd love to take a look
at if you guys interested in seeing it
let us know in the comments a ha darin
asks at john for lakers the galaxy s4
release looming should i went to reviews
before buying my next phone or just buy
the HTC one now well i would guess
reviews the galaxy s4 will be coming
very soon see waited this long you might
as well wait a few more days or a week
whenever the reviews the galaxy s4 come
out so you can know which one's going to
be right for you they are both great
phones i think meant for different users
what I've been telling people though if
you're the kind of person that likes to
swap batteries we need to have a movable
storage and the galaxy s4 it's gonna be
a wonderful choice you prefer sort of a
stronger industrial build perhaps more
built-in storage but you don't have any
need to swap batteries or swap in a
microSD card HTC one is going to be an
awesome choice really it's matter of
going to vacation to Hawaii or the
Caribbean the both good choices and
you're gonna have a great time wherever
you go that dude Daniel who asks at John
for lakers but all the devices you've
used and seen which ones are your
favorites well that's really tough when
I've had a lot of stuff that really like
at the time looking back though I'd say
my favorite thing that I ever reviewed
was the very first iPhones got some soft
spot in my heart since we've got me
started I would say the HTC One and the
iphone 4 probably be three of my
favorite project take a look at through
a very close second I think would be the
nexus 4 and perhaps the ipad mini but
it'd be definitely lower than the nexus
7 so if it helps answer your questions
