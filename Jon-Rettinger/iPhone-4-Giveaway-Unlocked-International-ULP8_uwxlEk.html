technobuffalo here back with one of my
favorite kind of videos to make it is a
giveaway I'm guessing you can see from
the title up there we are going to be
giving a brand new factory unlocked
iphone four to one lucky reader viewer
anywhere in the world so stick around to
see what you have to do to win so this
giveaways not sponsored by anyone it is
just our way of saying thank you I
always get a little choked up when I
talk about this I never thought that
when I was middle school high school or
just getting older that I would have had
the chance to talk about technology for
a living when I used to wonder the Eyres
aisles of best buy or when I just pour
over amazon online find all the newest
technology I never would have thought
that I would get the chance to talk
about it for a living you guys had given
me that chance um at least from a
personal standpoint you've made my dream
come true you give all of us at work
with techno Buffalo the chance to talk
about technology to get our professional
geek on and just thank you for your
support honestly from the bottom of my
heart and that's why I love to do as
often as I can things like this so
enough of my sappiness let's go and talk
about what you need to do to win this so
it is a brand new still sealed in the
package factory unlocked iphone 4 i'll
flip it over and cover up all the
information on the phone they can see
there isn't any carrier of information
that letting you know this is indeed an
unlocked iphone 4 which will come
directly to you the charger in here i
believe is a u.s. charger so if you win
and you're outside the US because it's
gonna be open to anyone in the world you
can have to get your own charging
adapter ah but if you win and you happen
to have an Apple product and go ahead
and use this or you can just use USB
port and plug it right your computer not
have to worry about a charger so what do
you have to do to win well let me give
you a bit of a back story I want to do
something with Facebook we're trying to
grow our Facebook initiative and get
more fans involves the Facebook doesn't
let us track stuff and saying just like
us to win seem kind of silly so we're
not using facebook for the giveaway
unfortunately but if you do want to give
us a like on facebook the link is going
to be down below I check it all the time
it's a great way to interact with me and
wrap the rest of TechnoBuffalo staff to
ask questions have dialogues I read it
all the time so if you want to get a
hold of me it's a pretty cool way to do
it so Thanksgiving down below for that
what we're going to do to enter this
giveaway is very similar what we did for
the ipad to give away we are going to
use twitter which if you don't have
twitter it's a free service sign up all
you need is internet connection and
email address which i'm guessing if
you're watching this video most of you
have so to enter all you need to do and
similar to the ipad to give away we did
a while back is retweet an article on
technobuffalo simply hitting that tweet
button on any article around the home
page or on the article page will enter
you you just need to include the hashtag
technobuffalo so hashtag technobuffalo
that won't go to track who enters you
can enter as many times as articles via
posted on the site so if we have 7
articles up per day you could enter
seven times you just can't retweet the
same article twice so if we have 10
articles you can enter 10 times but not
11 so pretty self-explanatory you can
tweet out any article that you want you
can only treat it out once and you have
to use the hashtag technobuffalo oh
we're going to pick the winner very very
easily I will be done completely
randomly i'll use random.org to see how
many posts have gone up from today until
May 27th which is when this is going to
end and that will end at mate 27th at
eleven fifty-nine p.m. pacific time does
matter what time zone you are it matters
what time zone it is and Pacific times
that's when this is going to end 1159
p.m. pacific time i'll see how many
articles that we've got between now and
then when the contest started use
random.org to pick a number i'll go to
that post and i'll use the twitter
kannur that's built into the site and
built in to twitter's api see how many
we have and i'll use random.org pick a
number starting from the top at one all
the way down to whatever numbers at the
bottom and that's how we're going to
pick a winner and i'll reach out to them
on twitter I'll send me their direct
message or not reply they get all of
their address and shipping so this is
going to be open to anyone anywhere in
the world let me do a real quick recap
all you have to do is retweet
any article on the site you can retweet
as many articles we have posted don't do
it more than once you have to use a
hashtag technobuffalo to be entered and
you are good to go it's going to run
until May 27 at eleven fifty-nine p.m.
pacific time and you can win this brand
to do this particular one i will send to
you with a note for me thank you 32
gigabyte unlocked iphone 4 it is the top
iphone 4 that's available I want to make
sure you guys got to the best step out
there if you want to buy this on on ebay
or buy it from where anywhere let's get
it cost you upwards of a thousand
dollars u.s. is one of the biggest
giveaways we've done and 1 i'm really
really excited to be a part of so guys
