technobuffalo here and welcome to part
one of the android superphone smackdown
between the newest member of the verizon
family the droid x and the current king
of sprint's hill the evo 4g we're going
to put these two head-to-head in a
grueling 12 round match in this
particular round we are going to cover
screen call quality and speaker battery
text entry browser speed at operating
system and in part 2 we are going to
cover camera quality both still in video
design multimedia and some miscellaneous
specs so stay tuned to both and to see
who is the current king of android hill
so we had to look at these tests and
some sort of interest of brevity for 12
rounds we have 12 that I think really
cover most of the aspects of the phone
so today we are going to go over screen
call quality and speaker battery text
entry browser speed operating system the
still camera quality the video camera
quality design multimedia and some
miscellaneous back let's go ahead and
jump right in and let's start with what
you look at with the phone the most the
screen these are both slave devices
meaning no physical qwerty keywords all
of your interaction with the phones are
going to be done on the screen so both
sport mammoth 4.3 inch capacitive
multi-touch displays the droid x has a
resolution of 854 x 480 the evo 4g is
resolution of 800 x 480 so 54 tall pixel
difference there the 54 pixels make the
droid x at something called fwvga which
is supposed to be just a little taller
resolution and supposed to make
scrolling through applications and web
pages a bit easier to reduce the amount
rolling you're going to have to do well
is that true so I've got the same
webpage queued up on each year we've got
TechnoBuffalo both of them are loaded at
the top and you can see that really you
can tell I'm there you can see that the
texts are almost exactly the same it
maybe get one or two lines more on the
droid
X me do on the EVO but nothing drastic
so from the resolution standpoint
there's not that much to see but the
actual screens that are used the screen
on the droid x looks a bit brighter even
when resolutions and brightness at it
the same and think just like a bit
crisper and clearer um so from a
aesthetic standpoint what's easier on
the eye the droid x i think has a little
bit of a nicer screen surround one is
going to go to the droid x so next let's
talk about call quality and speaker
since these our phones and they both
have to make calls the droid x is
running on verizon's outstanding cdma
network call quality was very good i
experienced no dropped calls no white
noise and lions or the other end of the
phone call the evo 4g is running on
sprints and an equally outstanding
network call quality sound landline esk
no white noise and no dropped calls as
well so call quality standpoint assuming
you get network service wherever you are
not going to be an issue certainly the
evo 4g is forgy capable but that 4g if
you are in an area where you have
service is right now i'm going to be
just for dads if not going us back to
the voice but we will talk about 4g
networks later on so let's talk about
the speaker quality i use speakerphone
quite a bit is there a difference
between two of these well i'm going to
go ahead and demonstrate them for you
and let you be the judge so first let's
talk with the evo 4g i'm gonna go ahead
and open speakerphone here i'm gonna
move the phone away so all my phone
numbers don't pop up and i'm gonna go
ahead and just call it's a voicemail I'm
gonna call claudi don't lift the phone
up since is here oh wait so pretty good
it's loud there's a decent amount of
noise you can hear it just sounds pretty
good when you're using it alright let's
go ahead and jump on over now to the
droid x and see how that sounds and
we'll do this sort of the same test here
condiments everything oh ok so then turn
that off so speakerphone to speakerphone
even with the evo lifted up and we're
not using the included kick Sam talked
about a little bit the speaker on the
droid x sounds better it sounds less
tinny less speaker ish and the volume
even when both these are turned up all
the way is just a bit louder so from a
call quality standpoint both the same
speaker phones important to which is
what we're talking about here the droid
x is going to be the winner so the droid
x is once again going to take this round
alright let's go ahead and jump in talk
about battery life you gotta figure to
both these are going to be pretty big
battery hogs out of how are these large
screens with these pretty big and
powerful 3g networks so the battery life
on each their belt or the battery
themselves rather about 1,500 milliamp
hours you're going to get eight hours of
talktime on 3g obviously on the droid x
and about two hundred twenty hours of
standby on the EVO 4g you can get six
hours of talktime on 3g and about 146
hours of standby so battery life is
actually much improved a little bit
better on the droid x you're going to
get actually similar battery left what
you get on the original drawing so this
once again is now trumping the droid x
in that standpoint so from a battery
very simple way to test you're going to
get a bit more juice out of the droid x
so next let's go ahead and talk about
text entry since again we're on a
physical qwerty keyboard the only way to
input text on these devices is through
the screens themselves let's go ahead
and talk about each neither of these i
should mention are using the stock
android keyboards both are using sort of
a custom software manufacturing keyboard
so we've got HTC's own sense keyboard on
here and actually that's hardware
manufacturer rather since HTC and
motorola both made these and we have
Motorola's motoblur keyboard here found
on the droid x let's go ahead and hop in
and take a look i'm gonna go and jump
into messages here and we'll go ahead
and start a new message i'll show you
the keyboards look like so pretty
standard you can use either in portrait
or landscape of both are very
good android does an absolutely awesome
job about predictive text and correcting
what you're typing really almost second
to none and in previous comparisons with
non Android devices I've always talks
about the voice to text although I'm not
going to mention that here and really
compare because both phones have it and
it works really well you talk to the
phone and actually will transcribe what
you are saying let's go ahead and talk
about the keyboards so this is the sense
keyboard and go ahead and try typing
here and landscape and we'll see how it
works have to compose and I'll go ahead
and type a quick message all right so
Winnie the Pooh sounds gross so we
protected it to mini the Pooh but not
too bad we'll go and switch on over and
let's try that one more time and I will
say with both these devices having the
screens at this big does make typing a
lot easier so Connie the Pooh sounds
gross looks like it doesn't quite want
to find wing in a dictionary the
keyboard is pretty accurate and very
easy to type on as you move your fingers
over the letters you can sort of see
what they are makes it a bit easier to
type on let's go ahead and jump on over
to the droid x and see what the keyboard
looks like here to go ahead and go into
text message and we'll try a new message
so keyboard your seat looks a bit
different we'll go ahead and try typing
the same message ER
so Winnie the Pooh sounds gross pretty
accurate it worked well go ahead and
move this over and try it one more time
all right so Winnie the Pooh sounds
gross so if we're going to compare a
keyboard to keyboard i actually prefer
the keyboard in Motorola's offering i
prefer both these keyboards rather to
the standard keyboard and android
however what Motorola's done just made
it a bit easier to use now that's not
the only way that you can input text
here on the droid x i can use something
called swype which is pretty big rage
now in the Android world you can put
swype on the EVO but it comes standard
on a device like the droid x let me show
you very quickly what's wife looks like
so go ahead and jump right down into
keyboard it will hop on over to swipe
and let me show you what this looks like
it's another way to input text without
ever having a little ifft up your finger
which is kind of neat I can go ahead and
just type and move your finger around
I'll sort of pick the words that you
want hit spacebar and it'll go ahead and
type I haven't used swype that much but
when I have use it's very quick and very
accurate and just another reason that I
think the text entry methods on the
droid x is a bit superior so we're
talking about text entry keyboard to
keyboard i still give it to the droid x
with the inclusion of skype i swipe
already built in as just sort of icing
on the cake so keyboard to keyboard the
droid x is once again taking this round
so let's see if the evo 4g can make a
comeback let's go ahead and talk about
the browsers if you're interested in
picking up a device like the droid x to
the evo 4g browser is more than likely
going to be a very important factor for
you so let's go ahead and talk about how
both of these look so we'll go and open
up the same pain to open up
technobuffalo calm both of these support
multitouch so pinch-to-zoom you can see
that they both sort of work the same way
just as fluid really no difference if
you tap on text you can sort of zoom in
or zoom out to play on what you're doing
so did the same
thing they're scrolling is very smooth
on each the physics engine works quite
well however I will say there is one big
determining factor right now with both
these devices the evo 4g supports flash
content whereas the droid x does not
although will support it sometime about
end of 2010 but comparing these two
devices as it exists right now the
addition of flash gives the evo 4g a bit
of an edge you have the option of
whether or not you want to do flash
content on the droid x you don't have
that choice certainly motorola and
verizon said it's definitely coming but
right now it is not there so if we're
comparing browser to browser and sort of
the way things work gotta give it to the
evo 4g let's go ahead and talk about
speed how do both these things work
they're both using different variants of
the one gigahertz processor one is using
a snapdragon ones using the TI built
omap processor but does that really
affect how things work ram difference
let's go ahead and jump in and see how
speed works on both of these devices so
let's go ahead first and we will kill
all running applications i'm sort of
make this very same application killer
task manager will go ahead and kill all
selected apps and i will do the same
thing here on the droid x i'll do it on
camera so you know there's no funny
business going on all right let's go
ahead and first check web browser speed
oh we're connected to the same Wi-Fi
network and we've got pretty good
connection on etude showing full bars
let's go ahead and see if there's a
difference loading web pages so we'll go
ahead and open up the browser on both
and we'll try loading let's say
TechnoBuffalo first on both the see if
there is any sort of difference arts all
cued up here on the EVO and we'll do the
same thing here we got it all ready to
go and these are websites that have been
loaded on both devices obviously you saw
it on here this will be a test of
cycling visit on a regular basis let's
go ahead and hit go on each and see if
there is any sort of difference so I'll
hit it there right there and we are off
and it looks like the evo 4g he's got a
bit of an early edge all the droid x is
showing much more content first and the
droid x is done and the evo 4g is still
loading and still loading and still
loading now in all fairness i will say
that the evo 4g is still loading Flash
content and that may sort of accounts
for why I took a bit longer to load
we'll try some other sites that maybe
are less flash intensive there's a bit a
few flash things on here I'll but it's
to see sort of what that looked like
let's go ahead and try another website I
let's go ahead and go to how about I
will try and gadget he thinks you're a
difference there so we've got it ready
to go there and we'll see if there's any
sort of difference with these two as
well we don't want to search URL here we
want to jump right to it
alright and that will go ahead and use
over speed difference here and see if it
pick up the mobile version or pick up
the full version so we got the mobile
version and so loading the same web page
without flange content of the mobile
version of each the evo was a bit faster
sort of interestingly enough and as I
found in web pages certainly when you're
viewing Flash content the evo is going
to load things a bit slower however when
you're doing started the same sort of
web page I generally the evo is just a
hair faster as we saw right here nothing
that's that noticeable but if we are
going to put these two head-to-head
there is a bit of a difference when
loading non-flash pages there's
something to keep in mind so let's go
ahead and talk about some application
speed as well I both these are running
Android so that's sort of the unique
opportunity to open up the same programs
on each generally when I do my
smartphone smackdowns they're two
completely different operating system so
it's hard to sort of compare apples to
apples i hate to say so let's go ahead
and open up sort of similar programs on
each so we'll go ahead and let's try a
game for example first and let you try
Jules and again all these things have
running our the browser you saw me kill
all applications let's go ahead and try
opening up both of these at the same
time which is a bit more difficult than
you expected to be so loading up for
exactly the same time and they finish at
exactly the same time interestingly
enough so let's go ahead and try
something different and see if that's
going to affect anything really oh that
was I probably within milliseconds of
the same time so hard to say who won
that let's go ahead and try a few other
applications that are similar on each
let's go ahead and try opening up let's
say amazon mp3 something that both of
these devices support so I'm going to
try opening that up and see if we can
get any sort of speed difference here
once again just about identical and that
really sort of goes to show each of
these devices speed wise it's almost
negligible and opening up applications
however when you are reviewing web
browsers our web web pages non-flash the
evo is going to be faster using flash
pages since it's not supported right now
the droid x is going to be a bit faster
however we can only assume that when
flash to flash is going to be there
going to store to see the same thing and
it's student that when browsing the evo
is going to be a bit faster so if we
have to declare a winner in this round
application speed doesn't really affect
anything because they're almost exactly
the same but browser speed the evo is
going to be just a hair faster so the
evo 4g is going to take the speed round
let's go and talk to an operating system
both these are running android 2.1 up to
running skins of android 2.1 when the
cool things about Android Open Source
all its manufacturers put sort of their
own Flair on the operating system so if
you guys have seen any of my reviews in
the past don't know that I am a huge fan
of HTC Sense which is what's running on
the EVO 4G or just really well they
serve did a nice job of skidding
operating system so you're going to get
this new tray of icons of your
applications to get this new array
across the bottom you get a ton of home
pages you get the new feature where you
can sort of zoom in and jump to
different web pages and as you go
through and use calendar and use the
applications that are in here you get
sort of some custom tweets and generally
sense UI has certain beaten up on all
the other competition however that is
before the redesign of motoblur those
you may have seen motoblur on motorola
cliq or the backflip you'll know that it
looked like an absolute monstrosity look
like a cartoony mess however Motorola's
completely redone it here for the droid
x and they've may have taken a cue or
two from HTC HTC a sense I mentioned
sort of adds another layer to it you get
a ton of sort of live wickets and icons
in fact let me jump back and show you
some of those extra witness you're going
to get so go ahead and go to widget and
here the HTC witness you see out there a
ton of them that you can do turning I
don't at the time this video to show you
all of them
but you can see that there are a lot
here and they sort of work in the
background always updating content so
let's jump on over to motoblur and one
role is than a fantastic job here about
how they've implemented the operating
system in the skin to sort of not be the
dominant factor that it once was to use
it or not use as much you like so you
get sir that same icons across the
bottom you can now jump to the phone you
can jump right to your applications and
they added a lot of widgets as well I
noticed as I scroll along you'll see
that that icons across the bottom let me
jump from page to page makes it a bit
easier to navigate similar to what i
showed you on the droid that's right on
the EVO 4g when you can pick the home
screens it's less obtrusive so if you go
to severe you can see some live witness
in action let go and go to a blank you
can show you some of the options here
that we've got for motorola you can see
that there are quite a few here as well
a Wi-Fi hub of sticky notes social
status social networking photo albums
and there's a lot that you can really
see and do here I think a lot of people
have probably seen HTC Sense spend a lot
of great devices you could sort of see
here how it's going to work on something
like the droid x it's less obtrusive you
can add again add your favorite contacts
here I've got the photo gallery in the
music playing I've got some applications
lined up on the bottom you've got some
tips and tricks through your RSS feeds
they can sort of scroll along and sort
of see what you can have so I've got
some mail and calendar and google search
and weather and a few others so
ordinarily HTC Sense kicks the butt of
any other skin competition however
Motorola's done a fantastic job so this
round is most definitely a tie and that
is a tribute to how good both skins are
really it's going to come down to
personal preference but you can't go
wrong with either they improve upon
stock Android without being obtrusive I
think which is really the job of the
operating system and the skin itself
