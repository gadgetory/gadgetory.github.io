lakers calm yer with some feature
highlights for you of the samsung
eternity for AT&amp;amp;T wireless so if you
guys are going to be able to see this i
turn the brightness all the way down on
the device so first to unlock it you can
push any button and there's an unlock
button at the top and you hit it and
usually you're taken to this main home
screen right here now it's very cool
about the samsung eternity is that it
uses with samsung calls their TouchWiz
interface which is actually a widget
based interface so you can see it right
here I've got the date sound profiles a
little TV icon and then you can actually
set what you want to have on your home
screen you drag it over to that widget
bar and it disappears and these are all
the widgets you can choose from you have
a myriad of choices clocks calendars
some TV stuff birthday reminders let's
say there's a music player right here I
can drag that right out shows up on my
home screen I can move it anywhere I
want if I don't want it there anymore
throw it over and get rid of it you can
move to any other choice and the choice
that you like so you can pick calendar
pull it out there have a full calendar
want it gone it's gone this one I found
very useful sound profiles really easy
way to switch between ring and vibrate
and all that kind of stuff and the
widgets the way it flows is very smooth
and it every time I'm touching the
screen you guys can't see it but I get a
little bit of a buzz with haptic
feedback this is actually the first one
where I thought haptic feedback has been
very well done the vibration is actually
nice it's subtle doesn't shake the
entire thing it really does give the
impression of pushing buttons now I
should mention one thing during my
unboxing I thought the screen might have
been capacitive similar to touch screen
on the iPhone meaning there's no much to
it this one is actually resistive so
there is a little bit of a squishy
feeling but not bad at all so let me
show you some of the cool things about
the device first let's go to menu so
this is very simple menu there's no
scrolling or anything here but
everything you need is nice and easily
accessible you have your 18t GPS but the
cool thing that I hadn't seen yet
is TV so let me show you what this looks
like you're launching mobile TV and here
it is on comedy central actually
watching live comedy central right now
hit the button you can zoom it to full
screen tap the screen again actually get
a full channel lineup some of these
channels are live some of them are
pre-recorded ESPN is live there's
college football to go ahead and find a
channel you want to see tap on it just
like using a remote control here's
college football Northern Illinois
versus Louisiana Tech whole bunch of
channels here Comedy Central ESPN MSNBC
NBC Fox CBS and some dedicated internet
television channels Nickelodeon is here
CNBC so if you got kids it's a great way
to entertain them for us in a little
while or even yourself if you're sitting
there waiting check out movies here's
kung fu hustle being played on pics you
know very cool actually that's the
picture make sure this office you guys
can hear me the picture is actually very
good and extremely watchable and it
looks nice and vibrant on the screen so
one of the things you guys are probably
concerned about within all touchscreen
device is how do you input how do you
tax how to do anything so let me show
you guys that will go into messaging and
now will tap and now you've got your
normal phone keyboard Nick either turn
on 29 or turn it off and you just tap
and this phone does have an
accelerometer in it so turn it up and
you get a keyboard and I gotta say this
keyboard is actually probably the best
touchscreen keyboard i have ever used
that includes the iphone that includes
the blackberry storm and really any
other touchscreen phone that i've used
the AT&amp;amp;T fuze it is fantastic it's big
it's spacious and when you try and touch
a key it comes out to the side what
letter you're typing so I'm hitting G
right there and coming out to the right
it lets me know what I'm typing and it's
extremely accurate and you can set it 49
if you'd like and it'll actually will
correct your words and fill in the words
for you I mean it's just extremely easy
to use so I give you a demonstration
here
let me type hi my name is John and we'll
see how this goes so wasn't entirely
accurate but it was pretty close and
it's bad as accurate as I him with the
iphone so when you hold down delete
it'll actually will delete everything
for you if you'd like very nice very
well done and really impressive the
keyboard on this is actually fantastic
and every time you touch a key it pulls
up the capacitor sorry the haptic
feedback so you really do get that
vibration feel if you want your regular
touch keyboard just put it up now this
is just what's considered a feature
phone it's not a smartphone by any
stretch of the imagination it's got a
built in Java client but not going to be
very useful for you if email is a big
thing for you if that is important I
definitely don't recommend this phone
but if you're looking for just a feature
phone something that's gonna make good
phone calls good text messaging and has
an internet browser this is actually a
great choice speaking of internet
browser let me show you guys what that
looks like right here we'll go to media
net enter a URL and we will go to John
for lakers calm don't you guys see how
it loads and everything's you can get a
chance to see if this device is for you
and there's a dedicated calm button and
a dedicated www button which is nice
okay let go and it's off and you can
switch views and actually is a very
responsive accelerometer actually one of
the more responsive ones I've seen I
think much more responsive than even the
blackberry storm so I've got three bars
of 3g here so it should be relatively
quick let's see what this looks like
there it is loading up and as you can
see it's loading a full HTML version of
the page and you can scroll around with
your finger and the scrolling is very
smooth it's not choppy but it's not
going to zoom in you can't double tap to
zoom in on things so there's an article
I can't double tap the only way you can
zoom is to hit that and you get a little
icon right there we can scroll how far
you want to zoom or zoom in and zoom out
it is actually a very decent browser I'm
actually very surprised with it it's not
going to do any flash you're not to be
able to play youtube videos on it but
for simple web browsing it really is
very robust and full-featured so again
another nice feature about this phone
one other thing I should mention and
something that's unique on feature
phones this will actually has a
proximity sensor built in so when using
a touchscreen you're making a phone call
you hold it up to your head there's a
sensor up top much like the iPhone and
it'll actually turn off the screen when
it's up to your ear which is very nice
you're not going to accidentally dial
your mom or look up some contacts or
launch TV and have it up to your head
turns off the screen you pull it away
from your head and the screen comes back
on so we'll go back here to the main
screen hit the back button I've been
very impressed with this phone so far um
scrolling is very smooth and fluid and
for a resistive screen was usually very
difficult to do this one actually does
it the best resistive screen wise this
is probably the best implementation of
smooth scrolling internet browsing and
text entering that I've seen on any
phone so I can definitely recommend this
but keep in mind like I said before this
is clearly not a smart phone and it's
not geared to the smartphone market does
have an IM client built in it's more
meant for individuals I just looking for
a phone with some additional benefits
you're looking for internet browsing
you're looking for maybe some
entertainment value in the TV burley
nothing more than that if the Internet's
not important to you just want a phone
for fun this is a fantastic device that
I can definitely recommend so guys this
is jon rettinger with john for lakers
calm here with some feature highlights
of the AT&amp;amp;T
eternity I'll do a full review on a
little bit later you guys got a sample
of my opinions but you wanted to show
you some of the cool takes on it any
guys hope you enjoy I'll see the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
