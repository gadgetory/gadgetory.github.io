to you by full sail university what's up
everyone John render from TechnoBuffalo
here it's the new year which means new
flagship smartphones are getting ready
to hit and the next one that we are
going to see is me latest from HTC a
successor to the HTC m7 was HTC m8 and
I'm wagering that I can do some simple
math in the next one are going to see is
the HTC One m9 so as you guys decide
what smartphone you want to buy or maybe
look to get over the next few months I
want you to break down what you can
expect from the HTC One m9 this
information is based on leaks and
insider info first insert with design
design is going to be very similar to
HTC m8 though we might see a gold color
at launch I'm also expecting it to ditch
the black bar at the bottom of display
which should provide room for better
speakers but I'm going to get to that in
just a minute on the camera front the
ultrapixel has been pretty solid but
it's not so good if you want to zoom in
and crop your photos they're just not
enough resolution go around HTC might
switch up the camera game this time by
adding a 20 megapixel rear facing camera
at least according to some reports and
two images of cases that suggest a
larger image sensor is incoming it may
also include either a 13 megapixel wide
angle lens up front which should also
put a HTC Desire eye so it doesn't make
sense or an ultra pixel front facing
camera the reports on that front
definitely seem to vary one way or the
other HTC hasn't really suggested that
it plans to ditch ultrapixel camera all
together so hopefully it sticks around
in some fashion just with more
megapixels either way expect the best
camera HTC phone today so i mentioned
that HTC is rumored to ditch the black
part into the screen and i got a sinking
suspicion I know why you're gonna get
some better speakers so getting ready
that black bar probably in able to add
even larger boomsound speakers weaving
crisper louder sound from games movies
over unless you want to do it you see
improved experience HTC one m7 and the
m8 adding more powerful speakers in beef
your audio chip and it seems likely
they're gonna do it again let me stop my
m94 just two quick seconds to thank our
friends and good peeps at full sail
university as you know virtually every
software relies on software technology
and full sail university located in
Winter Park Florida offers bachelor's
degree programs that address the need
for skilled tech professionals so
curriculum that blends code and theory
with
real world experience so I learned
something new it's a great opportunity
to do that mobile development bachelor's
degree program offered on campus at
online teaches students how to develop
apps and utilities through courses that
cover both iOS and Android development

slash technobuffalo more m9 in next
let's talk about software we've seen a
few alleged screenshot of sense 7 on
Android 5.0 lollipop spilled out we way
way way back in October they didn't
provide any information show HTC really
has planned HTC went through sense 6
with a fine-tooth comb changing nearly
every pixel in the interface with
updated color palettes themes and new
sources for blinkfeed and changes to the
camera gallery and try app really just
everything there hopefully we'll see
introduction of brand new features like
we saw blinkfeed and maybe they'll
simply include changes just absolutely
everything across the board one way
another though change is coming my
fingers across its gonna get more stock
Android e of course the big one is
hardware there's been concerns that
Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 810 processor
is overheating although apparently HTC
has any issues on that front at all or
at least none that we've heard of the
new one or the m9 reportedly sparked the
brand new processor three gigs of ram
which should help but just slice through
and refi point of ollie pop with sense 7
on top without any issue at all now if
you remember with HTC m8 hat it's a
really really nice spec bump it gc's
always been amazing and optimizing its
software to run super well on devices
letting you have to continue with HTC
One m9 the processor should have more
than the power to pump up and quad HD
display but as it though that HTC might
stick with 1080p this when we have and
not be able get confirmation on but
maybe that means it'll get better
battery life one way or another that
we're going to find out absolutely
everything in march first in Mobile
World Congress we're going to be at so
stay tuned to technobuffalo come for all
of your HTC One m9 rumors is anything
we've talked about is enough to get you
