to you by gamefly on this episode i go
over my three favorite games of 2013 we
talked about max the curse of
brotherhood and i tell you where to find
techno buffalo's top 15 video games of
2013 let's get out of controller hello
and welcome to controller the weekly
TechnoBuffalo show that covers all your
gaming news reviews demos and new
releases in its easy to digest capsule
form at i'm your host Ashley ask ever
it's usually a big week in gaming but
it's the last episode of 2013 which
means I'm gonna share my personal top
three games of 2013 instead of
delivering news so let's hit it my
console pick of the year would
definitely have to go to bioshock
infinite it was really hard choosing
between Bioshock the last of us Super
Mario 3d World Grand Theft Auto 5 but
Bioshock really resonated with me
personally and those Lou test twins were
probably my favorite new characters in a
long long time the environments were
stunning the skyhook was almost too fun
when I got served death from above and
the story's ending well I won't spoil it
for you but I thought it was pretty
freaking great also in my humble opinion
the shotgun in BioShock Infinite felt
like one of the medias virtual guns I've
ever fired so easily my favorite game
this year as for handheld games even
though I've only had it for a few days
the legend of zelda a link between
worlds crushed it this year a Link to
the Past is one of the best Zelda games
ever made obviously up there with
ocarina of time and the fact that the
zelda game doesn't make you wait until
halfway through the game to give you a
hook shot makes me a very very happy
camper I also love moving between 2d and
3d while playing honestly who knew
switching to a link painting would be so
much fun a link between worlds also
really puts the 3d in 3ds so normally I
have the 3d effect turned to about
twenty-five thirty percent but I turn it
up a lot while playing this game because
it is gorgeous in 3d I couldn't possibly
forget mobile gaming on my list and this
is where i would pick the wolf among us
as my favorite
the wolf among this is available across
platform but I chose to play it on iOS
and man what a great concept or
adaptation I guess fairy tale characters
living in secret amongst humans murders
intrigue in an antihero with lots of
baggage and a chip on his shoulder all
those things are music to my ears not to
mention the great voiceover work and
story tell tale games delivered it's an
amazing adaptation of the fable series
of graphic novels and I cannot wait for
chapter 2 let's play as a feature on our
gaming channel where a member of our
writing staff plays a game and talks
about it over the footage this week joey
is playing max the curse of brotherhood
which is a follow-up game to max and the
magic marker this time around max has to
save his little brother who actually
disappeared after max wished he would go
away whoops I got to take one second to
thank our friend and sponsor gamefly
