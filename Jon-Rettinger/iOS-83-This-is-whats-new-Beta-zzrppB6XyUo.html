from technobuffalo and today we're going
to be checking out iOS 8.3 beta on the
iphone 6 i've been using it for a couple
days already and so far it's been pretty
stable if you're an apple developer and
have access to apples deb portal you
should be able to see the download links
for iOS 8.3 if you're not a developer
there's also a public beta available for
iOS that's slowly being rolled out if
you signed up to be a part of apples
public beta program so let's go ahead
and see what's new in iOS 8.3 there's a
new carplay section that's been added to
the settings menu that makes it much
easier to set up carplay wirelessly if
you have a car that supports apples car
play now you can press and hold the
voice control button on your steering
wheel to start the car place setup
process there's also new emojis in a new
layout for Apple's keyboard apples put
all the emojis on a single scrollable
page which makes it much easier to pick
emojis now probably the biggest change
here is that the emojis are now more
diversified you'll be able to choose
from a variety of skin tones from light
to dark and apple also added a few new
flags for different countries there's
also changes in safaris keyboard the
space bar inside safari is now much
longer the period and the Go button are
now much smaller so you don't
accidentally type like this it was
really annoying for me and I'm glad
Apple finally fixed this problem there's
also new Siri languages in Russian dutch
swedish thai turkish and more and
speaking of Siri there's also a small
but helpful change in iOS 8.3 regarding
the hey Siri function you can now say
hey Siri call so and so on speaker and
it'll place that call automatically on
speakerphone which is super helpful
whereas before it wouldn't be able to do
that action and last but not least
serves messages list filtering inside
the messages settings there's a new
conversation list filtering option which
basically adds a tab inside the messages
app which separates messages from people
in your contacts and everyone else let's
say for example you get a random text
message from a number you don't know it
will include that in the new tab which
you then can report as junk and that
apparently sends that reports who Apple
with the message details for review but
unfortunately we don't know what that
means and that's about it we'll keep you
sit if there are any major changes in an
upcoming beta or official release check
