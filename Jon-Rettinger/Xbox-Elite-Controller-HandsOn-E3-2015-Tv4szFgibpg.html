TechnoBuffalo here we're at e3 2015 one
of Microsoft's biggest announcement this
year is actually one of their smallest
and I've got it right here it is their
new Xbox elite controller this thing is
gonna cost one hundred and forty nine
dollars it's going to come with smooth
accessories and a carrying case so what
makes this unique is first it's
completely configurable so everything
pops right off you configure the
controller for exactly how you want it
so for example you're playing a fighting
game you can use the dish if you don't
prefer that you're go and pop it off and
put on a traditional d-pad if you'd like
anything that you want to do gets really
controllable as well as these paddles on
the back these are removable and fully
configurable so if you want let's say a
hair-trigger lock for example you've got
the ability to do that here with the
Xbox elite controller overall it feels
very different as well you've got some
texture here on the side to feel solid
in the hands and as you wrap your hands
around it your fingers naturally go to
those paddles so you got access to those
paddles and of course those triggers
that you all know also mobile editions
we've seen on the newer controller 3.5
millimeter headset jack is also here as
well also going to be powered by the
same double-a batteries that we saw on
the original Xbox one controller I will
say this fuel is absolutely great and
the best analogy I can make this is like
a mechanical keyboard - console gamers
it's been figural and you can sort of
get this to suit your needs and if
you're a heavy gamer you're gonna find a
lot of ways to figure this to make it to
suit you bet supposed to usually what
comes out of the box and making that
work for you
so obviously the elite controller is
hardware's also a software component
that goes with this - they'll you
customize the sensitivity of the
triggers also to be compatible with of
course the Xbox one but also Windows 10
Windows 8 and all the way down to
Windows 7 again pre-orders are available
now it's a hundred and forty nine
dollars Jon render from TechnoBuffalo
seven a first look at the Xbox one elite
controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
