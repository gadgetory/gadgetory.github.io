to you by godaddy what's up everyone
John rendered from technobuffalo here
and welcome back to episode of rumor
roundup just a show where I take all the
risk of deck rumors from the week and
there were a ton and I smash him with
basham and serve up one teeny tiny dish
of tech rumor awesomeness up this week
the motorola x + 1 the next note is
going to have ridiculous specs and more
Android wear watches are coming from
around up let's start just rounding them
up so Motorola recently announced can
hold a press conference on my birthday
September fourth in Chicago we're
expected Capri to unveil be Moto X plus
one seems like doing plus one is the new
thing plenty of earlier leagues already
set expectations for we can expect on
the hardware side of things and a new
geekbench benchmark chart seems to
totally solidify that information so
spotted by our friends at phone Arena
the benchmark points to a pretty awesome
spectacle a 5.2 inch 1920 x 1080 screen
2 gigabytes of ram 10 gigs of usable
storage elected obviously very a 12
megapixel camera capable of recording 4k
video a fun Drina suggest that the clock
speed of the processor 2.5 gigahertz
might actually point to a snapdragon 801
instead of the 800 chip mentioning
geekbench oh that's it's probably more
in life earlier rumors though quite
frankly motorola did a kick-ass job in
the software side of the original moto x
so unlikely heartbroken if it's an older
Snapdragon 800 chip at all and you
shouldn't either technobuffalo will be
there on sep tember fourth well the
truth will be unveiled our own Roy Troy
will cover it all for you so I'm really
excited i love the Moto X it was really
smart front of the year last year for a
lot of our staffs hopefully the x plus
one is pretty awesome I hopefully it
still got Motorola's hands on and hasn't
been lenovo up too much yet I'm there's
gonna be a lot of cool things coming out
of that film so if you're just a speck
guy and your girl and you want the
latest looks like the note or is going
to be ridiculous so Samsung pretty much
confirmed the galaxy note for its
existence and now a retailer has let
slip what appears to be the final specs
so if these are real anyone waiting for
this device will not be disappointed
they don't family's always been just a
crazy juggernaut
samsung stable and it looks like the
company is gonna get some really big
fire power especially with the imminent
arrival of the iphone 6 so according to
indonesian retailer error phone the no.4
is going to most kind of specs you'd
expect from just big-ass superphones
things like a 5.7 inch 2560 x 1440
display which is a ridiculous 515 PPI
for gigs of ram that's probably two more
than it needs and also my Star Trek live
long and prosper of 2.5 gigahertz
snapdragon 805 processor or octa-core
exynos with four cortex a7 cores and
four cortex a53 course depending on the
region damn 16 megapixel camera the
ability to record 4k video which is
ridiculously beefy even by Sam stirring
Samsung's already pretty beefy standards
in addition we're expecting different
size variants 16 32 or 64 expandable
storage up two hundred twenty eight gigs
micro USB 3.0 24 point 0 android 4.4
point 3 KitKat dual band Wi-Fi 8020 11ac
your mouth just ruling with expectation
for this i am i've already seen pictures
with the rumored devices must look like
you know looks pretty awesome like an
evolution of the note design i can't
wait for it though the specs though used
only half the story no mention of extra
feature so it's unclear how much
different than 04 is going to be from
the note 3 other than the specs I've
heard about the possible feature such a
time with Samsung's upcoming VR check
along with the new series of sensors
absolutely take advantage of new note
taking stuff though we're sure though
there's pretty more software features
samsung loves to throw everything in the
kitchen sink at you we should so you
should know much more than at the event
on sep tember third September's going to
be a very very busy month stop the rooms
for one quick SEC to tell you if you
want to start a website now is the
perfect time start building it with
godaddy you can get a domain for just a
dollar in 99 cents just use promo code
199 techno a check out if you want to
start your site for rare mountain goats
now's the time to do it some limitations
might apply to check out the website for
details so back in June rumors of an
asus SmartWatch began to bubble up to
the surface suggesting they are working
on an Android wear device of their own
that could be crazy cheaper than
alternatives from LG Samsung and
Motorola cuz 360 ain't gonna be cheap
now the company CEOs apparently
confirmed the news adding the device
could debut earlier next month at IFA in
Berlin with a nicer design and
competition so focused taiwan report
today co-ceo Jerry Shen broke the news
drink and investors conference on
Tuesday he didn't offer any details on
device itself but claims google has
already approved the new SmartWatch I'd
another had to do anyway for you they
didn't put it out if the Asus watch does
debut at IFA it's likely to come with
super strong marketing push as well
early reports adjust the device could
cost as little as ninety-nine one
hundred forty nine bucks which might be
a really key selling point for
smartwatch which is a good price point
for a SmartWatch even so though Chen
says he's trying to be realistic about
the wearables market doesn't expect to
see sales pick up until the second half
of next year on that note though you
just say the company is already
preparing its second generation
SmartWatch so why buy the first the next
one's already coming we're curious to
see what asus has in store without
hopefully a cheaper Android wear device
is gonna bring more people to the yard
like a milkshake in it under guys what
do you think is a cheaper price
important to you as specs and design
more important you'll want to hear your
thoughts anyway guys bad jokes aside
