techno buff flew here and welcome to
episode 2 of TV minis if you missed the
first one you should watch it but it's a
new series where I just share my
thoughts on something that's going on in
the world and just a short couple minute
video this week it was all about
disappointing apple rumors and faith
leaks let's start the Big Daddy the
iphone 7 supposedly leaked from somebody
at a manufactory presumably Foxconn this
phone first of all looks nothing like
any other iphone we've ever seen no home
button there edge to edge screen and
that might be plausible for the iphone 7
but what's not plausible made this a
huge fake first of all somebody at the
end yelling hey cuz you know that just
adds to the intrigue of it but also on
the back of the device the apple logo
was super skewed it already had all the
FTC and governmental regulations on the
bottom which now nine months from
release would still be in the early
prototyping phases I would certainly not
have that present so as cool as this
phone looked more like an HTC m9 maybe
an m10 type device we might see later on
the year but it is definitely not from
Apple so bummer there and on the second
bummer Apple news on Sunday on 60
minutes there was a huge special on
Apple it featured Tim Cook Johnny I
having a whole bunch of other Apple
execs it also Richard cameo from from
this guy I was in there for like a hot
second made my mom super proud didn't
know was gonna happen still pretty cool
but during an interview with some of the
Apple executives behind one of their
shoulders you can see what looked like a
much larger macbook I look like the
design of the 12-inch MacBook but on a
larger perhaps macbook pro types go it's
got everybody drooling for finally a
redesigned for the macbook pro maybe
it's the new macbook air maybe the
macbook is a feature of apples design
language turns out it was it was none of
those apple released a statement saying
slow your roll dudes it was just a 12
inch macbook so disappointing i would
have been great to have that as a sign
for a macbook pro but it was not so
bummer they're all around 2015 is ending
with that really anything new from those
two fronts from Apple but perhaps 2016
will bring something new and exciting
not a wager we see the new macbook pro
I also of course the iphone 7 come
September then you guys are watching
episode of TB minis till next time I'm
dry render from technobuffalo a blabber
action the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
