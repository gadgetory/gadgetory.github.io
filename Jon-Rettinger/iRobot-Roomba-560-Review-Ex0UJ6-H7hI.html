here with three view for you of the
irobot roomba 560 also known as the
vacuum cleaning robot I gotta say I love
the Roomba now there are a couple
reasons that I love it slowly just from
a geek factor in it tech nut it's pretty
freaking cool to have a robot do your
vacuuming we just want to get your geek
on have your friends come over and hit
the vacuum it's really cool to see it in
action it's not the best vacuum in the
world certainly get in one of those
handhelds and that you're going to go
through the carpet place by place it's
gonna do a better job packing but that's
not really what the Roomba is about it
doesn't adequate job vacuuming but it
does it without you having to do the
vacuuming so that may make me sound a
little bit on the lazy side I'm not too
lazy to bank and brain stretch the
imagination I just think it's freaking
cool so the room but what it does so I'm
going to show you the back of it you can
see it's got these two brushes one here
one here and as it goes around it just
sucks up in vacuums it's got a filter
and a tray and it's got another brush
that pulls up your debris
now I will say using the Roomba is not
like using another vacuum maybe you have
to clean at the end of every use or
communaut√© once a week the Roomba is a
little bit high-maintenance I've got a
cat my cat sheds a lot like I showed you
guys during my unboxing and even during
my demonstration of the Roomba so
there's a decent amount of cat hair on
my floor no matter how much I brush her
or how much really how much I vacuum and
cat hair and give a lot of dust and
debris it's gonna get caught in the
bristles and they're gonna constantly
get the duty to do please clean room
with brushes and that's because this
thing talks to you if it's got an error
it'll tell you what the air is if it
needs its filter clean if it's full if
one of the brushes dirty or needs to be
clean it will tell you which totally
adds the cool factor another maybe
sounds a little bit geeky and dorky but
I'm a tech reviewer I'm a geek it's
it's kind of what I did so it does like
I said an adequate job clean you can set
to clean it'll clean your entire house
or apartment up to four to five rooms
and when it's done it'll come right back
to its dump and charge itself it does
come with two virtual walls you can keep
it confined to a space or you can set it
to route into other rooms I will say
that does go randomly so it takes a
while to go across the whole room but if
you leave it and it's okay you don't get
a warning or an error message it will
get your whole floor I don't have the
largest apartment in the world you guys
may have seen it during my unboxing but
it does clean my entire place in about
25 minutes so figure that's probably
about an average per room it's got a
smog mode but there's a particularly
dirty spot on your floor you hit spot
kind of spins around sort of a seashell
pattern Fibonacci if you will and it'll
clean that particular area it lets you
know when there's a dirty area as well
there's a blue light that will glow on
tops let you know it's vivid dirty spot
and when it's done it'll just keep going
on its way all this sort of geek fun
robot action does come at steep price
the iRobot Roomba 560 is going to run
you a whopping looking at the computer
screen 379 bucks so $380 will get you
the full iRobot Roomba with the two
virtual walls and extra filter and an
extra storage piece in my mind it's a
worthwhile price to pay like I said it's
not that I'm lazy to vacuums oftentimes
I forget my girlfriend has allergies
sometimes friends come over if I don't
vacuum that day you know they can have
some sort of reaction so I can set the
room but in fact that you said it to
vacuum every day while I'm gone every
day at noon this little guy is going
hard at work vacuuming my floor without
me having to worry about it it's a
little piece of modern luxury certainly
it's not a necessity I could just easily
use a regular vacuum and sometimes I do
but the Roomba is just cool to have a
robot go
vacuum your floor you can set it like I
said to schedule it it's got clock it
doesn't definitely an adequate job the
vacuuming in fact to rate this on a one
to five on a solely of vacuum scale so
comparing this to all of their handhelds
probably only gets a two and a half to
three but comparing this as we're giving
as a score rather on an entire package
so knowing what you're getting know what
you're getting an automated robotic
vacuum it's gotta be a five it really is
just cool check out my demo if you
haven't of the Roomba in action
currently kind of see the neat factor to
it and I know this sounds sort of silly
but oftentimes I sit there and just
watched the thing vacuum we're easily
got I can just take the back and do it
myself but it's just kind of fun to
watch it's cool to see the cat chase it
around and kind of bad at it and get
scared and run away just enjoyable few
pets they're gonna get a kick out of it
or hate it one of one of the two so guys
