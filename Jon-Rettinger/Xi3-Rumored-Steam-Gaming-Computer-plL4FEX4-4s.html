robo 13 and i'm here at CES 2013 because
i won the contest at TechnoBuffalo did a
few weeks ago I've been here at the xi3
booth talking about the new rumored
steam box to see if it's going to be
coming out in the next few months could
this be valves new breakthrough gaming
computer stick around to find out after
guys don't know who valve is valve is
the company that made team fortress 2 as
well as the left 4 dead franchise and a
bunch of other games I'm sure you guys
have all heard about now if you also
play any games on the pc you definitely
heard a steam and valve is the company
who created steam as well so valve is
definitely the company to be making
these kind of gaming computers I've
always wanted a gaming company to
finally take in and create their own
version of a gaming computer pretty much
specifically for a gamer so no one from
xi3 actually gave us any specific
details but they did say to expect
something amazing we do know that the
code name for it is piston also no one
knows any specific specs just yet but we
do know that the piston is based off the
current x7 a modular computer from xi3
which is packing a quad core AMD apu up
to 8 gigabytes of ddr3 RAM a 32 gigabyte
SSD which retails for about a thousand
dollars so you can expect some big
upgrades the new piston a competitive
gaming computer hopefully in the near
future now the rumors are true we should
expect the compact gaming computer from
valve and xi3 in the next few months and
if any company should take the reins in
the gaming PC market its valve
