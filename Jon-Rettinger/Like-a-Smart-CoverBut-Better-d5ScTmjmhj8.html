TechnoBuffalo here the Apple official
Smart Covers are fun they offer some
decent functionality you get the magnets
it turns on the screen when you open it
up you can prop it a ton of different
ways but one big glaring feature that
you don't get for the exorbitant price
is any sort of protection on the back of
your tablet you can see mine right here
is pretty decently scratched up when I
use the Smart Cover which occasionally I
will use and I throw it in the bag I'm
always worried I am going to completely
decimate the aluminum or aluminium
depending on where you are back of your
tablet well the folks at a case actually
have thought of that and now offer the
best of both worlds let me show you
what's easier
so available in several fun colors
including the standard black we've got
smart cover functionality with the
protection of the back ear device so
let's go ahead and take out orange I'm
feeling like I'm in an orange kind of
mood thank you to the folks at 8k
pretending these over you guys know that
I use in kids products I think the
companies actually really outstanding I
know the people there and I like them
they sent these over for review if you
want to take a look at these or check
out any of the colors the link will be
right down below it's gonna come in this
package go ahead and slide it out got
that same polyurethane feel that you're
used to on the Smart Cover it's also
going to ship with a bit of a screen
protector as well if you want to leave
that in there go ahead push it off the
side for just a minute on first blush
looks very similar to the Smart Cover
you can see if we get if we leave it
fold it like that and we take one of the
Apple official Smart Covers see it's
kind of hard to even tell it when to new
to the material side by side feels
almost the same both certainly feel high
quality we'll throw this non back
protecting one off to the side open this
up I'm gonna go ahead and install it
we'll come back in just a minute
so we've got it installed it's pretty
standard installation if you've ever
used a full protection case for the iPad
2 you need to use the official
application the iPad 1 installation is
going to be pretty standard slides it on
the side and there's a little bit of a
leather flap here or suede flap that's
gonna protect it from falling out so on
first blush
you've got taste protection you've got a
little bit of a ridge on the side here
so if you do unfortunately drop your
iPad it's not gonna hit iPad 2 concrete
or iPad whatever you dropped it on you
are going to have a little bit of extra
right there you've got full access all
your buttons and ports you can see
button you can see ports including the
volume on the right hand side and
rotation lock or volume mute depending
homeo except for no problem accessing
your camera or the microphones and the
3.5 millimeter headset jack I like today
there's a slot for the microphone as
well a lot of cases actually don't do
that so if you're using this for
FaceTime or Skype it's not going to be
muffled and you get that same material
on the back of the iPad that you've got
on the front you've got some cutouts for
your speakers as well so this is all
pretty standard Smart Cover
functionality here all this stuff you
loved about the original you now get
with you added protection of the back so
you're gonna have the magnets on the
front which is gonna turn it on well
I've got nothing exciting showing there
there we go so it's gonna turn on close
it so we can catch it
hang on boom you can go ahead and do
your little Rolly thing and prop it up
and you can type if you're on an
airplane and you want to watch movies
you can prop it up like this you can
really do anything you want with this
guy again it's gonna be available in a
ton of different colors I'll show you
some of the ones that the 8 gauge goes
over again if you want to go pink you've
got that choice there's green there's
blue pretty much the same colors that
Apple sells if you want all the
functionality and looks at the Smart
Cover we want to make sure that the fast
year device is going to be nicely
protected this is going to be a really
really solid option the link is going to
be down below
you want to get your purchase on and
thank you again to the folks in a case
for hooking me up with what's now my new
iPad to kiss I'm John Breton Jeffrey
