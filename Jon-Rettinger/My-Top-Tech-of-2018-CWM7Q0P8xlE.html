this video chances are you were within
like 10 days of the exact middle point
of the year and I mentioned that because
a lot of tech has come out the first
part of the year and the biggest
question that I get in comments and
emails is first what wallpapers do you
use we've made a whole video talking
about that which willing to appear and
and down there but it's also what tech
do you use for like X sort of thing so
things like like headphones gaming
cables batteries kind of everything in
between so I figured I love to make
videos let's make a video of our top
tech in the first half of 2008 so when I
hope you guys try to find a good pair of
headphones without breaking your bank
let's start with the Marshall major
three Bluetooth these are 150 bucks so
they're not gonna be crazy expensive but
you're gonna get a lot of value for that
dollar so the big deal for me especially
when I'm traveling is battery life
I need headphones that are going to
glass that I've tested I'm probably
about 75 different pairs of headphones
over the past three or four years
battery life is super important these
are gonna give you 30 hours of battery
life so you'd expect a company like
Marshall to use the latest technology
they're actually using Qualcomm
technology and they've bought aptX but
it's just gonna call it Bluetooth app
text that's gonna give you things like a
higher bitrate it's gonna minimize audio
and video syncing issues it's also gonna
give you 30 feet of range so the
Marshall major three Bluetooth they've
got a control knob which lets you kind
of control everything you could start
stopped you could pause you can answer
phone calls kind of everything just from
a knob and it's a physical actual knob
that you could press the audio quality
is generally really good it's got 40
millimeter dynamic drivers they're
custom tuned for enhanced bass response
and it's Marshalls you kind of expect
that it's got pretty smooth mids and
pre-clear highest and overall the Ida
experience was just generally good and
better what I was listening to when it
comes to comfort there on your headphone
they're not over your headphones and
they fit pretty well they're pretty
comfortable so I'll put them on you
can't see how comfortable they are but
they are pretty comfortable there isn't
any sort of noise cancelling here but it
does
nice job that your cups of canceling out
the noise that are around you but also
you can still hear what's going on so if
your commuter you're on a train you want
to make sure you can hear your stop use
a really nice job with that and also
mention traveling walks I'm doing a lot
of traveling the collapsible design is
also super nice so if all of this sounds
good to you or something that you want
to pick up we'll link to the marshal
major threes down below and I do want to
thank Marshall for sponsoring this video
but these opinions are all my own these
are headphones that are legitimately we
wouldn't recommend them if we didn't so
again you want to check them out link
down below so the questions we get is a
lot of times what do we use to shoot our
videos with and we exclusively use Sony
we migrated over from Canon Sony's
released their a seven three and a seven
three is really versatile camera first
two thousand dollars but it's versatile
for stills it's great for video you get
something that's really good for
everything
it's got Sony's new 24 megapixel Exmor R
sensor which might not mean anything to
you but what its gonna translate to is
just better low-light and faster
autofocus and if you're gonna rely on
the out-of-focus
it's got 693 out of focus points which
is absolutely insane for this price
point so you can film in 4k but it's
gonna over sample the image from
actually six day I'm just gonna mean
you're gonna get better video quality
and sharper images so probably the best
thing about the a7 3 is a bigger battery
d7 3 supposed to the last 2.2 times more
than the crappy ones that we've got here
and when we go out on a shoot we got to
have like 30 of them so maybe that was
more technical but no the Sony a7 3 is
gonna be good pretty much for everything
an absolutely killer price point when it
comes to gaming you probably think
you're either PC master-race ps4 Xbox
one X but the gaming console let's have
the most staying power surprisingly in
our office is actually a Nintendo switch
and with III a ton of new games are
coming all the games you want to play
fortnight coming to the switch it's an
awesome versatile gaming console I had a
problem with Zelda
so probably don't pick it up here and
played it unless you want to give up
like 4 days of your life 300 bucks not
cheap but you're gonna get a console you
can take with you anywhere without
having to sort of sacrifice the fun that
you get from like a ps4 or an Xbox
we obviously review a lot of phones here
and what phone should I get is such a
hard question to answer I get it from
family all the time to you every person
needs are different but if there's one
phone that's pretty much good for almost
everything especially photography it's a
pixel to excel and I recognize that the
3xl is is coming out in a few months the
2xl is still so incredible on the camera
department Google's machine learning has
made what started out as an awesome
camera just get better
I love the pixel to excel you don't know
what phone to get and you're not already
on Team Apple or team Android just want
a good phone pixel to excel is a really
good way to go and there's some deals
you can find especially from the
carriers so I know it's weird to go from
talking about an Android phone to an
Apple watch but the best SmartWatch
out there right now as of Jude is very
clearly the Apple watch series 3
although it doesn't come cheap at 3 into
29 bucks and nothing makes me feel like
more of a hypocrite than smartwatches I
can't come up with the reason to
recommend them yet I can never seem to
take a SmartWatch off of my wrist the
Apple watch is the best at what it does
if notifications are important to you
you're going to get them the taptic
engine makes the vibrations feel the
most unique you get things like Apple
pay built-in the watch can be a bit
condescending like you just need a brisk
20 minute walk to close your rings or
recommend you stand up if you can deal
with a bit of condescension from your
wrist I still think the Apple watch
Series 3 is the best tomorrow work you
can get with the one caveat if you want
to get some a little bit cheaper there
are a lot of sales you can get on this
series too didn't get almost the same
features save for the LTE so I'm gonna
talk about a cable next but don't don't
click away quite yet think about what
you got to take with you when you're
traveling chances are it's maybe a
microUSB cable for charging some
headphones maybe it's a lightning cable
for your iPhone maybe it's USBC cable
for for your pixel device but chances
are you've got at least two to three
different cables the Nomad Universal
Cable is one cable for 30 bucks gives
you all of those in one so the main end
is USB a you plug it into something and
you could pick what you want to use with
really elegant system of caps you can
sort of plug on what you want
and for 30 bucks it's almost the same
price he's buying a lightning cable from
Apple but again the versatility of two
other options so talking a lot about
travel a lot about tech what if you want
to carry all that stuff I talked about
with you meet the air gay pack spelled
AER so you know it's you know it's fancy
so first it's obviously has that unique
look it's different than most backpacks
it's also water-resistant so if you live
somewhere where it drizzles out your
stuffs gonna be okay it's a pretty
compact design but it's got just a
beastly amount of space inside and it
keeps the bag shape even when it's empty
which is good it can hold up to a 15
inch laptop or tablet there's an
interior water bottle pocket which is
strange to have have inside it's a quick
access pouch so if you want to throw
things like keys or phone or your
Marshall headphones and you can do it
from the best backpacks out there and
bags and get expensive this one's not
the cheapest but not the most expensive
it's like kind of in the middle 125
bucks but if you want a bag it's gonna
last you and not destroy you physically
the airdate that's a pretty good way to
go so that's a lot of Technology you're
only halfway through the year I'm sure
it'll change if you want headphones you
want a gaming console you want a bag or
even even a cable these are things that
we legitimately use and like everyday
all the links to things will be down
below hope you guys enjoyed appeared to
hit the subscribe button and the bell
and the rest of the stuff that YouTube
makes us do because you don't get
notifications anymore because YouTube
doesn't like to do that we'd appreciate
it certainly a thumbs up as well until
next time I'm Jon Ranger from
