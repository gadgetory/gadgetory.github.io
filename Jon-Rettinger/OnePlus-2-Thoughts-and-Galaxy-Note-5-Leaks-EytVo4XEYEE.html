to you by domain.com what's up everyone
welcome i kept assaut dove ask the
buffalos the show where I like to sit
down pick a foot up talk to you guys
about questions you've got for the
technology and usually it's like not
even close to technology but this week
we're refocusing on heck first question
comes from our friend sore who by the
way is an awesome name at storms 11 he
says at john for lakers when you were
starting off how did you get vendors to
send you product seems like they
disregard the little guys wealth or I've
got an answer for you it's all about
showing value whether you're a huge
youtube channel or small ones all about
showing value to appear representative
and certainly while doing so always
maintaining that journalistic integrity
so whether you have to fight to get a
device you should not feel obligated to
give it a positive review in fact I
uploaded a whole playlist of videos
while back on how we got devices what
you need to do sort of get to that level
and when you're not at that level yet
what you can do to help get to that
point so we'll link to that playlist
down below definitely check out
hopefully it'll help answer your
question if you have any more questions
that aren't answered in those videos let
me know I will make some more additions
to that playlist victim comes from real
Joshua s ii who asks at john for lakers
hi John hi Joshua what are your thoughts
on the 1+2 it's gonna be awesome that's
it's gonna be awesome for words I think
it's going to blow the competition out
there's no one plus i think was a
groundbreaking device you got flagship
specs add a non premium price think the
price is going to be a little bit higher
just time around the specs of our been
released it looks incredible and
honestly i give 1 plus bennett for the
doubt they're gonna release a kick-ass
device we know it's going to have us bc
and also gonna have a sort of a tweaked
version snapdragon 810 i think it's
gonna be a killer phone I hope the price
point isn't crazy high excited certainly
put in competition with some of the
higher-end devices but i think the
oneplus folks are smart i hope they do
with the invite system but it's not
gonna happen i'm really excited for it
we should see the full review though i
believe in the 27th of july next one
comes from at charles carrera who asked
at john for lakers what do you think
about the recent iphone and galaxy note
leaks i think both those phones are
to be very interesting so iphone 6s and
presumably 6s plus what's called a
success our research reports are coming
out it's going to be about two
millimeters thicker before you start
getting upset supposedly that extra
thickness is to add force touch glass
two screens so that's real pretty
awesome I've ever used an apple watching
force touch has a huge potential for
adding function at the iphone that's not
there that adding another physical
button the leaks also show the home
button will indeed be to this generation
think they'll ditch it for the iphone 7
we are not there yet other than that all
the buttons and stuff are exactly as
you'd expect just a little bit on the
thicker side we can see sort of a new
aluminum kind of alloys the right word
but a new version of aluminum before you
set yelling at aluminum is element I
know but it's tweaked it's not pure
aluminum in your phone so it'll be
another sort of mixture of aluminum
that'll go into next gen phone and on
the Galaxy Note front roof gonna be just
a bigger galaxy s6 think a lot of people
really want including I'll give you a
hint what has two thumbs and really
wants a bigger galaxy x 6 this guy we
should see it make its grand debut at
IFA surround the september-october time
frame but figure galaxy s6 I wouldn't
expect a giant specs I'm Karina see a 4k
screen anything like that but just the
bigger Essex like a lot of people really
happy so absolutely we're gonna see the
next gen phones we stop real fast thank
our peeps at domain.com it's a place to
go when the next great idea hits you
like in the middle of the night so
one-stop shopping for all your domain
name and web hosting email needs the
rank calm wants to hook you up with a
pretty sick aw for say twenty percent on
domain names and web hosting would use
coupon code technobuffalo it's all one
word and caps at domain coms check out
when you think domains think domain.com
last definitely not least Thomas Crowley
asks at John for lakers new code I read
that as a bro you can code the answer is
no but I really wish I did if I could
have gone back to when I was in school I
would have learned to code I would have
major in computer science and go to
manic huge asset to know how to do that
I've had a play to spend this amount of
catch-up in this industry to learn just
basics how to understand the code it
would have helped me save time hassle
and money on a first launch techno
before
looking out there you're in college
you're looking something to study learn
how to code it's never going to hurt you
i think it's like learning mandarin it's
never gonna hurt you is only going to
help you you have the opportunity learn
how to code do it I'm gonna try I'm
probably try to pick up a few books and
sort of learned on my free time it can
be really helpful but that's just just
me I tried to bed yourself and learn how
to code it could be helpful I don't
think you guys watch the episode of ask
the buff hope you enjoyed i was love
making this video just talking you guys
anyway till next time jon rettinger see
you guys next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
