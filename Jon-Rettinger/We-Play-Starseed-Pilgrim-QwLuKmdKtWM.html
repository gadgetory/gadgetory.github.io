editor at technobuffalo calm and
currently you're watching me lose at
starseed pilgrim I think I'm losing I
don't know I assume i'm using i can't
really tell if there's winning or losing
this game is strange we're going to take
a look at it over the course of this
woman and clip enjoy Starseed pilgrim is
available right now for the pc and mac /
steam or directly from the developer at
Starseed pilgrim calm for six bucks this
like i said before is a strange game
with only a little more than an hour of
play under my belt before recording clip
you're watching right now i can safely
say that i'm still not exactly sure what
I'm doing it's not really an insult just
the game basically promises to be an
interactive riddle and it is it's a
confusing riddle it's one that I'm still
trying to uncover and understand so far
and I don't think I'm giving anything
away here maybe I am I don't know I know
that the blackness of space is bad you
see it eating away at the colorful
blocks I'm near at a constant clip I
also know that the stars turn into keys
when touched but they also spread the
blackness of space instantly so I need
to plant enough blocks to reach said
stars so that I can make my way back to
the lock in the world inverts at the
start of this we play episode you saw me
get stuck in a star I think that was
because I basically failed at getting
enough seeds between myself and the star
to get back so once through the lock
that's kind of at the bottom of
world I'm tasked with planting more
blocks there are messages scrawled on
the walls of the hub world and they
serve as quasi tutorials that I'm still
trying to uncover from there I know that
the heart blocks to see those pink ones
there they give me more seeds the green
wavy ones that I encounter over to the
left there like almost like marsh are
like swamp it's it's really hard to move
through them and you can't jump quite as
high the oral stuff that there's there's
lots of weird audio going on kind of at
all times and and it's it's a little
haunting but it's kind of cool it's not
necessarily musical as I'm sure here
right now it's more than or speaker
sound I'm completely lost when it comes
to playing this game but I think that's
a good thing that this this feels like a
title that that's meant to be explored
slowly and that is hard to understand
there's no real tutorial or gameplay
instructions so to speak you just kind
of start they made they give you a
little control prompt and and that's
really it I don't know we've looked at
strange games like this before on we
play like antechamber and proteus and
starseed pilgrim feels kind of like one
of those games there's a lot going on
here and I'm really only just starting
to discover it personally this game
probably won't be for everyone if you're
looking for a title that stands as a
pure challenge to understand kind of
like an interactive riddle that that
might reward you over time and then I
can recommend starseed pilgrim to you
it's not for everyone and and I don't
think that people who are looking for
more instant gratification when it comes
to games should apply but for six
dollars it's definitely something worth
checking out I just reverted the world
there and I'm going to head back to to
this hub I'm going to collect some parts
this is what I'm talking about here's
the lock at the bottom and there we go
I'm still trying to figure this one out
it's an odd game that that certainly
stands is one of a kind of experience
for now i'm joey davidson from
TechnoBuffalo calm thank you so much for
watching and we'll be back with another
episode of we play soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
