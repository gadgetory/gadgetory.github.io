to you by AMD's a-series chips welcome
back to the episode of rumor roundup
this to show we take all the tech rivers
from the week and there were quite a few
this week and we smash and weak densa my
we say here is a nice appetizing dish of
room ernest for you to enjoy there's a
lot to talk about if you don't to follow
all the rumors from the week does the
only show you have to watch of this week
we're gonna talk about samsung get into
the fingerprint scanning business x
phone is coming but might not be the way
you think apple iwatch is already in
testing with a 1.5 inch display if you
got a galaxy s3 you've been staring
longingly at the galaxy s4 fear not
because it might be getting some of its
key features this rumor roundup let's
start rounding them up so Sam mobile was
recently set to file that suggested
Samsung considered or perhaps still
considering adding fingerprint scanning
technology to its lattice plasticky
phones we've seen this before word the
motorola atrix 4g on AT&amp;amp;T it had it for
example an apple also is reportedly
interested adding its tech to the next
gen iphone the 5s probably delete came
in the form of a sec settings APK file
it shows images where it appears in the
phone so one even suggest that the
fingerprint scanner might have been
built into the smartphone's home button
just below the display we don't know why
fits and ultimately build on the idea
perhaps it was too expensive or just
unnecessary though we do hope it
continues to develop it and maybe you'll
see the future devices i think it's
going away it's gonna work if it's fast
if it's smooth and we don't sort of
delay you put your finger on it
automatically unlocks gotta be quicker
than the base unlocks earlier in the
week report on a rumor that Motorola's x
phone is likely slated for AT&amp;amp;T release
as the very sexually named xt 1058 but
could also be coming to verizon as the
equally sexy xt 1060 now a third x phone
model the xt 156 is serviced the
motorola x phone is rumored to feature a
unimpressive 720p display and dual core
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor that's
pretty low inspector during the quad
core chipsets and a 1080p gorgeous
displays we're singing this year's top
to your handset so when you think
a chance at the XT 1056 actually be a
budget-friendly model of the x-phone
meant to compete with Samsung's hoard of
lower to your smart phones but we'll
need to wait for more information before
making that conclusion Apple is
reportedly already testing its first
SmartWatch and it supposedly has a 1.5
inch OLED display according to fresh
reports from the economic times alrighty
display has reportedly been tapped to
provide the screens and touch sensors
for the device apparently a paleta
settle on a 1.5 inch pediatric decided
that it won't play display was just too
big for most wrists Foxconn is building
the device and has already received an
order for 1,000 units economic times
said a separate report from Bloomberg
and Mark suggested that more than 1,000
Apple employees were assigned to develop
the iWatch and that the wearable
computer will launch later this year so
we're not quite sure what it'll look
like or how it'll work yet or what its
gonna feel like or anything we do hope
the Apple embed series support network
seamlessly with iOS devices obviously
the iPhone the iPad perhaps we'll see
something and apples developers
conference WWDC that kicks off next
month but it might be too early for the
company chat about its i watch plans so
Samsung already said many of the galaxy
s4 software flourishes will arrive on a
galaxy s3 and a freshly leaked build of
android 4.2 point2 so the firmware is
currently in the very early testing
phase so the kinks are still definitely
being worked out however software does
offer plenty of clues about the s3
owners can expect kind of finally hits
most immediate difference is found in
the lock screen where users can say
multiple widgets new effects even set a
customizable message so that's cool but
beyond the lock screen the bill dad's
user interface tweaks for much more
fluid experience including a really neat
to finger swipe down reveals the
s-series quick toggle menu is also tab
settings i'm reading the look of the
galaxy s4 additionally the update
includes features such as driving mode
updated s voice and new screen modes I
do give Samsung credit for continuing
not only support an older device but
also give it new features a new life let
me take a minute to thank our friends
and sponsors at AMD
alright so there aren't that many times
my life that I get it feel like a spy
but carrying this thing around I
honestly felt like I was right out of a
James Bond movie it is crazy freaking
cool what you're looking at here is
temas it's the code name for the
microchips that are going to be branded
as the a series elite mobility APU from
AMD so obviously this is just a
prototype clearly by time it's all done
it's gonna look like this this beautiful
tablet what this is hopefully going to
do is sort of bridge that gap between
tablets and full on desktop be able to
handle anything that you want to throw
at it from your standard media
consumption stuff to full-on gaming and
we can check out you know will it play
this thing will play a lot of awesome
content in fact we've got loaded up on
here a sneak preview of what's yet to
come steam and if this thing can handle
the games that we play all the time if I
can handle our left for dead you know at
really high settings and just the things
that we like to do it'll be a good test
what the processor can handle AMD is
really trying to sort of bridge the gap
and be the one chip for everything for
the folks I want to just take a tablet
and go watch movie on an airplane to
folks that really want to play some
hardcore games they are thinking that
this guy right here ultimately can do it
all I want to tell you about another
show that I do technobuffalo is driven
this week we talked about how do you put
out a press release about Tesla saying
don't give them too much credit don't
put them up on a pedestal it made no
sense that Audi would even give tests
with any intention but they did it's got
a fun so check it out right here anyway
guys thank you for watching please give
this video a bit fatty thumbs up we must
definitely appreciate it check us out at
TechnoBuffalo come for latest in
greatest tech news mji rettinger see you
next video
