TechnoBuffalo here at the fun unboxing
for you that's a nice departure from the
Apple and Android centric videos the
past few days I've got an unboxing here
for you of a sonos product I'm not
entirely sure what zone of scents here
in this big box we're going to dig in
and find out for if you're not familiar
with so notes there a purveyor of
high-end audio equipment so I'm kind of
curious let's go ahead and see what's in
here and I have no idea why there
appears to be a blood stain on the box
go ahead and dig in and of course you
got the obligatory or the obat because i
like to call it well go ahead and just
dig into the box and see what we got
step aside
alright we've broken the literal seal on
Apache paper that's like so no sent us
the sonos zone player s5 go ahead and
give you guys some information on this
in a minute once I take it out of this
big shipping box so what do we have here
we've got some press material this is a
unit that sent just for demo go ahead
take another box we'll take a look at
that in just a minute that they also
sent us a zone bridge go ahead and push
this off to the side and let's take a
look at the products themselves alright
so we're going to take a look at the
sonos zone player s5 this is going to
run you 399 let me tell you a little bit
about it this is right from the sonos
website it's a high-performance wireless
music system with five speakers powered
by five dedicated digital amplifiers two
tweeters two mid-range drivers in what
subwoofer the s5 delivers crystal-clear
room filling sound that rivals much
larger more complicated audio equipment
plus all of digital sound architecture
provides precise sound reproduction just
as the artist intended with the s5 you
can quickly add a room of music anywhere
you want so if we plug it in and enjoy
the s5 superior wireless range no room
is out of reach I control us evidently
with your computer the internet or the
iphone or ipod touch via the app the
other thing they sent us here is a zone
bridge 100 this is going to run you
conveniently $100 the zone bridge 100
makes setting up and all on wireless so
no system wonderfully fast and easy I'll
be the judge of that instead of using a
zone player simply connect the zone
bridge to your router instantly activate
the sonos net wireless mesh network now
with your zone player and controller you
can wirelessly puts music anywhere in
your house it's the ideal solution if
you don't have eaten net wiring in every
room okay let's go ahead and dig in and
see what this thing looks like for 400
bucks you definitely want to make sure
getting your money's worth and getting a
quality product I've never used a sonos
sound system so I have no idea how it
works
so there's gonna be a very think
unbiased review as all of my reviews are
or at least I try and make them so let's
go ahead and dig in and see what we got
here this looks like it's a new unit I
let's see what your 400 bucks is going
to get you on the top of the box you
fried diggin tells you got the stone
it's sonos zone players five picture of
it on the front with the iphone app
right there some info on the back as
well supposedly they're really
advertising this is great to use with
Pandora or the Sirius XM app or any of
the other audio streaming applications
that you can get for the iphone or ipod
touch it see them all listed right there
let's go ahead and dig in and see you
again congratulations so the support
team thank you for your purchase while
your stone this would be pure magic you
got some get it starting stuff and a
disc and this will work with Windows or
Mac XP Vista 7 OS 10 leopard snow
leopard whatever you're running any
modern operating systems all right so
we'll pull styrofoam out of the box and
here it looks to be the sono system
there's a handle in the back that's it
it's a very sort of simple design it's
heavier than I expected it to be it's
got a decent amount of weight to it
looks like just a big speaker grill on
the front on the back of it here we've
gone looks like audio in and some sort
of audio out power and two wired
Ethernet ports that's interesting we'll
see how those work push that off let's
see what else would get in the box
here's something else in here box within
a box
little bit to be anything else terribly
exciting power audio cable even it and
that's appears to be all that you're
going to get for your money let's go
ahead and take a look at the zone bridge
100 that son of folks were also nice
left to send over same sort of thing
congratulations welcome to the sonos
family so to speak and here is our zone
bridge go ahead and take out of the box
get the package and there it is sort of
a small white until be nice looking fox
power and two Ethernet ports on the back
or Ethernet switch rather on the back
and keep digging into the box we also
have probably the same array cables we
had with the previous device very thin
ethernet cable and a power adapter in
there and that is about it so I'm very
excited to use this and let you guys
know what I think and of course i'll
give you some sample of audio quality
and we can check out whether or not this
is worth your 400 bucks for the system
for you and 500 if you want to get it
with the zone bridge certainly not in an
inexpensive proposition but we'll see if
it's worth the money and I stay tuned to
the channel for the rest of the sonos
videos i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
