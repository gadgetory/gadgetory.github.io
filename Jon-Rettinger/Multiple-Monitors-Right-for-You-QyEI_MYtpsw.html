TechnoBuffalo
and in this video we're going to talk
about multiple monitor configurations
we've got a lot of questions and emails
from people wondering how do you connect
multiple monitors to a computer why do
you need multiple monitors obviously I
have four behind me and there's a very
good reason for that we're going to
cover that in this video
so for those of you that have used two
monitors before know that it can really
increase your productivity the ability
to have two things on the screen at one
time side by side such as a document and
an internet site for when you're writing
a report or Hulu and maybe instant
messaging so that you can kind of watch
a movie or watch a video while you're
IME is a really great thing that can
help to increase productivity I've
actually seen some people with 10 or 12
monitors and there's definitely a law of
diminishing return in terms of
productivity so there's so there's not a
five times increase from two monitors to
ten monitors just doesn't work that way
the reason that some people have you
know eight ten twelve monitors is
because they work in industries that
require them to see a lot of data on the
screen at one time perfect examples the
finance industry stock traders they need
to see many different graphs and charts
and figures and items on the screen at
one time to be able to do their due the
profession the right way and so the
question becomes how do you actually
hook up multiple monitors well it's
quite easy you can have as many monitors
as you have video outputs so in my case
I've got two video cards with two video
outputs now you can fill up your desktop
with as many video cards as it can
handle whether it's PCI PCI Express AGP
and plug in as many monitors as you can
fit now of course you're going to want
to have some you know a good processor
enough RAM to be able to have your
computer handle all of this but two
monitors three monitors is not that
difficult for a computer to be able to
handle so what I'm going to do now is
take you through exactly why I have four
monitors we're going to turn the camera
around and kind of show you what's on
each of my four displays here so that
you have an idea of how somebody with
four monitors may actually make good use
of that screen real estate see you in a
sec
okay so the two monitors on the left are
both Dell 24 inch monitors with 1900
horizontal resolution and 1200 vertical
resolution that was a really important
resolution to me because a lot of 20 to
24 inch monitors have actually 1080
resolution now which is great for
high-definition video but if you really
want to be able to see a lot of things
on the screen at one time to get that
extra vertical resolution the 1200
really makes a big difference now as you
can see on my left monitor is all about
Twitter actually manage for Twitter
feeds one for my personal Twitter and
four for our three for various websites
on the left I am using tweet deck which
is an excellent program to be able to
see many things about Twitter at one
time so in the center I have my mentions
on the right I have a group of people
that I like to follow more closely than
my general pool of friends over here on
the left it takes up a lot of screen
space which is why for the other three
Twitter feeds I am using twirl which is
a very narrow looking way to look at
your Twitter there are buttons along the
bottom you can quickly go from your
mentions to your direct messages all
within one very tall column so it makes
it really easy to manage multiple things
on the screen at one time now the
monitor in the center is the one that I
actually look at the most because it's
right in front of me so I use it as my
internet monitor and what you're going
to notice here is I actually have
Windows 7 running and Windows 7 doesn't
have support for task bars on multiple
monitors so I'm actually using a program
called Ultraman it actually extends the
taskbar to all of your monitors if you
have multiple monitors and windows or
Windows 7 it's cost $30 but I think it's
tremendously worth the price because to
be able to have the taskbar on multiple
screens is really a great thing so I use
this window 4 for internet like I said
and I like to kind of keep it over here
to the right so that I can see the icons
that I have on my desktop at a given
time I actually use a resizer program
called window resize err it's a Firefox
plug-in and I can quickly go about and
change the actual size of the window and
because this is such a high resolution
screen I really have a lot of
flexibility to be able to change the
resolution
- pretty much what most people have a
lot of people have this resolution 1024
by 768 the next standard would be
probably 1080 by 800 and then you get to
1080 by 1024 I also use this monitor for
video editing because if it's right in
front of me I want to be able to kind of
take a look at it and be able to access
it right from there and over here on the
Left I have two del twenty inch monitors
turned horizontally or actually turned
vertically and the reason for that it is
very specific I like having the extra
vertical resolution especially in
Outlook to be able to see you know 4050
emails on the screen at one time whereas
if I turn them the other way I would
probably see half of that now the
resolution on these monitors is 1680
down and 1050 across so as I said I use
this monitor a lot for Outlook email I
also use it for Dreamweaver so I can
take a look at website code and be able
to see a lot in one take and over here
on the right I kind of consider this my
auxiliary monitor where I can monitor my
buddy list I can play music sometimes I
use it for a webpage if I'm monitoring
the radar if a storms coming or
something like that so that was a look
at my monitor configuration again four
monitors is probably overkill for a lot
of people two monitors can really help a
lot with productivity but it really
matters what you're using your computer
for for a lot of people one monitor is
good enough so I hope this video was
helpful and giving you some insight into
how people use multiple monitors and
hopefully you've an idea of whether it's
for you or it's not for you so that's it
for now bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
