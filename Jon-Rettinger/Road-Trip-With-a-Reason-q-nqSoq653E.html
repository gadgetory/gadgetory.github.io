throughout your day and it's maybe not
necessary but adds a little bit of
convenience you text your friend instead
of calling you go to an ATM instead of
walking in a bank you go through a
drive-thru instead of walk into the
restaurant all these little things just
make your average day a bit easier Matt
and I had the chance to check out a new
such convenience but we couldn't just
you know check it out in Southern
California we actually flew to Chicago
where we started a half country Odyssey
we got hooked up with a connected car
that has marketplace apps the cool thing
about the car it had the shell pay and
save app already built in we could
actually pay for your gas without having
to get out so come along with us on the
first leg of our road trip and a big
thank you to shell for sponsoring this
video
so I'm starting the journey here in
Chicago on a Friday afternoon Chicago
here in water show Matt and I just
landed we've been taking a look at the
sights walking around Lakeshore Drive we
are on our way to Indiana from Chicago
Indiana for our first stop I don't think
I've ever been to Indiana have you never
been Indiana
no first time Indiana Indiana go I don't
want to alarm anybody but tragedy has
befallen us we lost self-service
somewhere outside of Hammond Indiana
so we just pulled into our first Shell
station it actually worked out perfectly
because it was raining for almost a
whole duration to drive so what if you
had a gas station and it's pouring out
coming in sideways doesn't matter if
you're covered and you want to limit
your time outside what if like
hypothetically you could just take care
of all the payment from your car put in
a pin at the pump and then pump and back
in the safety of your car you can't the
shell and car makers are teaming up to
launch embedded in - car payment systems
which is pretty cool so this cars got
its own LTE connection built in and it's
pretty powerful which means you can have
apps and one of the apps that we've got
here if we go into the marketplace so
like you can get your grub on but you
can also use shell pan safe so it's
super simple you just hit pay and save
it asking for the pump number we are at
eight so you'll enter your pin number
for security so your credit cards will
show up you select the one you want to
authorize the payment you're also
getting ten cents back per gallon hit
confirm you're gonna get a PIN number
you just put it at the pump and get you
a pump on activation code enter
yeah hang out tail the scenes I'm a
friend of the people or just go hang on
your car
easy I can we are all filled up let's
see how far we get tonight hopefully far
we had a lot of traffic over so we just
did our first fill up and Hammond
Indiana and now we are on our way to
South Bend Indiana we've got another 70
miles to go and we'll be at the home of
Notre Dame sleep rest refuel and then we
got 600 miles to go tomorrow okay feel
mad feeling good be good do it
so here's how the days gone so up at 4
a.m. 7 a.m. flight flew to Chicago and
that we've gone as far as I think my
eyes can safely drive us and Matt's eyes
can safely drive us retired now on our
way to South Bend we or end of the day
it has been a long day
if I could have like one thing that
would be easy that would be nice and
paying for gas is generally like not the
most like pleasant experience pumping
gas in general it's not like a reg can't
wait to pump gas
but she'll are making it like at least a
little bit easier they've taken
they're taking the suck out of it and
there's my life easy
so the hotel in South Bend Indiana has
the world's lowest garage if you were an
SUV you would hit it I don't know how
all these cars are not like passionate
day one is finally in the books wind it
up in South Bend Indiana I'm hoping
tomorrow take a look at Notre Dame's
campus before you head out again whole
trip was really easy car made it simple
navigation made it easy are able to fill
up what are driving as far you just want
things to be simple you want things to
be easy and that's pretty much what it
was hope you guys enjoy it's kind of
like mini vlog roadtrip we had a blast
making it this is just part one of a
two-part video or the second part as we
get from here to the Pocono Raceway in
Pennsylvania gonna show you some other
cool stuff along the way hopefully get
into a few shenanigans hope you guys
enjoy it again thanks to shell for
making this possible I'm gonna crash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
