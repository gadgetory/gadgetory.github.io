TechnoBuffalo here and we have a
hands-on with you very elusive Samsung
Galaxy Tab 8.9 this guy's been announced
but we haven't really seen it much in
the wild from respect standpoint and
very familiar to the Tab 10.1 1280 by
800 screen although it's got an 8.9 inch
display
it's got Samsung's TouchWiz on top which
is actually pretty neat it's got this
thing called live panels let me show you
go ahead and tap that and I know you
guys love that joke it makes me laugh
every time - I know the launch stuff
right on top of whatever you're doing
any little trick alright but enough of
that let's go ahead and talk about specs
and take a tour of the device from
respect standpoint other than the screen
size it's almost identical actually to
the Tab 10.1 so on the right hand side
depending on how you're looking at it or
the left hand side let's go with right
so holding it up like this you've got
your power and lock buttons volume
rocker up and down it looks very similar
it's an extremely thin device 3.5
millimeter headset jack that same white
matte look on the back I believe a 3
megapixel camera with autofocus and LED
flash and there is your charging port
and dual speakers and it sounds like the
tab is yelling at me there are two
differences here now that we've got
TouchWiz sitting on top of course
honeycomb being powered by NVIDIA Tegra
2 processor so we've got some sort of
unique things here you'll see in typical
honeycomb so this is a bit of a tweak
here in settings and if we go ahead and
jump on into them I can see things look
a little bit different very Samsung
TouchWiz II one of the other cool things
I'm really happy about is that button
right there that takes a screenshot of
whatever you're doing so you get a noise
go ahead and hit it boom and you've got
a screenshot of what you're doing so
you've got some Samsung widgets here of
course that you've seen in touch with
they've been tabla sized
they can take a look at some of them
here go ahead and jump on into widgets
you can see what they are Samsung
Samsung few of them are Samsung ish
active applications you guys can go
ahead and see what all those are and
because we are dealing with honeycomb go
ahead and remove that you can resize
them you can resize some of the custom
Samsung widgets let's go ahead and hold
this down move it
and then hopefully I can show you that
we can resize it there we go and now you
can resize it and make that guy bigger
or smaller whatever you want to do to
him we'll go ahead and move him
background but I'm not the only treat
that I have here and it just had this
for a few minutes I managed to sneak it
away from the Samsung folks I also have
boom a laptop dock and this is kind of
cool it actually is going to fit the Tab
8.9 or the Tab 10.1 so go ahead and drop
that sucker right in and boom you've got
a keyboard separate power and it works
pretty well actually so let's go ahead
and see if we can find something to type
with let's go ahead and take a look at
apps so check out browser noting that
connected to here unfortunately the type
URL
so it's I've been pretty quickly a
techno buff will actually start a
populating it works its keyboard you can
hide the on-screen keyboard if you like
here are some of the options on it
they're gonna drag us away from you in a
minute so that much time to show you but
you guys can see all this right here
relatively you see inside you can see
sort of versus my hand for a size
comparison let me show you what with the
blackberry ninety-nine hundredths and
that's what I have handy so it's a
pretty decent size keyboard Chiclets
form factor let's go ahead and pull this
out of here
with one hand is it then we're just
hoping to expect let's see how thick the
keyboard dock is it's not that then
actually can see there's that same
charging port if you want to charge it
and there is a bit of a rubber stopper
on the back push that off the side and
put that down and this has been a very
quick a little bit rushed were let's say
of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 I don't
have any carrier availability or
anything like that or when it's going to
be able to purchase one but it is
announced and here it is in the wild
it's sort of the Loch Ness monster of
the tablet world so Samsung Galaxy Tab
8.9 hi I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and hopefully I'll have
more information for you on this guy
very soon so is this a tablet you've
been waiting for it is a form factor
that you want you like the 8.9 screen
versus the 10.1 it's a bit smaller
certainly not pocketable but a
relatively decent form factor so I'm
John Retton germ TechnoBuffalo I'll see
you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
