the like or even a dislike button hear
me out so I'm back for dub WGC a chance
to see apple's new products that start
to unfold to the next year and I started
thinking more about Apple and so as you
guys don't know Apple kind of got me
started in tech review the first sort of
products I reviewed we've always kind of
had a soft spot in my heart that some
really filtered through as you guys like
to call me out all the time to my
reviews but I think apples got a problem
and I don't think the problem is
actually Apple I think the problem is a
competition
the competition's gotten so much better
than it was in the past and look at
Apple's product line there hasn't been
an innovative brand new category since
the iPad you could argue the Apple watch
has come out but hasn't changed it was
good a paradigm shift since we saw the
original iPad and back then there was a
huge discrepancy between the efficiency
of iOS and with Android at the time and
I think we started to get throughout
2011 we saw the Galaxy Nexus
we saw Ice Cream Sandwich that was the
iPhone 4s was coincidentally the last
phone that Steve Jobs was alive for he
had his hand possibly leasing the iPhone
5 from the 5s but that was when things
starts to get closer and closer for
Apple and apples being held I think two
unattainable double standard they're not
reinventing a new category every few
years they're failing they're failing
they're not doing something great like
they used to
I don't think that's fair and I'm guilty
of that too I've certainly said apples
not innovating there's nothing new
coming out they've perfected their
categories they've perfected a tablet
they perfected a phone whether you like
the iPhone or not for a lot of people
that is the perfect device but the
problem they're facing is a perception
problem if the competition again has
gotten so much better and again I think
it went back that 2011 starting point
and you look back at what Samsung
started doing strangely was five years
ago
oh and Galaxy S 2 launched when I
started parroting the Apple 1 you know
the next big thing and that hit Apple
word heard I think that hid the
perception that if the image that Apple
was impenetrable gigantic innovation
machine and slowly but surely the little
pieces started to get chipped away and
what you have right now it's a company
that is clearly firing off the own there
they're selling millions of millions of
phones the largest manufacturer for a
ton of different categories but they're
still being held set double standard and
again I'm guilty of that as well but now
the competition that's really look at
things with the Galaxy Tab A 3 look at
the Galaxy at 8 and LG G 6 you take from
a feature standpoint the gas that used
to be there can android/ios is no longer
there and a concerning argument could be
made and your has surpassed Apple on the
future standpoint the easy argument to
make here is that Steve Jobs is rolling
over in his grave
but in cooks job is not to make you
happy or me happy can you cook
responsibilities to the shareholders an
Apple stock is at an all-time high
so in a lot of ways can cook is doing an
incredible job people are buying
products they're offering new wages
apples ecosystem and the more they sell
the more money they make the perception
isn't changing with it used to be Apple
was incredible they were untouchable
like I said but now it's yeah I'm not
that excited about the next iPhone and
for me to say that something I think
said in years you know I feel like for
the past almost three or four years and
make this analogy the office all the
time I feel like I'm some one crazy guy
outside as an umbrella screaming it's
going to rain and on the day it rains
I'm gonna seem brilliant but the other
threat is 64 days of the year they are
crazy first and every time there's new
iPhone I feel like I'm out there saying
this is the year we're going to get
wireless charging it's gonna be fast
charging didn't get feature parity with
Android and it just hasn't happened and
at least for me I don't look at Apple
the same way that I use you I don't look
at Apple the same way as this paradigm
of innovation not to say they're not but
that perception has changed for me
personally and I feel like it's changing
for partly you guys as well and that's a
the product aren't good not to say the
phone you have in your pocket is a
crappy device you made a wrong choice if
it works for you it's a perfect choice
but the competition that Apple is facing
and they say back in 2007 versus what
they face now it's different
the iPhone first launched for example
was sort of when the modern Apple
started you know they're not facing the
likes of the Moto Cube they're not
facing blackberry anymore it's an
Android onslaught and because of so many
manufacturers they're fighting battles
on multiple front and not fighting just
Apple versus those rims
the time it's now Apple and it's LG
Samsung it's the Chinese brand there's
on slots from every direction
Annapolis was done an incredible job
still selling these devices and still
making profit hand over foot but the
problem with competition and the
competition has just gotten better over
time so do you think the better than
Apple is kind of up to you but serve had
just I don't there's an epiphany a bit
of thought and my whole time of the
thickness is that the problem was Apple
was Apple doing wrong and I realized I
was holding on to double standard - you
can't reinvent a new category it's not
there every few years we're just going
to sort of force something that does
need to be there and you get criticized
for it so those are my ramblings that
was my thought on Apple you guys you
guys agree am i way off here and the
more I thought about it the more I
thought that they don't have to invent
new product categories to keep doing
what they're doing selling millions of
devices
honestly why do they have to change Tim
Cook is selling devices stock prices as
an all-time high investors are happy and
that is first and foremost
responsibility so green disagree I
generally want to know try to be civil
in the comments up there your thoughts
on it so next time I'm John Rhett injure
and techno both
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
