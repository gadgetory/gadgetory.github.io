from technobuffalo and in today's video
we're just going to quickly recap what
we think the Moto 360 is a top wearable
of the year and see whether it's worth
buying now or waiting until the next
version is released so let's go ahead
and get started so why do we choose the
Moto 360 as the best wearable of the
year well that question isn't so easy to
answer but there are a few notable
reasons why we consider to be the top of
the pile let's start off with style the
Moto 360 is stunning I've been wearing
it for the past two weeks and it gets
attention pretty much everywhere I go
it's sleek clean and the classic round
design is a nice way to blend a
SmartWatch technology of today with more
timeless watches from decades past in
addition to a stealthy black wood metal
and leather watchband options Motorola
recently released a gold and silver moto
360 variant and they look absolutely
gorgeous the Moto 360 is a little thick
which is a concern but considering how
much technology is packed inside the
design is overall still very impressive
the second thing worth noting is the big
screen the Moto 360 has the biggest
roundest play on a SmartWatch that's
running Android wear and I absolutely
love that even though it's not a
complete circle or using OLED or AMOLED
technology it's using LCD it's a display
I can appreciate even with that little
slit at the bottom if you're willing to
look past that I think having that
larger screen makes the whole user
experience better and coming from using
2g watch our I much prefer the Moto 360
s display over the G watch our and that
goes back to what I mentioned earlier in
style it looks gorgeous and a larger
display makes it easier to see and
navigate around Android wear third thing
that's notable is the Qi wireless
charging capability this feature is
probably one of the cooler things about
the mode of 360 and as of now it's the
only enjoyed where device out in the
market that supports qi wireless
charging and i found that having this on
a SmartWatch is super convenient I think
every SmartWatch should have cheap arles
charging because it just makes charging
so much easier I can just drop the watch
in its dock and bam it's charging
automatically and I can just pick it up
whenever I need it without wires getting
in the way and last but not least a
relatively affordable price tag there
a bunch of smartwatches available right
now from pebble Samsung's own gear
lineup and the various Android wear
devices out in the market the Moto 360
is in the middle between Samsung squared
design gear live and LG's g-watch are
starting at only two hundred fifty
dollars it's not the cheapest one out
there but for the design functionality
and battery life the Moto 360 makes a
great companion to any Android device
now that android 5.0 is slowly rolling
out to Android wear devices you'll get
more out of your SmartWatch and we
actually did a video about Android 5.0
lollipop on a moto 360 so make sure to
check out the links down below this
video we covered some of the new
features and new watch faces you can
install so the question is is it worth
getting the Moto 360 now or should you
wait for the next iteration moto 360 if
you're looking to get a SmartWatch now
there's nothing wrong with buying the
Moto 360 because it's the first
generation devices are definitely issues
but we still feel it's the best wearable
on the market most of the shortcomings
come down to you android wear though the
recent update has helped make the
experience more powerful with some
design tweaks and more advanced
technology I'm excited to see what
Motorola has for us in a near future
hopefully we'll see a full circle
display that doesn't cover up the bottom
portion of the screen and maybe bigger
battery that it lasts even longer now
what would you guys like to see on the
next Moto 360 just let us know in the
comments down below and as always a
markleham sanger from technobuffalo I'll
