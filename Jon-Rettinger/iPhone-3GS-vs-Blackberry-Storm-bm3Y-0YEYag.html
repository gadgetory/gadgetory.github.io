compare to the arguably hottest handsets
out right now the blackberry storm for
Verizon Wireless and the iphone 3gs for
AT&amp;amp;T I'm gonna lie to you out there
trying to make your mind up between the
two handsets so this tests are going to
cover really a lot of different features
including boot up and shut down Times
typing and keyboards photos and videos
camera camcorder email their application
stores browser and screen rotations so
I'm going to go through and talk about
the specs of each device and as I'm
doing that let me show you the shutdown
and boot up times of each i turn my
phone off every night and turned on
every morning so this is our time that
you'll definitely notice and these are
certainly real-world examples so I'll
try and do these both again at the same
time so we'll slide that over and hold
down the power button on both so you can
see how long it takes both to turn down
get that little swirl on the iphone that
we're all familiar with the verizon logo
on lundy blackberry storm now for those
you that may have seen my blackberry
storm review you'll know that I said the
device has a lot of potential this is
when it first came out since then there
have been a ton of firmware updates and
as I'll show you this blackberry storm
is running the most recent firmware I
like to show you that just as well on
the iphone 3gs is launching or is using
the launch firmware three-point oh let's
turn both of them on and the 3gs
launches much faster than the iphone 3g
but certainly not nearly as quick as the
blackberry it's almost instant on with
the blackberry so it is very impressive
so specs of both device dimensions of
the iphone 3gs you're looking at 4.2 4.5
inches x 2.4 5.48 so that's the
thickness to pass were here for the
dimensions of the storm you're looking
at 4.43 by 2.45 5.54 so just a little
bit bigger weight of the iphone you're
at 4.7 6 ounces the storm clocks in a
bit heavier at five
or seven battery life on the 3gs you're
looking at 12 hours of talk time in
three hundred hours standby time he sets
what the apple claims with the storm
you're only looking at five and a half
hours of talk time but 360 hours of
standby time but real world talk time
and it's the iphone 3gs claims to be
actually well over double resolutions
are pretty similar the iphone 3gs you're
looking at at 320 x 480 the storm is 360
x 480 sighs you're at 3.5 inches for the
screen of the iphone and for the storm
your 3.25 camera 3 megapixels on the
iphone 3gs 3.2 on the storm the iphone
does VGA video at three or 30 frames per
second and the 3gs comes in 16 or 32
gigabyte flavors and the storm ships
with one gigabytes of internal storage
and you can expand that with a microSD
card now we got the role of a boring
stuff let's get to the exciting stuff
and the tests so the big thing with the
storm is this sort of tactile clicking
keyboard that rim has put in rim stands
for research in motion the company that
that makes us so I just watched ending
because music by accident there so the
screen is nice an idea but in practice
doesn't necessarily translate so well
when you're typing something you have to
wait for the keyboard to come back up
but it's something that you do get used
to so let's compare the keyboards of
both devices so we'll go into messages
on each i'll go into messages here on
the iphone i will create a new one for
both so let's say that I want to create
a new message we'll make it a new email
that's fine Oh pets like this needs to
be set up close this
oh so now we are at the keyboard typing
on the storm you get two options you get
a very pearl ask sure type keyboard with
two letters / and you can change it to
look like a standard numeric keypad at
the abc down 12 go order or if you turn
it on your side and take advantage
accelerometer you will get a full
keyboard full qwerty bar the iphone has
a full qwerty portrait keyboard and also
has a full qwerty landscape so let's do
a typing prepare sinann each and I
should preface this review by saying i
am an iphone user and i've been using an
iphone for the past two years so just
natively i'm going to have a little
better accuracy with the iphone but i do
want to give you guys full disclosure so
i'm going to type a message using the
shirt type first on the blackberry storm
and i'll just type hi my name is John
we'll see how it comes out
ah so go my biz name is John not the
most actor in the world and the shirt
type can be a little bit difficult and
squirrely but it does learn what you
type and it doesn't learn your word so
if your name is something different it
will react to it and next time will type
it more accurately so let's try typing
the same thing now on the iphone
keyboard which is one letter per let's
see if we get any more accuracy with
this one and we'll type hi my name is
John again
so a little bit closer hi my name is
John but not bad either this is a
reflection of my awful typing abilities
or the keyboards on each aren't the most
accurate in landscape or in portrait
let's try in the landscape and see if
that's any better we'll turn this over
there's the accelerometer and we will
type hi my name is John again I'll see
how this worked I'm types fast as I can
ok so that was actually pretty good and
completely accurate hi my name is John
let's try that on the iphone turn that
around so that was just as accurate as
well hi my name is John so landscape
keyboard wise I think that they are
relatively close I do prefer the
keyboard on the iphone and really that's
for one major reason when you hold your
finger over letter you can see very
clearly what letter you're typing when
you're typing a letter on the focus on
the storm you just get sort of a blue
glow and it's hard to see where that
blue go is coming from I would have
liked to have seen the letter the
suretype and the clicky keyboard they're
really going to be a matter of personal
preference I think that's something you
get used to it is nice to actually feel
like you're hitting a tactile button but
you have to wait for it to come back up
so if I'm going to evaluate keyboards
completely uniquely to these devices and
to try and be as unbiased as possible
I'm going to give a slight slight edge
to the iphone just because you can see
the letters that are big type and you
have the option for a full qwerty
keyboard in both although I do give the
store credit it is quite nice and
relatively easy to learn and type on so
let's move on with our review here and
let's go to photos and videos so I'll go
back to the home screen well put this
back up the way it belongs so photos and
videos and managing them on the iphone
is actually relatively simple go into
pictures
and go into camera roll and you can view
your pictures right from here so there's
a picture of my niece you can use
multi-touch to zoom in or zoom out and
scroll over to the next and speaking of
pictures and video here's a video of my
dog dekhenge go ahead and hit play and
the videos are stored in the same place
as the pictures and the video will just
start playing it's on vibrate right now
so we won't hear any volume you also
notice that during video you get editing
ability across the top there with the
iphone 3gs to scrub and cut I put a
video of yesterday of how to edit video
so check that out if you are interested
so we'll stop this and that's really how
pictures are manipulated on the iphone
let's take a look at how pictures and
video are handled on the storm hit the
media button and now you get pictures
try music video ringtones and pictures
since we started with pictures on the
iphone let's start with pictures on the
storm go to all pictures and here are a
few that i just took randomly first
sample take a second open up and there
you go if you want to zoom this doesn't
take advantage of multi-touch pinch and
zoom although the screen can support
multitouch it's not really implemented
in many ways so if i want to zoom in i
can double tap and i can zoom and pan
around just as I could on the iphone
although I do want to show you one thing
especially with the panning let's go
back to the picture of my knees and
we'll zoom in a little bit if you notice
that panning is much smoother on the
iphone than it is on the storm it's a
little bit choppy on the store I'm going
left and right you can see it's taking a
while to catch up with me and it seems
to go right with my finger on the iphone
it's like something to keep in mind if
you want to zoom out you can double tap
again let's zoom back in cuz we might
actually hit that down button right
there zoom out and we're going to go
back to the original configuration it's
still zooming takes a little while to
catch up and hit that button and now
we're back to pictures you can scroll to
the next one
see the storm has a little bit of bugs
in it now is definitely one of them you
can't there we go the scrolling is not
necessarily so smooth sometimes when it
works it works very well it does not
always work let's go back to the iphone
so you can scroll to next nice and
easily so i mentioned that i would show
you what version of firmware i was
running here on the storm let me go
ahead and do that right now is that you
can't see that i am running the most
recent version that is available so i'm
trying to get to the main menu I'm
hitting the blackberry button took a few
times to actually get there that will go
to options I'll go to about you can see
that I am running version 4.7 point zero
point one four eight which is the most
reason okay so let's go back to media
let's take a look at how videos are
handled so we'll go back back and now
here we are in video I showed you how
they played on the iphone here's a clip
that was just preloaded here Babylon ed
I think that's a trailer for an older
movie that plays by default in landscape
let's see if it rotates nope does not
I'm sure where the controls are even
call that if you have to Steve
blackberry button there you go now you
get the options so we'll we'll stop that
and there are the controls took a couple
button manipulation to get them to show
up we'll go ahead and hit stop but you
can't see that video playback is
actually quite smooth on the blackberry
storm okay so we'll go back to the main
screen I should also say that one
advantage the storm has over the iphone
is that you do get a landscape landscape
and portrait home screens the iphone
does not allow you to do that all right
so let's continue with our tests and
let's talk about the camera and
camcorder since both are capable of
taking
pictures with autofocus and recording
video so I've done a video dedicated
just to the iphone 3gs is camcorder but
i'll show you real quickly what that
looks like and the camera so you're
greeted with really a very simple option
if you want to zoom in on something
while taking a picture if you tap it or
not zoom in rather autofocus it a lot of
focus and if you want to switch over to
camcorder there's a little switch in the
bottom right-hand corner and you flip it
over and you're recording video really
is easy let's take a look at the
blackberry storm and see if it is just
as easy so we will go to camera and now
here we are in the camera application
and if I want to auto focus on something
just like it was on the iPhone you'll
tap it and then I'll auto focus for you
if you want to go to camcorder hit the
blackberry button and to go to video
camera and you just hit record it is
pretty simple so both do have relatively
capable video recording I will say the
quality of the video that's your cord
and the audio fidelity is definitely
superior on the 3gs sick and record at
30 frames per second so moving along
let's talk about email an email when you
think of mobile email when you think of
blackberry person it comes to my mind is
fantastic and quality blackberries bread
and butter that sounds funny black berry
bread and butter is email that's what
blackberry is known for at what they do
best and the storm is no exception takes
advantage of rims really amazing push
email client there's nothing bad that I
could even conceivably say about email
on the blackberry storm it is great it's
fantastic it works well email on the
iphone works relatively nicely and
simply as well there's an email icon at
the bottom you'll hit that I'm going to
move this out of the way so my emails
don't show up and it's the text
disappear any way that you like it you
could have your title who is from and a
few lines of preview text and you can
also have push
as well and both are capable of talking
to exchange servers but as far as email
goes is really nothing better than the
blackberry the iphones email client is
certainly capable but it's not as
elegant as the black bears in my opinion
so next let's talk about browser and
browser speed the 3gs is equipped with
3g obviously using a tease hsdpa network
and the blackberry storm is using 3g
data as well on verizon wireless's evdo
rev a so let's take a look at data and
how quickly it loads web pages ok so the
cash has been cleared out of both these
devices and we're going to load
technobuffalo calm on each and we'll
check the speed and i turned off Wi-Fi
on the 3gs so we're running just now
both on cell signals and i do have five
bars of eighteen t and i have four bars
it cycles between four and five of evo
rev.a so it is pretty fast and should be
a relatively even comparison of speeds i
should always say though that network
speed is going to vary by your location
so you may get a better service with one
or both of these carriers let's go ahead
and hit go on both of them at the same
time and we'll see how they both do oh
they both finished pretty quickly this
is a simple web page although the 3gs
renders it as you would see it on your
main web browser these storms seems to
compress it a little bit more and ignore
some of the HTML spaces that will put in
there notice that i'm zooming and using
double tap and i can't zoom out by
pinching but i can do my zoom out using
the zoom out button right there the two
magnifying glasses i can zoom in using
pinch in or pinch out on the iphone and
i can pan around with my finger just
like i can on the storm so let's load a
little more complicated web page and see
if there is any speed difference here as
well we will load engadget com alright
so that's cute up on ready to go on both
devices let's hit go at the same time
and see if there's any difference
well the storm very quickly loaded a
mobile version of the site whereas the
3gs is being recognized as a desktop
computers pulling up the full version I
just need to be loading it pretty
quickly although will tell you that by
comparison evdo rev a and the iphone 3gs
BS are very very close and there you go
now they're both done so it depends on
what you're looking for if you want the
full web version of most sites then
iphone will give that to you the
blackberry browser is interpreted as
being mobile and will load the mobile
version of most sites you can scroll
through each you can see I can flick
scroll but it doesn't keep going when I
let go of my finger I'll go just as far
as I'm scrolling the iphone it flick
Scrolls so the last thing that I want to
show you guys is screen rotation I know
this is a software thing but when you do
want to turn the device you like it to
turn a little bit quickly so let's see
how that is on each I'll show you that
they both work turn that up see the
rotation here's the iphone do the
rotation there and let's see how they do
then both are stood straight up so the
black bear was a little bit quicker
although it wasn't turning and rotating
nearly as much so that was just about
the same so guys this video did get a
little long in the wind but i do want to
give you my overall impressions of both
devices verizon's network is fantastic
signal strength has been generally good
wherever i go and call quality is great
that being said a great network oh they
can overcome a very buggy device the
storm scene almost seems like it was
rushed to market the click screen I've
had dust caught in there even have
fingernails caught in there and it does
become a little bit difficult cumbersome
to use in theory I think it's fantastic
and it was a
a good idea and implementation I don't
think it translated very well the iphone
is certainly not without its flaws it's
email client could be better it could
handle multitasking a little more
elegantly and you couldn't be a little
bit more open as far as formats that it
can read and it could have external
storage be quite nice like the
blackberry storm has that being said I
think the iphone is probably a better
choice of devices and this is a 3gs at
least for me based on web browsing I do
a lot of work online being able to have
really the full internet- flash in a few
plugins in the palm of my hand is great
the multi-touch zoom really makes the
iphone stand out in my opinion they're
both great devices and releasing depend
on your carrier but if you have a choice
to go anywhere the iphone 3gs is a hard
one to turn away from hope you enjoyed
