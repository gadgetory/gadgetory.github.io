to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of Rhett
endures rest I'm Ernest John Wright
injured up this week I want to talk to
you about t-mobile's test drive it's
been about two weeks since I'm carrier
five in a 6.0 when t-mobile invited
folks to try their network for a week
without really costing them absolutely
anything and worryfree so I did it I got
an iPhone 5s 17 and I want to share my
experience with two mobiles network
their devices and how the whole process
goes it's going to get started so case
you guys are familiar with t-mobile test
drive essentially what it is you can go
to t-mobile website and once every
billing cycle you can get an iPhone 5s
loaded with an unlimited data plan that
you can try their network and that's it
you return the device they take the hold
off your credit card and you're done so
I wanted to see what it was like I've
been with AT&amp;amp;T for they were singular
actually so this goes back probably six
seven years up until this point but
didn't see what email service is all
about they've been talking about how
good their data is sort of in big metro
areas and here in Southern California I
would qualify as one they're gonna be a
great opportunity to not only document
the process of getting the phone but how
the experience with t-mobile was and
then how it was to return it so I went
to the t-mobile slash test-drive page I
signed up phone came two days later and
it comes in a sort of a weird box and
come in like a regular iPhone box but
they send you now is an iPhone 5s I got
a 32 gig black one now you can't pick
the color I don't think you could pick
the size either I think it might depend
whatever they haven't talked and it
showed up inside of the box cuz
everything you'd get inside of a regular
iPhone box it's all sealed and brand-new
but that might change as a program you
know gets older and a little bit of
plastic was the iPhone 5s like turned it
on and that was good to go and that was
it it was already activated asked me if
I wanted to set up my account on it and
that was really it I was kind of off and
running so I tried it for the first day
in the second day I got a call from
t-mobile on that line so ya wanna see
how you're going with the test drive if
you want to fold your call suite here's
how you do it if you want to download
apps to sort of do speed tests here are
the apps to try so the first thing I did
was I ran the speed test everywhere I
went I had
AT&amp;amp;T phone I had my chemo but I would
just be testing like oh cool
and it was pretty interesting to see
obviously it says totally subjective
depending on where you live and that
kind of stuff but Southern California
t-mobile's down data speeds were really
really really fast
on average about two times faster than
what I was seeing on AT&amp;amp;T general AT&amp;amp;T
I'd get anywhere from one megabit down
all the way up to maybe nine to twelve
highest I got at t-mobile I was
regularly seeing speeds up to 36 Dan I
know some people get way faster speeds
and the folks like in Atlanta and Dallas
their ATP speeds are super off the chart
on the upload side it was kind of even
18 teams but we're about the same
somewhere hovering between two to six on
the upside but he's really really fast
on the download and I his blanket and lt
where it was then I went into my house
inside of my house I dropped down to one
bar for jeans sometimes if I was lucky I
would get two bars of edge which is
tough to make phone calls on and
sometimes even get the dreaded no
service thing up there so I sent the
tweet to t-mobile and they gave me an
email address email sort of talked about
service issues so I did an another email
address didn't have my name on it on the
outside chance and maybe my name would
get recognized I get some special
treatment which I didn't want so it was
the the t force team they call it so I
emailed them said hey yours when I'm
problem having here's my address here's
a phone number I got an email back
almost in an hour saying here's your
casing or registering it we're gonna do
it we can try to fix your service and
was really cool to see obviously don't
know that's gonna happen or not the nice
thing I guess about t-mobile is they've
got Wi-Fi calling iOS 8 will support
Wi-Fi calling so presumably as a test
drive goes on and iOS 8 comes out on the
iPhone 6 it'll be really nice you can
just do Wi-Fi calling wherever you are
so they're up the video real fast thank
our friends at audible you know them you
love them you should definitely be using
them they are the largest purveyor of
downloadable audiobooks things from
mystery to romance I'm not gonna judge a
fiction nonfiction everything in between
this is open your car at the gym on your
iPhone or Android device wherever you
are you could listen to audible go to
audible podcast.com slash check down and
get your free audiobook download again
that's audible podcast act now and get
your free audiobook again whatever
about reading now's the perfect time
listen to it while you're making your
daily commute back to the video so you
guys are all saying why an iPhone why
only knife owned right now it's all
t-mobile offers the really only fly see
in their test-drive program is that you
can't pick the device you want you know
an iPhone 5s Mike a different reception
than the galaxy s5 or HTC one nice to
pick and chemo blast said they will
offer other devices the reason that they
picked the iPhone they answered this in
a Cuban a genuine carrier event was they
didn't think people knew they had the
iPhone so it really was kind of a PR
thing but hey we've got the iPhone you
you can have the iPhone here go ahead
and try it so the seven days were up I
got a text message on the sixth day sing
hey you'd return your film tomorrow you
could turn it to any sort of t-mobile
retail store and I took it back it's
actually the first one that it returned
test drive phone I took about ten
minutes I got a receipt saying I'd
returned it hold a second off my car and
that was it was a super super schemas
experience at the very least you want to
think about which into an iPhone you can
try an iPhone for a week and see how
that experiences and give it a shot
there's sort of no risk to you 100
percent charge comes off your card so
there's no cost it was a really cool
program I think you mobile swing a very
nice job with all their uncarrier
announcements they've been doing this
when that was first time we really
wanted to try the service room use it as
my daily phone and overall I keep my way
pretty impressed so what do you guys
think is something you try not try when
you want to see change about the test
drive program leave in the comments down
below and the folks at t-mobile
I would guess are probably going to
watch this video at least I hope maybe
they'll take your comments to heart you
