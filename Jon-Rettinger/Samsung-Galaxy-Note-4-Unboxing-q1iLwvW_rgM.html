TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest iteration of a lot of people's
favorite phablet this is one of the
originals in the market this is the
Galaxy Note 4 brings a lot of
improvements over the previous iteration
it's got a qHD screen it's got some new
design cues and it's got a lot of new
software and hardware under the hood
let's go ahead and unbox it you take a
first look so we are unboxing the ATT
unit this was sent to us from the folks
at Samsung a typical 18 T box picture of
the device on the bottom it just the
orange and whites that we know and love
still had been broken I've seen the
Samsung folks put a sim card in here for
us and there is the Galaxy Note 4 feels
really nice it feels very different than
the note 3 which will bring in in just a
minute we've got a QuickStart guide for
of course getting started quickly how to
use the S Pen and all the Air Command
features that are going to be built in
digging into the rest of the box we've
got a manual home to that all that often
anymore some stuff for milk music micro
SD cable and the now ubiquitous samsung
white wall work and that is it's not a
headphone or any other accessory to be
found so here is the Galaxy Note 4 code
and peel us off here and get that
whooshing noise that a love kind of got
it there feels really really different
and by different I mean um feels more
premium with the really thick metal
bands around the side it's very
reminiscent of the Galaxy alpha which
we'll bring in in just a moment let me
go ahead and power this guy on and we'll
run through the specs so the first thing
you're going to see light up is a 5.7
inch screen you're probably saying John
that's the same size the last gen and
you would be correct but there are many
many more pixels in here it is now 2560
by 1440 which means not only is it qHD
it also has a ppi a 515 the screen here
looks absolutely gorgeous I do want to
test it a bit more with pictures and
video and 4k stuff to see how it how it
looks but on first blush it looks just
like a really good 1080p screen same
questions I had when I saw the LG g3
screen for the first time Android 4.4 at
launch there depending on what version
you get what country you'll get either
get a 2.7 gigahertz quad-core processor
or an octa-core processor which is going
to be 2 quad cores one's going to be 1.9
and one is going to be 1.3 it's gonna
vary by country in the US so we're just
gonna have the quad core variant we've
got three gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage
but it is expandable you've got a 16
megapixel camera living right there on
the back and now has optical image
stabilization which is quite nice I got
the flash and heart rate sensor sort of
combo we saw introduced on the galaxy s5
sort of an ugly megapixel up three point
seven megapixel sensor right up on the
front into 211 ABG and in DC bluetooth
4.1 and a beastly 3200 20 milliamp hour
battery so quick tour device here it's
gonna be very familiar if use any recent
Samsung devices we've got a home button
in the middle which feels really nice in
the hand it's sort of hard thing to say
but it's got much more tactile feel to
it flanked by two capacitive buttons
you've got a back button and you're a
multitasking button if we go ahead a
look at the right-hand side power and
lock button on the left hand side we've
got volume up and down it's a single
button with the top and bottom are a bit
more pronounced so you can feel the
difference between at the two on the top
that's sort of an odd bit of a hump
there which is housing 3.5 millimeter
headset jack noise cancelling mic and an
IR blaster
you've got the 3.5 milimeter headset
jack on the bottom microphones and the
s-pen lives in exactly the same spot and
looks pretty identical to the galaxy s3
take a look at some of the soft we're
gonna have on board here we've got a lot
of AT&amp;amp;T stuff built in here almost the
whole first screen is all 18 key
business keeps scrolling along she's
also gonna be on board you've got
Instagram now shipping you've got mobile
hotspot mobile TV play games and some of
the Samsung Apps they included on now
all the devices uber is built right in
and usage manager and soon to be renamed
Isis wallet I believe they change the
name to soft card I think appropriately
enough so the big deal here I think is
the screen
the design so thinking about the Galaxy
Note 3 you're probably thinking hey that
also kind of had a metal band so you can
see right here does not feel the same at
all this felts kind of cheap this feels
really solid like you're holding a
premium phone the back is also improved
it sort of has that same fake leather
look we saw with the note 3 you don't
have those fake stitches but it feels
much better than the material on the
note 3 it's a little more tactile and
almost feel soft touch it just feels
really nice Samsung is definitely
stepping up their design game let's
bring in what I think was really a
design inspiration for the note 4 this
is the Galaxy alpha looks almost like a
mini version of the note 4 they look
really identical on how very similar
feels to them so you can see those two
side-by-side and the last let's bring in
the iPhone 6 plus with its 5.5 inch
screen versus a 5.7 on the note 4 and
you would think the note 4 would be a
bigger device it's got that point 2 inch
larger screen you would be incorrect if
we sort of put these two right on top of
each other you can see that in fact the
6 plus is the larger phone and the width
looks to be very very similar so take
that for whatever it is worth case you
are debating which larger screen phablet
you want it to get we're gonna use this
device and do some first impressions
with it and they'll let you do we think
until next time I'm John rent from
