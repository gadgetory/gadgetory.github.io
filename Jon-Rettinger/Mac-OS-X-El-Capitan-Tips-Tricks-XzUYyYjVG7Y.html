to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys the Markman Sangin from
TechnoBuffalo and if you're running
apple's latest desktop operating system
OS 10 El Capitan today we'll be going
over five tips and tricks that can help
you get more out of Apple's newest
update probably the biggest and newest
addition to OS 10 El Capitan is the
ability to use split view it's similar
to Microsoft snapping feature on Windows
but in El Capitan you have to click and
hold on the green maximize window button
then drag the window to either at the
left side or the right side of your
screen you can also go into Mission
Control and drag the app you want to
dock into one of the desktops you
activate split view up next you can now
hide the menu bar for a better
fullscreen experience in window mode
inside System Preferences under general
you now have the option to automatically
hide and show the menu bar as if you
were in full-screen mode just like a
hidden dock the menu bar will reappear
as soon as you hover your mouse over it
it's any little trick that can enhance
your experience if you like working in
window mode if you're big into Apple's
Notification Center and want to group
your notifications by apps there is an
easy fix for that by default El Capitan
will group your notifications by date
rather than by apps well that seems like
a really useful feature if you want to
check out what you've missed recently I
like having my notifications group by
apps to narrow down my selection to
change this head on over to System
Preferences notifications and use the
drop down menu and change the behavior
from recent to recent buy apps but of
course you can always group your
notification manually if you'd like the
last two tips for OS 10 El Capitan lives
inside Safari the first of the two is
pinned tabs which essentially works just
like bookmarks but they'll stay active
in the background and they'll stay put
on the left side of your tab for easy
access whether you quit the app or
suspend the window you're pinned apps
will still be accessible the next time
you open up Safari to pin apps you can
simply click and hold on an open tab and
drag it to the very left side of the
browser let me stop the video real fast
and thank our friends over at domain.com

idea hits you it's a one-stop shopping

hosting email needs domain wants to hook
our fans up with a pretty cool offer

check out the last one on the list is
you'll now be able to mute tabs with
just a single
of a button let's say you're listening
to an audio in one tab and another
website starts to play you can now beat
the one you don't want to hear or if you
want to meet Safari in general you have
the option to mute all tabs if you'd
like without the need to mute your
entire computer and that's about it if
you guys have any cool tips and tricks
you found in OS 10 al-kahf it's on make
sure to leave them in the comment
section down below and also if you guys

covered five apps that take advantage of
3d touch make sure to check that out
