cinco de mayo de i'm noah Kravitz from
technobuffalo I'm James Kendrick from
ZDNet mobile news and welcome to good to
go James how you doing good are you I am
alright I'm alright it is uh it's
Thursday mean it's time to do it again
and lots going on the world of mobile
tech as always so let's let's dive right
into it I think I think Samsung and AT&amp;amp;T
launched a ginormous phone today in New
York and there's been a bunch of rumors
about Apple cutting the cord so to speak
with the OTA updates what do you want to
start all right the infuse I guess we
can jump in there real quick if that
announcement just came out we haven't
seen it yet you either one of us but
that mainly it's a four and a half inch
display phones yeah just like wow it's
like the world's smallest tablet maybe
yeah it uh you know there were rumors
that that's what it was going to be and
they actually showed the phone back at
CES circle you know not undercover but
sort of quietly and so I was digging
around a little yesterday online and
thinking while dell streak was like a
5-inch sort of tablet phone and you know
obvious is a little bit different but
that didn't seem to go over all that
well I don't know what when is when is
I'm going to open it open it up for bad
double entendre is here but what is too
big just plain too big yeah I've you
know previously the biggest phones were
the 4.3 inch evo the charge and a whole
bunch of other HTC phones I played with
every one of them and I have really big
hands and I actually like that sighs
phone but that's stretching it i have to
admit sometimes that's almost getting
too big for me yeah i don't know who
could use a four-and-a-half inch phone
on I am yeah just before we came online
or rather came out here to tape I was
looking at some photos on on Twitter
that some of the the folks in New York
some of the journalists the event we're
posting of the phone granted these were
fo you know photos taking it kind of
weird angle some of them that you know
sort of distort things when you take a
photo from the top down at an angle it
makes you know that
the actual size of things look strange
but I mean this thing is just huge and i
don't know i also have fairly large
hands but i actually am NOT personally
such a big fan of the the 4 inch plus
screens just because I'm I think just
because I don't want to carry around
something that big in my pocket but you
know to each their own whatever but yeah
I just I don't know it'll be interesting
to see how it does in the market and
kind of interesting to me that it wasn't
launched it's not packed to the gills it
has the super amoled plus display which
is fantastic technology it has dual
cameras it has four GL it's kind of
Kwazii 4G I think it's at its HSPA 14
for well yeah is stretching the
definition there my eyes but you know it
doesn't have a dual core processor it
shoots video in 720 not 1080 you know
blah blah blah interesting to me that
they didn't just like load it up as you
know the biggest baddest beast on the
block but well I get I think they they
just figured it really was with the
excretion show right that was good
enough you know so so yeah that's out
May fifteenth I think 200 bucks although
there were ads leaked earlier in the
week from I don't know walmart or costco
or something showing it being cheaper
but anyway there you go if you want a
giant phone you can get a giant jibba
but yeah for apple verizon AT&amp;amp;T iphone
over-the-air updates lots of rumors what
uh what do you know about that what do
you think about that well it's it's
beginning to sound more and more like
there are serious discussions from apple
and that kind of surprises me because
you know Apple has been wonderful at
controlling every part of the update
process for ILS i mean what i got i have
about 20 of these lying around one of my
to-do list is now well you can still use
them that would probably end up being
faster i mean apples gonna have to
change their whole update process
because currently they you know each
update contains the whole firmware image
and that's that's six hundred megabytes
plus yeah how long is that going to take
on the AT&amp;amp;T network there yeah it's just
gonna be it's
begin of the A to Z network if it you
know where I'm going with this if if if
Apple starts doing OTA updates for the
iPhone the iPad what is going to happen
to the world famous AT&amp;amp;T network every
time an update gets rolled out its gonna
crash mean if you've ever been to CES or
ctia or I think it was a little bit
better this year from what i heard South
by Southwest some of these big events
where tons of geeks and people who
report on geeks descend and you try to
use an iPhone in one of those places
it's I mean it's just all screeches to a
halt and and that's nothing compared to
huge streaming download right i mean
right that's this call such a race
network yeah i mean i just don't see
what the game is for Apple personally
yet well well that I mean while we all
like that i mean i love android and
webos and all the other platforms do OTA
updates and they can get away with it
because they're smaller samples of users
i mean right there's hundreds of
millions iphone and ipad owners out
there right and while there may be you
know comparable number more of android
users that split across many different
devices each with and carriers carriers
yeah yes and and that's the other thing
that i can't fathom how this would work
because i guarantee you the carriers
will get involved with the apple update
process no matter what people say oh no
apples too big they won't let that
happen they want any choice i mean then
yeah it's the networks it's the
carrier's network and bandwidth and they
control it they're not going to just
turn anybody even in an apple loose so
yeah just shoot it out whatever anywhere
right it's what it's one thing to give
up some control to Apple as far as the
hardware and the software but when
you're talking about the network
absolutely so to go back to your sort of
rhetorical question
what is there for Apple to gain I mean
is it just user perception people saying
you know I'm gonna quote you before we
went on air oh you know my uh that's not
me doing James's voice that's me doing
the voice that James did earlier I want
to get that straight yeah oh man you
know you have an iphone it's tethered
you're in the stone age my android phone
download over-the-air updates boom I'm
updated let's go I mean is there
anything beyond that for Apple the game
if well the only thing easy I tell you
the only thing that that occurs to me is
we know or we believe Apple is probably
pushing this cloud incentive going
forward with us stuff right that would
be certainly a part of it I'm sure so
maybe you maybe they've already figured
this out we Apple usually figures things
out they have a night off your things
out yeah yeah so who knows but I don't
know I'm I just fine with plug-in and if
I have to yeah Terry speaking of a
speaking of AT&amp;amp;T again actually the the
veer the first of the the HP webos
device yes I did the actual date is now
eluding me when they announced it's
going to be shipping it Shh coming up
real quick I mean it's it's actually
moved a little bit but it's real quick
yeah so that's coming that'll be tiny
phone that's the other right into the
special from the Ford IFH phone yeah
exactly and then actually sony ericsson
today relaunched kind of up refresh
versions of the experian minis is funny
I saw that on my RSS feed and I my first
thought was oh man like somebody's
somebody's RSS generators broken and an
old article slipped in there because I
really thought it was that you know from
first glance the was the x10 mini in the
x10 mini pro but their new refreshes and
apparently the keyboard on the the mini
pro the mini being a I think it's a 3
inch screen touch only and then the mini
pro having a slide-out keyboard like the
veer that the HPV are has a slight I'll
keep
as well but apparently the keyboard on
the mini pro is really really good the
keyboard on the veer I was surprised
when when I use it that demo event way
back when how good it was right yeah I
was too I mean in fact I was also
surprised how small it is when it's
closed yep but it still looked like a
pretty decent webos experience yeah
prize being such thing and I was going
to ask you when now that we're talking
about it I got the definite impression
from HP out at that event that we both
attended way back was it februari now
Wow yeah anyway I got to definite
impression that the veer was not
necessarily supporting the synergistic
capabilities with the touchpad because
all they ever talked about on the other
two phones interesting because I I don't
know if it was at the event or an
interview at reg shortly afterwards with
with jon rubinstein where somebody from
HP was talking about a use case for the
veer being kind of a a phone for
somebody who does a lot of work on a
tablet or you know probably more likely
a laptop but they wanted to try to you
know spin it with up selling the touch
pad but so a phone for somebody who you
know they use the phone for kind of
quick information for voice calls
obviously you know maybe a short text
message but a lot of the time they're
going to use their tablet and so then
the phone is very small in a confunkshun
as a mobile hotspot which made me that's
the only thing I remember hearing
specific about that I definitely did not
see a demo the the whole bumped the
phone to the tablet together and the
patron is that pre three only well
additionally that's the impression that
they gave at that event now I've heard
since then that it's also the not severe
but the other one what's the other one
that was a doctor pre three they would
then there was a what are they calling
it Oh me and I can't remember now but
anyway I got the definite impression
that the pre three was it as far as the
the communication center synergy between
the touch pad but I've since heard
someone say no I they were confirmed
with HP that that's not true okay that
all of the webos phones will will have
that capability so I was gonna ask you
if you'd heard that I had not heard that
officially yeah I am a button am a would
make sense like you said is a hotspot
and actually what the usage you
described for the little veer yeah kind
of makes it into like a bluetooth
headset for the tablets right exactly if
that's if that's the case but anyway
it's gonna come out soon I guess we'll
know it'll be out before the touchpad
which I sure we should get that thing
released yeah i just i don't i'm doing a
little googling in the background here
is why i'm looking down and maybe it was
only two phones actually two phones in a
tablet yeah yeah the veer and the pre
III and the pre three yeah because there
was no there was no pixie refresh yeah
no no that's that's correct but anyway
it's the veer that I've since heard
others say that they've heard from HP it
will handle the touchstone stuff and the
right and this energy but we'll just
have to see out of that yeah I'm with
him I'm uh I'm anxious for them I really
I was the fool in the room I really
thought they were gonna pull a fast one
and announce that at least one of those
devices with shipping you know that day
back in February because they'd made
such a big thing I've even said that
they need to do that and they still
haven't and they still haven't confirmed
I don't believe they've confirmed actual
shipping for the touchpad which is just
yeah it's like we said it was way back
in February when this thing was
announced so here we are still waiting
well you know it's like the advice that
I that I and I'm sure you give to
readers all the time which is why should
I get this phone or wait for that phone
well if you can always wait because
something
there's always around the corner in this
business so I don't know maybe I often
say the opposite because if that's the
case you can actually and I've seen
people like this be waiting all the time
and never ever get anything well that's
why I never get anything done because
I'm just I'll just win the whole time
just playing around with all this stuff
but you know we were you worried the
time speaking of waiting all right well
next week we'll do it again I'm going to
be out at Google i/o on Tuesday and
Wednesday but we'll tape again Thursday
and I'm hearing some rumors I don't know
this just rumor talk but I may have a
galaxy tab 10 one in my hand rumors that
you know last year at Google i/o google
gave out EVO 4 g's to everybody
attendance developers conference I'm
hearing rumors about them given out of
10 12 all the devs this year I don't
know if it's true well I've heard
similar things here or zooms of her debt
to you today that you yep what makes
sense look under your chair I will
exactly the old the old that Steve Jobs
did that one year at a at back when
macworld was in New York they gave out
was either keyboard or they had a new
mouse they gave out and a friend of mine
was at the keynote and got it it was one
of those things where it was like you
know it's like a fifty dollar sixty
dollar peripheral which is great I mean
that you know anything you know but it
was more just to like this was under
that this is the keynote I got the
keynote keyboard you know so that was
obviously before Apple owned everybody
they don't have to do that stuff now
exactly all right James if if the folks
out there I want to get more of you I
was gonna say in print but i guess in in
pixels formed in the letters and words
and blogs where can they find you it's a
the ZDNet mobile news blog that zdnet
com / blog / mobile dash news all right
and as always i'm hanging around on
technobuffalo calm and our YouTube
channel and Twitter you're on Twitter we
never say this at the end which I'm
every urge J Kendrick is me hey todrick
excellent and i'm noah crab it's easy
enough alright till next time j
enjoy you know enjoy the week enjoy a
giant four and a half inch screen phone
if one head your way yeah we'll do it
