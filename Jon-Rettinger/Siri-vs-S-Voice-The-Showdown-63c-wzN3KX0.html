TechnoBuffalo here one of the biggest
selling points with the Anaheim the
iPhone 4s was Siri the voice-activated
assistant found in the device well the
galaxy s3 is here and it's got a
response to Siri it's called s voice
let's go ahead and put these two voice
activated assistants head-to-head see
which one comes out on top
so both voice assistants do a myriad of
different features I'm going to ask just
simple questions that I use all the time
that I use for Siri and then I would use
if I was going to use the Galaxy s3 as
my daily phone so let's go ahead and put
these two suckers head-to-head if you
want to access s-voice you can double
tap the home button I just have an icon
for it on the home screen though alright
let's go ahead and get started what's
the weather here's the forecast for
today through this Saturday so you can
definitely see that Siri picked it up
first
and pull out the information first
s-voice pulled in the exact same
information but a few seconds later
let's go ahead and ask it if I need a
jacket do I need a jacket the low will
be 59 degrees so totally low will be 59
degrees on the iPhone 4s and the S voice
on the galaxy s3 is still thinking so it
just translated the text and these are
both connected to the same Wi-Fi network
so speed and network connection
shouldn't be an issue and it's still
thinking
so it's like it's having a hard time
with do I need a jacket so let's go
ahead and go to the next one okay set
timer for 5 minutes oftentimes I make a
popcorn or two you know to make a timer
so iPhone 4s already done Galaxy s3 is
still thinking about it
so there goes it did it took a little
bit more time when there's some follow
up instructions that go along with it
going to cancel out on that cancel out
of this all rights go ahead and see how
reminders work on this guy remind me to
call Brandon tomorrow which Brandon
Brandon
Russell Brandon so both of those
actually worked just as fast on the
reminders side alright so let's go ahead
and see if we can do some math for us I
hate doing math see if the phones can
help us out what is seven plus five okay
here you go
alright so pulled that in from Wolfram
Afra alpha very quickly gave me seven
plus five equals twelve
okay so galaxy s3 did it as well but a
little bit slower let's go ahead and try
some restaurants what's the best sushi
place close by I found a number of sushi
restaurants 19 of them are fairly close
to you I've sorted them by rating
alright so this got it but maybe I
talked a little different or than hit
the button in time so let's try it just
on the galaxy s3 where is the best sushi
place nearby
so it recognized it and now it's pulling
in lists of places that you can go ahead
and call so s voice seems to work pretty
well when you put these two head-to-head
a Serie definitely works a little bit
quicker than s voice but as I use s
voice more we'll see if it does a little
bit more than what Siri does or the not
Siri is going to reign supreme
so what do you guys think about these
two were you excited not excited do you
think that Siri was a runaway winner you
think that you could live with little
slower speeds of s voice occurs to what
you guys have to say and something that
you want to hear me test that I didn't
test this very simple overview leave the
comments down below so I can go ahead
and make a follow-up I'm drawing a
retinue from TechnoBuffalo be sure to
check us out for all your Galaxy S 3
news I'll see you the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
