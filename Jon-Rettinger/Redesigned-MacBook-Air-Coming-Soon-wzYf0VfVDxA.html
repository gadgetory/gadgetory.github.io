Air has been kind of relegated to
second-class status in Apple's lineup
but it looks like the little laptop that
once could is about to could er a little
bit more people leave the folks at Mac a
Qatar who admittedly have a bit of a
touch or go history of alpha rumors
rumors have been substantiated by the
folks at digit times and economic daily
news again of questionable validity but
they all three are saying the same thing
the MacBook Air is getting a complete
design refresh so here's what we think
we know we are going to see our friendly
IO get removes that means we're no
longer going to have Thunderbolt 2 role
are going to have us be a which is going
to be a gigantic bummer I'm no longer
going to have MagSafe tube gonna be
powered by USB C and of course it also
be compatible with Thunderbolt 3 and
that's the big design change is in the
i/o standpoint supposedly it's going to
take design cues from the MacBook Apple
is going to drop the 11 inch model
introduced a 15 inch model so they have
a 13 and a 15 hopefully they'll be
slimming down those just gigantically
chunky bezels doesn't leave a question
of where the MacBook Air is going to fit
into the lineup wait how does it slot
with the MacBook it's a MacBook a sub
computer to the MacBook Air it's not for
Kerrigan somehow slot below the MacBook
and then of course the new MacBook Pro
lineup on top of that I think a lot of
people are going to be excited to have a
15-inch MacBook Air one thing we don't
know what's going to happen to it SD
card slot that exists now on the 13-inch
model
hopefully that will stick around there's
been another less accentuated rumour
that it's going to be a very high spec
machine meeting 16 gigs of ram on board
and the latest processor from intel no
core m here so hopefully it'll haul more
ass than the Kardashians Range Rover all
this MacBook Air redesigned stuff wasn't
that big of surprise with a surprise
though is the time frame supposedly this
is going to debut in June which does
coincide at Apple's WWDC which is coming
up also reports and Apple might just
announce it at a different time with a
press release and it won't be at WWDC
but it doesn't make much sense
so what once looks like a software only
focus event for the next generation of
OS 10 or mac OS and iOS 10 introduction
my Dahlstrom 2 bit of a hardware event
fingers crossed
you guys waiting for a MacBook Airs
you've been saying well just get a new
MacBook Pro when it comes out because
apples not really doing anything with
the MacBook Air I wanna hear your
thoughts on it a few things we don't
know the screen resolutions going to be
if it's going to get that Retina display
presumably it will stay in the back the
question why did anybody buy a MacBook
so only Apple catches that question they
certainly not try to cannibalize their
own sales so big shrug on the screen
resolution what do you guys think what
are your thoughts on it
MacBook Air you excited and holding off
for a MacBook Pro are you like hey Apple
