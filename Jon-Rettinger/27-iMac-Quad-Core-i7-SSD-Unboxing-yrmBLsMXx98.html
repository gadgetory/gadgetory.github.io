technobuffalo here it's in a box and I
am really excited about it is my new
desktop it is a 27-inch imac let's go
ahead and dig in talk about the specs
alright so we are looking at a brand-new
mid-2010 refreshed 27-inch imac with
intel core i7 a quad core processor
clocked at 2.93 bigger to eight
megabytes of level 3 cash hyper
threading and turbo boost all its up
i'll talk about a later video the ati
radeon HD 5750 with one gigabyte of
gddr5 memory and an SDXC slot this
particular one I custom-built it's got a
two terabyte hard drive at 7200 rpm as
well as a secondary 256 gigabytes all
update drags you're not talking about it
let's go ahead and dig in and see what
this sucker it looks like I'm very
excited to take a look I have an imac
right now a 24 inch which is getting to
be a bit slow hard drive got filled up
and I wasn't quite doing what I needed
to do as far as video processing and
rendering obviously I do a lot of video
work and I need something just a bit
faster so of course we'll use the ablute
or a big ol knife and cut into this
monster cardboard box
go ahead and slice the tape and not my
fingers one of these days though this
knife is going to take me down from ten
fingers to nine go ahead and do a few
more cuts and we should be dope all
right push it off to the side here we
have the imac in a massive box sync what
is about 42 pounds the whole box ivi
back to anyways less let's go ahead and
see I can pull it out of here just
harder than you might think little one
fancy one-handed maneuvering there we go
push the bumps up to the side and here
we have the 27-inch imac packaging it's
pretty straightforward what you'd expect
to my Mac boxes the past years it's got
a picture of the imac on the front in
this case of course the 27-inch it's a
backlit LED display with a resolution of
1230 2560 x 1440 it's a really high
resolution screen let's go ahead and see
what else you got on top you have a
picture of the imac latino come to the
wireless keyboard and the magic mouse
another picture of the imac on the front
on the sides tell you know that 16 by 9
widescreen LED backlit display we just
talked about wireless keyboard and the
magic mouse on the other side we've got
a bit about the specs and some UPC
information but let's go ahead and check
out the computer itself and of course
are we doing comparisons with my older
imac i'll be showing processing speeds
on all kinds of bench tests and show you
guys how this works how it compares and
also show you the benefits or not
benefits possibly of the solid state
drive coupled with these spinning 7200
RPM two terabyte drive curious how Apple
sets that up so we'll go ahead and slice
the tape here and open up the new iMac
there we go all right knife off to the
side for the last time and this is a
quite a large box so we've got the
design by Apple in California sore what
you'd expect a new computer what's going
to have we've got the wireless keyboard
pretty standard we've seen that many
many times it actually comes with a
battery charger I don't know that they
had had done that kind of neat we also
have a magic mouse and a a cleaning
cloth actually I ordered the battery
charge panicky they put it in the box
here we've got everything Mac which is
going to have all of your disks and
backup information and that looks like
it is a bound it put everything off to
the side and let's go ahead and dig in
and see if the computer itself is like
we'll come back use that keyboard and
such later again and out may prove to be
quite difficult you've got some
styrofoam little corners here push those
up to the side is off to the side inside
the box is pretty sparse save for the
giant looking imac itself go ahead and
try and pull it out here there we go go
ahead and push this down on the floor
we've got a few other things in the box
not power cord and some more styrofoam
corner just and that is about it alright
go ahead and take a look it's all go and
push the camera down a little more push
this off to the side sorry from the
corner here we've got the 27-inch imac a
little bit of cloth on it and pull this
off to the the bat will break
that seal and probably the last time
I'll ever see the screen smudge free
go ahead and kill us all
and here we've got a pretty standard
looking 27 imac the isight camera go
ahead and spin it around and see what
else we have nothing here on the
left-hand side on the right-hand side of
course you've got your super Drive and
there is the SD card slot which is now
XD XD so can accept a pretty high
storage present continuing the attur on
the back it's now silver compared to the
black model that I previously had me
turn it over take a look at the quartz
here we've got well you can see that and
see me we've got a headphone in audio in
and out three USB ports firewire DVI and
your Ethernet port so if I stay tuned to
the channel and technical up so we'll be
running a ton of tests on the 27-inch
this is the top of the I'm a client to
see if it's worth the money or not and
make your better off with the i3 and
we'll put the solid-state drive to the
test anyway guys I am jon rettinger
protect no Buffalo and stay tuned for
all those videos and I'll see you in the
next one bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
