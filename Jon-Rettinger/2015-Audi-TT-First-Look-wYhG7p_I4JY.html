TechnoBuffalo here at the 2014 Geneva
Motor Show and behind me is the
brand-new Audi TT when the TT was first
unveiled in 1998 I absolutely fell in
love
but unfortunately my tastes changed over
the years in the car maybe not so much
but it is all completely redone and
redesigned I gotta say it's looking much
better so this car is based on the MQB
underpinnings that we've seen on VW s
group for a few years you don't know
what that means it's a really really
solid foundation for the car so it's
built on high-strength steel so this car
will really be safe no matter where you
go but also needs a bit on the heavier
side from the end enjoy looking at
either a 230 horsepower engine or a 310
or power engine whether not you off to
the TT or the TTS usually gonna choose
from the turbo engine front-wheel drive
or all-wheel drive it's gonna jet you to
60 in the smaller engine in 4.7 seconds
so really on the quicker side when you
look at the car design wise not gonna
stick this up anything else it's
certainly an evolution of the TT design
they haven't totally redone it I was
kind of hoping for maybe a baby r8 but
it looks very much like a TT just it
grown-up TT so that this really
distinctive silhouette with that real
quick fastback that goes down the
rounded back and around the front are
there you've got out of these more
masculine aggressive grille up front LED
headlights are here as well
the big story though is what's inside of
the car back to the sheet metal's new
and prettier but inside you've got the
updated version of audi's MMI and it's
gone completely digital as things now
tend to do it is totally customizable
highlighted by a 1440 pixel display you
can make anything you want the idea now
is that you can sort of customize for
what you're doing you're on a track you
want to see at economic you're just
doing normal driving you want to make
sure you can see your speedometer if
you've got a manual transmission you
wanna make sure you can see rpms very
clearly you can customize whatever you
want in the car first time we're seeing
this make its way into production a date
assuming they're looking at the future
of what Audi might be so if been
thinking about getting an Audi but maybe
the TT is too small take a real close
look at what's inside this is going to
filter down to
the a4 the a3 the a7 the a8 really all
across every design it looks really
awesome
Addie's been at the forefront of
technology for a while we've got Google
Maps integration with full satellite and
Street View so they've really done a
nice job up in technology game this is
the next level so while the car itself
might not be a revolutionary design at
what's inside of it certainly is so what
do you guys think about the new TT could
it be your next car is it not too much
of a change for you do you care more
about what's on the outside than the
inside I would love to hear your
thoughts leave it in the comments right
down below until next time I'm John
renters and TechnoBuffalo I'll see you
