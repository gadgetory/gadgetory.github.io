technobuffalo here if you follow the
smartphone industry you are well aware
that one of the glaring holes and apples
armor is the inability for the iOS to
play flash you've heard of it touted in
the Android operating system is really
one of the big selling points however
now there is a workaround to view flash
video not all flash content relatively
smoothly on your iPhone let me go ahead
and show you so sky fires been a browser
that's been around for quite some time
on other platforms we've seen one on
Windows Mobile bc went on blackberry and
fuel and mobile operating systems we've
finally seen it approved for Apple
disorder relax their restrictions it
essentially sits right on top of Safari
and what it's going to do is convert
flash videos because that can be played
on the iphone enough about me talking
about let me go ahead and show you it's
available now from the app store it's
going to cost you just about three
dollars so go ahead and open up skyfire
and what we have right here is my
youtube page is probably what you're
familiar to sing when you look at a
YouTube page on your iPhone this is
built right on top of Safari so the
control should look very familiar I'm
gonna go ahead and refresh the page
right here and show you what's going to
happen so you notice that there are a
few more icons across the bottom there's
an hourglass there's a little squiggle
little squiggle is going to pull up
allied content and little hourglass
right there is going to let you know
that there is some sort of flash video
to be played so if a little our blush
changes but you know what stop thinking
and now there's a play button I could go
and hit play and it will play that video
that was on my home screen I'll take a
minute the sort of buffer and convert it
but this is a great way to sort of view
flash content I could be able to play
flash games or view sort of other non
video related stuff but you can now
watch flash videos on your iphone and
surprisingly decent quality though as
you can see you right now there's a bit
of a load and buffer time here so go
ahead and let it go it's buffering the
video right now to your device and this
will work on three
and there it goes and you can do it in
full screen as well and you can see it
works go ahead take a look at a few
other sites to show you flash working on
the iphone got some already queued up
here first question I had was what work
with hulu it will not work with who the
list you know that hulu is not supported
for mobile browser very disappointing so
go ahead and quit it that how about
south park studios it is a well-known
flash website people love south park
what if you want to watch yourself park
episode on the go what you couldn't on
your iphone unless you downloaded it now
you can stream it right from the site
let's go ahead and pick a video and i'll
show you the same thing those little
hourglass it's going to let you know
that it's thinking and trying to convert
some took here is the episode to go
ahead and try and click it and see what
happens you still get the pinch to zoom
it's go ahead and find the play button
watches episode there we go this is a
tale of Scrooge Rick booger balls you
get the big flash notification there
let's go ahead and see if this is going
to play we've all kind of become very
familiar now with seeing that not
equipped to play on an iphone but that
did pop up and I do have a psych on
school head and see this is going to
work and I'm just gonna play like a
second of it here I don't want to get in
any sort of issue which i want to show
you that it does indeed work so it's
buffering again that does take some time
but it will start playing relatively
good quality it's not going to be HD
like you get if you download it from
iTunes or rip your own HD content but
it's very watchable really quite usable
I actually exciting and now we can view
a lot of a flash video content on your
iPhone of course you can download this
on the ipod touch although it's going to
sort of shrink it a little bit you have
to enlarge it to scale but for 299 you'd
be able to get your flash video on you
can see it's probably about a minute and
a half a two-minute affair to actually
get the video to play once it does play
it's pretty good and jeremy you don't
have any
buffering issue once the playback begins
so there we go getting ready to play
still still waiting you see a little
icon there again like I said it's not
the quickest in the world but it will
work so there it goes I night at the
stud supply gotta close that I want to
get any copyright issues I just want to
show you guys that it does work and it
keeps you're wondering yes that is a
flux capacitor app anyway go ahead and
get downloading skyfire it's well worth
of three dollars you're going to open
yourself up to a ton more video content
than you had before on your iPhone
definitely a recommended must find it
really does work as advertised a few
other options skyfire actually let me
show you sort of very quickly let's go
ahead and exit out of this you can
choose whether not you want to view
websites in mobile or desktop version
pretty simple also has a private
browsing feature in case you don't want
people to see the naughty website you're
looking at these little squiggly lines i
mentioned i'll pull ups or of alloy
content so episode and sort of what's
more about it and the rest of the icons
on the bottom should be very familiar if
you've used safari and other guys really
want to know we have to think about this
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i will see you in the next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
