of interest in it especially now the
Galaxy Note 7 has gone bye-bye and
there's a lot to love about the V xx
fact we made a whole video about what
the LG v 20 is in the in video which you
should watch I'll click click up here
take a look at it but there's a flip
side to it the LG v 20 is far from
perfect and a lot of things to not like
about it
so let's go counter here some of the
things that the LG b 20 isn't first the
phone doesn't have any waterproofing in
it
so if you live where it rains Lotter
you're prone to dropping your phone in
water either get a waterproof case or be
prepared to have to replace your phone I
think every flagship should check two of
the four boxes if you either have
wireless charging it should have
removable battery span double storage or
waterproofing the LG v 20 definitely
checks to those boxes the battery is
removable and does have expandable
storage but those other two are
important to you that I would not
consider the v20 the biggest con for me
is the skin sitting on top of android
7.0 nougat LG's UX 5.0 is a weird
animation iPhone looking UI there's no
app drawer on here it's just not an
enjoyable experience to use but pro of
using android throw a launcher on here
and you are good to go but if you're not
the kind of first maybe doesn't know how
to use launchers you should become that
kind of person and learn if you're going
to pick up this phone or if you just use
what comes out of the box you might feel
disappointed with what LG is offering
the build quality on the LG v 20 isn't
quite as premium as the price would
suggest which we will talk about the
back wall removable which is a great
feature doesn't sit flush with the
bottom of the phone when you put it back
on meaning the bottom chin is raised a
little bit from the back panel
and the last kana things to get kammath
almost every flagship nowadays is price
seven hundred and seventy bucks or
around there if you're gonna pay full
retail for the phone it is not cheap
especially in a world with a one plus
three other lower price options are
really bumping up the specs you got to
really love what the LG v 20 is to want
to spend clothes 800 bucks or more
for taxes work so if you guys watch both
videos the is me isn't there's clearly
much more to love about the LGB 20 then
there isn't but it's not perfect no
phone no thing no person no reviewer no
video are ever perfect so I want to give
you guys the counter-argument to the is
is any of that enough to keep you from
buying the V 20 you've already ordered
it is already in your hands I want to
know about it even the comments down
below
so next time John Wright nephew
