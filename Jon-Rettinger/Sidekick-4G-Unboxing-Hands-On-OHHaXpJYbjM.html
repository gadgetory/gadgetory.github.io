TechnoBuffalo heareth and unboxing and I
am really looking forward to this is the
new sidekick 4G I've got a very
nostalgic place in my heart for the
sidekick brand and that's a little bit
distraught when I thought that it was
going to be killed completely by the
folks at t-mobile but it is supposedly
back with a vengeance
now ditching the danger sharp combo who
manufactured the hardware and the OS in
the past now we've got Samsung and
Android onboard let's go ahead and see
if the sidekick 4G is worthy of the
sidekick name alright so the box is
kinda neat you've got a new sidekick
logo SK got some sidekick branding on
the sides right there as well I've got
the phone number covered up talking a
bit more about the specs of course I'll
run through all that business you're
going to have Android 2.2 onboard but
really makes as a sidekick as opposed to
just a standard Android phone is this
social address book with Facebook and
Twitter clients enhanced media
experience with media room and media hub
there's all kinds of sidekick features
that you would expect so let's go ahead
and dig in I have not opened this box up
yet I have not touched one of these so I
am very excited
the original sidekick and the sidekick
to some of my first smartphones that I
owned I was really really excited about
it I loved the social media features
that had at the time and had the
built-in AI AM which was kind of neat so
here it is it definitely looks like a
sidekick pushed it off the side for just
one minute there is the white color so
you also were going to get in the box
I'm guessing it's going to be veteran
cables but let's go ahead and check it
out we've got an adapter for the micro
SD 2 standard SD card that's great wall
charger it is using micro USB which is
nice and USB two micro nothing all that
exciting there it looks like there are
some books in here as well let's go and
check that out and get right to the
phone yep there's some ebooks Quick
Start Guide
and the rest of it push that off alright
so here is why you're all here in
something I am again very excited and
again so very nostalgic about here is
the sidekick 4G let me go ahead and run
through the specs of this guy because
there is actually a lot to like first
it's going to be available April 20th
from t-mobile with support for their
HSPA+ network so you're going to get up
to 21 megabits per second and also kind
of cool support for their HSUPA for
uploads
I'll be able to get up to 2 megabits per
second it's got a 3.5 inch coarse
capacitive touchscreen the resolution of
480 by 800 and I will pull the sticker
off I know I can see the comments
already with everybody talking about it
it's got a so again the 3.5 inch screen
it weighs five point seven ounces or 162
grams if you're so inclined being
powered by Android 2.2 Froyo this one is
Samsung built so it's also going to have
the same processor we've seen at Galaxy
S my de phones which is the cortex a8
hummingbird which is a 1 gigahertz
processor on the back to go ahead and
take a look at the rear we are going to
have a 3 megapixel camera also on the
front we are going to have a VGA camera
somewhere which I guess lives right
there and VGA is 0.3 megapixels in case
you were wondering and you're going to
have full flash support so let's go
ahead and peel the sticker off the
screen let's take a look at this new
opening and sliding mechanism previous
generation sidekicks as opposed to
psychic slide swiveled up this one does
not do that I don't believe got kind of
a cool sliding mechanism to it you can
see let's look a little bit of tilt push
it back and see how that works
ok neat worked very well slides right up
a keyboard at least on first blush
appears to be very spacious a sidekick
liner is really known faretta very nice
courti keyboard here's got a full row
for numbers
Cordy that you've got a pink shift
serving line I guess the t-mobile
branding you also have some pink I
probably should say magenta accents here
on the side and the back you've got your
t-mobile branding let's go ahead and
take a look at
the phone itself actually I will power
it on and while it's powering on we can
talk a little bit about it I think
that's probably the power button down
below there we go all right so sidekick
so you've got your typical array of
Android buttons you've got a back button
I believe that's probably going to be
your home button a menu button something
I'm guessing is going to have a sidekick
specific set of features we've got like
an optical if that is an optical
four-way navigation as you move your
finger over it they'll navigate around
for it similar to scroll ball you can
also push it end so you can actually get
five-way Boonton up into Android on the
top of the device you're going to have
your charging port under a door I found
those doors really annoying Samsung
doesn't sometimes they make them slide
sometimes they have this a little bit of
plastic generally I take those off but
that's a personal preference thing looks
like we're going to have your camera
button right on top as well click you
got that above five booting up there on
the bottom that's where the volume
rocker is going to live and that's
probably the power and lock button also
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack so a
little bit of a hump on each side which
actually as you holding and typing
should give a little better and improved
Edmund experience so it looks like we
are booted up here let's take a real
quick look at the operating system all
do a full walkthrough of all the
sidekick features this is my first time
actually taking a look at this so let's
see what this mystery button does I'm
guessing yep it pulls up so it's a jump
key you can go ahead and set all kinds
of settings I'm assuming for this jump T
jump key settings jump key shortcuts so
that would be you the jump key and you
can go ahead and navigate with this that
is indeed the home button T sensitivity
of the touch screen seems to be working
pretty well about we'd expect from a
pretty decently powered phone here
alright so this has been a first look
and unboxing at the sidekick 4G we'll be
showing a lot more this guy coming up of
course it's got an accelerometer and
full touchscreen and all that business
that you'd expect from a modern
smartphone so
what do you think about the sidekick 4G
you excited not excited you know what's
your thoughts on this as you open it up
to the screen do its little rotating
business you got a phone apps and
contacts are kind of neat as well so
there's a lot of skin going on here on
top of Android 2.2 to make this a
sidekick I'm really looking forward to
getting through this and seeing if it
lives up to the sidekick name the
Android smartphone market is getting
very crowded and it's getting tougher
and tougher differentiate so let's see
if Samsung and t-mobile have a winner on
their hands I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo be sure to check out the
website for all your tech news and I'll
see you in the next video bye bye so the
one last thing I want to show you guys
is actually a size comparison oftentimes
and almost all the time phones with
physical QWERTY keyboards especially
those that slide out like this guy add a
little bit of bulk so let's bring in
some phones give you a sense how thick
this phone is going to be here is the
Droid to go ahead and see that the
sidekick 4G is about what you'd expect
from a thickness standpoint here it is
with the Droid X which is my no means a
thin phone this is of course not have a
slide-out QWERTY keyboard why you might
be familiar with the thickness of it you
can see that right there and for those
of you that want to see it next to an
iPhone I can see what the thickness
difference is here as well it's really
not bad it's got a pretty nice feel to
in the hand too and doesn't weigh all
that much so guys I'm John rhett
interpret TechnoBuffalo and this really
is at the end
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
