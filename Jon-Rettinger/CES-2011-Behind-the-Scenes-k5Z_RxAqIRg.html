cold cups of free coffee Shalom young
Shalom y'all I'm trying out these
different ways to hello Shalom I'm Noah
crap it's from technobuffalo and this is
a little behind-the-scenes look at what
it's really like to blog CES 2011 I
can't even talk anymore
so here it is the cold hard reality I
got my laptop I got two empty cups of
coffee cell phone empty bottle of water
random press release ethernet cables
everywhere some dudes laptop we told me
to watch for him but he's not back in 10
minutes I might just take it fellow
bloggers fellow members of the press
instead of a hotel ballroom it turned
into a press lounge for a little while
let's walk around shall we so you know
all the electronic electronic press kits
you can eat lots of publications notice
how the the print materials are all
still here because he just wants the
electronic stuff you don't want to carry
things around when you're walking around
the show Karen all your gear and stuff
having to carry more stuff it's it's
hard man these are I it's a fun gig but
these are long days you walk around the
show floor all day go to events at night
go back to your hotel room and you know
right up which you can cover an all that
stuff the last thing you want to do is
carry more deer around
for young there's the water cooler
here's the refreshment stand it's at
slim pickins the cookies long gone the
lemons for tea and sit now for the wow
no more skim milk there is whole North
strewn coffee Cubs abandoned another
empty cookie tray this video they apply
us with that caffeine and sugar to keep
us going so we can block more now I'm
playing up the you know the woe is us
angle right I his word is work
presidents yes 2011 Las Vegas
you know there's a lot of people have
not left this little corridor all day
because I press conference is writing
the stuff of more press conferences at
Sarasota cetera and they're still like a
tens of thousands of square foot actual
show to go see over at the convention
center so that's my goal for tomorrow
it's been a little more time over there
but anyway look as I came back to the
table here and somebody left me a note
awesome be that you the author of the
note that's my hey you want a free plug
for your website I'm going to link up
excellent there you go so if you're in
the mood for a free note the next time
you're in the press room you know
because the Android please some love
here's here real quick here's the gear
bag just so you know I've got the
portable tripod this is this is the the
best 120 bucks you can spend if you do a
lot of video production y'all gotta chip
it makes exporting video just amazingly
faster yeah card reader because the
macbook air doesn't have a card reader
built in earphones half empty bag of
Skittles I got the verizon press
conference
lip balm gum I prefer the Trident pink
it's sugarless it's great for blowing
bubbles what else we have in here wallet
a baggie of business cards that you gave
me cables and an extra battery for the
camcorder tools of the trade man you
know you want it's all about going as
light weight and efficient as possible
because oh I'm old my shoulders get
tired of every bag all right there you
