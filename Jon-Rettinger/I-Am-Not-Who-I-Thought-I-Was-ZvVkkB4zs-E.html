know it's a tech channel but you guys
have gotten to know me over the years
I've shared big life news I shared when
I got married when I had kids when
techni Buffalo was launching you know
when they launched failed and this is
probably the most personal video I've
ever done and then something just came
from wanting to know who I am sort of
where I come from my whole life I have
always looked culturally ambiguous when
I was younger and I was outside more
often a little Tanner people were sure I
was Puerto Rican or Italian or more
recently that I was dude from grand
theft auto 5 and I got older and saw
less sunlight people just assumed I was
I was Russian or somewhere some from
somewhere in Europe and I always wanted
to know who I was especially as I became
a father and like kids start to ask
questions you know who are they I wanted
to know so about six months ago I
started a research project I just kind
of kept to myself to try and see if I
could find records on my family and as
far back as I could find was my
great-grandparents in the earlier part
of the 20th century emigrating from
Eastern Europe and the records that I
had was actually came through Ellis
Island actually found my original last
name was not written jure it was read a
chanc off and it got changed at Ellis
Island - Rhett injure half my family
evidently their last name went to Cherry
and half turned into Rhett injure it's
funny because my mom's name was sherry
so she theoretically could have been
been chery chery previously and before
that immigration I can't find any
records of any of my ancestors so I
wanted to know who I am it's decided to
do a 23andme test if you haven't done
janek tests I always thought that it was
like gotta take blood and send it in or
sending urine or something weird gross
and invasive turns I just got a little
vial like that biggie just spittin it
and then you close it up and there's a
label yes you send it in you log in
online to get an email unlike couple
weeks later you get an email with your
results and that was really it I also
nervous open this up I'm not gonna lie
and actually before I opened it up I put
out a tweet that was like hey I did a
23andme test something you guys want to
know about and there was a pretty
overwhelming response yes which is cool
this is a tech channel I guess there's a
lot of tech that goes into testing your
genetics
um folks 23andme saw the tweet and
they're like hey if we're gonna do a
video can we sponsor it so I was like
sure I'm gonna do it don't do the video
anyway I'm gonna say what I'm gonna say
so thanks 23andme for actually actually
sponsoring this so here are my results
and before I before I give you my
results taking guesses put in the
comments before I get to this what do
you think I am there were no surprises
in my ancestry I was 100 or M 100%
European I thought that would have been
a mix somewhere on my moms or dads side
mixed with something but turns out 100%
so that was kind of interesting I wish I
could find further genetic history of
those results at which I could sort of
see you know exactly we're in Europe I
believe it's Eastern Europe you know
Russia Poland Czechoslovakia is always
sort of where I've been told my family
came from but it was a really
interesting process and self-discovery
like for me alright so if you don't know
about genes you haven't taken that class
that or you forgot you have 23
chromosomes was actually where that like
23andme came from 22 of your 23
chromosomes come from your ancestors so
aside from all the ancestry stuff they
also offer genetic testing to help
figure out what you can potentially be
predisposed to it's kind of a cool test
I did it if you want to have it done
23andme offers it as well so as I was
going through and doing this test the
folks at the office here we're super
interested as well and they wanted to do
the tests and most of them wanted to
share their stories too about who they
are who they thought they were and what
they ended up being so give that a watch
and maybe you guys can discover
something different about yourselves and
if you want to try 23andme for yourself
or give it as a gift to someone they
give us a code it's 23 me complex
checked on Buffalo get discounts on all
different services that they offer it's
really cool I feel better knowing who I
am and I know maybe you guys might feel
cool about it as well
so here's the office and sort of a
pretty interesting self discovery hey
guys I'm Jesse Ortiz I'm the social
media guy here at TechnoBuffalo so when
you angrily tweet at us about something
you don't like I'm the one happily
responding to you but before I did this
test I was really really interested I
come from a Mexican family both parents
are
andris that Mexican but I was interested
in like what if there's anything else in
there I'm I was actually really
surprised with the results because I
actually got 46% European but it breaks
down to being Spanish so I'm 46 percent
Spanish while only 41 point 9 so 42
percent native which is Mexican so if
they're interesting to see that I have a
higher percentage Spanish than Mexican
which I expect it to be like 100%
Mexican like they would only be the one
trait which is interesting and the only
other percentage I had was 6.4 percent
African which is really interesting
coming from the fact that I thought I
was gonna be like a Honduras ed native
and that was it so it's really cool I
really enjoyed this hey what's up my
name is Danny Cepeda and I'm one of the
editors here at techni Buffalo if you've
been on the site you've probably read
some of my articles and I'm one of the
guys that took the 23andme test and I'm
Mexican my mom from Mexico my dad's from
Mexico but aside from that I'm not
really aware of my genealogy so I was
very interested in finding out about
that so when I got the results back it
turns out much more diverse than I
thought I was
I'm obviously Mexican Native American
and I'm also southern European which
means I'm have some Spanish in me and
there's even some Asian African and
Jewish parts in my genealogy as I had no
idea that I was brothers related to that
so that's pretty cool and yeah everyone
I'm Matt Gonzalez and I'm a video
director here at TechnoBuffalo so I
always knew that I was half European and
half Mexican but I didn't really know
how that broke down I didn't know
exactly where I was from so it's
interesting to see the results
especially because on my dad's side who
is Mexican he doesn't know his dad so
really it's a complete mystery I don't
know anything about that side of the
family so it turns out after getting the
results I'm very European about 75% the
biggest portion is British and Irish
that is on my mom's side and the other
portion is Mexican but it's mainly
Spanish so that was very interesting to
me I thought there was more native in
there but that's only about 15 percent
so this test was
this test was good I liked finding out
exactly what it was and I think I think
we're gonna have to buy more of these
for my family hey I'm Marklin Sangin and
I'm the creative director here at
TechnoBuffalo and growing up I grew up
in the Philippines born and raised there
ever since then like my parents had told
me I you know 100% Filipino after taking
a test with 23andme it's true
like there's nothing different than what
they told me when I was a kid I'm
according to my DNA result I am 98.3%
East Asian and Native American but 91
percent of that is Southeast Asian where
essentially that's where the Philippines
is technically so I guess my parents
weren't lying so so if this sounds
interesting you and you want to test
your theory on on who you are who you
thought you were or see if all of your
grandparents were telling you the actual
truth on where you came from we got a
code 23 we hooked us up so go 223 me
calm select TechnoBuffalo this counts
there and all their services good
through January 31st it's an awesome
gift I'm gonna give it to my wife she
was really curious after seeing my
results on who she is and if you're open
to sharing your story and sharing who
you are I would love to know thinkin
sort of makes people unique
who they are and where they came from so
leave in the comments or send me a
message on Twitter I'll keep the thread
active and I'll try to keep coming back
to check hope you guys enjoyed totally
different sila video but it was one of
the most personal videos that i've ever
done sort of it's Who I am on like a
genetic level I hope you guys enjoyed if
you like these more personal style
videos let us know in the comments also
down below and of course subscribe and
hit the little bell faint notifications
when new videos are coming up until next
time I am a hundred percent European Jon
Rhett injure and I'll see you the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
