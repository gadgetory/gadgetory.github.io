TechnoBuffalo and what I've got for you
guys today is a tutorial on making the
switch from being an iMovie user to a
Final Cut user now all you PC guys out
there don't get mad I'm also planning on
doing one doing Windows Movie Maker to
Sony Vegas or something along those
lines but for today it's gonna be iMovie
to Final Cut let's go ahead and get
started so one of the biggest hurdles
that I move a users face when they're
switching the Final Cut is really just a
mental one when you first get it open
you see all these options and it's
somewhat overwhelming but the good news
is that for the vast majority of users
90% of the stuff you are never gonna
need as it really meant more for the pro
level users out there the other good
news is that the interface your custom
to an iMovie has direct correlations
with the interface in Final Cut so what
we're gonna learn is how you can
translate the moves you already known
how to do an iMovie into Final Cut so
what's the first thing you do in iMovie
you import your footage into an event
right where a similar thing happens in
Final Cut except it's just named
differently you have what's called bins
and the way to think of these is as your
events are in iMovie and it's just a
collection of raw video clips and what
you can do is you can make a new bin in
Final Cut and then just go ahead and
drag all your footage into it for easy
organization you'll notice it comes up
as a list view instead of as thumbnails
well it's easy to change that so you can
get to the clip that you want simply by
right-clicking inside the bin and
selecting icons your next step is to
find the clip that you want and bring it
into what's called the viewer now the
way to think of the viewer is is a space
for you to edit the clip before bringing
it into your final product which is
shown in the screen next to it the
canvas now in iMovie these are all
combined into one screen but Final Cut
simply splits them into two most
people's next step in iMovie is to
select they're in and out
points of their clips and then drag them
into their project window where they
want them well you do something similar
in Final Cut so here in the viewer I'm
gonna scrub through and find where I
want my clip to begin and end in my
final product then I'm gonna set the in
and out points either by selecting the
buttons here on the screen or using the
eye in Okies now once that's done I have
a couple options I can drag it to the
canvas to insert it or drag it down to
my main timeline now once I have it
inserted you'll notice in the canvas
window what my clip is gonna look like
in the final product then just like in
iMovie I'm gonna repeat those steps
until my video is sequenced how I want
it's easy to make changes as well just
go into the timeline and click and drag
or double click on the clip and make the
adjustments in the viewer
one of the things people really love
about iMovie is the ease with which you
can add transitions and effects well you
can do the same thing in Final Cut
it's just laid out a little differently
here in the browser window if you look
at the top you see an effects tab and
that's where you'll see all the built-in
filters and transitions so for this I'm
just going to go ahead and pick the
cross dissolve transition and place that
into my timeline and now the clip is
gonna have a nice fade to it in the
finished product you can fine-tune those
filters and effects by double-clicking
on a clip to bring it into the viewer
and clicking on the filters our motion
tab at the top of the viewer window so
this is a good time to talk about
something you will not encounter in
iMovie and that is rendering for example
let's take this effect and drag it to
the timeline now you notice the top of
the timeline window there's a little red
bar appearing up there and that
indicates that this part of my sequence
is not rendered and you can see when I
hit play it actually comes up as
unrendered in the canvas so what you
want to do is is go ahead and go to the
top of Final Cut under sequence and then
render that selection now that's gonna
allow you to see the video play in real
time keep in mind that you'll encounter
unrenewed selections not just for
effects and transitions but also for
certain video for
as well okay guys final step and that is
exporting and iMovie this is pretty easy
you go to the share menu and Final Cut
you get two different options really you
can go ahead and export the QuickTime
and pick a format you want to use and I
would recommend this if you don't really
care about file size your second option
is to export using Quicktime conversion
now what this is going to do is give you
some presets specifically for certain
situations then you can of course go to
the options for all these different
presets and then tweak them to fit your
specific needs there you guys have it
the basics of switching from iMovie to
Final Cut a good question to ask
yourself though is do you actually need
to make the switch iMovie is a very
capable program on its own and can do
some really great things well either way
hopefully this was helpful for you and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
