Apple's like an arrested mob boss they
don't say nothing and nobody about
nothing and they didn't see nothing
times though they are changing
surprisingly Apple held a really small
meeting for their Cupertino offices with
select journalists to talk about
surprisingly new Apple products even
more surprisingly to bit that they were
wrong and this coming from a company who
kind of miss engineered a phone and
blame people for holding it wrong so
give up a little bit of credit I have
done many rants on Apple and I think
they forgotten the Pro line talks about
the products last year if I'm going to
take one side of the stands when Apple
addresses it I feel like in fairness I
should address that as well but Apple
said a ton of stuff first thing they
said was totally are bad on the Mac Pro
we way over designed it and made
upgrading it really harder next to
impossible because the thermals
just got really hot so that's why it's
that stagnant for a really long time
Apple said they did not forget the pro
users they still super heart the pro
users and there is a new Mac Pro coming
which will be modular sometime next year
and again for Apple to say something
like this lycra have a new product
coming is unheard of for them so we
don't know much else about other than
modular design Apple also said there's
going to be a new cinema display for pro
users as well and we had heard that
Apple's kind of exiting that business
they partnered with LG for the current
set of monitors that we have right now
so assume that those will come sometime
next year as well when the modular Mac
Pro comes but that ain't all for Apple
users who wanted to the pro experience
the Mac Pro kind of just sat stagnant a
lot of those folks migrated over to the
iMac and Apple noticed I said a
pro-level
iMac is coming later on this year like a
pro configuration don't know what
they're going to call it don't know
what's going to be in it but certainly I
think that they've been hit making the
success of the Microsoft Surface studio
through other all-in-one the practical
migrating over the Apple wants to
recapture some of those lots people or
also get people that are using older
computers to finally upgrade I'd also
presume that all those iMac upgrades are
going to come with a totally redesigned
iMac or at least that's the hope if
you're doing like fingers crossed for
touch Phil Schiller said ain't no touch
coming they don't see touch at all being
important
which is maybe like a little just kind
of ironic because that's bar touchy if
you're waxing nostalgic about the Mac
Pro Apple didn't do you a bit of a solid
they drop the price on the existing
models you can get a lot more computer
lob it and outstayed a computer for your
buck and interesting kid with dota came
out of this too with Apple also said
they think external GPUs do have a place
so that would be incredible for for the
MacBook Pros you can make almost any
iMac be a pro level iMac with
Thunderbolt 3 will be a really
incredible thing of Apple support of
that or even if Apple maybe came out
throwing the closure either way it looks
like Apple is realizing that's way they
did things where they addressed pros
last few years it's not gonna be
sustainable for them over the next
couple of years and decades so I do give
Apple credit here not only do they MIT
that they were wrong they said here's
what we're going to do to try and fix it
and they give a timeline for that which
I puts them on the clock to deliver so
regardless of how you feel about Apple
this is a really unprecedented move for
them and again I commend them I'm
excited about a new pro level iMac I
really couldn't care less about the
trashcan Mac Pro but perhaps you care
I'm excited to see what a modular Mac
Pro looked like so what does this mean
for you are you guys going to wait for a
new iMac you're going to jump in and buy
a Mac Pro you're just like I don't I
don't carry more I've already already
left one of their thoughts on it tell me
in the comments located in order located
