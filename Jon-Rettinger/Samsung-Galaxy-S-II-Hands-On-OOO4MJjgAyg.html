like Pearlman here for TechnoBuffalo I'm
hanging out with a good old friend of
mine Phillip Byrne we used to work
together way back in the day didn't we
Phillip I seem to remember that yeah way
back in the day way back in the day
anyway what do you got in your hand
there I have the Sprint version of the
galaxy s2 this is our newest phone it's
the slimmest 4G phone available on
Sprint it's actually the slimmest 4G
phone on any network where you can find
it Philip tell me what are the most
compelling aspects of this new rocket
ship from Samsung it is very very fast
this is the fastest smartphone that I've
ever used it's got a 1.2 gigahertz dual
core Samsung Exynos processor you won't
find faster on the smartphone it's great
for running our awesome TouchWiz
interface it's great for playing games
and showing movies she's got an 8
megapixel camera it can shoot video in
1080p at high profiles which is similar
video quality to what you'll find on a
blu-ray disc and what frame rate would
that be
choose I don't know Mike it's got to be
30 frames alright it's gonna be
confirmed maybe 30 maybe 24 any of those
frame rates it could be you got a 50-50
shot 50-50 raffle at it yeah now I also
was wondering about the TouchWiz 4.0
what's new in that TouchWiz has an all
new interface design it's got these
widgets that are there they're very live
so they update over the Internet they're
close together so it has more of a
magazine like look and feel to it okay
so here we see some of the TouchWiz
interface as you can see we've improved
the widgets drawer on TouchWiz here's
the widgets and you get some very cool
motion features too you can
pay on the phone left and right and it
follows your motion there and we have
plenty of custom widgets available
you can also see here some of the motion
features
so with two fingers on the phone you can
zoom in or zoom out just by tilting the
phone and that works on photos and also
on webpages unnecessary zoom unnecessary
zoom one other differences between the
AT&amp;amp;T and the Sprint and the t-mobile can
we expect huh they all use the fastest
network available on the provider the
AT&amp;amp;T version is 4.3 inches to the screen
the Sprint and t-mobile version are 4.5
inches the AT&amp;amp;T and the Sprint versions
both use our 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
Samsung processor the t-mobile is using
a different dual-core processor when the
Sprint version you do have a 4G on and
off toggle which is always a popular
request on Sprint's 4G phones one thing
you'll also notice is that our widgets
our resizable so for instance
you can throw up a
not that one some of our widgets are
completely resizable
so here you can see you can sort of drag
that widget and make it larger and
smaller and that way you can see more or
less content and arrange your homescreen
how you like tell me about that camera
do we get auto focus I want to jump into
that camera because I'm loved cameras on
the camera guy you get eight megapixel
autofocus touch focus it's got a fully
customizable camera interface so you can
arrange your own shortcuts oh my god and
the camera it's the same on all three
phones yes same camera on all three
phones so here is the camera interface
as you can see we've got plenty of
features available we've got lots of
different shooting modes but one of the
things that I especially like about the
interface is that you can edit the
shortcuts on the camera so if you're
someone who switches shooting mode a lot
or if you often find yourself using
macro like I do you can just make those
dedicated shortcut buttons so that
they're always quickly available no
digging through the menus
is that thing thinner than my iPhone is
definitely thinner than whatever phone
you are using right now no way this is
the thinnest phone that you can buy I
promise it it's in a phone you can buy
within the next week until another
Android phone comes out and it's like as
thin as a piece of paper I don't think
that's gonna happen I don't see any
phone ever ever coming out that's better
than this phone that is a bold-faced lie
I'm probably long about that yeah so
let's do a little thin test here let's
hold it up to the camera and show
the supermodel you want to take home
with you that's the Adriana Lima and
there's just a lot of customizations
options on this phone too
you can make folders you can make
shortcuts you can put anything you like
down here in the frequently used app
drawer
and really do whatever you like with the
phone you can really make it yours it's
got some cool calling features so
there's lots of shortcuts with some
motion you can turn the phone face down
if you don't want to answer the call you
can set it even though there's no send
an end buttons you can answer a call by
hitting the HOME key or end the call by
hitting the power button if you want to
make a call quickly you just swipe to
one side and it jumps right to the call
or if you decide you want to send that
person the text message you just swipe
the other way and you're right into
sending them a new text message so
there's a lot of little shortcuts
throughout the phone that make it really
nice and convenient to use they just
showed us something on the screen a new
way a new way to socially interact as
far as aggregating contacts together
through different different online
social sites I've got no idea what
you're talking about but I don't either
that was too much cellphone mumbo-jumbo
one cool thing that it does have is it
has keys err okay tell me the phone
generates its own webpage so here we
have keys running off of this phone
and my samsung laptop here is connected
to keys so here you can see here's all
the photos I have on the phone
here are my ringtones I've got videos
that I've recorded on the phone or
stored on the phone my web bookmarks my
contacts my music all of the Samsung
Galaxy S 2's used an MHL port which is a
mobile high-definition link which means
that the USB port also doubles as HDMI
so as you can see we've got our gorgeous
TV up here and you can see whatever I do
on the phone screen I also do on the TV
itself so if you've got videos stored on
here you can show them over HDMI if you
record videos or if you got videos
stored or any of your photos or even if
you just want to play games up there on
the big screen you can do that with
these phones so I've been hanging out
with my good friend Phillip Byrne hi I'm
Mike Pearlman through TechnoBuffalo we
just looked at the Samsung Galaxy S to
be sure to go to TechnoBuffalo comm for
all of the galaxy s2 specs pictures
videos you name it wallpaper bedroom set
pillow cases until next time I'm gonna
see you guys in the wild
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
