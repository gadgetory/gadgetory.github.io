to you by citrix gotoassist
the number one global market leader and
remote support what's up everyone walk
back the pursuit of retinues riffs oh
it's kind of like riffs and rant so what
call Retin Jers rant diffs
i am fresh off the plane from the Apple
event I've been back in the office for
like 20 minutes and I got all kinds of
thoughts about what got announced and
why things only have one port and what
evolutionary revolutionary and what's
just another way to sell your stuff so
if you want to know what I think about
Apple products let's go ahead and jump
right in let's start with that new
MacBook so let me start with what it's
all about it's all about fitness it's
all about lightness and it's all about
portability which for me sounds exactly
like what the MacBook Air is all about
or at least was all about so why would
you buy a macbook air right now that
Apple just upgraded as well look at the
MacBook Air just like those bezels
they're huge
you've got a non Retina screen you look
at the MacBook that's got an almost
bezel as gorgeous Retina display you
don't have that on the MacBook now the
only the matchbooks out going for it is
a not mobile processor more configurable
options and more than a single port but
Apple's ever been afraid to cannibalize
their own product line with their own
products but I can't for the life of me
figure out what the appeal to a MacBook
Air is now why would I will do that to
their entire product line so moral being
if you're good-looking about getting a
MacBook Air I'd probably wait a few
months until it gets updated to look
like the MacBook we're gonna go away
with it or maybe the Mac what's gonna go
away I don't know
but speaking of MacBook let's talk about
IO shall we input/output and I guess I'm
done to put a plural there they're not
inputs or outputs it's just just a
single single USB type-c port so this
it's all about portability it's all
about travel it's all about a wireless
world like I get that and I get that
it's for the future more thing you're
gonna use USB see I understand all that
but in the world right now where you're
gonna buy the new MacBook it's gonna be
available what April 10th or so in the
US how many USB type-c things you have
is your thumb drive USB type-c or
external hard drives USB type-c I'm just
gonna wager life you like me they are
probably not so you're gonna need a lot
of adapters to go with that think of
port so you're gonna have to buy if you
just want a USB port like a normal USB
port 20 bucks if you're gonna want to
plug in a monitor that's $80 adapter but
you're also getting a USB port on there
and then another USB type-c port so
that's cool my fear and worry is if I'm
traveling to an event what if I forget
an adapter what if I lose an adapter
what if I
heaven forbid want to plug in an SD card
to get pictures off of an event I'm not
sure what you do in that situation you
got to make sure that you are carrying
accessories after accessories to go with
your computer this argument might sound
very familiar remember the very first
MacBook there had a little door the pop
down single USB port it was annoying but
at least that had a separate charging
ports to go with it you didn't charge
through that as well so if you're out of
juice and you also want to plug in a
thumb drive you don't have an adapter
you sir madam are screwed it's a very
tough pill to swallow and taking all
that out outside it's got a mobile
processor in it I'm sure it'll be fine
for like emails and they'll be fine for
watching videos not sure about what's
gonna do with 4k videos despite having a
retina splay I don't know yet you can
pretty much take gaming at the equation
I can certainly take any significance
from a video editing out and anything
maybe it's not iMovie is that out of the
equation
Photoshop probably at the equation - at
least you have to worry and think twice
about we're gonna use that computer for
words you don't maybe with something
like current generation MacBook Air and
certainly the MacBook Pro what it does
have going for it is oh it's so pretty
looking it is so nice and impossibly
thin if I can sound a little cliche the
trackpad is awesome you can push it
harder or softer and vibrates it's great
Apple made a big deal about the keyboard
with the new butterfly mechanism but the
reason that they had to make a new
mechanism because things too thin to
have a normal keyboard clicking 'us so
you don't have that same throw that you
have with the normal keyboard it's so
fine you push a is gonna show up but you
don't get that gun
satisfying quickie
type feel that you're gonna get I have
no way to think about this new MacBook
I'm excited to get it in and try it
the colors certainly look nice but it is
a very expensive experiment for Apple
and I'm not sure what its gonna do to
the MacBook Air stop real fast thank our

since everybody loves free stuff if you

March 31st you sir madam will get a free
Galaxy Tab 4 as well but that wouldn't
do anything that Apple talking about
they talked about the Apple watch
obviously and I had a chance to play
with all three versions of the Apple
watch first like you I was kind of
floored by the price I got a few
concerns first what's the upgrade cycle
gonna be is it gonna be every year I
looked online the Apple watch I would
get there was the price wasn't an option
is almost $1200 for just a regular Apple
watch with a pretty cool looking steel
band that is a lot of money for a watch
that's going to be obsolete presumably
in 12 to 16 months the sport looks great
it's less expensive you get the same
functionality you should get 2 bands in
the box that might be the better way to
go for a value proposition if you can
give it's a value what I don't
understand about the watch at least as
it is right now there's nothing
revolutionary about it doesn't do
anything really that Android wear
doesn't do save for being able to maybe
send little drawings to your friends or
send your heartbeat to your friends or
someone else that has an Apple watch I'm
not sure what the reason to get it is
yet
there isn't that killer app that's gonna
push app mass adoption now what it does
it does very well the UI is super smooth
it looks really nice the screen is
gorgeous you know they say you're gonna
get keen hours battery life which is
nice it's got a magnetic charger it's
got a lot of stuff going for it but
there isn't that killer feature and I
think phones for a lot of people are
almost sort of a necessity nowadays and
I say light necessity obviously the food
shelter that cast up a real necessities
but a watch doesn't fall in that
category
so I'm wondering what Apple's going to
do and how they're going to dress that
to get people to try and migrate over
maybe the profit margins are so huge
maybe I only need one out of every 400
iPhone users to buy an Apple watch I
don't know or maybe there are eight
cycles gonna be two years maybe they're
not making much this year but its
component costs come down next year
it'll be a huge profit for them I I
don't know what that's gonna be most of
Apple's new products have been a way to
sell you more apps soon believe you'd be
able to buy more apps put on your watch
and that's where they're gonna make
money sort of a Trojan horse model but
I'm not sure what the use case is for
the watch yet it looks really pretty I'm
excited to test it if I was looking to
get one you know would I I don't know
for 1,200 bucks not only could I buy a
brand new unlocked Nexus 6
I could buy like eight android wear
device and find one that works well for
me so it's gonna be a value to you and
what's sort of worth it or not if there
was an idea that Apple products are
premium and expensive the Apple watch is
only gonna push that notion way further
than perhaps before I'm really curious
though if it's going to sell or how it's
gonna sell it's gonna have line inside
the Apple Store or after that initial
launch if people are going to jump on
board with it I just don't know the
answer but like you I'm probably pretty
curious to see what it's going to be
what do you guys think you want the new
MacBook do you think it's silly with one
port is it awesome to you it's the Apple
watch like your next thing it's gonna be
on your wrist I'd really be curious to
hear your thoughts on it cuz I'm not
sure what I think about him yet and I've
had a chance to see them both in person
and if you like the video please give it
