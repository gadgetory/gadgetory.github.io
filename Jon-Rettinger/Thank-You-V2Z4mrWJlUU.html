for lakers calm I think this video is
very long overdue I really just want to
extend it thank you to the YouTube
community I know everybody says this and
they think that they're their viewers
and subscribers with the best but I
really believe it you guys are
absolutely fantastic supporting me in my
videos as I stumbled at the beginning
slowly improved and as I'm still
struggling now and supporting their
website and supporting all the endeavors
now the things I'm trying you know I
really can't thank you guys enough it's
one thing to to try and fail but at
least you know you tried and you know if
your guys's help I think that's
everything that we're working on can
really be a success can help give people
a platform to express their technology
views and help give me a platform to
express my opinions none of the other
thing I've accomplished could be done
without you guys and I will never ever
ever forget that I know that the mana
subscribers and viewers are small
compared to other people but to me it
means a lot and I really just want to
extend a thank you to you guys I'm going
to be out of town for four days today is
Friday September excuse me Thursday
September fourth I'm going to be out of
