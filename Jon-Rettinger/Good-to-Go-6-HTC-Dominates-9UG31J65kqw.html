to another good to go from Oakland
California I'm Noah Kravitz
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo calm
and I'm James Kendrick from ZDNet mobile
news James Hardie it today what's going
on I'm good it's Thursday Thursday's are
the good day before friday exactly
exactly well let's just dive into it
since we seem to have a time problem
there's too much to talk about trying to
keep the sting to it you know to a
reasonable length each week we were we
were talking about talking about HTC and
then you were talking about how you just
got an HTC device so i don't know let's
talk about HTC HTC in the middle you see
ya apparently they're big apparently
they're popular they're making money
yeah that is just came out just
yesterday that their market cap is
bigger than nokia and that i mean those
of us who cover this is this industry
know that that is just absolutely huge
and that surprised everybody yeah yeah i
mean we all new HTC is big and they're
growing and they're the number one
android phone maker and and they've
grown phenomenally in the last five
years but that is you chubby adam or cap
is now bigger than ben ramen blackberry
and Nokia I mean they're they're they're
big and you know what's really
impressive to me about it is that
they've done it all without their own
platform right brain they did it right
they they they got a strategy of giving
that sense in her face you know that's
very distinctive looking yep we all know
an HTC phone when we see it right and
that's all they wanted they wanted to
create their own brand and wow they good
ya know they've really they've done a
mean I've been a fan of theirs you know
for a while and I think what they're
doing i don't know how much a part of it
it plays but i think what they're doing
with their marketing as well you know
running their own marketing campaigns
with their whole theme you know you
campaign
and TV and web and print bus stop ads
and whatever it's getting the name out
there and and I'm not you know on the
one hand i'm not i'm not a marketing
analyst kind of guys so i don't know how
much of an impact that has i don't know
if people walk into the store and say i
want to see an HTC phone because i saw
the ad on TV on the other hand they're
doing something right because you know
they're they're like you said that the
market cap news just kind of stunning
but also well I want to say not
surprising but it is still surprising
that that they're you know they I mean
bigger than nokia whatever whatever
issues no key is having you know
currently I mean they're a giant so so
that that is huge and you know I think I
think you hit it on the head that
Android has probably done for them you
know Android sort of fueled Motorola's
come back and in some ways and you can
say Android kind of breed second life
into sony ericsson and androids done a
lot for a lot of lot of carriers but for
HTC HTC wasn't struggling but they
really like you said with sense you know
it's an HTC phone they were working on
since before this but you know with
Android it really just they were able to
really kind of execute what seemed like
the vision they kind of had for it all
along now we're going to see when the
flyer ships or near the evo view is
Prince going to call it will see you
android on a tablet and yeah you know
it's a interface with the same since
interface right right exactly they're
brilliant their their their plan is
worked really well and I knew that
Brandon was working when about I don't
know a couple months ago my teenage son
you know who normally doesn't care about
any of this stuff I mean he just wants
to text on his phone and that's it right
and but I'm always getting phones in for
review you know there for every day it
seems like and delivery came and I am
packed if I was just starting to play
with it he said all the sudden HTC phone
huh and that's when I knew when the
radiators say I nah I'm
I'm familiar with HTC right right I mean
that's a big deal because all android
phones i think this is one of the
problems that that a lot of people have
with it i mean even though samsung's big
in android probably almost as big as HTC
and motorola as you mentioned i mean
they're all the out there but nothing is
that distinctive when you see one of
their phones right now right you go I
said angel it just kind of looks like
back a lot of people think that stopped
pretty stocked Android is ugly you know
just like right and and and whether you
do or not you know I I think that's a
it's a really good point that that
people who are really in the know people
who really follow this stuff can tell a
samsung android phone from an LG or from
a motorola but a lot of people can't and
especially since Motorola's backed off
of their whole their whole blur system
uber yes cuz it was big blur you know
there's sort of more you more and more
commodified now it's a it's a thin
lightweight phone running android and
you know to the to the consumer going
into the verizon store or the AT&amp;amp;T store
or whatever at the AT&amp;amp;T probably puts it
the t-mobile store would have you you
know they kind of look the same but an
HTC phones an HTC phone and people get
that similarly you know i have a family
member who just got their first
smartphone and wound up going with the
droid incredible which at this point is
not a new phone anymore but they wanted
to be on verizon it was free on contract
you know free with an upgrade because
it's been out for a while it says it
price always good price and in a lot of
ways it's sort of i mean this was the
phone back before verizon had an iphone
when people would say to me i really
want an iphone but I'm on Verizon what
should i do and i would say either wait
or getting
edible because you know to me that was
the one that offered that sort of
similar blend of style features camera
web browser and for my money was the
most kind of consumer friendly android
phone out there because of sense so yeah
there's definitely something to that
it'll be interesting to see you know
there's news earlier this week that
Motorola is working on a platform of
their own you know that that's kind of
come and gone with HTC a little bit talk
about that I don't necessarily see it
happening but I'll interesting to see
what happens with that HTC this you know
supporting win phone seven but is that
really going to go anywhere or is it
really just going to be about making
Android their own as they've been doing
and just building on that success well I
think the way that they position
themselves that one of the reasons it's
so brilliant is that it doesn't matter
because there they are going to come out
of windows phone 7 the same way as they
did windows mobile that they're doing
with Android make the interface distinct
it no matter what and then it doesn't
matter if the platform I mean they they
can't abandon a platform today right and
it doesn't really affect them as far as
their branding right right it's great
they've done it just brilliant the other
way the way they've done it it and that
hit me home when you were told my the
HTC incredible with your family member
because we are very familiar with what's
the latest version of Android or the OS
or this or that the people on the street
weeks we've we've noted in past shows
don't they don't really care right but
the HTC incredible interface with that
sense you know definite look yeah to it
yep looks just like the new ones so they
don't care race is a new phone right yep
you know but it's it's it's a great
strategy that yeah it really is and
another thing about them just kind of
turned into the HTC lovefest episode
here but they make a really good
keyboard I have always loved their
keyboards and this keyboard this is the
this is the arrived the windows home 74
okay this keyboard isn't that much
different than the touch pro 2 keyboard
that came out a couple years ago and
that phone was a huge phone but you know
have this full five row qwerty board
with the you know the offset spacing and
just little things like the larger space
bar and and you know shift and function
latkes with lights and just those little
touches that they've always you know
they've always for my money paid
attention to that sort of they make good
cables for detail they make they make a
keyboards and I just sent the HTC EVO
shift back yesterday and that had a nice
keyboard too i really like Ted keyboard
yep yep there also you know that there I
i was thinking back to we're talking
about amazon recently and all the
different things Amazon's have been
doing you know HTC now is starting to
build their own media offerings into
things the the flyer you know is going
to have the gaming service built in and
I forget the name of the company they
acquired a media company recently you
know that I am I'll be interested to see
if this shakes out and it may well not
but you know there's definitely
something of a trend towards and again
Android is kind of leveled the playing
field in some ways these devices now all
have a certain level of spec and feature
set that's more than enough for the mass
consumer and so rather than looking at
you know oh we got to get a decent
camera on there or it finally has you
know a full web browser that kind of
thing everything has these has these
features now so what else can you build
in and you know a music store streaming
video gaming services you know whatever
other things they are and and it'll be
interesting to see if Amazon you know if
this really comes with a piece of Amazon
hardware with these services built
around at the sort of challenge Apple's
model HTC might be in a position to do
that sort of thing if it if it if it's
the right move for the
just based on a couple little moves
they've made recently that I noticed
when they were launching the flyer in
particular well they're big enough and
their global enough something I mean I
think they're certainly feeling out
things I mean who knows where this all
going to go you you mentioned cameras a
few minutes ago if I did have to slap
them around a little bit right right
they need some work in the area of
cameras because I don't find that their
cameras are quite as good as some of the
competitors right right with that yeah
that's hardware wise that's probably the
only consistent complaint right what's
the best what's the best camera phone
out there for your money you know I have
I seem to have the best luck with
Samsung models I mean just in general
but I'll say that there they just I
don't know their autofocus is
outstanding is I mean I cover even even
the galaxy tab which actually that's
where we first met out of the HP webos
event right I covered that whole event
in video using the galaxy tab camera oh
that's right that's right I being it was
incredible i mean fact the the HP e PR
folks who you know who we're presenting
all this stuff we're really watching
this out of it alive you know their eyes
breasts if you can well it must be
better than we thought right good what
she could do that doing it just with
that yeah right anyway but wow where
there's our time again all right the the
we're approaching the shot buzzer and
anything and anything of you know extra
special importance going on on the blog
right now well no this is the same most
of review and stuff i'll be reviewing
the a thunderbolt when it comes along i
I just reviewed a a budget android
tablet which is I'm fine that's pretty
good the identity tab okay so Wi-Fi only
for 29
I in right it's pretty full featured for
that price again just typical business
as usual I'm actually and this might
speak to my still lingering Android
burnout from last summer I'm actually
really excited to get the the new
samsung android phone for boost because
it's it's smaller 3.2 inch screen i
thing it has access to the android
market 50 bucks a month unlimited voice
and data and then they've got this thing
where with boost if you pay your bill on
time six months in a row i think it is
your monthly fee gets knocked down five
bucks that's pretty cool yeah so
apparently it can go all the way down
that I think it's $35 a month if you've
paid your bill on time for 18 months in
a row I guess it'll get knocked down
that far but you know even 50 bucks a
month unlimited for a full-on smartphone
you know it's a lot cheaper than what a
verizon or AT&amp;amp;T is asking to run you
know an iphone or a top of the line
android phone so i'm kind of excited for
that just to see if I you know I don't
know to see if somebody like me could
see how good the network is yeah right
it doesn't matter if there's not enough
bandwidth for everybody but yeah also I
iphone users on AT&amp;amp;T have been putting
up with it for several years now and
still ranking highly and all the surveys
seriously alright James for for people
who want to check out that that tablet
review you mentioned and everything else
you're up to what's the what's the URL
for the blog it's zdnet com / blog /
mobile dash news terrific and folks know
technobuffalo com for whenever I get
that boost phone we put a review up
there and get some other mobile phone
reviews that went up this past week so

will we'll have to think about doing it
again next week yeah let's do alright
