recommend the Palm Pre to you are we
gonna see an Apple TV no doubt they've
got the set all ready to go
Windows Phone 7 has tremendous potential
when you hold it up to your face you can
start to get a profile what that's gonna
look like it looks silly and see myself
going to an Apple store saying hey let
me check out the new slate so yeah I was
wrong
so for the past 12 years up and sitting
in some version of this chair talking to
you guys reviewing electronics and
during those 12 years I've had the
privilege take a look at tons of tech
products when I review something did a
vacuum I'm reading a product in 2008
it's only frame reference I have I was
able to find some videos of things that
have changed companies that went
sideways that I never could have
predicted at that time so I humbly
present to you my five biggest mistakes
I've ever made on YouTube do I recommend
the Palm Pre 100% I can recommend the
Palm Pre to you but when I thought about
mistakes the first thing that came to my
head was back in 2009 with the Palm Pre
I haven't been that many phones and I
was crazy hyped about I mean when John
Rubinstein took that CES stage and
showed what webOS was it was amazing and
I still think that's one of the greatest
keynotes
I have ever seen and I could not wait to
get my hands on it it used card based
multitasking I'm sure it's something
like that sounds familiar
had a slide-out keyboard capacitive
touchscreen it had a gesture area it was
a first one I can remember that offered
inductive charging it had this
touchstone charger it was an optional
accessory to buy afterwards but it works
and it works well in wireless charging
back in 2009 seemed crazy futuristic
this was the first true competitor to
the iPhone and in a myriad ways was
better than what Apple was offering
so again benefit of hindsight Paul made
a few really big mistakes it proved to
be catastrophic first launching was
sprint one of the smallest carriers in
the u.s. at the time probably a mistake
but the bigger mistake was the ad
campaign that went along with the Palm
Pre that was the most cringy weird ad
campaign that said nothing about what
was a really revolutionary device there
were huge build quality issues again I
had to get three before I found one that
worked and if you go back and watch
really almost any
initial Pomfrey review they are
glaringly positive I give it on a one to
five scale I get the pump for you really
really really solid four or three
quarters people love these devices but
consumers didn't know what it was they
really know what smartphones are they
were that much at a time it was kind of
the iPhone or Blackberry it's something
that the advertisement campaign could
have come in educated people and they
completely missed the boat I think in
the long run Windows Phone 7 is going to
be a tremendous competitor to Android
and iOS I think it's sort of a nice
in-between so a year after palm
introduced webOS so in 2010 Microsoft
entered the mobile OS game with Windows
Phone 7 I was actually at the launch and
I remember when they handed me my HTC
and LG made Windows Phones
and these things looked amazing and
unlike any other phones I have seen this
lie of tile interface give you
information at a glance you could
customize the tiles
I thought Internet Explorer Mobile was
actually a pretty good browser and it
was the time for dogged me in the
comments when the greatest things I
think that Windows Phone had going for
it there on-screen keyboard was
ridiculously amazing the windows
marketplace I thought was gonna be a
burgeoning app ecosystem it didn't
launch with very many he was oddly
tightly integrated with Facebook but the
absent I use I could get either first
party or a third party app that did the
same thing I went on camera and I said
if you're looking to get a new
smartphone I think you owe it to
yourself to at least look at Windows
Phone 7 because you might be surprised
it feels very I guess unlike rasathi
maybe the biggest problem was an app
support that I thought was going to come
never came and sort of a weird issue
that popped up was Microsoft bought
Nokia so the nokia started making
windows phones
and you're LG's and Samsung HTC didn't
want to compete if it was essentially
was a Microsoft company that was making
Windows Phone hardware so they started
to bow out but Windows Phone was around
for a long time they didn't kill it
until 2017 got Windows Phone 10 and they
were all versions of good and you could
see the vision that was supposed to be
there just never took off with Microsoft
hoped and speaking of that last word Pro
I'm still not sure what's Pro here all
right so for a more reason miss 2015 on
the launch of the original iPad pro and
that bit pro was definitely not what it
is right now there was only one version
it was twelve point nine inches and that
seemed absolutely ridiculous to me
running iOS it was sort of the first
taste we saw of Apple's sort of tablet
as a PC vision but it was very clearly
not there yet but I wanted to try it I
wanted to use it as my only computer so
I was actually flying to Germany I was
doing a video with BMW at the time so I
took it with me trying to use it on
airplanes was unwieldy trying to
communicate and do all my email and type
that et was fine when I do actual
computer stuff it started to fall behind
then I couldn't wrap my head around a
twelve point nine inch tablet I didn't
see a use for it
I thought it was too big and running a
phone os that didn't make any sense on
something that size well I think where I
started to really see the benefit
of the largest ring size when sort of
iOS gave it more tablet e and dedicated
computer features not necessarily iPad
OS but it could do more than the iPhone
could when the current gen iPad pro hit
with thinner bezels and the hole size
shrunk down the screen size say the same
but face ID can when the
second-generation Apple pencil came out
that's when it felt good and it started
to see the power for what it could be
and kind of now what it is with iPad OS
it was a it was kind of a long ish
evolution to get its apples vision I
just didn't see it at a time so a 5 inch
tablet when you hold it up to your face
you can start to get a profile what
that's going to look like it looks silly
so do you think back on the very first
phablet and I still maintain that I said
phablet first on camera before anybody
but you probably think the Galaxy Note
that was not the first one Dell actually
made the first phablet it's called the
Dell Streak at least the first phablet
that I reviewed it was 5 inches with
gigantic bezels and it looked ridiculous
Dell had no idea what it was how to
market it they were like you could use
it as a GPS in your car you can maybe
use as a tablet that makes phone calls
they didn't know what to do with it but
I knew I wanted to try it so I put that
phone in my pocket giant bezels and all
and I walked around using it I remember
I was in business school at a time and I
met with my professor and I took it out
because my wife was calling me and he
laughed out loud like a guttural laugh
and then pointed at me like what are you
doing you are a crazy crazy human and
it's hard to look back and be like why
would anybody question a 5 inch phone
back then phones were 3.5 inches
generally speaking so this thing was
ginormous and that I had gigantic bezels
on top of that but the line died a very
quick death but I still maintain the
Dell Streak was an amazing tablet I
believe I said that people should
consider it and buy it
and that was probably not accurate
because the Galaxy Note line was coming
and that was gonna be the phablet to get
that was a phone first that could also
be a tablet the streak was a tablet that
could make phone calls that in hindsight
probably not the way to go for the most
part I'm pretty ambivalent towards the
watch it's like I was toward the Android
where this ambivalence comes with a
really hefty price maybe one of my
biggest like swings and misses 2015 and
the Apple watch came out I was at the
keynote saw Tim Cook on stage debut it
and generally I can get super pumped and
hyped for these products the keynotes
I was like who why is somebody going to
want this I was super invested and in
love with my moto 360 running Android
wear like that was a jam it was round I
don't care about the stupid flat tire it
had it looked awesome and I said very
publicly that Android wear was amazing
and it was gonna be what people should
use and every watch should have Android
wear and clearly that was also another
miss but the Apple watch for me was
nothing a more a notification machine
and was kind of funny was the things I
knocked on the Apple watch for just
being notifications and kind of slow
running apps or still the case on the
Apple watch but I'm big enough man I
could admit him miss on that because I
love my Apple watch and I think what
sold me on it
as time passed and generations went by
was the health features that got
built-in obvious I'd love you can close
the ring something that launched the
watch but as more features God had it
became more of a part of my day
something I would just look at to see
who what's calling me so I miss on the
Apple watch
also a miss on Android wear but I still
maintain I was dead right about the Moto
360 being amazing and the greatest
SmartWatch that was ever made so I had a
blast looking back
at these old videos cringing at myself
and what it looked like and all that
kind of fun stuff but also the benefit
of hindsight now looking back she alter
my perspective a little bit about videos
I'm doing now so looking at 1 plus 7 Pro
I gonna be sitting here in five years
being like wow we didn't know what was
gonna happen to a company like oneplus
you know saying we didn't know what the
iPad was going to be and now it's my
only computer that I use in three or
four years looking at the past got me
thinking about the future and sort of
reevaluating how I look at products
maybe coming out of a vacuum a little
bit more and trying to see a bigger
picture so I think in that aspect can
learn for the mistakes I hope you guys
had fun kind of coming along with me
they went through the time machine of
tech mistakes past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
