revealed phase 2 of Tesla's master plan
if you were scratching your head saying
I didn't know they had a plan 1 you were
not alone it's been around for actually
about 10 years and lives on Tesla's
website but here's what plan 1 was step
1 built a super expensive low volume
electric car they did that with the
Roadster step 2 was using proceeds from
the roadster to build a more affordable
family sale car did that with the Model
S and the third step in Tesla's phase 1
master plan was to build a way more
affordable mass transit car for everyone
at Tesla is doing that with the model 3
so now it is time for phase 2 and if you
don't know Tesla's goal has always been
to promote sustainable fuel not
necessarily to always make money and
people buy their own Tesla's that's why
they release all their patents publicly
so the goal with phase 2 is to address
all the different modes of terrestrial
transportation as you know I must put it
in a holy crap did they do it so here's
what to expect from Tesla's phase tube
master plans first the Solar City merger
makes a lot more sense
Elon wants beautiful solar roofs on all
houses of zouma be connected to Tesla
battery packs on the car side that's
where things got interesting not
surprisingly more body styles based on
the model 3 architecture so we'll see a
crossover SUV and we'll see a new type
of pickup truck don't know what that
means but pickup truck powered by
electricity coming soon
Elon then went on to address other modes
of mass transportation things like buses
there'll be a test love bus and it will
also be a test about big rig both of
which are expected to make their debut
sometime next year leasing design forum
hit the road sometime in the next three
to four years and speak in the next
three to four years
that is when Elon Musk claims cars will
be fully autonomous meeting you can just
go to sleep in the back and Tesla's got
some plans for full autonomy essentially
if you want a car to come pick you up
you all put the test lap and one of
Tesla's own fleet of cars will just
drive up pick you up take you where you
want to go if you are a Tesla or do you
want to make some money from your car
you can actually let your car join that
pool so while you're at work your car
didn't just make its own uber pick
people up and come back
and you can make some money from it I
don't know how I personally feel about
safe and someone else sitting in my car
and how they would treat it but it's an
option to make some money now from your
automobile along playing people me
driving their card but 10 to 12 percent
of the time and the rest of it just
kinda sitting there doing nothing so a
ton of Tesla news as a huge fan of
electric transport as a huge fan of
Tesla in general I am super excited what
do you guys think about phase 2 of you
interested in any of this it's
fascinating to see and if you're not a
fan of Tesla or a fan of musk this sort
of kind of musk said of my own mosque to
start to see it electric transport gain
more and more footing it's just really
cool to sort of be a part of that kind
of revolution alright guys let me know
in the comments down below
mash the thumbs up but we appreciate it
John renders TechnoBuffalo you guys the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
