to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of ask the
Buffalo me rose jon rettinger stew show
where you can ask me any question you've
got the world of technology whether you
don't know what phone to get you catch
me some personal questions you could ask
me why it only rains on every other
Tuesday in Scotland and I will pretend
to know the answer of this week we
talked about Apple's latest OS 10
Yosemite the best android phone ever a
few personal questions and Android wear
versus pebbles that's the Buffalo it's
going to get started first questions
comes from Twitter at Red Sox 2009 asked
at John for lakers what feature an OS 10
Yosemite will be the most useful for you
and your business so I've been running
OS 10 Yosemite for about two two and a
half weeks now I use an imac at the
office i use it for video editing
everything that i do but the past like
five months it's had really bad Wi-Fi
issues it would disconnect from Wi-Fi
about every sometimes 10 to 25 minutes
which in my line of work just really are
things like uploading videos having
skype calls all become next to
impossible i bought applecare on it so
I've gone through apple support and they
couldn't figure out what it was they
know if it was hard where they know for
the software nothing would fix the issue
so I don't think was a good time to buy
a new computer there's nothing really
new out and I couldn't justify the cost
by in your computer just didn't need one
so I figured in my last-ditch effort
I'll install OS 10 Yosemite and see if
maybe its software maybe it'll fix it
and lo and behold it completely fix a
problem which is awesome that' fix it
i'm also super annoying because if you
fix a problem to just software why the
hell wouldn't apple just push a fix they
know it was an issue it's a known issue
if you look at the forums for late-2012
imac Wi-Fi issues there's just a ton of
stuff going on so annoying on that end
but very happy that feels how many fixes
but also let me use Yosemite which in
all honesty other than some different
fonts the doc looking different I have
noticed any difference at all which I
guess it's a good thing I've had no
third-party app compatibility she was I
don't use all that many third-party apps
but I've had zero issues I've had zero
crashes I haven't had any problems with
it
at all I was really excited about dark
mode but my estimation just looks like
the universe of colors and really look
like that much of a big deal I like the
Notification Center they're kind of
widgets on the side other than that
though it just looks like OS 10 with few
new features there I have to use
continuity though which is really kind
of cool when I've got my sim card on my
iPhone that worked super well gonna make
calls and all that kind of stuff was
really handy I have that chance to play
with four yet at least beta for free Oh
70th installed i'm using it today i
would have to get to use it and more
things come out i'll be sure to share
them with you so really the moral is if
you're thinking about trying yosemite
when the public beta comes out you know
be aware there might be some bugs but
it's worked out pretty well for me next
question comes from chow Ryan who asked
at John for lakers is the LG g3 the
greatest Android phone ever made why did
the review of the g3 in my estimation I
thought it was the best phone I have
ever tested but then Brandon mark
reviewed the oneplus one and they
freaking love that thing I didn't
interview on it so I can't really say
whether it is or not but my estimation
right now today if you're going to buy a
phone it's a really hard pressed to find
something better than the LG g3 it's got
the camera it's got the screen got the
design it's got the OS the power the RAM
and then you could want in a smartphone
it has it you know if you really
dead-set on apple and obviously talking
to be for you or windows home but you're
looking at some sort of android phone or
you're open to other os's i think still
it's the best one on the market next
question comes from add to the tech guy
69 who asks at jump for lakers but i
want to meet you in person how can i do
that well you can go to the events that
we go to CES is the next big one coming
up we're going to be at comic-con that's
the great place you can just you know
find out where i'm going to be silly
message on Twitter and we're happy to
come and meet you if you're in Southern
California we've brought folks to the
office to come by and say hi before I
love the chance to meet fellow geek so
I've ever seen me out and about please
stop by and say hi tapped me on the
shoulder billig a lake your sucker your
face is stupid whatever it is just stop
by and say hi but that's probably the
best way to get this a guy in person
next question comes from at sitio one
marshall who asked at john for lakers we
passed a technobuffalo legacy down to
nathan nathan is my son and my answer on
that is
nope if you want to be successful in
life he's got to work for it doesn't
think you can just come work for dad and
have a job I know some people probably
can disagree fundamentally with that
every parenting style is different but
in my mind he's got to go to college has
got to get a degree and got to prove
that he can be an asset to either my
company or another company and then
perhaps he could work here or wherever
you know ever might be at the time but
I'm not just going to give it to him to
got my same last name that's not fair I
think that can sort of promote kind of
laziness and hurt motivation I want him
to be as successful as he can be on his
own merit not relying on what his dad
has done to quick second to thank our
friends at GoDaddy want to remind you to
put your website to work while you go

just enter promo code 199 techno a check
out that's all one word but dunno some
limitations may apply so check out the
website for rest of those details no
back to the questions now back to tech
system comes from Josh hey John what
will this new office we detect no
Buffalo the kernofs doesn't have it just
sets for shows or could we see new shows
in the new space so we're moving offices
we might have seen some pictures on it
come up construction is underway right
now or about halfway through we should
be in sometime middle of September's
early October then probably another
month to get all the studios and stuff
built up so people are asking why we're
moving will first got Lisa's up in our
current space we are outgrowing the
space where in which is a good problem
to have we've hired more people I want
to hire more people in the future so we
need sort of more space there and also
we're filming right now there's a lot of
outside like I mean you can't see it but
they're sore office light over there
there's natural light coming in from
over there we have stirred can write
with set studio lights sort of facing
right at me so our new office is going
to have a studio built right into it we
can dress about six different sets so
for all the revision three shows sort of
other unboxings will have actual sets
which I hope will serve up the
production quality I'm really really
excited about I just make the videos
look like I always imagined dick look in
my head and we can control all the
lighting you know we brought run on
about six months ago and that sort of
helped with videos becoming you so much
to combat outside lighting and outside
noises and all that kind of stuff
it should be really helpful the hope is
that we can bring on maybe some other
new video producers in addition to
marking myself and create new shows and
new ideas the studio gives effects going
to do that okay adult intra question
last question comes from at such in
button all who asked hey John how does
the LG G watch the Samsung Galaxy gear
live compared to the pebble series of
smartwatches do you think pebble can
still compete with all the upcoming
SmartWatch with Android wear so on paper
just looking at android we're watching
the google i/o keynote or watching
videos on android where you think not a
chance that we can compete andrea where
blows it away but that you start using
android where you realize there's not
that much that it does right now so kind
of to aunt two-part answer first right
now I think pebble is definitely
superior smart watching notifications or
what's important to you and beyond that
pebble works with iOS and Android wear
right now Android only when it comes to
android wear the future though I think
is gonna be the hands of developers
developers put out a lot of apps for it
maybe get some more Google enough
functionality perhaps it was a reach
even cross OS support i think android
wear could far surpass what pebble can
do in its current state but as it stands
right now pebbles a better value and you
does more so out a SmartWatch the next
five six months pebbles still a great
way to go poof adult answer question
