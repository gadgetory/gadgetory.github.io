up a camera in your home and nests
recent acquisition of Dropcam last year
shows that people are pretty interested
in doing so well what happens if you
take that just one step further you wind
up with the guardzilla and all-in-one
home security system i'm our percenter
with TechnoBuffalo
let's see if the guardzilla really is
the king of the cams I was really
excited to review this thing as you
might have seen in my videos I have two
dogs and we've been looking for a way to
watch them when we're not home they have
a tendency to get into some naughty
behaviors so I headed home with the
guardzilla and I excitedly told my wife
all cool things that it did and I was
really really stoked I plugged it in
opened up the app after downloading it
and I was greeted with this this is this
is what the guardzilla app looks like on
Android and it doesn't look all that
much better on iOS so I'm standing there
thinking to myself oh god this is not
looking good already but I talked to
myself like okay got to give this thing
a fair shake
so I set aside how awful it looked I
went ahead with the setup it was fairly
straightforward enough to set up and
once I was able to do it I was able to
see the feed from the camera on my phone
while I was on the same network but as
soon as I change the quality level on
the camera from medium to max it stopped
working altogether and it took
completely uninstalling the guardzilla
app in order to get it working again
that was pretty representative of the
kind of experience that the guardzilla
offers the device itself the hardware is
fine I guess it's not terribly
unassuming so it's definitely gonna look
a little weird in your living room it's
got this like black sort of weird alien
feel it does have a micro SD card slot
on the back for capturing a few days of
video at a time but the video quality is
like really bad terrible security camera
footage when you put that side-by-side
with video from a Dropcam it's
astoundingly bad like really bad here
I'll show you some video from the
guardzilla versus some video from here
in the TechnoBuffalo
office where a handful of our colleagues
fell over while playing around and that
was taken on a drop cam
everything on this thing from the app to
the hardware is just well below par and
it's just so disappointing I I genuinely
wasn't able to get it working for long
enough to be able to test out some of
the more robust features of the thing
like motion sensing or pet ignoring
motion sensing it'll pay attention to it
to your pets and it won't set off the
motion sensor if it knows that it's them
it's got an alarm siren and it's got
Auto arming because the thing is
intended to be a security device the
thing is just the app is so poorly
designed and developed that the password
field things like this the password
field is revealed by default the login
asks for four different fields of
information to log you in and logging in
with another phone is an affair that
demands that you're on the same Wi-Fi
network ask the camera itself so if
you're out or someone uses multiple
phones like I do and you're not
connected to your Wi-Fi network you
can't log in to the guardzilla service
seriously if you guys know me well
enough which I think at this point you
should you'll know that I'm a pretty
savvy guy so it takes something pretty
bad for me to not be able to get it
working properly if you're in the market
for something in this vein do yourself a
favor spend the extra 80 bucks and get a
drop pan given that it's only a hundred
bucks I suppose I can't really expect
all that much but I'm certainly not
going to be using this thing as a camera
in my home much less as an actual
security measure
bottom line redesign your app man
redesign it from the ground up then try
again I'm sorry it wasn't a terribly
positive review this time around you
guys but they can't all be winners thank
you guys so much for watching if you
enjoyed this video you can go and hit
that like button down below of course
you can also subscribe if you'd like our
intern ibin here to accompany me to your
house for a fun choir of singing
otherwise again thank you guys for
watching be kind to one another and I'll
catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
