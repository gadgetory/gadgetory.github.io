CES 2017 has come to a close and when
you guys were at home I was in Las Vegas
pretending I didn't have a cold there
was a ton of stuff we saw that God
announced the highlight for me was
definitely the automotive front there
was a ton of autonomous cars that were
showing off and announced but the best
fancy and perhaps most vaporware eous of
them all came from faraday future and
their FF 91 this thing looks to be a
beast if there's an automotive future
technology chances are this has it got a
Tesla beating 130 kilowatt hour battery
it's got a range of almost 400 82 miles
assuming you're driving at 55 miles
straight it's got over a thousand
horsepower it's got facial recognition
instead of a key it looks like a concept
car it drives like a concept car and
chances are it's going to always live
its life as a concept car but CES 2017
will be known as a year faraday future
at least show to something they intend
to produce mobile gaming was also really
big I don't think any other company
brought the Thunder like Nvidia did with
their new shield this is a big update
for Jen to forty percent smaller nougat
base handles 4k HDR streaming service
lets you stream up to GG x 1080 quality
games right to your television set the
big news though is google assistant is
built in the new shield cost the same as
a / gin if you know what that is you are
a nerd like me it's 199 bucks could
include a brand new remote as well if
you consider yourself a pro like to pay
for it it's also a version for 299 bucks
five min gigs of storage critters are
going to ship later on in January and if
CES 2017 is gonna be known for anything
it's the year Alexa got super
with every single company LG's got Alexa
Volkswagens got Alexa mattel's got Alexa
Lenovo's got Alexa I feel like Oprah
being like you get elected you get Alexa
everybody gets Alexa it's in it's in
almost everything here at CES I never
looked at like my fridge and stove and
thought it was dumb but Samsung and
others are trying to let me know that I
need some smart appliances and we saw a
lot of those here I know it might not be
the most sexy
the world of the washer can handle a
load up top and a load down below and
stop laughing and the dryer can handle a
delicate load up top and then a bigger
load down below in fact if you want to
snicker with us all through CES Samsung
is so proud of the amount of loads their
washer and dryer can handle they put a
gigantic banner outside of CES stop
laughing he's a real things TV's also
were huge here at CES 2017 and often
from Samsung was they weren't showing
anything oulad they were telling
everyone who would listen that's her new
cue led the queue standing for quantum
dot is the best thing since sliced bread
which is a weird thing to say about a TV
and from led to hey welcome to the OLED
party Sony they are here with a nola TV
set so give it up for Sony the TV's
looks really nice and if you've been
thinking to yourself that your TV is
just too damn thick and it needs to look
like wallpaper then LG is the answer for
you with the LG w7 TV w standing for
wallpaper it's crazy crazy thin almost
looks impossibly thin but just like
Samsung's TV you gotta have a cable that
connects to an external box but this
case a component box is actually a super
awesome surround sound sound bar but you
can't mount that flush on the wall it
has to be sort of sitting on a shelf of
course you can always pass through and
just use it as a place to plug in all
your stuff and I put some robots robots
are fun and futuristic they were
everywhere here I think LG had some of
the best robots they had robots with
Alexa they had robots are gonna be
roaming the airport in South Korea very
soon you just show it to your boarding
pass I'll tell you where to go just
robots everywhere a lot of experience
things I gotta do a Navy SEAL experience
where I gotta pretend for like a hot
second I was a very fake Navy SEAL
shooting very fake nerf bullets of
things but I did get away night vision
and that was cool BMW also has a huge
presence here as well as showing off
their late
always kind of fun to see what they
think the future is and last but
definitely not least probably the
coolest thing that I saw at CES 2017
came from Panasonic and if you just look
at it from the wrong angle looks just
like a regular glass window look at it
dead-on realize the thing is a freaking
TV and it looked awesome and it made me
feel like I need this in my house as
well as a flying car so panasonic maybe
maybe help on that it's obviously a ton
of stuff happening at CES 2017 it's kind
of just encapsulated the highlights a
cliff notes version of everything that
we saw what do you like the best about
ces 2017 leave in the comments down
below and let us know will help
discussion about it be sure your
notifications turned on so you know when
our CEOs videos are coming up until next
