to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of rettinger
trances to show where I ranted rave on
anything from the wide world of
technology up this week it's all about
the HTC one in particular the crazy spec
race and the very odd for megapixel
sensor that HTC's put on the next
flagship I've read your comments on
YouTube and I want to talk about it
let's get ranting so on Tuesday HTC took
the stage at their own keynote and
announced their brains new hot flagship
the HTC One this guy's got a 4.7 inch
1080p screen quad-core a pretty
awesome-looking industrial aluminum
unibody design and by all accounts is
the new hotness this is gonna be the
phone HTC hoax is gonna bring them back
to prominence back in the days of the
original Nexus HTC was the manufacturer
since then though is Samsung as
skyrocketed LG's gained an apple keep
selling phones and people are forgetting
about poor HTC so that you're saying hey
this one is gonna do it for us get it
but one of the crazy things they
announced is a ultrapixel camera
everybody said awesome ultrapixel it's
gonna be like nokia's pureview with 32
megapixels instead they said it's gonna
have this many megapixels Thor which is
weird so let me first say that I have
not tested the camera yet I'm gonna hold
out final opinions on the camera until I
have a chance to test it but I'm trying
to go in with an open mind and I think
you should too aren't on hey Latinos at
the event New York had a chance to play
with the phone of course on the screen
the pictures look great but that's not
the real test gonna see how they look on
your computer so let me explain a few
things about megapixels the more
megapixels you have in a camera doesn't
mean the better the camera is that is a
huge misconception you think more of
something you have better it's gonna be
an HTC said they didn't want to get
caught up in a spec race which kind of
sounds like a cop-out being like hey we
don't want to keep putting I inspects in
here essentially it's megapixel sensors
stacked on top of each other and
megapixels as i mentioned don't give you
better pick
she was essentially the advantage of
having more megapixels on a camera is
first digital zoom so you can zoom in
more you've got more pixels to work with
or if you want to print out your image
and blow it up to giant size or show it
on a giant screen then yes more
megapixels definitely are nice well for
most of us that are viewing pictures on
her phone viewing them on a regular
computer even printing out photos for
normal size extra megapixels to actually
create extra noise inside the picture
doesn't mean your pictures are gonna
look any less sharp they can actually
look a little more blurry sometimes
because of more megapixels like she see
is saying is that they are taking the
best sensors they can scan take 300
times more light into the sensor may be
able to have better low-light
performance better highlight performance
better just performance overall why
don't you taking out some of that noise
so yeah it's a 4 megapixel sensor but
it's a stacked sensor so in theory of
these pictures should look absolutely
outstanding but how is that going to
affect digital zoom how's I can affect
things when you want to blow up your
image is gigantic that is the big
question and I'm really not sure how
each GC is gonna answer that yeah it's
great give got the Zoe thing where you
can make gifts and all that kind of
business that move around awesome it'll
do that since like the past 15 years but
the camera is the big question mark with
the HTC one I really want to see how it
works if they did it and if they didn't
work and it's not as good as advertised
HTC is gonna be in a world of hurt so
let me take a minute from talking about
specs to think our friends and sponsors
that Netflix you know him you love him

them know that we sent you and get your
streaming on so I'm giving HTC the
benefit of the doubt be sure to check
out our full review of the HTC One we
get our unit in which HTC has said is
going to be sometime in early March and
I will test the heck out of that camera
will take picture is in near dark will
take pictures and bright light take
pictures of dog temperatures of humans I
will take pictures of food for Instagram
and pictures of airplane wings that's
apparently all you use it for and we
will put this guy to a full battery of
tests by 10 you guys think are you upset
by the specs in this or you having an
open mind saying okay maybe I need to
reship how I think about cameras on
phones really kind of curious to hear
your guys thoughts leave your comments
