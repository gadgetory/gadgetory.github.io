technobuffalo here the smart covers are
fun but they're expensive and don't do a
very good job protecting your iPad so
what are you going to use to keep your
several hundred dollar tablet internet
device safe let me show you what I use
so you guys know a case is one of my
favorite accessory companies I've used
their cases for my iphone 4 for my
iphone 3gs before that my first
generation iPad and now my second
generation iPad and they just sent me a
ton of their new stuff tip coming out
and I want to show you what they are in
case you're looking for the best way to
protect your iPad I free dressed in any
of these links you're going to be down
below you can pick them up at a case for
ipad calm or some of their amazon
resellers so when i travel with my ipad
2 i really like to make sure that i
don't have a lot of bulk with me so low
profile cases are really nice but i
still want to make sure that my ipad 2
is being protected so this is where this
guy comes into play it's got a really
nice leather fuel to way to get that
leather smell which kind of what's you
know they're dealing with something high
quality i like that i can see the
stitching but more than the way it looks
is actually what it does if you go ahead
and keep this guy open it's got the same
magnet capabilities that the Smart Cover
does meaning it's going to unlock the
screen and lock the screen when you
close it back up again you can't see
that it's lockdown thank well you can
see it's sort of turn on so which it's a
very nice feature to have is one of the
cool things that the ipad 2 did and one
of the reasons that i really like this
guy another reason obviously there's a
low profile design and the ability to
access out port so you can see the dock
connector port right there no problem
getting to your volume controls or emule
rotation lock depending what you have it
set at course the camera and the power
and lock button this thing on the back
is kind of neat too if you take the flap
and you fold it over this is very
similar what we saw on the official
apple case for the first generation iPad
you can go ahead and prop this guy up
any way you like and if you want to use
it for typing you can go ahead and do
that as well and boom get your type on
this is the primary case that i keep on
my iPad 2 I really liked protection the
inside here is microfiber so it sort of
cleans the screen to as well really nice
and it offers full protection front and
back for the ipad 2 but that's not the
only thing that's at dover so let me
show you some of their other states so
let's
take a look at the next guy if you like
what the smart cover offers in terms of
the magnetic functionality but you don't
like that the back of your iPad is going
to be exposed this is a really nice
alternative you get that same
functionality of the Smart Cover take
out those magnets and segmented into
four sections same capability when you
open it up and unlock the screen you've
got that microfiber back you also have a
little bit of a bumper here all the way
around that case you drop the device
which I don't recommend doing but you
are going to get a bit of extra
protection and you've got the same
functionality if you want to roll it up
it's got the Magnuson you can go ahead
and prop it if you want to type or you
can go ahead and put it all the way up
nice and easy you're going to have full
access to all of your buttons there's a
volume all the rest of that business
camera on the back really lights got a
nice good feel to it it's a microfiber
material that we've seen on non-leather
smart covers folks in a case I really
put together a nice product whether or
not you want the leather feel or whether
or not you like the more microfiber
smart cover esque look and feel of the
ipad 2 you can't go wrong with either
and the last of the kind of fun
accessories that they sent over is a
sleeve that you can go ahead and put
your iPad to write in to protect it if a
case is in your thing you like to sort
of hold it and have the phyllo device
but you still want to make sure it's
protected whether you're traveling or
you put it in your bag these sleeves are
a great way they come in a ton of
different colors again the links are
going to be down below at a case for
ipad or you're going to go ahead and
click it if you want to check it out and
this is going to keep your ipad 2 nice
and safe so 3 really solid new options
from the folks at a case i've used them
it's what I've got on my device so if
you want them you can trust for a
reasonable price and you don't want to
pay the premium that you might get an
apple store they're good guys to work
with so many guys hope you enjoy what
are you using to protect your device
whether it's Android or whether it's
iphone for whatever it might be what are
you using to protect your phone or
tablet I want to hear from you guys i'm
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see you the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
