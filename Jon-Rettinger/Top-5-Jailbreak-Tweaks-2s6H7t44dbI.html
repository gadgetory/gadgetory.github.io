technobuffalo and I'm back with my top 5
jailbreak tweaks for iOS 6 so this first
week is called speed intensifier now
this is part of the xsellize repo so you
want to go back to your sources and add
cydia.xsellize.com and i'll have that
individuals you guys can see that and
edit yourself so you want to go into
your internet repo and search for Speed
intensifier and once you find that what
it does is it speeds up all the
animations on your phone and you can go
down into your settings down here if you
scroll all the way down you can see
speed intensifier right there click on
that and it lets you have won only one
really option cooking that and you could
change how fast you want it to beat so I
haven't set the default I have a phone
over here that does not have it
installed I'll show you guys what it
basically does for your apps and all the
animations so it stays in your cash so
once you open up an appt you want to
stay in your cash so you don't want to
clear it all out of your multi task bar
down here but I'm going to clear these
out for now just to show you what it
looks like so I have calendar and
calendar i'm going to open up both of
these on the phones at the same time now
this is going to beat it at first but
since it's not in the cache so i'm going
to open this up just like that so you
can see that loaded quicker but now that
it's in the cash i'm going to exit out
of both of these and open them up again
so now that that's in the catchment open
them up at the same time right here just
like that so you guys can see that it
does actually load it faster and there's
even more settings you can do with it
like you can make it even faster I would
just set the default you can go down to
fastest or as slow as negative 10 the
numbers really don't matter they just so
it's just so that you can know how fast
they're going to be then they have to
respring your device every time you do
it so this is speed intensifier and it's
free in cydia so my next week is called
flux or FL u X is also in windows and
mac for your computers but basically
what this does is it changes the color
of your screen so that it's not as a
horse on your eyes once we get into the
later parts of the day so you can change
the time you can change the different
kinds you can see it changes what it
looks like that's not what it's going to
look like at the end of the day we
changed it from candle incandescent
halogen or fluorescent and now this
change is basically the glow or the
orange pneus of your
device depending on the time of the day
it's really cool you don't actually
notice it until I the first few days
you'll notice it but once you get used
to it you don't notice that at all and
this does actually help your eyes it's
not as it's not as harsh on them it's
not as bright you can always turn down
the brightness but if you like to have
the brightness up at night but you don't
want it to be hurting your eyes as much
definitely try out flux so again
depending on the time it'll change the
screen color to a more orangish type
glow so that it doesn't hurt your eyes
as much at night so tweaked number three
is called dashboard X now what this does
is it lets you actually have a widgets
on your home screen just like Android so
I have a weather widget up there as well
as an NC settings widget down here so
now what this does is it lets you change
the brightness so you can change the
volume as well as Wi-Fi and a bunch of
other toggles in there that you can
change this one has a weather widget up
here and now once you install it the way
that you actually add a widget to the
Home screen is you click and hold on a
nap and then you click and hold on the
desktop or not the desktop the home
screen and then you have all these other
things and you can download other ones
from City as well but I have sbsettings
NC settings and a few other ones I use
the weather widget and the NC settings
one that's how I got the ones over there
and let's say I wanted to do the stock
widget so I'm going to click there's a
few other options there but I'm just
going to click add widget and you can
see down there there it is and I can
take this and drag this basically
anywhere I want it to go I can put it
behind apps I can put it over here I'm
just going to put it right down there so
way that you save it is you just click
the home button and it'll save it right
under your home screen you can interact
with it and if you click on it it will
actually launch the app that you have
installed on your device and now it's
really cold as a bunch of other
different ones you can get and the way
that you race it you just do the same
thing you click and hold on a app and
you just hit the little X button right
there and it erases it so that's how I
got the NC settings one right here as
well as the weather widget up tops that
is dashboard X and check it out in cydia
tweak number four is called
intelliscreenx and now what this is is
it lets you have stuff on your home
screen on your lock screen actually so
if I just scroll this down you guys can
see I have the weather widget as well as
a stock widget there and also if I
scroll to the left over here I have
twitter so i can follow twitter people i
can actually go into this without even
opening my phone and if i click on one
yeah i can open i can open it go to the
link reach
it will reply i'm going to open it and
it will actually launch my twitter app
and bring me right to that tweet by
TechnoBuffalo right there so it's pretty
cool you have you can have a bunch of
other stuff on here as well I don't have
too much if you get a text message you
can also use it on the dashboard as well
you can also add instead of just Twitter
you can add your email and a bunch of
other social networking stuff as well
this is intelliscreenx check it out in
cydia now at week number five is called
iconoclasm that's how i actually got my
apps to look like that so i have a
little gap there and a little bit bigger
gap up there and I don't have any apps
down here so I kind of class them lets
you design what your home screen and all
your other pages are going to look like
and a great thing to get with iconoclasm
is called layout maker well a homemaker
lets you do is literally design exactly
where you want your apps to go so if i
put 1 here and i added another one in
2345 and i put all these everywhere all
my apps would look exactly like that all
my dashboard on my home screen once I
save this in the app and save it to my
home screen and then I respring the
device my apps will look like this so my
first app will be there and so on and so
forth so it let me actually design
exactly how I wanted my home screen to
look so using iconoclasm as well as
layout maker let me have these gaps here
which let me use the dashboard exits and
look really really nice and you were all
asking me how I got my home screen to
look like this I use dashboard X for the
widgets then use iconoclasm with layout
maker to make the little gaps in between
the apps and I put the widgets right in
between there and what's really good
actually like exactly how this looks
also if you're wondering how I got my
apps to be this small I use the tweak
called springtomize and that lets you
change a bunch of stuff with the
springboard as well as the app sizes but
I'm not going to go over that in this
video so this is iconoclasm as well as
layout maker so let me know what you
think in the comments section down below
