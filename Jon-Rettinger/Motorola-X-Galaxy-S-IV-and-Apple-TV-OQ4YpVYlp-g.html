to you by carbonite welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup is to show we
take all the tech rumors from the week
and smashing basham into one condensed
video of rumor awesomeness of this week
we got a ton of news Motorola's x is
said to be a game-changer to take on
apple or Samsung Apple's rumored to buy
TV maker low samsung galaxy s4 might not
have an S Pen in it after all I'm
speaking of galaxy s4 Samsung's project
J might include three devices not just
the samsung galaxy s4 this rumor roundup
let's go ahead get round it up the
motorola x is allegedly going to be a
game-changer to take on samsung and
apple remember a few years ago google
bought motorola mobility and has really
done much with them they're supposedly
buying them just for the patents be
expected some hardware to come out of
there well smart house is reporting that
it's learned that till estrous chief
technology officer Hugh Brad lo said
that Google is working on a real
breakthrough with the game change
that'll put pressure on Samsung and
Apple of course neither Brad loan or
smart house elaborate on any of those
points I only said the vice is supposed
to support some amazing new software
which is most likely going to be five
point O or Android key lime pie I think
Motorola's really stepping up their
hardware game recently so certain i'd
like to see another manufacturer take a
crack at a Nexus device Motorola
certainly makes sense perhaps maybe Sony
might be up after them who knows we
shall see but the X phone sounds pretty
awesome and now for the rumor that just
won't die the apple TV is suddenly
gaining some new steam Apple is
supposedly interested in buying German
TV maker lo the news already propelled
electronic company stock up about thirty
percent of time in this publication not
talking about Apple according to one
trader speaking at Reuters Apple's
interested in bidding up to four euros
per share the company if it does indeed
follow through with the rumored
acquisition speculation is first
reported by Apple Insider actually back
in May this if true is of course huge
use for the tech industry Apple's long
remember to have an itch for entering
the home TV market feeling could be
scratched by the apple TV of course it
already offers the Apple TV set-top box
in fact up recently hired Oh LED
technology experts from LG well as
experienced in working on TVs back in
December report on a rumor that
suggested Samsung will launch its new
flagship Galaxy s4 support for the s-pen
the same stylist like device found in
galaxy note 10.1 galaxy note and it's
follow-up the Galaxy Note 2 however the
rumor is now being adjusted by the
original source Sam mobile which said
that the device actually not gonna feed
your netspend after all it will however
still support a home button possibly
something what we already have on the
note and the note to the sites also
suggesting the phone will support a
non-contact gesture technology to us
that implies are going to some kind of
interaction with the camera try to be
able to reject or as an execute commands
on the phone itself or some kind of
crazy eye tracking technology we're also
expecting jellybean no key lime pie but
awesomely an XE nose octa processor in
addition to support for wireless
charging latest rumor suggests the
galaxy s floral launch sometime around
the middle of March about a month or so
ago we coded a report that suggested the
galaxy x 4 was called Project J inside
Samsung's walls and that device was
actually code named Alice Sam Mobile's
extra verizon original reports suggest
that project day doesn't include one
device but instead is a term ssangsun
used to cover three in development
devices including the galaxy s4 so what
are the other two as fam mobile says it
includes the project j mini another
phone that's code name serrano that is
presumably mini version the galaxy s4
it's unclear at the third devices or the
Sam mobile suggests that it's dubbed
Project J active that's a fitness
related gadget currently being dubbed
Fortius it is clear the device related
to health and fitness because it's
accessories include an armband bike
mount and a pouch we're guessing though
we'll hear more from Samsung following
Mobile World Congress possibly on march
