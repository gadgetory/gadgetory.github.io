technobuffalo here when we first saw the
droid bionic back in January at CES I
was extremely excited a dual-core phone
that's rockin 4G LTE speeds it sounded
like a dream come true for spec and
phone nerds like myself well many moons
have passed since that announcement we
finally have the droid bionic in front
of us let's go ahead and see if it still
as exciting as it once was alright so I
want to give you guys an overview of the
droid bionic the full review is going to
be coming very very soon I'm getting a
lot of questions about how the OS looks
that fast it isn't that kind of stuff so
I want to go ahead and show you Mitch
remind you very quickly as some of the
specs here on the droid bionic it's got
now very familiar 4.3 inch screen with a
resolution of 540 x 960 so pretty high
res there I is dual core as I mentioned
one gigahertz on each core 1 gig of ram
16 gigs internal storage and a lot of
other goodness packed in here including
a 1080p camera that lives on the back
and I'll the focus camera so real quick
overview from the hardware here got a
typical motorola for android capacitive
buttons that one looks a little
different on motorola devices on the
left hand side a charging port and your
hdmi out soft touch feel here on the
back that motorola logo i have covered
up let me rip that off there this whole
back is one piece there's the camera
with LED flash the autofocus camera that
i mentioned on the other side lives
volume rocker and see it's a little bit
of a chin there on the phone all right
so enough of that let's talk about the
OS here so no longer do we have motoblur
gray we now just have motorola skin
sitting on top of the droid bionic if
you saw my previous video i ran a
quadrant score test ina poulton a pretty
nice stock rom score of 2202 so
obviously you're getting a very powerful
phone what's a great powerful phone come
some neat stuff that it does that's like
scroll from screen to screen you can see
some 3d
there it's not a 3d display but it does
do some pseudo 3d stuff so you can see
things start to slide in and slide out
if I go into the menu options here I can
see it looks like they're sort of
folding out there we do have a
horizontal scrolling here for all of
your applications go ahead and exit home
there's a neat custom widgets at
Motorola added one of my favorites here
is this contact widget which you can
sort of pull down and get access to more
stuff so I just selected one if you call
them you could send the message or text
or get your history with that person and
you can add as many as you want if you
sometimes it gets tricky you can sort of
pull it down there you go now you can
add a ton of them there and just tap it
and off you are running um some other
tweaks here you're going to the camera
Motorola's sort of changed at you I a
little bit from some of the stock
gingerbread action action nothing giant
but a lot of subtleties here on this
phone to go ahead and check out what's
most important to me the browser specs
are great if I don't get good browser
performance it's not really that
exciting so let's go ahead and check it
out so you've got technobuffalo the
mobile site thing is lightning fast yeah
I ain't connected to Wi-Fi I do about
three bars of 4g as well I'll do a quick
refresh and of course is the site that's
been loaded on here in the past so
cookies cash and all that business are
on here so go ahead and let it refresh
yes I think I let refresh there we go
let's go ahead no there it goes all
right so loaded relatively quickly let's
see if my awful demo there no
checkerboard pattern at all click the
article it went right through
pinch-to-zoom very smooth here let's go
ahead and load a site that i have not
loaded on here before check out one of
my favorites ESPN com and it should pull
up actually before we do that I'm
getting overexcited let's go ahead and
check out the full version of
technobuffalo which has some flash
content and this has not been voted on
the device yet so I'll let it load the
desktop version and this is connected
over Wi-Fi and we'll zoom out still
pulling in part of the mobile version
there we go so you can see that there's
some other stuff on there as well and
the loads very very quickly so
perspective hadn't been
down here before no checkerboard pattern
there's a bit of a lag though from the
first time I touched the screen to when
it starts moving so let's go ahead and
check out that's it ESPN I have not
loaded this on here before good ESPN
it's a good of WAP a google search for
ESPN and I assume that I'm probably
going to get the mobile site here with
this guy but let's check it out so this
is just really a speed test in my Wi-Fi
network let's go to the full site down
here at the bottom scrolling seem to be
a little bit smoother so go ahead and
launch espn.com see if they'll take me
whoops picked up the total wrong side
there we go ESPN com and let's see what
this is gonna look like go so obviously
it loaded pretty fast there's some html5
on here it's not actually flash but it
does work well at sea on a site that's
this intensive with all that information
being pulled in pinch-to-zoom was very
quick there wasn't any lag I'm doing so
and moving around the site forever
little room I have was very fast the
browser's been a really really pleasant
experience and the high res screen makes
you in text well zoomed in or ever you
are look really nice so there's that I'm
going to hold off on showing some other
stuff until the full review some other
sort of neat widgets that we've got in
here I've got a gallery widget for
social media accounts you can tell I
don't really use those but I do like is
that small unobtrusive weather widget
see i'm going to irvine california go
ahead and a whole bunch of those entitle
them around if you want to move icons
around you could sort of a new theme
here go ahead and hold this down you get
that term we saw this on honeycomb got
those little X's it sort of show how
much space you take up when you move it
as I move stuff around get a little bit
of 3d effect as it flows and able to
keep up with your finger almost let's
say up down up down up down up down left
right left right left right left right
ba ba select start um so let's see how
sort of quick that is there as well
overall up and pretty pleased with the
droid bionic I probably need about one
to two more days where I do my full
review but I didn't want to share a bit
more information about it give you some
overview it's a very pleasant experience
probably won't at least thus far one of
the bed
android experiences I've had on a phone
another small tweak that I do want to
show you is in the keyboard so let's go
ahead and go back to browser open up the
keyboard will show up there a little bit
of the way not good to have on camera I
bring a demonstration um so there is
haptic feedback here but it's really
subtle haptic feedback very much like
that don't give me a giant vibration
just a little bit to let you know you
push something so I'm a big fan of that
we'll talk about this keyboard here in
the fort review stay tuned for that
later on in the week anything you want
to see mention the floor review be sure
to leave your comments down below i'm
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo now
we'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
