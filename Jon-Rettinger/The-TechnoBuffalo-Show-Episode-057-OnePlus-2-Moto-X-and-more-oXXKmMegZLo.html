TechnoBuffalo show online you're two
hosts for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton hey
everybody how are you doing today Todd
I'm good today's mmm the first not so
crazy day this week I didn't get a
chance to ask you this pre-show what
time did you fall asleep last night it's
like right away I normally I go to bed
like 10 I like I'll go up to my bed at
like 10 that all breed for like a half
hour or so I was laying in my bed lit by
like nine ten yeah after we're goin down
for a bit yeah it was a long two days
yeah because it started out on Monday
with one plus two we were fortunate
enough to have two people up in well
John was up there with Brandon up in San
Francisco for a briefing and then so we
were preparing a bunch of stuff here and
then they didn't announce the phone
until ten o'clock eastern nine o'clock
your time yeah actually that's when the
press conference started took a while
they didn't even really go into the
phone for a bit and at the end of the
press conference were just ended there
was no news on the price there so yet it
we had the price but hey let's talk
about that for a moment so the oneplus
press conference was this virtual
reality thing and that started at 10
Eastern and we already had the embargoed
materials we were you know we but we
were embargoed until 11 eastern which
meant we could not publish what we had
right so then the press event ends at
ten-thirty and we're all sitting there
for 30 beds with all the materials were
all like hey can we run the news cuz you
announced the phone but we're not
allowed to say anything about it we had
the price but they didn't give the price
of like the whole world sort of just
sitting there for like a half hour
waiting for like this the news to break
on the price when everybody was allowed
to talk about which is funny but I think
they had another event in Asia so my
guess was that they were sort of weight
for that to like catch up i don't know i
think i got a full outer room I don't
know it was it was just very odd yes and
this thing with the the event um you
didn't need virtual reality to watch it
but for you know a reporter like us
we're trying to cover the event you
could turn off the the two windows that
would be used in like Google glass or
Google cardboard so we had it but then
it was panning around and like I can't
follow along you know and type at the
same time because they're moving around
this 3d were or real world in you know
first we reality whatever um it was it
was very hard to like covers report and
then I accidently stopped it and I
wanted to restart you had to go went all
the way back to the beginning so then I
was following along with her or Alive
block yeah it was it was a very odd way
to do things but you know what and the
message I want to send to press to the
companies like this is we don't need 15
minutes of you telling us about all the
rigors of going through designing and yo
the stuff decent oh yeah you know
fine we understand you guys want sure
that but just like release YouTube
videos yeah exactly but so to be clear
before we jump into all this the only
people that have touched the 1+2 from
TechnoBuffalo or Brandon and John Burnet
on the show the only people to touch the
Moto X pure edition and the Moto G from
technobuffalo or yourself and Jacob
although the Moto G will be in Jon's
hands today right but I for reference I
have not touched either of the devices
so going into this I will be just I know
what everyone else knows i have not good
either of the phones right so let's just
go in the order of the vents let's start
with the 1+2 huh and you know we have a
question from such an bahal which really
just kind of fires off the whole thing
here is the 1+2 what you were expecting
I kind of
because i think i was going i was
thinking like quad HD display but I also
knew that they couldn't probably do that
for the price you know you gotta keep
the price down enough I mean if they
came out with like a 700 ollar phone
fans would be like what the heck man
like this isn't why I'm a 1 plus fan so
they couldn't do that so I think yeah
besides like that there are other
niceties like wireless charging would
have been cool NFC I see Sasha and you
have the question about that I thought
that was a kind of weirdo mission
because I don't think it cost much to
add but I will get into an abit led the
Moto G in front of me and it doesn't
have any either um and the reason I
think it's weird because I believe
android pay and stuff like that they're
all going to use NFC payments so like
you kind of have this flagship but it's
not going to be able to use a flagship
feature from google you know if Android
Bay is actually widely accepted and
stuff like that Google Wallet didn't
really take office as much as I wanted
to but I guess that's fine those are my
comment like concerns with it camera
sounds good all that stuff you know it's
13 megapixel 5 megapixel up front that's
it's the same megapixels last year I
guess the modules change because they're
saying it's a really good camera and
speaking of cameras motorola put a lot
of emphasis on that yesterday too so
when we talk about the moto phones will
put anybody I like that all these
manufacturers of putting cameras front
and center and for the most part doing
it well except for HTC this year with
the one and nine which is kind of a
bummer I apologize for the phone call
there everyone I was a telemarketer yeah
the NFC thing I agree with you Todd yo
okay maybe it's not a big deal right now
but your average person is buying a
phone for a minimum of one year right
most people buy phones for two years or
even longer NFC is definitely on the way
in so the fact that one plus decided not
to put the NFC and to me feels like the
phone is not future-proofed at all now
the same could be said for USB type-c I
understand that you know yes they did
put
that in and you know the Moto X doesn't
have that fine but I think NFC is
actually the bigger thing right bill
yeah and it's weird because I mean we've
NFC's been around for a long time right
and like some people it's used for
pairing speakers and maybe the thing is
that people don't like how often do
people use it really i use it from time
to time mainly for pairing with a
speaker but you know people aren't using
it and I guess that's what 1 plus told
our guys in the meeting up in San
Francisco they said you know we would
have added if our fans wanted it but
apparently they don't want but now that
comes down to what you can do with it
right now and there's not a whole lot
but if Android pay really relies on NFC
and here you are with this flagship but
it can't use Android pay and you want to
like that's that's kind of weird because
I feel like if it was another company
maybe you'd be like whatever they're
selling it to Joe consumer but I feel
like Android pay is going to be used by
enthusiasts right like my mom's going
easy Android pay but I feel like if
you're buying a 1 plus phone you're
probably an enthusiast and if you're
using you know mobile payments you're
probably in enthusiasts and so the two
seemed to me like they would go together
but I agree with you I agree completely
it's a very minor thing you know I I'm
not saying the oh don't buy the oneplus
2 because it doesn't have NFC right but
it is an odd omission in this day but in
general I mean the pricing yes the
pricing went up but I didn't think it
was anything ridiculous by any means
yeah i think for pricing scare ya Barry
you know what was it for the 64 gigabyte
like 389 I think 318 yeah i think it was
389 maybe yeah which does lead me over
to the Moto X which you know they said
okay it's in which by the way everyone
we're talking the Moto X pure addition
although be called the Moto X style and
the rest of the world that's the most
mind-boggling think it makes absolutely
no sense but so the Moto X pure edition
starts at 399 and you know that's just
going to be for 16 gigabytes so you
really
wonder how much is you know the the 32
and the 64 gonna cost and then yeah then
you're gonna customize it with moto
maker mm-hmm exactly it's not gonna be
it's not that cheap but it's a very nice
phone and you know to be fair I haven't
played with the 1+2 the only the only
reason I'm not like crazy excited about
the 1+2 is because i was kinda let down
by the 1 plus 1 i've talked about that
on the show before I felt like the
battery life wasn't that great camera
wasn't that great but other people have
had really good experiences which makes
me wonder like did I get a different
camera module you know who knows um now
speaking see I'm not that I'm probably
not gonna go for one plus two and the
simple reason is my battery after about
six months it just started getting worse
and worse and worse so and yeah it mines
in my shoulder bag but it's just I don't
know I don't have a whole lot of faith
right now in 1 plus and that again
everyone I'm speaking for myself
personally that that's not a techno
Buffalo official yeah yeah we're going
to review the phone as it as a brand new
phone yeah exactly so I I don't know i
just i I'm not that excited but I mean
I'm interested in moto x but i'm really
concerned about what the prices ok i
can't see myself doing less than 32 gigs
right i mean it does have expandable
storage but you do sort of i mean it's
16 gigs kind of just like four base
torch is still not a lot so you know
like when I like to install games on
well actually this for example as 16
gigs of storage when i install games on
it like that's gonna take up a lot of it
and yeah you can move the files over to
micro SD but still the bulk of that app
sitting on them and unless you really
phone and do all the tons of other
things but getting back to the Moto X
that's the phone i'm excited for 399 you
get the quad HD display front-facing
speakers the 20 megapixel camera which
motorola is saying and like again we
have to test it ourselves what they're
saying is going to be like the best
smartphone camera out there i do think
the smartest thing they did was giving
the
dpreview yeah okay these are guys who
they do nothing but shoot photography
right and you know they do not have a
final review of the camera module yet
but their initial tests are very
promising their samples looked great
again these are our professional
photographers but they're not messing
with yo color tones and all that and
editing right you know and they look
good yeah they did look good we have
them on the site yeah so all those
features are exciting to me expandable
storage like I said the customization so
to me 399 or whatever even with the 16
gigs of storage I would probably go a
motorola 1x pure edition I hate adding
the pure edition in there so i call it
the style or whatever or just called
them the moto x 2015 i don't know now
they did not have any of the play there
correct right yeah so at the event they
didn't have the play because they said
you know all we have to share at this
time is it's not planned for the united
states so they didn't have it there for
us to play with um unintended I guess
1080p screen so it's a little different
I think right get them all mixed up but
I do have the Moto G here and I've been
using it since the events so I have uh
you can see it's kind of like a ribbed
plastic green with the orange you get a
13-megapixel camera Motorola says it's
the exact same module that was used in
the Nexus 6 which you know it's not the
best camera on the market but for a
device like this that's pretty awesome
so under 200 bucks um 16 gigs of storage
you can expand it here i'll pop off the
bed it's dusty and for those listening
to the radio he is showing us the most i
sorry for everybody listening on the
radio I'm showing into the camera now
and you can see I've got micro SD and
the sim card slot up top it is a micro
sim card slot so not nano and it's a
little wet cuz I actually ran it under
water earlier today because its IP
x7 resistant so I want to test that out
it did pretty well the only thing I have
on my unit i'm trying to show it to the
camera here but it won't work but where
the the back cover meets the body it
doesn't quite close all the way and they
say like you're supposed to move around
snap it which I'm doing right now and it
is all snapped into place so maybe it's
just my unit but it's something you know
I don't know if that's gonna let water
and it seems like it would but maybe not
it seems like it would mean but the
thing is if you if you look at the back
there's like the battery is not
removable everything's under protection
here except for the microSD and the nano
slant sim card slot but here I'll show
the camera there are these rubber
gaskets on the back that protect those
individually so I don't know that
there's anything to get worried about
really as long as those are covered
right and then they're nano coatings on
the micro USB port and the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and stuff take
care of the rest so anyway I'm actually
really liking moto G good yeah good at
what's at starting price 189 I think
that's you know for a Knockaround phone
you know if you're an international
traveler and you're swapping Sims alot
or whatever really can't beat that I
know you know yes I i still use my mega
6.3 uh travel to England but you know if
I was in the market for a new yo phone
to use with a UK cinnamon I'm over there
I I would jump on that heartbeat yeah
check it out and the thing is um it's a
Snapdragon 415 processor I think versus
the the style the Moto appear as an 808
um and it's been snappy for me real
snappy and I actually loaded up
vainglory which is just awesome game
I've been playing I don't know if
anybody remembers it but it was
introduced when Apple was talking about
metal for iOS it's a 3 verse 3
multiplayer game very fun so I loaded it
up on here but I haven't had a chance to
play it because it's big install so I'll
report on that but if it can handle the
Snapdragon 415 you can handle that it
and this is pretty solid device for the
price
yeah I agree I agree it's been
interesting and then of course also this
week we had the announcement of a
samsung event which to be clear we do
not know for sure what is being an ass
at the samsung event however you don't
have to be a psychic to figure out it's
the note 5 right and the galaxy s6 edge+
thank you I can't wear it with I don't I
have the hardest time remembering that
one for some reason the excess 6 edge
spectacular I who knows but yeah it
doesn't take a genius you know to figure
out that's what we're going to see on
August thirteenth in New York City yep
which goes back to what we were saying I
believe it was last week about how the
companies seem to be moving away from
Aoife and the big trade shows in mind to
do their own events instead you know the
note announcements have been a staple of
Aoife for the past four years yeah so
this is really interesting to see it is
definitely moving out to its own a bit
we think yeah right but and like we
talked about I think it was last week
that you know the rumor is Samsung's
trying to get these out on the market
ahead of the iphone 6s and iPhone 6s
plus and all that stuff but while we're
talking about all these new phones i
think the release date for the Moto X
pure edition style of September is
dangerous for motorola because you know
we're excited about it yeah but then the
note fives coming the new iPhones
everybody's can be talking about these
devices and I get it the price points
totally different for people that
understand that like that mmm that's
where the markets going we're going to
be buying these phones probably out of
parking pop-up park it pocket or with
these like you know these prepaid plans
from from t-mobile or whatever
installment plans is what I mean which
motorola offers also but the point is i
think even though the price is right
there these flagships are coming and i
think that's kind of dangerous
so we'll see no I totally agree with you
I also asked them yesterday about the
Moto e because that's sort of the lower
the lowest Edmodo and I was like is that
dead like what what are you guys doing
with that and they don't usually refresh
it at the same time they said it's like
selling like crazy I think last month
was the best month of sales for the Moto
e in the u.s. they said unlike unlike
cricket I guess or like all these
prepaid kind of brands okay oh yeah I
thought that was interesting sorry i
went on a real big tangent no no it's
totally no I I was curious actually why
the Moto e wasn't mentioned but it's
interesting to know that it is still in
play right yeah and so what I meant by
that was I guess motorola sales have
been really good anyway so they're not
too worried about these competitors and
they were saying like there was one
journalist there was just nailing the
guy I was at a round table was nailing a
guy with these questions about like
Samsung does the samsung does that and
the guy was sort of like look like we're
not even really trying to go after
Samson like that's not the point here
and I get that because you know the
galaxy s6 is like a 700 honor I have to
look at the off contract prices but it's
not 400 bucks and so that's Motorola's
point that while it offers these awesome
features it's not that it's right and I
think that it may be you know that is
something we need to look at especially
with the pure edition is that these are
not the people that buy moto phones and
that's not this is not saying that
they're bad but they're not typically
your iphone buyers they're not typically
your note 5 buyers right just you I I
can see why CM someone to move the note
5 away from the iphones I I get that
especially now with the the plus you
know series of iphones right but yeah I
can see what Motorola saying they're not
really they've never set the x series up
as let's go after the big boys yeah
right i agree i think
their focus on customization and
personalization and still really great
phones but they're also not like you
know you've never seen this before I
mean ya moto maker and stuff like that
but I mean like they're not like check
out this S Pen that's done something
we've never seen on a mobile device
before or you know Samsung with the quad
HD Super AMOLED displays when they renew
and stuff like that and then you have
you know Apple it sort of its own thing
I mean I don't want to get into the
argument of what they've done first and
what they haven't done first but
whatever but their flagship premium
expensive phones and that's not where
Motorola's going at least not with the
expensive part right right exactly so
it's been an interesting week it's going
to be a couple interesting months as
these phones roll out now the Moto G is
available now correct yep yep you can
order it now online you can customize it
you can buy the shelves you can buy all
kinds of stuff so the customization
comes down to and I'm showing the camera
just that metal area around the camera
and then the shell like you could pick
your color but it's not permanent like I
was showing earlier you pop it off by
another one I think they're 15 bucks
each so gotcha so it's gonna be an
interesting time we're going into I this
is I never thought we would see where
the holiday season became an important
phone buying season but it has yes or no
especially depending on contracts to as
contracts are sort of going away at
least as these you know early upgrade
programs come where t-mobile at you
upgrade like what like three times a
year if you're on those or if you're
just buying off contract phones and yeah
this right now is sort of a hot new
season coming up well we've got a couple
questions coming in here about the
phones in general most of them from such
a ball ah let's see here speaking from
such Mahal could NFC and or wireless
charging could be added in a swappable
cover for the 1+2 they actually address
that and no wireless charging well you
possible if you buy one of those kits on
Amazon where you plug
to the bottom and then you run yes I am
sorry yes you are correct wireless
charging but they said NFC could not be
yeah it seems like that would be sure oh
I I want to comment on a story that I
just saw the tweet go out so I know the
post is now live about the xperia c 5
ultra leak oh yeah that was the best
week ever that improves for those of you
that have not seen the story we just ran
a story about a picture of the Xperia z5
ultra was leaked and since it's your
department Todd would you like to share
with everybody where the source of this
leak came from yeah so it came from
Brazil the police busted a guy during a
raid and I don't think they talked about
what kind of rate it was you know sounds
like you electronic read and they find
this phone and then they published the
pictures of the phone and that's how I
got leaked it's like not your typical
leak we're like some guy publishes
images these are the police publishing I
guess he's not how the story goes they
need someone maybe someone somewhere
just made it all up uh-uh that let's
just crack me up so much I was a police
picture yeah that's great um no it was
unlike nevermind what if it was in the
middle of a crime scene what do we do we
just don't report like what if the guy
on a bag of drugs I'm so hot Raja and I
know he asked us last week so I and we
didn't have time to get to it last week
so I get to it this week what are our
current daily drivers mm-hmm look what
are your it folks you got to remember
something we swap phones yeah i use the
iphone 6 plus as my dealer I gotta be
honest though I've been on I have iOS 9
the latest public beta on it and I it's
running slow i've been using android
more is like my go-to device and so that
was either the galaxy s6 or right now
i'm just using the Moto G because i'm
testing but i really liked emoji I don't
know well I'm in an odd document right
now
phones so at my iphone 6 plus which is
in an otterbox case that's why it looks
so gigantic then I have my 1 plus which
right now is having battery issues so i
swapped the sim card out that this is
normally my daily driver for android so
right now my sim card is currently in an
LG g3 and i wanted to see if reisen
would work in my house because other
carriers don't and oddly enough verizon
did work in my house so I'm also
currently using a loaner droid turbo uh
but if I was to say just to daily
drivers it's the iphone and the oneplus
when the battery decides to work I'd
probably say minor the s6 in the iphone
6 plus and like i said i'm sort of
leaning towards android these days i
don't know i didn't see myself like
making this huge switch because like i
said like i I'm vested in both systems I
have you know the Apple play music
subscription that I probably plan on
keeping i'm not sure why my apps that i
paid for on iOS and then on android
androids where I buy my movies where I
have my books where I have google play
music spotify also i don't know it's
just an gmail my calendar and everything
I mean I know I can do it on the iphone
too but for mail and calendar and stuff
like that just seems to me to work
better than hangouts which is what we
use for work so it just helps better on
a droid speaking of Android let's jump
back to the 1+2 for a second what are
your feelings on about the move to
oxygen OS yeah well it sounded like they
had like a little fall hour maybe a
bigger fallout with cyanogenmod and
using that i haven't used oxygen OS
honestly and i know that i could install
i guess the other version of it online i
don't know i think it's fine just like
keep going what they're going i think
that the the main thing is that they
promised frequent and speedy updates and
it sounds like that's going to happen
more without using cyanogenmod were they
i guess they were felt sort of tied down
with cyanogenmod to get those updates so
now that they're using their own home
built stuff
they can just push it out quicker which
is the same message that Motorola's
trying to stay to like we're just you
know it's pure addition we're gonna get
everything out quick and there's no
carriers yeah I just I don't know I my
only concern about oxygen OS is that it
is a yet another fork of Android which
seems to be happening constantly mm-hmm
and I'm just I'm worried about
compatibility and again folks I have not
used oxygen OS I keep wanting to call it
color for some meats you color OS what
was that that's another one that out
there so yeah I keep wanting to call it
color but no its auction Papa I don't
remember I don't remember but it just it
concerns me about it being a fork yo and
they're being possible incompatibility
issues so I'm just I'm not real excited
about moving to yet another fork of
Android and that's part of the reason
the Moto X pure edition which is such an
awkward name it's saying I know is
probably the reason the Moto X PE or
just on up here oh that would made more
sense but yeah the Moto X pure is more
appealing to me simply because its base
Android with some motor oil enhancements
which are done via app but that appeals
to me more than going off and using
oxygen OS yeah I don't just see me
though oxygen seems cool it's very
gesture-based and stuff like they've
done in the past and they have the swype
keyboard pre-loaded which is you know
good or bad whatever Samsung has swype
keyboard souza anyway uh from Abdul
Wahab when I apologize if I
mispronounced your last name I am in
Pakistan and I can buy the Moto G second
gin but not the Moto G third gen so
should i buy it or look at something
else i would say more unlikely wait and
see if the third gen is coming they
didn't specifically mention pakistan but
they did mention india so it makes sense
to me that it's out in that area and
please i'll be clear I understand pack
stand in the are two separate countries
but that's a global launch yeah I i
think i would wait just a little bit i
mean if you even got your heart set on
moto g i think i would wait just a
little bit and see if the 3rd gen is is
coming to pakistan as would I because I
know Motorola's pushing into as many
markets as possible with the Moto G for
example in Brazil is the number one
selling smartphone it has been so I
would try to wait for it second
gentleman's great too we really like
that but you know if you can get the 3rd
gen why not um since this is the most
upvoted question right now from dis hunt
boody do you like pie I do how can you
not like pie yeah who doesn't like fun
um and now I know what I'm wondering for
lunch lunch oh I can order anything I
could I could find i'll probably get
buffalo wings with a side of pie or
something that's cool thing about living
around New York City you can get
whatever you want I that that was always
my favorite part of going there for toy
fair you know all the menus that would
get shoved under my hotel room door I am
I ordered so much food delivered now we
have seamless and so I could like
hundreds of restaurants it's crazy yeah
yeah did I ever tell you about the time
the one time I tried using online food
ordering in Manchester no I the I can't
even remember the name of the site now
but it's not one we have over here and
it was a horrible storm that night I was
just like fine I'll order something in
and so I ordered from a italian place in
the site crashed i was like oh okay well
I'll try again so at that point I
changed my mind and decided to order
Chinese what I did not know was the
Italian ordered gone through they both
show up at the exact same moment in the
lobby I like look I'm not I'm not going
to you know screw either one of you out
it was my nose a problem with the site
i'll work it out with them so
end up by to take out orders that been
delivered for me then I discovered a new
style of food that night they called
chaa talion Italian there yeah I ages a
little bit from both meals that's just
you know what I've had this is crazy
I've had the you know online ordering
order something and then like literally
half hour 45 minutes later same delivery
guy comes back with the exact same items
and I didn't order it twice and this
year this happened and I was like what
the heck like do I that I told the guy
I'm like you were just here you already
delivered it so he took it back because
I didn't want to like charge the
restaurant you know they made this food
so they throw it out now weird though is
like Groundhog Day or something it just
keeps coming back yeah it's like
literally I just finished eating that is
very good Oh from such Mahal hey Todd
have you updated your computers to
Windows 10 so I'm working with Microsoft
and that they sent me the surface pro 3
year so it has yes Windows 10 on it and
i've been using it and i plan to do some
coverage may give me some tips and
tricks and stuff like that I don't want
to review it yet because I feel like
it's you know it's an operating system
you I play with this and i also really
want to review like windows hello where
they do the iris scanning and stuff like
that so we'll probably do a lot of that
out in the office once those actually
there are a couple computers who already
have windows glow support so we'll
probably want to do it there but yeah
I'm playing with it here and I also have
it on my netbook um like still call the
netbook it's the x 205 that i bought for
like 140 bucks if you've been listening
to show like six months ago and it
doesn't run well on that so think about
upgrading before you put it on something
it's an atom based machine uh from
spencer win any news on 1 plus light no
we have not heard anything on it yeah
and my guess is it doesn't exist i don't
know maybe it does but at 329 for the
low end right
not what it starts that I believe so
remember no am i mixing up all these
funds i don't know there's four phones
in two days from sahaja why do you think
motorola didn't have a new Moto 360 I
think they do have a new Moto 360 I
think they just decide to announce it at
another time yeah I think so too and you
know good because otherwise there is
gonna be a bunch of stuff I was
wondering about the droids yesterday to
the rumors of the new you know droid
Maxx or droid mini coming and but
usually verizon likes to hold that event
and then they'll say our friends from
Motorola r here you know yeah so I bet
that's coming soon and then you know I
don't know about the the 360 like when
it would happen if marolla's gonna do
its own thing maybe it'll do something
with google I don't know ok I am going
to butcher this name I'm apologizing
before I even attempt it I can't even
try i say shop so I i apologize i I
don't ever want to disrespect somebody's
name I would believe me as someone who
has gone through the life at the last
name ani have heard every possible
pronunciation on Oh on moon Mooney my
father when they you know they had a
restaurant they SEO can we have your
party's name he just does Keith now he's
just like I don't even try that's like
my stepfather uses Anderson because his
name is long and hard well uh anyway the
question is there is there any software
image stabilization in the Moto X style
or the question I don't know that's a
good question I don't think I saw it in
the specs but i'm sure there's there's
image stabilization because i think most
phones try to do what they can and post
processing right well actually let me
look at this piece I'm afraid to touch
my keyboard folks cuz eight years ago or
not years ago a couple weeks ago I
accidentally hit my keyboard and stop
the recording yeah let me we run over
there real quick because the the specs
for the
camera were pretty detailed oh yeah so
let me jump over there real quick it has
hardware who is us no let me jump in you
can't claim you're the best on the
market without oh I asked with the
camera well if the specs would load that
would help immensely there they are ok
so let's see here a aperture quick
capture tap anywhere to capture ring
flash there's nothing about image
stabilization and slow wow that's a big
claim then without to say you're the
best and you're going against s6 iphone
well iPhone 6 has a great camera no I
asked what the six bus has it and the
specs they get lists do cover some
softwares items like slow motion video
burst mode auto HDR panorama drag to
focus on exposure so yeah there is no
image stabilization mentioned now I will
say this this drives me nuts so I'm the
one that's responsible for putting the
product pages up on technobuffalo so
when we get the spec sheets I go in and
fill them out now yesterday the Moto G
spec page did not list what technology
was used for the screen ok fine the Moto
X pure editions page did list the
technology for the screen but decided
not to share with us what sensors were
on the phone now our rule is you can
assume it's going to have accelerometer
ambient light proximity but my feeling
is I do not list those on a product page
until I have a hundred percent
confirmation because we have seen some
that did not have ambient light yeah but
folks come on and give us the specs you
you saw I love is when we call the
companies and we go hey can you tell me
Oh what are the sensors on the
such-and-such oh I don't have that
information yeah cuz they don't have had
their it's like somewhere it's like in
engineering
are my favorite answer I won't say what
company this was I buy you were the one
helping me with it it was the day before
an event and they'd given us a spec
sheet like a week prior mm-hmm and up to
the day before the event they were going
oh we don't know that yet oh yeah
malarkey mallorca you built the phone
you know what's in it yeah oh good grief
anyway from Shanghai Austin Are you
disappointed at the Moto X style / pure
edition does not have a fingerprint
scanner no I don't care now I'm not it's
it's nice i'm like the galaxy s6 and
stuff but all the time I end up typing
my my code anyway the only the reason i
really like it on apple on the iphone is
uh for payment it's like in the app
store and stuff like that and so if i
can't use it for that that I'm like man
I mean just for opening and closing my
phone I really care now for Windows 10
for phones the talk of Windows hello and
the iris scanning stuff that's cool I
just look at the phone I'll see how
nerds I'd like NFC I has a lot of uses
fingerprint scanners honestly to me are
pretty much a gimmick at this point but
but that may just be me from saha Raja
why do you think the Moto X play is not
coming to the US I think it's just it
doesn't fit in which they need here yeah
I think they're trying to do moto g Moto
X pure edition style whatever you know
at 399 and then you know the two hundred
dollars starting point and then you
customize it up and that sort of kind of
fits in the middle but I bet they
probably want to push sales of those two
phones instead of that but I don't know
from coot con uh Sean any updates about
the pebble time yes actually I had an
issue the other day I had not told you
about that she had Todd my screen went
completely black and every once while I
would push the buttons I could see it
was trying to draw but it couldn't so I
ended up having to reboot it and it came
back fine after that but
I still have no idea why in the heck it
went all black other than that it's been
great I think the battery life is not
what they had hoped I have to throw it
on the charger about every four days hey
that's that's not horrible but it's not
the seven days they said now that being
said I get more notifications than the
normal human being so you never know I
ain't like when my security cameras you
know spot the cats in the warehouse at
night I get an alert so yea yea Lord
well we're going to have to close up
your pretty quickly i'm just going to
randomly slide through here and choose
one more question and i do mean random
let's see here to do from such a ball
which one is worth getting Moto X style
AKA pure edition or the 1+2 and why it
really it comes it's going to come down
to what you want do you want pure Google
then you want them moto X pure addition
if you don't want pure Google then the
1+2 comes into its a John asked me the
same jon rettinger the owner the company
asked me the same question yesterday yo
goes which would you choose and I had to
sit there and think about firm it
there's a lot of pros and cons to both
yeah I agree first time I would go and
i'm not i don't think i'm gonna buy
either one but i would go moto x that's
the way i ended up finally leaning when
I was talking to jon was the Moto X yeah
I don't know for some reason I I'm on
this kick these days where I like the
water is just two devices maybe because
it's summer and I can take you to the
pool and stuff right um from Shah again
uh because it's just an interesting
question is the micro SD card slot on
the Moto X style an optional extra
through moto maker or standard on all
versions standard on all versions
anytime you have a feature like that
you're talking about a massive retooling
yeah and I I won't go complete geek on
all of you there was a story a long time
no with them the motorola xoom about why
ahead extra port and i wrote a big
article about body non-lte version of
the zoom had this port still it all
comes down to when you make something
like this you have to build a mold molds
are extremely expensive to buy so you
don't ever wanted to have more molds
than you absolutely need so if they're
going to give you microsd support on one
phone they're going to give it to you on
all phones yeah so then you're also
manufacturing that I mean what if what
if everybody buys the model without the
micro SD card slot not that that would
happen and then all of a sudden you're
sitting on a bunch of phones did it that
have it yeah so no it's gonna be
standard well that is going to bring
