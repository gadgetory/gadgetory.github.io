to you by Linda calm what's going on
guys the marked in Sangin from
TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be taking
a closer look at Android lollipop on a
mode of 360 Android bipolar pop is
slowly but surely being pushed out to
various of Android wear devices so if
you haven't received the update yet keep
pushing that check for update button and
I'm sure you'll get it in no time now
one of the first things I noticed with
this update was the drop-down overlay
used to just be the date and battery
percentage alongside the mute toggle but
what Android lollipop you get three
different options to choose from there's
show all which shows every notification
you receive there's priority mode where
only priority notifications come in and
there's none or mute to show nothing at
all there's also a few different modes
or settings to choose from within the
overlay there's theater mode which
essentially turns off the screen and the
vibration motor and the only way to turn
the screen on from here is to use the
side button of your SmartWatch there's
also sunlight mode which temporarily
maximizes the screens brightness so to
display is easier to see under harsh
lighting conditions last but not least
you have a quick shortcut for your
settings menu the update also includes
the ability to swipe a card back when
you accidentally dismiss it and I have
to admit it I've done that several times
over the weekend and I'm glad this
feature is finally here now when you tap
on a watch face you'll be prompted with
Google now which looks a bit different
in the enjoyed 5 point oh you have your
google now label and under that will be
your frequently used actions for a quick
access and I also notice that the color
palettes has changed just a bit to a
more flatter more material design look
now within the settings menu not much
has changed other than the addition of
accessibility where you can invert the
colors of the screen but other than that
everything else is just about the same
let's stop the video for just a quick

TechnoBuffalo Google will also release a
watch face API for developers which
gives users even more ways to express
their personal style while creating an
opportunity for developers to customize
the most prominent UI features of the
watches developers will be able to
change between 12 hour and 24 hour time
or change the watch faces background and
a background service to pull data like
weather and calendar events some of the
new watch faces that are available from
the play store right now unfortunately
only work for those who receive the
update some of these are extremely
beautiful and I love love the golden
beauty watch face which looks super
classy while giving the watch face that
mechanical timepiece feel there's
something like the us to watch faces
which includes four watch faces in 12 of
which includes weather information one
as a regular clock and the other that
includes your calendar events then
there's something like surf language
shows you live data from surf line surf
forecast sir it essentially displays the
tide time surf height wind speed and
direction straight to your SmartWatch
now when changing watch faces you get a
bit of a different look from previous
versions of Android where you now have a
recent section for your recently used
watch faces and you have all which shows
all of your watch faces in an
alphabetical order also with this update
you'll be able to download watch faces
from the google play store just like you
do with apps however you won't see an
app icon anymore as everything will be
under your Android wear app which is
pretty awesome less clutter in your app
drawer and more watch faces on your
SmartWatch the Android wear app has
changed just a bit too giving the
overall you I a material design look you
also have the option to choose your
watch faces from the app which I think
should have been there from the first
place the updated Android wear app also
allows you to enable or disable tilt to
wake which wasn't there in previous
versions and you'll also be able to see
your battery life including how much
time you have left and a breakdown of
usage by applications you can also check
how much storage is left on your
SmartWatch for apps and offline music
but other than that everything else is
about the same anyway since it for this
video guys I hope you guys enjoyed this

latest Android wear update if there's
