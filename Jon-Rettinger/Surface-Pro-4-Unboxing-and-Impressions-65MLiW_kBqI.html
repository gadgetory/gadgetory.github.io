TechnoBuffalo here at that unboxing from
the past of the Microsoft Surface pro 4
by the time you guys watch this I
already have used this for about two and
a half weeks oh hi future John I have no
idea what model we have in here what
specs SR this was given to us from
Microsoft at their launch event for the
surface pro 4 in the surface book and
the debut of the 2 Lumias so we can
learn together what specs are in here
but I can't tell you that it's going to
be in the price point from either $8.99
to 2700 dollars because that's the lower
end to the very high end of the surface
pro line I've been a huge fan of the
surface line surface pro line especially
for a while I use the surface pro 3
almost everyday at home do work I'm
sitting on the couch just playing with
my son so I'm really excited to see what
them this guy can do so I keep her
jabber at a while let's go ahead and
open it up and as a side note we also
have the surface pro 4 tech cover this
is not the one that has a fingerprint
sensor that's another model for about
$30 more let's even say to back $129 so
will unbox this guy afterwards and take
a look alright so I don't have to cut
anything is that a little handy pull tab
so I'm going to pull said tabs I have
one tab pulled you can count along with
me to tell I'm a father of a toddler and
I count with me I'll also do our
alphabet while we unbox this alright we
got that slit off
I got another pull tab hahaha there we
have the surface pro 4 it still still
magnesium but now it is thinner lighter
faster that is well that is really thin
push it off to the side real fast so
we're going to have inside of the box
we've got the new surface pen that you
put a battery in and it lasts for a year
they said and it seemed reasonable cuz
gotta replace ink so a lot of touch
points removable tips and all the rest
of stuff to either loved or just didn't
use with the original surface pen but if
you're a designer me me you really set
about this also now a new magnetic part
on the tablet somewhere where this guy
will just stick to right there and I'll
just stick and then probably inevitably
fall off soon after
let's push all this stuff off to the
side again
and assuming here we've got a power
brick let's see what this looks like we
have it's a power brick it's a brick for
power looks pretty similar to the last
one but you have a built-in inline USB
port and she prongs in and then the
proprietary surface port looks exactly
the same as the last gens so there's all
that business push all this off to the
side let's take a look at the surface
pro 4 and we can try learn together what
specs we have on here because I don't
know all right hello surface pro 4 look
at it's got a little Windows hello
smiley face there let me know that's
where it is and there's a camera
microphone power speaker USB 3.0 power
port and DisplayPort let's go and pull
this off this is really quite thin just
so you guys can see how thin this is
versat surface pro 3 here you go it's
thinner so again still clad in aluminum
so with the hinge that you can do
multiple points so you're not locked to
one or two kind of go all the way out
pretty close to two flat depending on
angle you are at so again running
Windows 10 that same magnesium casing
that the previous generations had it's
got Microsoft's calling pixel Sense
technology which and there's a lot of
pixels and very thin borders it's a
twelve point three one inch screen the
resolution of 2763 by 1824 unwaged a
diminutive one point seven three pounds
and before I move on to the next thing
and you guys yell at me I didn't mention
kilograms 786 of them power of this guy
you've got a ton different options all
six Gen Intel business either the core
m3 i5 or m7 you can configure this guy
up to different gigs of ram for eight or
sixteen they up to a terabyte to a
solid-state storage starts at 128 and
then goes to that one and again pricing
is going to be that nine hundred bucks
to about twenty seven hundred dollars so
if you walk around tablet we've got our
power button at the top volume up and
down there you've got you
hello cameras some ambient sensors in
your actual front-facing camera right
hand side if full-size USB 3.0 port
there is your display it's the power
port as well also the ton of accessories
you can use to plug this in to get
different configurations if you need
HDMI or ever you want to use to plug
into your monitor and then it just
stands up I'm gonna go ahead and turn it
on hello there surface pro 4 mind if I
buy okay sorry bad joke but you guys
more from me so you expect with my
videos the jokes are going to be bad
while that guy is booting up let's take
a look at the type cover if you're not
familiar with the type cover it is a
cover for your tablet that you can type
on this is a completely redesigned type
cover memory serves me correctly I can
also use this with the surface pro 3 and
you can see what this looks like it's
got a soft touch microfiber feel on the
back really thin it's got a glass
trackpad I believe with five point
multi-touch is larger the keys look
different than last generation they've
got a new mechanism below and you get
more of a natural keyboard feel I'll to
connect it it just kind of connected
cell via magnets and you can push this
up now you've got that angle for typing
so let's go ahead and set the sucker up
and come back when it's all done also
worth noting the keyboard on the type
cover is backlit so if you're using us
in a dark setting you can still type act
real eye on the light from your screen
sorry there's that alright so you got
this guy all set up let's see what kind
of computer is or what it's packing
we'll jump into settings we'll go to
system jump down to about and this
computer is Intel Core i5 clocked at 2.4
gigahertz we've got 8 gigs of RAM
install on 64-bit x64 LS Fe to Quebec so
it's the i-5 model with eight gigs Rams
kind of right right in the middle so I'm
going to go ahead and use this for the
next couple weeks and buy time this
video goes up I already have used it
already know how it performs and how it
works so I can't even say anything guys
want to see you in the comments I'm
gonna have to just imagine what you guys
can say and most of them probably not
appropriate until next time though I am
John Rancher from techno Buffett let's
has been an emboss
first look at the latest surface pro the
surface pro this many I'll see you guys
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
