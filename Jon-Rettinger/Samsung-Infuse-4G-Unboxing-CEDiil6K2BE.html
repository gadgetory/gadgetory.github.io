TechnoBuffalo here at than unboxing of
the 4.5 inch super phone the just
announced Samsung Infuse 4G for AT&amp;amp;T
let's go ahead and dig in alright so
let's take a quick look at the box there
is a picture of the device letting you
know that it is for gene we'll talk
about all the specs here that's the
HSPA+ variety slight device android 8
megapixel camera what's in the box we're
gonna see that and picture the device
and some legal mumbo-jumbo all around it
alright so let's dig in and take a look
at on the first 4.5 inch phones so
you've got a Quick Start Guide great
probably not many people are gonna look
then so throw it off to decide all right
so we got some more notifications same
stuff that was on the other side of the
box texting and driving it can wait it
can wait I'm going to tease you guys so
I'm gonna push this right off to the
camera and see that's my tease doing a
little dance doo doo doo doo HHH alright
push that up let's see what else we are
going to get in the box
I'm guessing is going to be a wall
charger and some USB business so this is
actually kind of nice a micro SD -
regular SD adapter kind of handy to have
in the box
we've got free $25 samsung media credit
I love to do this when I get samsung
devices there is that activation code
first person to use that gets free $25
samsung media hub credit there it is
considered a gift from the folks
TechnoBuffalo and me push it that off to
the side we've got some sort of crazy
dongle let's see what this is looks like
there's more in the box than meets the
eye
or usually would expect so we've got
look at that the mini HDMI they include
that in the bag that is really nice to
have Samsung included so if you want to
output to HDMI you are now going to be
able to alright so through
back in the bag now we got the standard
stuff so there's your charging cable
here's the wall charger the charging
cable goes into it's all standard
proprietary stuff we've got our non
proprietary stuff rather it is the
microUSB variety we're gonna have a pair
of stereo headphones with I'm assuming a
microphone there is a microphone it
actually looked to be a little higher
quality got some ears yells on alright
but that's not why you guys are here I
can already see the camera unboxing
starts at whatever so here is the actual
phone itself and go ahead and zoom in
texting and driving can wait we talked
about that the tease is over I mean
because I know that you guys love
stickers she's gonna go ahead and leave
this one on um Jessica
alright let's peel this off something I
can find it the sticker business putting
out the stickers bane of my existence
sometimes there we don't have any nails
boom and this guy does feel very thin in
the hand surprisingly despite the fact
that it's so big there's also a sticker
in the back I think the batteries can be
in here so I'll try and turn this thing
on
while I am running through the specs of
it and we'll talk about it and do size
comparisons and the rest of that
unboxing business alright so this is
going to be available for purchase for
AT&amp;amp;T or on AT&amp;amp;T May 15th for 199 bucks
so just under $200 it has a 4.5 inch
Super AMOLED plus display the resolution
of 400 by 800 the previous size King on
AT&amp;amp;T was the HTC built in spire which
was 4.3 inches we'll bring this guy in a
few minutes and do a size comparison so
this is 0.2 inches bigger it's being
powered by a second-generation
hummingbird processor clocked in at one
point two Gators don't let the fact that
single-core folia this guy is going to
be quite a screamer
oh really supposedly a very fast device
but of course I'll put it through the
test and be the judge of that we saw
that 4G branding on the box this is a 4G
device meaning it's got HSDPA plus cat
14 you might hear that term thrown
around
essentially this is going to give you
faster HSDPA plus a download
and HSUPA cat 16 the you standing for
uploads he'll get faster uploads as well
depending on what area you're in if
you're in HSPA+ area we go ahead and
flip this guy over or gal over depending
on what gender your phones are we're
gonna have an 8 megapixel camera on the
back with LED flash and it's also gonna
do autofocus it will record video in
720p but that's not the only camera this
guy has we also have a front-facing 1.3
megapixel shooter so that's kind of
Awesome
you're also gonna have an FM radio in
here kind of kind of dressing a 16 gigs
of internal memory for all your storage
business of course expandable with micro
sd you're going to have a 17 OH 1750
1750 milliamp hour battery to power this
guy quite a large battery which is nice
to see and all of that large battery and
large screen size is really any very
very thin package it extends from 8.9
millimeters at its thinnest down to 9.2
for its look it's got a bit of a hump
there you can see this is a really thin
device I'm actually very impressed with
how thin it actually is adage you have
one of the things you have to hold in
your hand to see 4.5 inches sounds huge
probably thinking I can never put that
in my pocket I can never hold this or
use it it actually does feel really nice
so I'm gonna go ahead and catch the
Internet this you guys are something to
look at and I'll do a quick size the
Bears alright so we are back and you are
looking at Android 2.2 with Samsung's
proprietary you I was on top of it are
you gonna get your seven home screens
you can go ahead and do all your
customizations you're gonna get some Sam
standard Samsung widgets in here a lot
of kind of cool ones there's some cool
live wallpapers as well some of them
that I really like to show you what
those are I don't know why I love the
the beach one I know what the batteries
suck and it's a killer but it's very
pretty to look at so I'm gonna put it on
my phone this is a demo unit sent by the
folks at AT&amp;amp;T so let's go ahead and do a
size comparison and see how big this guy
really is so if you're looking for a
larger screen phone and you're on AT&amp;amp;T
you might find yourself looking at the
she inspires well this is a 4.3 inch
device very similar in size to say the
HTC EVO out on Sprint so if you go ahead
and stack these two side-by-side
definitely appreciate the thinness here
of the device the in fuse is just really
really thin go ahead and see that right
there even at its thickest point still
really really thin you can see the size
difference to that extra 0.2 inches when
you go ahead and put it next to each
other if you're also on AT&amp;amp;T you may be
looking at let's say an iPhone 4 let me
go ahead and bring this guy in you guys
can see the size and thickness now the
iPhone 4 at one point was the thinnest
smartphone around but that was about six
months ago and that is no longer the
case now I have a 4.5 inch phone which
is extremely thin all right so let's do
a quick walk around and tour of the
device
pretty standard Android business here
you've got your four capacitive buttons
at the bottom got your menu your home
your back and your search got that down
and remember eyes now on the left hand
side volume rocker for rocking your
volume on the right hand side the pretty
much Samsung standard location for the
power and lock button charging port on
the bottom on the seeking port on the
bottom of the rest of that it's also
where your HDMI out is going to live so
keep that in mind
on the top 3.5 milimeter headset jack
you got a microphone on the back you got
a bit of a textured feel to it it's not
soft touch but it's a little bit of
great-looking seem like you're going to
drop the device that's where your camera
is your LED flash there's some speaker
business going on right on the hump and
if that is it this has been a first look
and an unboxing at the brand new Samsung
Infuse and I should looking so good
excited to test this guy put it through
its paces and see how it does and see if
it's the new king of AT&amp;amp;T is line up
Atrix or no way 2x this guy looks to be
a really impressive phone and one of the
ones that you really need to look at if
you're looking for a new smartphone on
AT&amp;amp;T so what do you guys think I am Jon
