to you by domain.com what's up everyone
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here
and walk back the pisode of ass the
buffalo got my special guest Lucille are
you guys have commented on her she is a
French Bulldog hangs out in the office
all the time every much every day for
the past three and a half years
sometimes she makes appearances on
camera so this week it's all about the
one plus his new announcement the one
plus two and some movie news our first
question comes from at Hari Oh Luis
Tejada who asks at John for lakers y 1
plus uses that invite system hashtag ask
the visa invite system I know was super
annoying to a lot of people it was like
an annoyance like up fly floating a
drink but they need to drink and realize
the fly and you look at it you know like
gross people did not like the invite
system i understand it everybody wanted
to buy this really reasonably priced
essentially flagship spect phone but
they couldn't because 1 plus have this
invite system but they did it for a
reason and a lot of times as consumers
you don't see the business side you
don't know how that sausage is made 1
plus for all intents and purposes to
start up they did not have this capital
of like Samsung and Apple LG even HTC so
they were using by systems every time
you got an invite a phone is actually
built the phones weren't built two
invites were sent out it's able to sort
of manage your cash flow that way so
they didn't end up before the doomsday
scenario of having thousands and
thousands of phone sitting in a
warehouse they're just appreciating day
after day after day phones of course are
depreciating assets as with really any
consumer electronics so they minimize
that risk that's for the business reason
for how it happened and 1 plus announced
earlier in the day that in fact if you
use the same invite system for the next
phone presumably called the 1+2
triggered all upset also now though
that's the one plus one now is invite
system free so you can just order one
and have it sent to you still one of the
better specs phones out there and still
incredibly reasonably priced so if it
helped enter question next one comes
from New neo Braga 97 to ask at John for
lakers also 1 plus related how do you
think the oneplus 2 will be fingerprints
quad HD so this is sort of a bits bit of
speculation I'm not entirely sure what
one plus is going to do they can go sort
of two divergent ways they can keep the
path they're already on which seems to
be pretty successful where you get
really flagship spec
for reasonable price or they can just go
and superphone it up for probably an
increased price my bet though with that
it'll be the former I think we're gonna
see a 5.5 inch phone to 1080p screen
using a Snapdragon 810 chip three gigs
of RAM rumors are some biometric scanner
built inside assume it's going to have a
fingerprint reader on it that's probably
be all you're going to see difference
wise it's not going to be running
cyanogen 12 it'll be running 1 plus his
own oxygen OS take a look at that she
seems pretty good and it's really just
lollipop with a few tweaks would be my
bet what we're gonna see you'll see the
improved camera as well I don't think
we're going to see the quad HD side of
things and that adds a lot of cost to
the phone in one posture and they want
to be cost sensitive I think we'll see a
bit of a price increase probably fifty
dollars or so versus where we're at for
the one plus one so I'm not giant but
certainly way less than you get if
you're buying something from your the
main manufacturers again your Samsung LG
is your apples let me stop real fast and
thank our peeps at domain.com it's a
place to go when the next great idea
hits it like in the middle of the night
to one-stop shopping for all your domain
name and web hosting email needs the
bank calm wants to hook you up with a
pretty sick off or save twenty percent
on domain names and web hosting would
use coupon code technobuffalo it's all
one word in caps at domain comms check
out when you think domains think
domain.com a last question comes from
our friend Taylor Allen 55 this one is
not one plush related at john for lakers
what's up with movie trailers these days
they contain lots of spoilers and show
so much footage terminator avengers etc
hashtag ask the bee they do if you
notice on TechnoBuffalo we've been
posting a lot of movie stuff mostly
because i love movies especially their
the geeky culture movies you know that
superhero movies of course terminator i
just i have a soft spot in my heart for
terminator so we've been doing a lot of
sort of movie news and yes the trailers
show a ton of footage avengers and i
went to the premiere the avenger so I
saw the whole movie trailer gives away a
lot of plot points the new terminator
genisys gave away a gigantic plot point
about John Connor which probably we
didn't need to know about they want to
get butts in the seats I think once you
get in the seeds they're hoping you're
gonna find something else you're going
to like but I hate especially at
comedies when you already know all the
jokes for they're coming to solve the
trailer find it very annoying speaking
of trailers
we actually just launched a YouTube
channel where all we're putting up or
movie trailers so in case you want to
get the latest that's coming out as it's
coming out I hit the button down below
and subscribe to it just movie trailers
you'll normally of my face up there
serve as they hit as it become public
will be uploading them just again
because we like movies and we enjoy
movies and we want you guys bill to see
them so it's a big tub scribe but if you
want the latest trailers as they come
out if you want a question feature NASA
buff oh it's pretty easy just send it to
me at John for lakers or at

see it usually pick three to four
questions pending on the week every guys
