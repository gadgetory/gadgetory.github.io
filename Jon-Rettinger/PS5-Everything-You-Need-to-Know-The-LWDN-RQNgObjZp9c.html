lowdown everybody I am Robert Rosenfeld
and today we're gonna do something a
little bit special we know the next
generation console from Sony is out
there it's on the horizon and enough
bits of information and rumors have
started to make its way online for us to
get a good idea of what this next-gen
console is really shaping up to be so
I've gone through all those reports I've
read the rumors and the fan speculation
and compiled everything into this video
to give you guys a good idea of what the
PS 5 is really shaping up to be then
what features it's gonna have and what
it's not here's the lowdown
we talked a few weeks ago about the
release date of the new Xbox console
most likely being sometime in 2020 and
it looks like the next-gen Playstation
will launch around then as well we've
heard many different rumors that we
could see the PS 5 way sooner than that
maybe even in 2019 / typically Sony and
even Microsoft don't want to cannibalize
the sales of their current consoles with
new releases and Sony CEO John Cordura
said himself if the ps4 is entering the
final phase of its life cycle and the
company is using the next three years to
prepare the next step hopefully enough
Hardware advancements will be made by
then to really warrant a big update for
the console and what we are expecting
from Sony in the PlayStation 5 is
something really big we don't know any
info on concrete specs right now but the
current rumors suggest that the PS 5
will run off of an AMD processor with an
8 for Xen CPU architecture and AM DS
upcoming Navi architecture for a
high-end and powerful GPU that will have
native 4k support and the ability to
display the next generation of gaming
graphics and with all of this power we
should also see an upgrade coming to
memory with a jump from the current 8
gigs in the ps4 pro to 12 or possibly 16
gigs of next generation ram even DDR 6
Ram in the new console storage capacity
in the new PS 5 should also greatly
increase we could see a baseline storage
of at least a few terabytes and possibly
the ability to option up even more an
SSD technology could also make its way
into this new console as capacity goes
up and prices go down it would be a
great addition to this next gen console
this would especially be important if
Sony does decide to axe the disk drive
we don't know yet if that's going to
happen or not
but we'll talk about that a little bit
more in a minute all of this new
hardware would not only go to power the
latest and greatest games but it may
also be used to provide a much more
immersive experience for psvr version 2
reports indicate that Sony is heavily
investing in the future of VR and that
the PS 5 will have much more of the
technology built into the system to
power the psvr
meaning an additional box or extra
external processors and cables would not
be needed making the whole experience a
little less clunky we're also hearing
that the new version of psvr may have a
higher risk
and headset hgr supports in a wider
field of view to provide a more
immersive experience and it looks like
Sony will most likely follow suit with
Microsoft in heavily bolstering their
gaming selection and their cloud
computing power of their game streaming
service PlayStation now and the service
currently streams over 500 ps3 and ps4
games to your Sony console or PC this
number will probably grow to a much
larger collection in the coming years as
game streaming becomes more widely
adopted and we talked about how the
rumored X cloud streaming service would
have the cloud computing power to stream
new titles and high quality and low
latency and we're assuming that PS now
will work in the same way in the next
few years
getting some beefy processing upgrades
and data centers to handle this kind of
game streaming but this would also mean
that the average home broadband
connection will need to get much faster
especially a 4k streaming is the
standard for these new consoles but with
the improvement from ISPs as far as feed
goes and coverage and the new next
generation 5g tech into new cities this
will hopefully mean that speeds at home
will get a lot better in the next few
years we're still a bit off from 2020 so
we don't know if the console is going to
get a design refresh or what its
particular starting price point will be
but here's where the conversation with
you guys comes in what you guys think of
the PS 5 and what the rumors suggest
it's shaping up to be do you hope that
game streaming is what's next for gaming
consoles do you hope the PS 5 will have
a particular feature or a particular
design leave a comment down below and as
always send us a video message on
Twitter or Instagram for your chance to
be featured on the next episode of the
lowdown and before we wrap up today in
the last episode of the lowdown Tech one
TV said that the perfect budget Apple
laptop would require just a bit of
tweaking with the current models
they said this no need for new laptop
kill the MacBook Air and make the back
book 12-inch thicker to add one USB port
and add an SD card slot that's the dream
check one TV that's the dream but
knowing Apple it's probably just not
gonna happen that's all I've got for
today's special edition of the load on
