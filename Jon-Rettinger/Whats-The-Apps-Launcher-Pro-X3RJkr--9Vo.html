brought to you by carbonite well hello
there what's going on what's going down
yeah Oh awesome that's pretty cool it's
John Q here from TechnoBuffalo and
welcome to what's the apps I spent the
last couple of episodes talked about iOS
based stuff you know iPhone iPad mm-hmm
kind of thing so I think it's fair to
jump back on to Andrew so for this
episode of WT a acronym right there I'm
gonna be talking about my favoritest
Android application launcher pro and yet
I favoritest isn't a word I know I know
that favoritest it's not a word to me
launch pro embodies what Android is all
about it's a slick and lightweight
application that's designed and
developed to customize and maximize the
user experience and oh man that sounded
really cool right there but I think I
kind of ruined it by saying all the
stuff that followed up after that but
that's fine we can pretend it never
happened
yes all right that is pretend pretend
good pretend launcher pro serves as a
home screen alternative I had the HTC
Incredible S for a little bit so I got
to experience since UI first hand the
design of sensor wide gorgeous beautiful
amazing but yeah it was just really
really laggy at least in my opinion I
loaded up launcher pro and it fixed it
right away and that's something I really
recommend you guys do as well if you
experience like unsent see why I totally
show you everything on screen but I sold
the phone about two weeks ago so we're
just gonna have to play pretend for a
little bit besides dramatically
improving performance the amount of
customization you can do with mantra Pro
is astonishing first of all unlike
sensor y-you can have up to five icons
in the dock if that wasn't enough you
can have more dots up to three giving
you a total of 15 icons you can also
customize the number of home screens
home screen transitions number of
columns show the count of unread
messages
customize the dark skin hide the
notification bar hide icon labels hide
applications you don't like change the
size of on screen widgets very handy all
the
fun-filled advanced options do this
really really cool trick a bunch of
other stuff and oh yes use the thing in
fudge in landscape mode oh yes
personally I prefer a really really
basic setup three home screens one dock
and a reduced app list I cannot tell you
how handy that was on the HTC Incredible
S as it had tons of Belle bloatware on
it like Belle TV or some sort of weird
golf game and again
we got to pretend here launched a pro
comes with this own set of widgets but
this is Android here a lot of people
including myself
our fans of that oh so fabulous Sense UI
clock unfortunately the default
application doesn't have it but you can
pick up an add-on called LP sin skin +
clock widget at the market for a pretty
okay price and it works flawlessly
that's what I'm talking about
you can also backup all of your settings
onto your memory card you know just in
case something happens speaking up just
in case something happens not so smooth
transition right there but but that's
okay I want to take some time to give a
shout out to Carbonite computer
disasters happen eventually to everyone
you computer crashes it gets infected
with the virus you drop it theft fire
etc but if you get carbonite online
backup before your disaster happens and
no need to worry my friends because all
of your files will be backed up
automatically and safely off-site and
it's really easy to get them back plus
you get anytime anywhere access to your
back to files from any computer or even
on your smartphone or iPad with a free
Carbonite app cool with Carbonite
unlimited backup from your Mac or PC is
just $59 a year that's less than five
dollars a month Wow but when you use the
offer code techno that's Tec HNO to
start your free 15 day trial you'll get
two months free if you decide to buy all
of the details can be found at
carbonite.com and remember to use the
offer code techno that's te CH n o to
get two months free with purchase i've
never experienced any issues with
launcher pro of anything since you I
gave me more of a headache than launcher
pro best of all this thing is free yes
it is free indeed there is a paid
version which gives you extra Sense UI
widgets highly recommended but not in
this
so for that reason and all of the
wonderful stuff I mentioned mantra Pro
five out of five if you don't have this
on your Android phone then you are
seriously missing out well I hope you
guys enjoyed my review of launcher pro
and seriously check out this application
it's really really that good and after
everything I said if you still don't
want to check out launcher Pro for some
unknown reason then we we don't got
anything left to talk about man that's
for true right there like that under
snap properly there we go like that just
cut in this one John Q from
TechnoBuffalo thank you very much for
checking out my review and I'll see you
guys next time
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
