s2 and thinking that thing looks really
nice what it needs is more cowbell
Samsung's got more cowbell for you with
the gear s3 number one driver and sales
for samsung for the gear s2 was
beautiful design and look and they took
a very if it ain't broke don't fix it
approach with the gear s3 this is a
better looking version of an already
really good-looking watch it's gonna be
available in two different design
languages classic or frontier the
classic is gonna have bluetooth and
Wi-Fi and the frontier is going to be a
bit more rugged have an active look in
different design choices also going to
have Bluetooth and LTE models available
design UI is I think where Samsung
really shines
Garrus 2 hadn't always on this boy but
they upped it with the gear s3 you don't
have 16 million Super AMOLED colors on
there always on display to create a
really immersive experience and of
course that's gonna work with a variety
of watch faces as well talking about
specs on a watch seems a bit silly but
in case you're wondering it's a 1.3 inch
Super AMOLED circular display with no
spare tire at the bottom IB 68 is here
on board as well but the flagship
feature for me is the addition of
Samsung pay on a watch if you've used
Samsung pay on one of their phones it
kind of seems like a paying magic trick
and the very same philosophy is here as
well just hold down the back button and
carousel of cards gonna pop up choose
the one you want tap it to the terminal
and you are done it's going to work for
NFC transactions and also for magnetic
strip which is a really kind of cool
thing meaning it's going to work at like
95% of all terminals even wear things
like Apple pay will not work so the
Tizen ecosystem is relatively new when
the gear s2 launch didn't launch with a
cadre of apps but Samsung thinks they
fixed that with the gear s3 expect by q4
to be over 10,000 apps and watch faces
if you decide to opt for a version that
has its own data and it will work with
all four major carriers give it'll do
things like Spotify on-the-go able to
make HD voice phone calls right from
your watch all kinds of other phone
things that you'll never you have to
carry the phone in your pocket for the
watch looks and feels really premium it
kind of has a Rolex II look to it
judging by the bezels looking for a
SmartWatch committee doesn't look like a
piece of technology if it looks more
like a piece of jewelry like traditional
watches this is a really good option to
consider
felt good in the hand it felt
significant it's a little bit thicker
than you expect most more watch to be
but inside of that it does have a 380
million power battery with wireless
charging so you should be able to easily
get through a full day to two days with
your watch keeping this guy hopefully
scratch 3 is going to be Gorilla Glass 3
so if you put your hand in your pocket
don't worry about it hitting your keys
you should at least in theory be ok this
is a real first look at the Samsung gear
s 3 it boils down to this TL DW did
didn't watch the whole thing
it looks premium it feels premium
there's now app support I don't mind
that it's not Android wear as long as
you denote occations I'm pretty happy if
the LTE versions do a lot of things now
and Samsung pay built-in to the watch
with the MST technology that's the
technology look you just put it up to
the card reader is really incredible
those are features that you want in a
SmartWatch look no farther than the gear
s3
but if maybe the gear s2 still catches
your fancy Samsung's still gonna sell
that cuz you know sometimes people want
things different variety it's the spice
of life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
