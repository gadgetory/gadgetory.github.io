from TechnoBuffalo here in a previous
video we unbox and demonstrate for you
the Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime the
world's first quad-core tablet on the
market I talked about the price which is
going to be $4.99 or $5.99 depending on
the 32 or 64 gigabyte models and I also
mentioned a hundred and $49 docking
station so let me go ahead and unbox
this docking station and you can decide
if it's a good match to accompany
quad-core tablet
alright so here is the docking station
which can not only add a keyboard but
can also improve your battery life by up
to 6 hours and charge the tablet it'll
get 12 hours default battery from the
Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime battery
and this will add six hours additionally
bringing it up to 18 so let's go ahead
and open this sucker up I'll use my
unboxing nail here if I can or finger
there we go alright so the plastic is
torna go ahead and open this up boom
alright so let's go ahead and see what
this looks like pull off the top and
here is the keyboard dock a much thinner
and lighter than previous generation
keyboard docks we've seen in the past go
ahead and pull off all the plastics
there appears to be quite a bit of it
alright plastic it's harder than it
looks
sometimes brute force is just the best
way to go all right pull all the stuff
off to the side you're going to have
inside the box as well some warranty
information and a cleaning cloth a
cleaning cloth also will come with your
tablet but in case you have EE greasy
fingers you can go ahead and use that to
clean it alright so let's take a look at
the tablet dock itself which is
considerably lighter and thinner again
than we see in the past so in addition
to having a keyboard you're also getting
Mouse control here which is quite nice
you can dock and charge your pad for up
to 18 hours of battery life you get a
full QWERTY keyboard as I just mentioned
and you get easy file sharing with the
built-in SD card and USB port so we'll
take a look at that in just a second
let's see what this keyboard feels like
it's got relatively decent key throw to
it it's not full size but it's very
close it's gonna probably translate to a
pretty enjoyable typing experience but
of course we'll test it and let you know
if it's going to be worth your $150 I've
got some typical Android controls here
in addition to regular keyboard controls
so you've got a home button right there
and you've got your Android menu button
we're also gonna have full arrow keys
which could be great for gaming or who
do a lot of spreadsheets if you're on an
airplane or in class that's going to be
very helpful and of course for taking
notes this is going to be a really nice
addition and of course you can lock it
as well
alright so we talked about other ports
and expandability let's take a look at
those other ports and expandability here
so there is where the charging is going
to happen it uses the same a proprietary
charger that your iPad transformer prime
is going to use on the right hand side
this is where some of the action is
going to happen so you've got a full
size SD card here some of your
photographers might appreciate that or
you video nuts or folks you just like
bigger expandable media you're gonna
have that option you're also gonna have
a full and functional USB port here as
well with this sure to be lost rubber
stopper that lives in there so this will
expand your battery up to 18 hours so if
your tablet is dying you go ahead and
plug it on in seeking a plug it on in
let's go ahead and do that and see what
it looks like I happen to have here the
soozee Pad Transformer Prime let's go
ahead and turn it on you can see that
beautiful IPS screen there is not only
charging ports also one of the dock
connectors so go ahead and make sure
this is in the unlocked position this
lever can move left or right to lock it
in place we'll go ahead and try and
slide it in when I review the first epad
transformer the dock a notoriously gave
me trouble I'm hoping that this is going
to be a bit of a better experience
trying to get this to work so we'll do
it for the first time see if we can get
this to function
alright so every now and then and some
unboxing reviews we come across some
interesting things here are the
instructions that we actually had a
reference and what you guys didn't see
was about the 20 minutes that elapsed
between when the video ended and when it
begins right now here are the
instructions it looks like you would
just drop it in place what they don't
tell you however is that on the bottom
of the tablet here these two slots were
actually filled with these very hard to
remove rubber stoppers in each of those
two slots meaning when those rubber
stoppers are in the tablet's not going
to dock and there's no indication in the
instructions that you're supposed to
remove them they look like they're
actually part of the tablet themselves
so the docking doesn't work so consider
yourself warned to know that when you do
get your tablet you are going to want to
dock that now once you do eventually
realize that see there's a little bit of
an arrow on the bottom there's an arrow
here on the dock itself and you should
at least be theory now be able to snap
it right into place and indeed you can
do that so it's asking me if I want to
shut down I'm gonna go ahead and cancel
and now I can actually use the keyboard
dock on the Asus Eee Pad Transformer
Prime so I bring this up a little bit
and show you what things are gonna look
like on how it's gonna look when you new
your navigation so you've got I'll move
this so you can see you've got your full
trackpad here which is actually going to
correspond to a mouse on the keyboard
and it works pretty well the mouse you
can't probably see but the cursor looks
just as it would on a computer so I'd go
ahead and go down to home and if I
select it I can click and I can go ahead
and jump
home want to take a look at applications
I can go ahead and take a look at
applications so let's say I want to try
typing something for example so I'll go
ahead and jump into browser we haven't
configured it for Wi-Fi yet but will
give us the ability to use a keyboard so
we'll go ahead and just hit OK Brad your
connections unavailable
let's go ahead and see what the keyboard
feels like now then I'm typing and it's
pretty quick the letters are showing up
instantaneously there isn't any sort of
lag things you just seem to be working
the arrow navigation are a little bit on
the small side but definitely works
we'll go ahead and hit the home button
it's been a very quick unboxing of
course we'll do a full review and
demonstration of the keyboard dock in a
little bit in a coming video so go ahead
and close this up you can see what it
looks like really is a thin package it
feels like a little bit of a heavier
netbook I've got a very nice look and
feel to it and of course the top matches
the bottom so it almost looks like a
full tablet this you could definitely
carry with you to class you could take
it with you to work to take notes or you
could watch videos or movies on a plane
and perhaps not even have to bring a
laptop so I am John renter from
TechnoBuffalo this has been an unboxing
of the $149 Asus Eee Pad Transformer
Prime keyboard dock I'll see you guys
the next video stay tuned for a ton more
coverage of the Asus Eee Pad Transformer
Prime
