TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing I am
really excited about living inside of
this UPS envelope is perhaps one of the
hottest phones of 2013 this is the HTC
one this 1080p rockin full aluminum body
phone packs a lot of punch let's go
ahead dig in see how it performs alright
so here we've got the HTC one let's go
ahead and dig and this is an unboxing
that I am really looking forward to I
should say though HTC claimed that this
was not the final shipping unit so what
we're gonna see inside here I'm guessing
isn't gonna be the full retail packaging
but the phone should be good we do not
have a version that's going to work with
18 T's LTE what we've got here is a
European version but we should alright
so this box is clearly not going to be
what you're gonna get when you pick it
up from your AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile your
Sprint store and over here you're going
to get us is a pre-release box the phone
again should be exactly what you're
gonna get when you get it from the store
so we just slide off the sleeve this is
a European version so it does not have
support for AT&amp;amp;T LTE network here we'll
take that out of the box and push it off
the side for just a quick second so it
also we've got in here got a sync cable
we've got some stickers we got a wall
wart got a sim removal tool and we've
got some pretty cool looking headphones
actually but that's not the reason
you're here I've got a little red
earbuds on it we want to take a look at
the HTC One let's pull this guy out of
the packaging the first time I'm really
holding this thing and it feels
tremendous on the hand it feels
incredibly solid HTC has always had
awesome build quality is what looks to
be the culmination of all those years of
building phones so I'm gonna go and
power it on see if it's got enough juice
to kick on it will run through all the
specs of this guy quietly brilliant so
what you see power on right there is a
4.7 inch HD display so that's 1920 by
1080 give you an a crazy PPI of 469 it's
running Android 4.1.2 at launch but HTC
has said that it will try and support
other versions of Android moving
forwards hopefully 4.2 and whatever
comes next
being powered by 1.7 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon chip that's the Snapdragon
600 Feliz you keeping track at home 2
gigs of RAM Sena coming either 32 or 64
gig configurations not sure which one
we've got here on the back is that ultra
pixel camera that a lot of people have
been talking about really excited to
check that out it's got a front-facing
HD camera that can shoot Full HD video
Wi-Fi here not something I usually talk
about but it's 802 11 a BGN and AC which
is the new standard most people don't
even have HD at home but this phone will
sort of be forward proofed it's got a
2300 milliamp power battery sealed in
the back it's got NFC from dimension
standpoint it's 5.41 inches by 2.6 9
inches by 0.3 seven weighing five point
four ounces or a hundred and three
grams so I'm gonna go ahead and go
through the setup process here and I'll
come back in just a moment we'll do a
quick tour of the phone alright so we've
got the HTC One all booted up here and
you are looking at Sense 5 and this is
blinkfeed we'll talk about that a little
bit later let's do a quick tour of this
gorgeous looking phone on the left hand
side boom we don't really have much
other than the SIM slot looks to be a
micro sim on the right hand side shibam
we've got a volume up and down rocker it
looks to be kind of flushed to the side
though that might be difficult it's
actually fine with your thumb when
you're using it on the top of the phone
we've got a 3.5 millimeter headset jack
and living kind of oddly on the
left-hand side of the device is the
power and lock button on the front we've
got ambient light sensors a giant
speaker grille right there there's your
front-facing camera speaker in the front
down below for boom sound that's kind of
interesting and if you look at the phone
we power it on we've got to physical
capacitive buttons down here not a third
one you got a back button and a home
button we don't have a multitasking
button but if you want to access
multitasking you can go ahead and double
tap that and they'll show you what your
most recent apps are keep gonna fight
the urge to tap that HTC logo but it is
not a button the back is where the ultra
pixel camera is gonna live Beats Audio
brand you
because this does have support for Beats
Audio on the bottom we've got ambient
noise cancelling microphone and the
charging and syncing port so let's go
ahead and power this guy back on we're
gonna do a full overview here of sense 5
we can take a look at how different
things look so what we've got here is
blinkfeed this is gonna pull in all
kinds of news of different sources and
technical buffle actually should be here
relatively soon let's see what kind of
apps are gonna have and you can should
you can customize rather how many
applications show on your screen looks
like they're not showing all that many
there aren't that many to show here
doesn't look to be any sort of bloatware
at all I can go ahead and check out
custom and select all kinds of different
options we will go back let's go ahead
and find settings somewhere here and
take a look at some of the stuff the
phone has so this is very familiar for
sense if you've used sense for point X
on the droid DNA or other phones it
should be very familiar so let's see
what we've got with software information
all right so we are running Android
4.1.2 and it sends five you can see the
software number that's on here as well
go ahead and hit home so we're gonna do
a full overview of everything here on
this device we're gonna cover the camera
we're gonna cover blinkfeed wearing your
comparisons of device and all kinds of
other goodness anything you guys want to
see about the HTC one be sure to let us
know and only when I feel I know the
phone well enough what we do our full
review let's bring in some other phones
for some good size comparisons here is
the iPhone 5 you can see the difference
between that 4.7 and the 4 inch screen
if you ever held an iPhone 5 you know
the way it feels with that aluminium
back it feels really solid the HTC One
really feels the same way so you can see
what those two look like when they are
stacked next to each other so there is
HTC One and the iPhone 5 let's bring in
a cousin here is the Droid DNA see those
two is a 5-inch 1080p screen versus the
4.7 those guys excited by sigh got the
Verizon red banding all that kind of
business and we do our overview of Sense
5 we'll also bring in sense 4 on the DNA
to show you what that looks like
here is the blackberry z10 side-by-side
doing a little bit's tackiness next to
each other let's bring in
the Galaxy s3 you can see what these two
look like very different build materials
here we got the plastic on the s3 and
the full metal on the HTC one there are
those two and lastly let's go ahead and
bring in the Nexus 4 here these two and
the bill collectors for is really
outstanding as well you can see these
two side-by-side I really see the
thinness and appreciate it than this of
the HTC one so thank you guys for
watching and give this video a thumbs up
if you want to see more from the HTC one
and again anything you guys want to see
further let us know we're gonna do a
full software and hardware overview and
upcoming videos just want to show you
