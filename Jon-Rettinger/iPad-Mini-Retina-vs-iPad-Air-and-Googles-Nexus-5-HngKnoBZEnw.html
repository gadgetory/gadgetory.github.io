to you by loot crate hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me ashley's gather any question you
might have across the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo calm
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise you can send them to
me on twitter any time of the day or
night at TechnoBuffalo or at Ashley ask
evah just use the hashtag ask the be so
I can see it usually I answer between
three and five questions every episode
so let's get answering because this is
ask the Buffalo
Kyle Judd asks dear Ashley product
launches are often spoiled weeks in
advance by numerous amounts of leaks how
would you feel / react if a company
decided to purposely leak a fake device
so that everyone would be completely
thrown off by the real device on launch
day Thanks this is actually a really fun
question because I do love the idea of
all of these companies all these
manufacturers totally pranking us by
leaking fake cases fake screens like all
this stuff but there's kind of a
two-pronged issue with this number one
it's expensive because you know you have
to make that little fake phone and then
you have to hopefully at some point
maybe you fake that it works so there's
a lot that goes into that and the other
thing is is it's really hard to not know
which one is the real one based on the
amount of leaks so you're still gonna
see those leaks from factories saying
okay hey well here's you know the the
new screen for the iPad or hears you
know this piece from this home button
from this device and the thing is is
there's no way to really spot that
avalanche so I think OEM is having this
like sort of side small Avalanche
compared to this like huge avalanche of
actual leaks makes it a little bit
impossible but I am totally off for it I
think it'd be hilarious Josh asks hey
Ashley which ipad would you choose
between the ipad air or the ipad mini
with retina display this is a question i
got all week this week it's a tough
choice i am having the same problem
choosing between the ipad air which is
very very light now at one pound and the
ipad mini with retina which is the
portability that I wanted and the
display that I wanted but here's the
thing so I've been thinking a lot about
this and for one hundred dollars cheaper
than an ipad air you can get an ipad
mini with the exact same specs and
that's different than last year's iPad
Mini which was running on a processor
that was one generation behind the ipad
4 so i think if you have the ability to
get the exact same specs a better
resolutions you're getting better ppi on
the ipad mini with retina because
they're the same resolution and the ipad
air is bigger you're spending less money
and also the exact same specs so
honestly for me I think
it's gonna be the ipad mini with retina
so that's my choice twitter user at
Icarus son 18 asks hi Ashley do you
think HTC will make another version of
the one max that will have better specs
hashtag ass the bee this is kind of a
tough question because obviously HTC is
going to make better phones going
forward and they're going to have
updated specs I don't know that the one
max is gonna see an update with specs
however we may see something like the
butterfly s which had better specs than
the one so we may not see it everywhere
globally but it is of course possible
that will see a phone like that I think
HTC unfortunately is struggling a little
bit this year at the other day I would
like to see an HTC One max with better
specs I don't know that that's gonna
happen sorry twitter user at canine
freak 20 asked where's the nexus 5 with
a lot of question marks I don't know I
don't make them here at the office um
which you know that we're wondering the
same thing I think it's about time for
Google to sort of roll out the nexus 5
in the 2nd gen Nexus 10 we're all pretty
surprised this week when the event that
Google is having turned out not to be
the nexus event because it would have
been a great way to sort of steel a
little bit of apples thunder with the
ipad event but who knows i mean last
year if i recall correctly and i could
be wrong I think that the nexus event
was the release of the devices were in
november or maybe even early december
now that I'm thinking about it but it
was a little later in the year so don't
fret I don't think anything's wrong I
think that they are maybe just making a
couple of final tweaks before there are
fully prepared to release it and really
that's what you want at the end of the
day you want it to be done when it's
ready not done based on a hard date kind
of like the blizzard model where they
say well it's done when we're when we
feel it's done when it's ready to
release we don't like to say Owen two
years this game is going to come out on
this date because then either you delay
it which stinks or you end up you end up
pushing to get everything done before
that day if it's not ready and then
you'll launch with not so great of a
product so it'll be done when it's ready
and that should make you very happy I
got to interrupt the show really fast
bring your word from this week sponsor
loot crate as a geek who likes shiny new
things I'm a big fan of buying myself
stuff and every year on Christmas and my
birthday I think to myself why can't I
have things every single month and get
amazing stuff well guess what loot crate
totally answered my call for monthly
presents so here's how loot crate works
you sign up you pay for a 13 or six
month subscription and every month you
get a lootcrate just like this every
month has a different theme with a
variety of items in the box and this
month's theme was survived so zombies it
had a super awesome ewoking dead t-shirt
look at how amazing that is I'd also had
card a book another fun little gifts
inside it previous crates about
companies like Marvel Nintendo and even
Blizzard getting in on the action and
getting a crate honestly feels like a
little materialistic hug to yourself
every month which I am a big fan of if
you want to sign up that's awesome just
head over to loot crate calm / techno
and you get ten percent off of your
first order a subscriptions are less
than 20 bucks a month including shipping
and you get an additional discount if
you sign up for longer subscription
lengths that's loot crate calm / tech
