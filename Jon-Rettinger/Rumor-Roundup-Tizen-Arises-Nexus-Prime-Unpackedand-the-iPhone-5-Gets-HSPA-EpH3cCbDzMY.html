to you by Squarespace
what is Tizen and what might it mean for
the future of Android running on Samsung
handsets they've got a big event going
on at CTA San Diego in just a couple of
weeks we finally see the first Android
Ice Cream Sandwich device unpacked
at CTIA and we all know the iPhone 5 is
finally coming set to be launched this
coming Tuesday October 4th all this
coming up right now from the Intel app
up elements conference in Seattle it's
TechnoBuffalo room around
hey what is going on everybody I'm Noah
Kravitz editor-at-large for
TechnoBuffalo and I am here at the Intel
app up elements conference in Seattle
Washington bringing you this week's
installment of rumor roundup this is the
rumor roundup for the week ending today
Friday September 30th 2011 this week's
episode of the roundup on revision3 is
brought to you by Squarespace alright
the big news coming out of this
conference this week is Tizen Tizen is
what Mego used to be but now Samsung's
involved huh
well it's still a little bit confusing
but basically Mego was a Linux based
platform that is probably best known for
showing up on Nokia's n9 which you know
was the phone that was released to
coincide with Nokia basically announcing
hey forget me you go forget sim you know
forget all that stuff we're going with
Windows Phone 7 still the device which
was shipped just a select few countries
not including the United States has
gotten rave reviews for its sexy design
and the inherent usability and kind of
coolness of the operating system well
Intel now has a big-time partner in the
mobile space and Samsung and they've
used the app web elements conference to
announce the birth of Tizen Tizen is a
new mobile platform that you know it's
kind of unclear but basically it's going
to take elements of Mego it might be
built on the Samsung bada OS kernel kind
of unsure what's going on but the rumor
here is that this all you know the
timing of this was not accidental
Samsung announced that bada is going
open-source and Samsung also just
announced they've reached a deal with
Microsoft to pay Microsoft $10 per
Android phone that they make it's part
of this whole ongoing patent war thing
that's threatening to take over a
technology world in general but
basically Microsoft claiming that
because of patent infringement they're
due a royalty on any Android phone
that's sold and they were asking for 15
bucks a phone Samsung struck a deal 10
bucks
and the same day they announced that
Tyson was also announced rumors that the
first Tyson phones may be launched as
soon as Mobile World Congress next
February so what does this all mean
couldn't mean nothing but it could mean
that Samsung is trying to roll their own
OS which they already haven't bought it
but trying to roll it on a bigger scale
and looking maybe to pull back from
their Android involvement with all the
patent stuff going on with the fact that
they now have to pay Microsoft royalties
and with everything Google's been doing
with Motorola Mobility buying them it
would stand to reason that a company
like Samsung a company like HTC for that
matter might be looking to say hey you
know what we don't know where Google's
going with this whole thing with
Motorola we got to make sure we're
covered
let's get another partner oh I don't
know Intel they're huge and also you
know Intel hasn't really done much in
the mobile space Mego hasn't exactly set
the world on fire I look for more on
Tizen coming later this year with the
first alpha release of the platform and
then next year like I said February
Mobile World Congress we could see the
first Tizen devices perhaps from Samsung
speaking of Samsung they have sent out
invites to their next unpacked event
which will be taking place on October
11th at CTIA San Diego our own John
Rhett enger' will be live on the scene
at CTA bringing you all the news
including whatever Samsung is unpacking
and the rumor which makes a ton of sense
is that they will be unpacking the Nexus
Prime aka galaxy prime aka the first
Android Ice Cream Sandwich device to
grace Planet Earth with its sweet sticky
goodness that sounds funny I had some
good ice cream at the insult party last
night there were sour cherry popsicles
with vanilla ice cream on the inside
really good anyway Samsung's been doing
these unpacked events at all the big
mobile shows recently and also some of
them on their own they did one I was at
in Barcelona earlier this year with the
galaxy s2 line and now it looks like
they may be unveiling the Nexus Prime if
you recall lots of rumors about this
phone the first and first Android Ice
Cream Sandwich phone really high spec
device set to launch on Verizon Wireless
first which makes a lot of sense because
the other three big US carriers AT&amp;amp;T
Sprint and t-mobile all have
their own galaxy has two devices now
Verizon doesn't have one and that that
may well be because they're sitting on
prime set to be unpacked according to
the rumors but I believe him
October 11th in San Diego at CTIA stay
tuned to TechnoBuffalo whatever is
unpacked there John Rhett enger' will
have his hands his eyes and his video
camera on it so we'll bring it to you
ice cream mmm ice cream sounds good hey

te CH 0 and the number 9 to get your
free two week trial of Squarespace and
finally the iPhone 5 is almost upon us
thank goodness we can put these rumors
to rest we love the rumors but you know
it's on something else and China Unicom
has come out and said that they believe
the iPhone 5 will support 4G in the form
of HSPA+ running at the full 42 megabits
per second now this is interesting
because in the u.s. t-mobile is the only
carrier to currently support the full-on
HSPA+ 42 earlier this week they launched
their first HSPs 42 devices but t-mobile
looks like they will not be getting the
iPhone 5 in fact a t-mobile executive
posted an open letter recently this past
week which to me was one of the sex
things I've ever read it was basically
saying we've told Apple we want it we
support on
the iPhones why won't they give it to us
I don't know anyway
stayin clear from that but the
interesting thing is that China Unicom
saying they'll be getting in HSPA+ 42
iPhone 5 which you know means that the
technology is there for a similar device
to run on t-mobile in the US and it also
speaks to the question at least in a
rumor land about there being an LTE
version of the iPhone 5 it looks like
probably not you never know we are we
are kind of placing bets that there'll
be one world version of the iPhone 5
they'll have a dual mode chipset that
will support CDMA as well as GSM 4G
implementations on both this point looks
like probably not an LTE version but
I'll tell you what an LTE iPhone running
on Verizon's network in the US and HSPA+
42 iphone for that matter running on
t-mobile's network here in the u.s.
works support it would be blazing fast
and I personally would like one
so Tim Cook if you're listening and you
haven't decided yet there's still a
chance just roll them out LTE HSPA+ 42
china unicom t-mobile USA Verizon just
hit everybody up with them the more
iPhones on the market the more choices
people have and the more incentive for
non iPhone phone makers to kick their
game into high gear Nexus Prime Ice
Cream Sandwich we want to welcome a big
welcome tie loss ties iOS help joining
