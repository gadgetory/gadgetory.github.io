Sangin from technobuffalo and this is
Motorola's latest budget smartphone the
2015 Moto G I've had the chance to use
this phone for about a week and a half
and I think it's time to give you guys
our final thoughts on motorola's latest
budget smart Motorola unveiled several
new phones late last month during an
event in New York City and while we were
really excited to see the new flagship
Moto X device it was really hard to be
that excited about the Moto G however
after playing with a new device for a
few days my expectations change it's
actually a really good device despite it
being an entry-level smartphone inside
the Moto G we have a quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 410 processor 8 gigabytes or
16 gigabytes of expandable storage up to
32 gigabytes one gigabyte or two
gigabytes of RAM a 5-inch 720p display a
two thousand seven hundred forty million
battery and it finally supports 4G LTE
but in return lacks NFC onboard the Moto
G isn't the best looking phone on the
market though it's also not the worst
you've seen it's not crafted out of
high-end materials like aluminium or
glass and is instead a mostly plastic
and very plasticky feeling device before
a 220 dollar smartphone you can't expect
it to have the best features and
hardware the design change is very
refreshing in my opinion the back now
features a crosshatch texture instead of
the matte finish from previous
iterations and it's still removable and
swappable you can choose from 10
different colors and each backplate will
only cost you fifteen dollars which
seems like a pretty reasonable price to
me opening up the back you'll actually
see rubber gaskets along the top of the
cover which helps protect the phone from
moisture drop it into puddle or the
toilet and you should be fine we took it
for a quick swim and it didn't run into
any issues but you're running the risk
of damaging the phone should the back
cover pop off after removing the back
panel you'll be able to pop in your sim
card and also expand your storage via a
microSD card for up to 32 gigabytes
though a 64 gigabytes microSD card we
tested work just fine probably the
weakest part of the new Moto G would
have to be to display it's still a
5-inch 720p display and it's not the
prettiest display of seeing color
reproduction isn't the best text isn't
as sharp and the colors looked a bit
washed out of times then again it is a
two hundred twenty dollar smartphone so
I don't really have any reason to
complain or compare it with other
high-end displays I've seen and use plus
that 720p screen will help save on
energy consumption which translates to a
better battery life in terms of overall
performance it's
just fine you'll be able to make calls
text browse online email no problem the
Snapdragon 410 processor works well
though it can be a bit sluggish when
trying to play a graphics heavy game
like vainglory it works it's just not as
smooth as on more powerful devices if
you're just casually using the phone to
check Twitter or Instagram or take
pictures it gets the job done no problem
also having LTE on a budget smartphone
is big this means you'll be able to
browse the web and watch videos without
having a way too long for sites and
videos to load so let's chat battery
life the Moto G is packing a 2470
milliamp battery and it's not bad at all
it lasts the entire work day from nine
a.m. to 10pm which is perfectly fine for
me i'm on twitter most of the time and
making a few phone calls throughout the
day but how you use the phone will
definitely affect the battery life if
you're constantly on your phone checking
email Twitter and taking a lot of
pictures that will hit it unfortunately
there's no wireless charging or quick
charge even though the Snapdragon 410
ship was built to support faster
charging which isn't available on the
Moto G but I didn't expect those
features to make it to a
two-hundred-dollar smartphone needless
to say the battery life on the Moto G is
decent it'll last an entire day if
you're not constantly tinkering with the
device though standby time is great I
could leave it on for a few days and
still have enough juice to use it for an
entire day the next day which is very
impressive probably one of the best
things about the Moto G is the nearly
pure stock Android experience it's
running android 5.1 point 1 out of the
box with a few customizations from
Motorola such as moto ases action and
active display moto active display
essentially allows you to quickly glance
at notifications and the time without
waking your phone with actions you can
simply flick of the wrist to activate
the camera and chop twice you turn on
the flashlight with assists it'll
basically change your phone's behavior
based on a time of day whether you're in
a meeting or about to go to bed the fact
that it's running stock Android the new
Moto G could easily pass for an
affordable Nexus device and speaking of
a Nexus device the camera sensor on a
moto G is actually the same sensor that
was used on the Nexus 6 the Moto G is
rocking a 13 megapixel camera with
dual-led flash and I asked on Twitter
what you guys wanted to see from the
review and a lot of you guys wanted to
know how good or bad the camera is to
tell you the truth the camera isn't bad
nor is it the best either Motorola
hasn't exactly impresses with its camera
the past couple of years whether we were
using the 2014 Moto X or
Nexus 6 but the Moto G has a pretty good
camera for e 220 dollar phone the images
we got out of the Moto G were detailed
though sometimes a bit washed out
dynamic range isn't the best though for
a two hundred twenty dollar phone it's
impressive autofocus worked relatively
well and quick and good lighting
conditions though it will hunt for focus
and low-light conditions Motorola's
using a customized version of google's
camera app and it's very minimalistic
which means you can simply tap the
screen to take a picture and the
settings are tucked away on the
left-hand side of the screen which you
can enable things like HDR flash touch
to focus and change the aspect ratio the
front-facing camera isn't the best
either it's definitely mediocre at its
best the shots we saw seemed a bit to
over process for our taste but we
weren't expecting anything great again
the camera on the Moto G is not the best
but it's not the worst either it gets
the job done and you'll be able to get
some good shots that can easily pass for
social media such as Instagram or
Facebook so to wrap it all up for you
guys I'm giving the 2015 Moto G a
TechnoBuffalo score of 8 out of 10 the
Moto G is a really good budget
smartphone as in surprisingly good it's
running an almost stock android 5.1
point one it has LTE good battery life
expandable storage in a decent camera
and it's only two hundred twenty dollars
of course you can't have a 220 dollar
phone without trade-offs one the display
isn't the best a 720p resolution on a
5-inch display looks horrible also the
lack of NFC and quick charge may be a
deal-breaker for some people still the
2015 Moto G is arguably the best bang
for your buck as of right now anyways
thank you guys so much for watching and
if you guys enjoy this video make sure
to give it a thumbs up and we will see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
