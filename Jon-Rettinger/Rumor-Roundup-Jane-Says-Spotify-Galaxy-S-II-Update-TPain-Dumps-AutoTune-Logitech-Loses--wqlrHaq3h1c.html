to you by Squarespace white tpain Tom
autotune why is our own buffalo mike
phirman hanging out in New York City
with rock stars did google TV kill
logitech dead and cost the top executive
his job or they just gearing up for the
big ice cream sandwich push this fall
our honor system is dead what are they
doing on the internet anyway and why is
a giant consumer electronics company
sending these things out to ppl park
over yonder is that a buffalo i see now
it's a rumor it's rumor roundup
what is going on everybody I'm Noah
Kravitz from TechnoBuffalo and welcome
to the roundup for today Friday July 29
2011 why did Samsung sent me a telescope
we'll get to that in a minute first off
our own Mike Froman it's been in New
York City finding worms in the Big Apple
all week long he had the chance to hang
out with rock legends his words not mine
but really they are because they were
caught stealing once when there were
only five Perry and stephen from Jane's
Addiction LG threw a big party to
celebrate the launch of the thrill 4g
their 3d phone for AT&amp;amp;T with 3d
camcorder 3d playback capably all that
stuff we sent Mike down to the Apple
they had a concert Jane's Addiction
there was the whole thing where you
gonna be able to record the concert 3d
make a big film out of it I guess that
didn't work out but Mike did get a
chance to check out the show and spend a
little time talking to Perry and Steven
about the future of digital music so
check that out if you're a digital music
fan just interested in the future of
digital media online or want to see what
band Mike was repping on his vintage
rock t-shirt I'll give you a hint dancin
in the streets of Hyannis that's all I'm
saying Mike I see you I see you're in
New York Hyannis speed the digital music
the man who made auto-tune famous and
who got famous by auto tune is now suing
the company who made it easy for you and
me to autotune ourselves what rapper
t-pain is suing and tourist technologies
to get them to take his likeness off of
everything having to do with autotune
why the t pain's done be an auto-tuned
apparently he wants to sound more
natural on his upcoming album and
recordings but at the same time he's
also partnered with a new company for
something called the t-pain effect I
don't know man this is giving me the
headache effect get ash this a bit head
pain effective and Katie ICU t-pain I
still hear you with autotune we'll have
to see what happens I don't know can he
sue them after all this I guess it
depends on the contract the legal system
is crazy but look and listen for the
t-pain effect whatever that is coming
soon from a company called izotope speed
I think
getting dumped the CEO of logitech is on
his way out the door after the company
reported very very meager bleak bad
awful logitech I see your key one
profits and they weren't very big very
bad financial earnings my detects q1
report on the headline here is something
we are new google TV didn't really catch
on logitech is slashing the price of
their review the logitech branded google
TV box from $249 all the way down to 99
bucks the company says they're doing
this in an effort to bolster adoption of
the platform perhaps ahead of a relaunch
in time for the holiday shopping season
maybe you'd hope so because google i/o
the company previewed a new version of
the platform built on honeycomb android
3 and said it would be coming up by late
summer the new version looks a lot more
promising than the old version which I I
test it out before I joined up with
TechnoBuffalo but i'll give you my
review right here in two words don't
like really didn't like google TV and
then the whole thing happened with
content studios blocking access to
content from their websites on google TV
because they didn't want you watching
the web videos on your TV because it
would lose out on ad revenues even
though it's the same stuff and I just
the whole thing you know the media
company is having to reinvent themselves
as the internet just makes everything go
crazy I see you out there pirate errs I
see you on mininova at any rate Google
TVs early partners sony and logitech
bore the brunt of the miss launch if you
will and now logitech CEO bearing the
brunt by being out the door logitech
investors bearing the brunt by having
revenues profits everything go down down
down but consumers interested in Google
TV who hadn't yet pick one up you guys
and gals can win because the price being
slashed from 249 299 hopefully the
review product will be upgradeable I
don't see why i wouldn't if it his ass
sure if it wasn't to the new version of
google TV which again is hopefully
coming out before the end of summer as
originally mentioned or at least in
time for the big holiday shopping season
fiesta speaking of TV I actually just
called my cable company yesterday I'm
here in Oakland California and use
comcast rings they call themselves
Xfinity now mainly because fios isn't
available where I live but we had cable
in the house cable modem cable TV HD DVR
box cable card in the tivo all that
stuff called yesterday slashing
everything I actually just going to get
rid of the TV service altogether get
some bunny ears for the TV sets and then
we already have the netflix subscription
maybe set up for hula maybe not I don't
know turns out it was cheaper to keep
the very very basic it may have basic
cable just the local network channels
and the HD feed cheaper to keep that
then to go all the way down to just the
internet service because the way they do
they're crazy bundles so I'm cutting the
cord mostly i guess so i will be
interested to see what happens with the
Google TV platform later this year but
more interesting is the new line of Roku
boxes it just came out our own esteemed
editor-in-chief mr. Sean this big Roku
fan picked up one of the new box it says
it's awesome it's tiny it works great so
we'll be looking forward to some reviews
of the new roku gear put it up against
Apple TV put it up against the other
stuff from boxy from Sony ton of
streaming boxes out now a sous newest
sous box just clear the FCC I believe
and then of course we'll see what
happens with logitech and Google TV
later on this year our honor system is
dead I hope not but the internet world
of honor system based commerce which is
big big commerce believe me took a blow
earlier this week when an Airbnb
customer posted a blog post explaining
how her apartment was trashed by people
who rented it out through the air BnB
service if you're not familiar everybody
is a service that basically lets
homeowners or apartment daughters would
have you rent out their pads when
they're away so let's say I go away i
list my home on Airbnb you're going to
be in town you find by listing you rent
my place so that way you don't have to
stay in a hotel you can stay in my
awesome awesome house and I can make a
little bit of money
my vacation by renting it out to you now
apparently the deal is that when you use
airbnb you don't actually talk directly
to each other until some moneys laid
down on the table everything goes
through airbnb so I don't actually know
who you are who's running my house until
the end I've never used it that's just
what I understand from reading about it
apparently this happened and this poor
woman was away on vacation rented her
place out through some people through
every baby while she was where the
people were sending her these lovely
sweet emails talking about you know how
great your place is in the natural
sunlight well it's awesome she gets back
home her place is utterly trashed I mean
from reading the post you can't even
imagine the damage that was done just
just sounds premeditated and cruising an
awful you can go on to TechnoBuffalo com
Adriana wrote up the story it's just
it's disturbing it's terrible but the
whole thing now is well this is all
based on the honor system and based on
the community that Airbnb is built up
and everything but is it trash now also
I see you conspiracy theorists who are
saying I bet this person was planted by
the hotel lobby Association because the
hotel industry is scared of places like
Airbnb because they could really put a
dent and if not you know take them out
of business so internet things crazy
disruptive music industry TV industry
the hotel industry I mean what's next
publishing anyway interesting to see how
this all plays now it apparently or
maybe not legally liable but they have
stepped up to try to help the poor woman
out with financial and other assistance
in the wake of what sounds like just an
awful awful experience I don't know head
over to technobuffalo calm read ad read
audriana's piece chime in is honored
dead or should you just use a system
like Craigslist where you know you're on
your own doing all the listings doing
all that stuff but you can actually
communicate directly with the person run
a background check on them if you want
you know ask them to send a video I
don't know then helping an old lady
across the street so you know they're
good people before you write your place

and last but certainly not least mostly
because I've been holding up this silly
prop throughout this whole show do that
it wiggles turntables might wobble but
they don't fall I've been caught
stealing anyway as a rowan emily price
reported earlier this week I got Jane's
Addiction stuck in my head now I don't
know how that went to run DMC as Emily
reported earlier this week samsung
announced they've already sold 5 million
galaxy s2 smartphones and the 85 days
since the phone first went on sale in
asia that's a whopping number of phones
and they haven't reached the states yet
well samsung saw fit to send out a
trinket to members of the media
including yours truly mine arrived
yesterday it's a telescope and it came a
little card that said keep lookout for
the galaxy s2 or something like that
galaxy has to come to the United States
lots of rumors kicking around about
where we'll go the latest is that there
will be a version coming to sprint also
a 4G LTE version coming to verizon
assume the sprint version will be wimax
but personally I'm a little bit more
excited about the LTE for verizon cook
faster also rumors kicking around that a
white version of the phone will now be
on sale in Europe so be interesting to
see when the phone comes to the US what
color or colors is it available in when
will it finally go on sale what networks
I don't know a white galaxy s2 on
verizon might make some people think
choice about the iphone 5
I almost got through a whole show
without a mention of an apple product
but couldn't do it so there you go keep
an eye out on TechnoBuffalo calm for all
the latest on the galaxy 2 s all kinds
of other stuff and you know I'm not
going to use this telescope again guys
i'm done i'm not using it today not
gonna use it again another show unless
you ask really really nicely all right
till next time we got people going to
rock shows we got people reporting on
the honor system what else do you need
well there's a lot more to be found for
sure Henry TechnoBuffalo calm and don't
forget to tune into revision3 every
monday wednesday friday for ask the
