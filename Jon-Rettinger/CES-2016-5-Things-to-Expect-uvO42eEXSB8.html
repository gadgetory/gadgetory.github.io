known as CES is fast approaching in
early January 2016 typically that show
we see technology trends are going to
set the stage for the next 12 months 24
months and beyond forgot to take a look
at this year's show if you five
predictions things you can expect from
CES 2016 coming in at number 54 k
everywhere unexpect directv and dish to
announce therefore k plans least directv
to announce 4q plans actually going to
work I'd also put the cable providers to
get in on the game streaming providers
should also be upping their 4k contents
look for more from netflix from amazon
and for hulu to make 4k ubiquitous it's
probably time to look at a new TV set
number for connected everything if you
ever hear me say the term Internet of
Things your permission to smack me in
the face but at CES 2016 we're going to
see everything finally get connected
from toasters two spoons and other
things that probably have no business
being connected everything in your home
in your pocket in your wallet we're
probably of some sort of internet
connection in 2016 and it beyond number
three cars everywhere CES used to be all
about mobile but companies are starting
to take their own stages and other
events so CES has gone less mobile and
way more car focused every u.s.
manufacturer is poised to have a
presence at CES this year in fact it's
where we're going to see the production
Chevy Bowl to finally make its debut
Volkswagen said they're gonna announce
an all-electric concept remember to be a
new camper van Hyundai and others all
expected to announce the electric cars
at the show so look for new in dash
system showing the next evolution of car
play perhaps and Android auto and
connected cars as well to have a big
showing at CES 2016 number two project
tango devices are ready for mainstream
project tangos been kicking around
Google Labs for a few years but it's
finally ready to get into your hands the
technology essentially lets your tablet
zuma Blee phone eventually see the world
around using a variety of sensors and
GPS it's a great way to get immersive
environment for games for apps and for
software developers sort of take
advantage of a whole world around you I
look for these to start shipping in the
early part of 2016
and the number one prediction for CES
2016 PlayStation VR project Morpheus no
more the sony has been teasing us for
two years with their VR headset will
finally see the production ready
PlayStation VR which I cannot wait
expect to see launch game expect to see
live demonstration we expect to finally
put the real production headset over
your eyes I expect this guy to ship
towards the end of 2016 hopefully in
time for the holidays so what do you
guys was excited about for CES up to
hear your thoughts on let us know what
you want us to cover trend you want us
to look for make sure we bring you the
latest and greatest from the Consumer
Electronic Show thank you guys for
watching till next time from John render
from TechnoBuffalo your next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
