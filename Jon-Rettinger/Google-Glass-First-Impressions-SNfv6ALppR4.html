technobuffalo here with a first
impressions of this guy Google glass I
have literally had this on my head for
about 15 minutes total so this is a
legitimate first impression what it's
like to wear it what it feels like what
the poly the video looks like and all
kinds of other Google glass first
impression so if you're thinking maybe
this might be something you want to get
stick around let's get started so I was
super excited to finally try google
glass I had all kinds of questions and
things I was curious about so let's talk
about how these things look and what
they feel like so available in a variety
of colors we've got sort of the slate
gray here to make you look less
obviously a cyborg oh the things are
really light and they're surprisingly
comfortable to wear I wear glasses most
of the time did see them right here
mostly when I'm not filming I got
glasses on my head that's very
comfortable for me to where they feel
almost the same weight as a normal pair
of glasses so it's a little bit strange
to be looking at a screen unfortunately
can't always show you exactly what I'm
looking at but the user interface here
is surprisingly intuitive it's got a
bone sensor for in the back to help with
the speaker volume similar what the
jawbone does about their technology and
overall I'm just feel really high-tech
wearing it working in this industry you
know you always get a chance to play at
new technologies but nothing is for a
paradigm-shifting as i think google
glasses so you can do a few things first
you can tap it to wake it up or just
tilt your head backwards I usually just
need to tap it you can talk to it so
it's I'm talking normally and as soon as
I say ok glass it's going to start
surging slurring wake it up again I'm
talking normally ok glass and you give a
whole bunch of all because you can take
a picture record a video get directions
and all kinds of other stuff it'll take
you right to do those things you're
trying to do so wanna take a picture tap
it ok glass take a picture walking
around things up on the screen though I
find myself always looking up in the
upper right and my left eye doesn't
always know what to do so I almost
closing my left eye and licking up with
my right after wearing it for about five
minutes after I took it off for the
first time my eyes actually hurt a
little bit last you can negate a few
ways you can scroll down to turn it off
tap it again to wake it up and you've
got a menu screen you can scroll all the
way back to scroll through your apps and
so you can see how much battery you've
got connect to Wi-Fi if you scroll fast
you be able to see all the applications
that you've got right up on your screen
things you have to pass our two weeks
ago whatever you've done and they give
you your pictures you could send
pictures you can send video and I'll
kind of other thing just by simply
tapping now there is a physical button
on it if you go ahead and tap that
button right there that is your video
but it's going to launch video right
away I'll be able to see what video
looks like now I can talk to it and say
ok glass you know do stuff but the first
impressions of it is I feel like I'm
wearing the future I now certainly the
way it looks right now isn't going to be
the future the sort of crazy weird
headset looking thing but the future i
think is going to be as integrated the
things like this just look like normal
glasses that you had this ability to
project on a screen you have it on a
contact defends i think over to see
directions while you're driving it's
really cool being i'll take pictures of
your kid is really cool you know when
you just don't have a camera with you
just want us to have a quick picture you
always have this on your head or you
always wear your glasses is sort of the
idea it's been really fun and novel for
those things that i wish i could
demonstrate wish i could show you
exactly what it looks like and feels
like to wear glass but join your
pictures and video isn't gonna do it
justice you have a chance to see google
glass a person you're somebody who's got
it you know give it a shot try and see
if you can use it i found that picture
quality really good video quality pretty
awesome microphone surprisingly good
these things actually very comfortable
battery life not so awesome vegetable
recording video it does get a little bit
warm and i can start to feel your heat
up on the back where that battery pack
is located bro for all it's been just a
very enjoyable experience in terms of
the one or two times I've gone out with
it people do look at me very weird so be
prepared for a very hot like boo what
thick is that I certainly some privacy
concerns I will say it as at Google i/o
people were wearing Google glass all
over the place especially in the
bathroom and that sort of was a little
bit creepy to be so privacy issues with
google glass something that's gonna have
to be worked out a little display here
though it does look really awesome you
can move it around to make sure you get
it right in the right spot for you can
remove that alarm to make sure you can
absolutely see this crane but it's been
fun to use it sixteen hundred bucks
though what i buy it you know probably
not that was a retail price google i
know is hoping get this price down so
you know that may be 46 henggeler range
work and have some work you know
prevalent user folks who just cant for
sixteen hundred bucks that is a absolute
ton of money for product and nobody
really needs to have at least right now
so you want to know anything else about
google glass leave your comments down
below I love to hear your thoughts on it
I look forward to trying it doing video
tests on the rest so for right now I'm
