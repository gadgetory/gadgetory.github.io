to you by the Air Force collaboratory
hello internet and welcome back to
another episode of ask the Buffalo the
show where you can ask me Ashley's got
any question you might have across the
wide world of technology every tuesday
we put up a call for questions on
TechnoBuffalo calm and you can leave
your question in the post comments
otherwise you can send them to me
anytime of the day or night on twitter
at TechnoBuffalo or at ashley escoba
just make sure you use hashtag ask the
be so i can see it and usually I'll
answer between three and five questions
every episode so let's get answering
because this is ask the Buffalo Kevin
tat asked dear Ashley Tim Cook said
something about Apple being able to make
new product categories if it wanted to
what are your predictions for these new
products what do you think they'll be
Thanks this is an awesome question I
can't even begin to imagine the types of
crazy things not just Apple but other
technology companies are going to come
out within the next few years it might
be a really long time until we see
something like the iPad again that sort
of created a new genre of product that
was really consumer-friendly tablets for
everybody I know that we sort of had
seen slates before but really the ipad
kind of brought it into the collective
lexicon of technology for non gadget
geeks like we are but honestly I think
when Tim Cook says something like that
and this is sort of an apple ask thing
that they do which is I think it's more
of not necessarily creating new
categories like because even the ipod I
would consider a new category even
though mp3 players had already existed
and at that point in time but I think I
sort of redefined that particular niche
and that particular product to make it
widely consumable by everybody so I
think it's sort of the same thing and I
think this is what you know Tim Cook
means maybe he's talking about an apple
TV or you know the wrist watch that
they're rumored to be making but at the
end of the day I don't know I think it's
gonna be a while before we see any truly
brand new products from anybody but then
again every year
yes there's new stuff so who knows
somebody might just totally blow our
minds next year Paul Villalobos ass hey
Ashley what do you think of the motorola
ARA project and do you think other
companies will adopt this phonebloks
method of customization Thanks I find
this very intriguing the phonebloks
thing and now our project with Motorola
I do like the fact that Motorola has
already been sort of working on this and
then when they stop foam blocks they
reached out to Dave hakkens and they
were like hey we want to talk to your
community and get some feedback I'm not
sure a we always joke around about how
case makers are going to react to this
they're gonna lose their minds laughs
they're gonna hate anything like foam
blocks because they can't make a case
that they can sell and then the other
rationale behind my skepticism is that
there's so much software optimization
that needs to happen in these phones and
I mean just look at for example your
samsung or your HTC or LG device like
how long it takes to get the latest
version of Android now add on extra
pieces of hardware into that equation I
mean this is sort of one of those things
where you're going to be constantly
chasing the carrot of you know
optimization and making sure everything
is compatible hardware wise with either
Android or some other open-source form
of software so i don't know i think
idealistically this is an awesome idea
and I'd love to see something like this
kind of come to fruition but I don't
know if a lot of companies are gonna
adopt this method of customization and I
also don't know if it's really going to
get picked up across you know a wide
swath of consumers but it'll be
interesting to see if it actually does
come to fruition at some point twitter
user ave around asked would you prefer
an iphone with a larger screen yes of
course i mean the thing is is I do like
my iphone 5s it's a nice phone however I
do feel that four and a half inches to 5
inches is really like that sweet spot
for screen I love a four-and-a-half inch
screen that's like my favorite screen
size even 4.7 HTC One is a really great
device I think that screen side is this
kind of the perfect place of a large
beautiful easy to see screen but also
small enough to where it's not like
ridiculous sighs you're not holding it
the second hand it's your head but at
the end of the day I think the iphone 6
if it does end up being a four and a
half to five inch screen I would be
I own something like that at Lansing
says I have a surface RT tablet and I
have been eyeballing the surface RT 2 is
it worth the upgrade well I can't say
for sure but I have a special guest with
me jon rettinger TechnoBuffalo kaam hai
jaan hai so answer the question because
you've been using the surface yes if you
like the original surface RT the surface
2 is awesome if you live in that
ecosystem it is the biggest upgrade it's
like saying from the ipad 1 to the ipad
3 do it do it now run because they might
sell cops and that's the story Vern John
rendered so and I'm telling you that is
literally the best person to get that
answer from because he is the only
person whose office using a surface so
