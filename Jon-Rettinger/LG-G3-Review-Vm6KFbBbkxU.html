to you by audible what's up everyone
John written from TechnoBuffalo with a
full review for you of LG's latest dg3
there is crazy competition to be crowned
smartphone King so let's play a game of
phones and so you should sit on the
throne I usually start off all my review
talking about call quality but not so
fair talk about call quality here since
didn't have all the bands for 18t but
when calls were connected they sounded
really good crystal crystal clear and
speakerphone was also very loud we get
our us unit regardless of a carats on
all updated talk about call quality let
me just jump into what this phone is
really all about it is just a giant
screen so case you're wondering what
this giant screen is you probably should
already know it's a 5.5 inch quad HD
display that is 2560 by 1440 with an
insane 534 PPI making it the highest
resolution phone ever in existence we'll
actually tying for the highest
resolution phone that has ever been put
out on the market and as it expect it
looks really really crisp but like I
kind of thought I figured everything is
gonna look just gorgeous when I saw it
those extra pixels really don't matter
that much unless you're doing something
that takes up all of those pixels so
just bear that in mind taking that pixel
count out of the equation the white
balance is a little bit off and kind of
looks a little bit pink to me but that
just kinda picking it looks absolutely
gorgeous I know this isn't gonna be a
popular thing to say but it doesn't look
that much better than a 1080p display
next let's jump into design in a sea of
sameness this thing really stands out to
me it is almost no bezels at all it's
just like a screen it kind of melts in
your hands I'm an OG and Alice that are
gonna do serve a metal paint on the back
in plastic I was like you can put
lipstick on a pig still gonna be a pig
but it actually works really well here
you can tell it's plastic that the metal
kind of gives it a nice balance between
weight and through the device feel you
don't HTC one a mate you pick it up and
you know it's a heavy device doesn't
feel sort of heavy as that certainly
feels more heavy than something you'd
get on a Galaxy s5 buttons on the back
are still there and still weird but wait
easier get used to then the G to having
them on
back though doesn't the phone look
Riggin awesome and slick and sweet so
maybe it's form over function here like
the g2 before it took me about four days
get used to the volume and power buttons
on the back tried trying to find where
it was still though the camera buttons
located right above it so oftentimes I
kept snacking my finger right on the
camera which certainly smudged it and
then leaked all the best picture they
had a certain clean it off then the
pictures came out great we'll talk about
camera coming up so I know I'm
nitpicking here on the buttons people
get used to it honestly I didn't
diffusing the buttons all that much
because it's got a pretty cool knock
feature you just double tap screen and
turns off double tap it again turns on
it doesn't set a password if you want by
doing that as well so you know it's kind
of cool touch you really have to use the
buttons all that much as well I also
like the two moveable back so you can
pop in a fresh battery it's also where
your sim and microSD card are going to
live overall though the device feels and
looks as premium as it is I really like
just looking at this phone you know a
lot of Android phones look identical
this one you can really tell that it's
something different next let's jump to
software LG has done a lot customized
Android here aesthetically icons are
flatter and LG's widgets are brighter
and the app tray Scrolls horizontal is
her flatter is kind of a new thing to do
our SK Telecom unit has vemos bloat
where I have ever seen on a single
device it's got like a whole screen of
bloatware but presumably hopefully when
hits you assures it'll be better I'm
hoping it can't be any worse I do love
that LG has universal search on here it
works awesome my favorite features that
come standard on iOS this one works just
a Telugu need hit the little question at
the magnifying glass type in what you
want and it populates one of you apps or
fine apps real quickly it's a great way
to go other LG stall works like cue apps
and cue mem over here as well as I'm
taking memos right on your screen
and it uses often but they're here it's
a really heavy skin but it feels light
and let's Android be Android they add to
it but don't take away that's kind of
what I mean by being light there's a lot
of LG things there in the settings menu
it looks all different it doesn't take
away with the experience they're not so
rowing features at you that you kind of
have to use sort of took an HTC approach
I think where they put sort of features
on there they thought you might use the
most take a real quick second to thank
our friends at audible.com check out
audiblepodcast.com/diy audiobook of your
choice
the
over a hundred thousand choices to
choose from which route into the romance
and I'm not gonna judge you mystery
fiction nonfiction anything in between
you could listen to it whether you're in
your car at the gym just walking around
whether you can pretend to be reading a
regular book and have your headphones
plugged in either way they've got you
covered
check them out today so next let's talk
about camera on the backside a 13
megapixel camera which is standard
nowadays but LG's got a pretty few
awesome tricks first freaking 4k it's
awesome
did a whole video on it the microphones
too is pretty good as well if you want
to see that 4k video unedited hit the
link down below take you off to that
look at the back throw the phone you're
gonna see a little black oval right next
to the lens and it's a frickin laser for
autofocus got freakin laser beam which
means that focus is really really fast
and more important really accurately
even when taking macro shots which was
great a lot the best photographer in the
world I was able to get things that
looked really really good pictures
generally looked like I said really
really good even in low light away the
full gallery of picks up on the full
review if you want to see more and that
flora do links going to be right down
below
some cool software tweaks here for the
selfie lover so you can kind of make a
fist and it'll do a count down take a
pic it's a nice little feature if you
want to take selfies which listen we
make fun of everybody take selfies but
we all do it I know your selfie fiend
you're gonna go blind for it so all this
stuff like the camera the quad HD the
quad core processor figures gonna be a
drain on battery right that was a big
concern for me and you probably thought
the same thing
so first got a 3,000 million power
battery in it and surprisingly it's
really good in fact I noticed no better
difference versus standard 1080p powered
phone I was easily able to get through a
full day my usage is pretty heavy
generally I'm up around 6:30 in the
morning connected to Wi-Fi about two
hours of phone calls I've got two email
accounts being pulled down every five
minutes and social networking going on a
lot of social networking going on
emailing some video viewing generally
connected to Wi-Fi when I'm at home or
the office mic text messaging the time I
plug my phone end of the day and I don't
keep my brightness set auto either keep
it generally about 75% end of the day I
had over 45% of my battery which is
really incredible and even better than
some 1080p phones about on par with what
I had with HTC One m8 which when I say
only has a
and ADP screen so I don't know what
magic LG serves apt to hear but they did
a really good job with battery life so
don't worry about that that was one of
my biggest concerns and I started using
it let's go to wrap this sucker up this
is close to a perfect phone as I have
seen and the best Android device I have
ever used it's fast got a gorgeous
screen all-day battery life awesome
camera and everything I needed to do it
did almost flawlessly those you guys
that know my reviews watched me for a
while you know I don't say these things
lightly at all I didn't think anything
would ever top my enthusiasm this year
for HTC One m8 but this does sub might
be turned off by it's a little bit
larger size but for me with its super
thin bezels I probably noticed I was
holding essentially a small tablet in my
hand this gets a highest ranking you've
ever given out a 9.5 is as close to
perfect a phone as I have ever seen if
you want to get a new device don't think
twice run to your store and ever this
hit your carrier pick this thing up you
will not regret it I'll serve you well
