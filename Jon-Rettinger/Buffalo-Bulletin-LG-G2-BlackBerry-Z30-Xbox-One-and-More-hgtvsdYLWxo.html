Buffalo bulletin where we recap a
handful of stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm a few times a week
I'm Ashley ask ova let's go to the
bulletin board in Atlanta technology the
LG g2 is officially revealed yesterday
in New York City and it is not messing
around the g2 has a 2.26 gave her
qualcomm snapdragon 800 processor 5.2
inch 1080p display 13 megapixel camera
three thousand milliamp battery and some
unique design that moves the volume and
sleep controls to the back of the phone
we've got a hands-on on our site carrier
availability and all the other details
in the g2 if you want to learn more an
interesting leak hit the wire this week
via photos of the rumored blackberry z30
device the photos reveal a 5-inch phone
ready for an HD screen expandable
storage and a 2100 milliamp battery it
seems to be a piece of blackberrys phase
2 attempt at a comeback unfortunately we
also heard this week that three more
executives are leaving blackberry
reminding us that it's still a turbulent
time for the canadian-based phone maker
still no word yet on when or if Alicia
Keys rolls creative director will also
be trimmed for cost saving purposes in
gaming news Microsoft's Major Nelson
posted an official xbox one unboxing
meeting every other site to the punch
and ruining it for the rest of us thanks
regardless though of our bitterness the
unboxing shows off what you'll get when
you open up your new Xbox one and we
were surprised to see a headset included
since Microsoft claim back in June they
would not be including one it's a fun
unboxing though and worth watch if
you've already pre-ordered or if you're
just thinking about it on the other side
of the console war Sony's president of
worldwide studios clarified on Twitter
that the PlayStation 4's game recording
function would be free unlike the xbox
one which will require an xbox live gold
subscription running you 60 bucks a year
that won't matter for online multiplayer
games on either console since both the
ps4 and the xbox one will require
subscriptions for those but for
single-player walkthroughs it's a pretty
good policy on Sony's part and lastly
our wildcard post this show is from our
very own
hazleton who posted a great interview
with HTC senior manager of global
products JV McCree McCree talks about
how an accident changed his entire
career path in life how he got his first
job at HTC and how he channels his
inspirations and passion for innovation
into helping create amazing phones if
you love HTC it's a great read and a
really personal look at one of the
humans behind their phones that's the
