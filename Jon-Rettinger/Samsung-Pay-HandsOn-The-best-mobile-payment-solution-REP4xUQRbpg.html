it from TechnoBuffalo and Samsung this
week finally launched its own mobile
payment service in the US Samsung pay
the company's mobile payment service
isn't the first to the market but it is
the first to support magnetic secure
transmission which is a standard card
reading technology found in most modern
POS systems Android pay and Apple pay
relies heavily on NFC in order for
payments to process but Samsung pay can
be used practically anywhere even if the
POS system doesn't support NFC the way
samsung pay works is that it essentially
emulates a swipe of a physical card that
means you can use Samsung's new platform
at way more places than you could with
Android pay and Apple pay
as of now samsung pay is only compatible
with select Samsung Galaxy phones such
as the galaxy s6 s6 edge s6 edge+ and
galaxy note 5 Visa MasterCard and
American Express are the three major
credit card companies that support
Samsung pay and banks like Bank of
America Citibank and u.s. bank are the
first three banks that support it though
many more banks should support the
platform in the future some phones do
need to be updated first in order to use
Samsung pay 18 C Sprint t-mobile and US
Cellular are issuing updates throughout
the week to all compatible Samsung
phones so make sure to check your device
and see if you have the latest version
installed Verizon unfortunately doesn't
support Samsung pay at the moment
setting up Samsung pay was fairly easy
once you've updated your phone you
should see Samsung pay pop up in your
app drawer launch the app download the
necessary files and add your card by
using the phone's camera to scan your
card or enter the information manually
to access Samsung pay you can quickly
swipe up from the lock screen or home
screen and you'll be prompted to enter
your fingerprint in order to process the
payment we tried samsung pay at a few
local stores that don't support NFC
payments and as soon as we authenticated
a payment with our fingerprint it
process after a few seconds it'll even
work with Squares reader which is pretty
awesome since you don't have to hand
your physical credit or debit card to
the merchant however it won't work with
readers where you have to insert your
card into a slot like at a gas station
and or ATM Samsung pay as you saw from
the video worked flawlessly the only
downside so far is that you'll need to
be using Samsung's latest smartphones
and Bank support is fairly limited right
now samsung has said it could bring the
service to older Galaxy devices but it
will only work with NFC since older
devices don't have the proper technology
to support MST or magnetics
transmission overall Samsung pay is
pretty seamless to use and set up and it
should get better over time
samsung pay is out in the u.s. and South
Korea but we'll be rolling out to the UK
Spain and China in the future if you
guys haven't seen our Apple pay and
Android pay videos in action make sure
to check them out over here
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
