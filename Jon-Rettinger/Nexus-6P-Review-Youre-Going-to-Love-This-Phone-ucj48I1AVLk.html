lovers dream you've got next-generation
OS you've got a metal build a twelve
point three megapixel camera with
autofocus fingerprint sensor everything
that you would want an Android phone is
here but its Nexus 6p more than just
some of its parts how do all those
individual pieces come together to make
a phone that you would want to use I
want to carry you for the next 12 months
24 months or perhaps even longer I'm
John render from TechnoBuffalo this our
review of the Nexus 6p and next few
minutes I'm gonna try to answer the
question would I buy this and most
importantly should you buy it so as I do
with all my reviews let me start with a
disclaimer I use this phone as my daily
driver for seven days and Brandon who
did a written portion used it for four
days if you want to say any more
detailed anything I'm gonna talk about
including gallery samples hit the link
down below and check out the written
article we used it on AT&amp;amp;T here in
Southern California it is unlocked it
will work with any of the US carriers I
haven't used that many Huawei devices
chances are you haven't either so I was
a bit dubious about the build of the
phone and I got to say that bill Klaw is
incredible but the only way to really
test
I think house herbalist things gonna be
just a bit old-school Ben test
so constipated face and all jokes aside
all we did a really nice job here at the
design it's incredibly thin the camera
hump is so slightly hardly noticed it
it'll sit flat on a surface I feel very
confident with this phone coupled with
Gorilla Glass 4 on the screen because
the phone was going to last the 12 18
months over long you guys have it but
certainly time will tell
this device certainly I'd feel confident
with keeping in my pocket even without a
case as qHD display is starting to come
commonplace you should know what to
expect and you're gonna get exactly that
from the 6p it looks great colors look
very bright and vibrant blacks look very
black the AMOLED technology certainly
helps this 5.7 inch panel I will say
though when you're outdoors visibility
is not very good you have to kick the
brightness up all the way in order to
see anything you're trying to take a
picture in direct sunlight using your
screen as if you find there's going to
be quite hard it ranks below Samsung but
in line I've got every other Q HD screen
out there that I've seen so on paper a
twelve point three megapixel camera a
couple with laser autofocus the ability
to shoot 4k video sounds like a pretty
sweet combo and you scroll down that
spec sheet deal you'll notice one
omission no oh yes certainly gave me a
little bit of reason to be worried that
worry was very quickly put to rest I
start actually using the camera pictures
look gorgeous
colors look bright and vibrant and
blacks look really dark it was awesome
and highlight really good in low-light
ended up not missing oh is at all the
only knock those it took about a second
and a half to process a picture after I
shot it not a large deal before shooting
a lot of pictures it's definitely
something to bear in mind
Nexus users have come to expect a
certain level of performance from their
devices and always delivers with the 6p
it is running the Snapdragon 810 before
anybody worries and sorts screaming
overheating don't worry this phone ring
extremely cool and very fast number once
they encounter and stuttering apps opens
quickly
Zillah multitask without any worry
whatsoever because I know you guys love
benchmarks let's roll with it quadrant
nineteen thousand eight hundred and
thirty-two and two two five seven one
was forty seven thousand ninety-two I
wouldn't be doing a Nexus device justice
if I didn't talk about the software
Android 6.0 marshmallow is definitely
evolutionary over 5.0 lollipop but you
don't have to be revolutionary to be an
improvement this is a nice step forward
for Android things like doze now on tap
make an already polish Android OS shine
even more a quirk of this generation X
devices is a fingerprint sensor on the
back it will take some getting used to
but once you do so they come pretty
natural you might have to change how you
use your phone if for example you were
like meaning got used to unlocking your
phone when it was screen up by using
your thumb you have to tweak that a
little bit I will say though it unlocked
very very quickly and the setup is only
seven or eight apps from setup to
actually using it took about twenty
seconds very responsive and will work
almost always for me the bloom is off
the USBC rose it's nice to have it's
great to have a reversible cable but
right now before every device I have is
using it just means I have to carry an
extra cable when I travel the front
facing speakers on the 6p are loud so
that in fact I had to turn the volume
down when I was on a conference call so
it wasn't blaring and bothering that
people in the office next door if you
rely heavily on speakerphone or like to
listen to your phone to bump some music
you're gonna be really impressed with
the 6p the combination of Android
marshmallows dough's in the 3450 million
power battery lended itself to some of
the best Android battery life I have
ever
have by end of the day I easily had 55
percent battery life left or more and
that's what screamed Brian is set to
about 70% so battery life was incredible
performance was solid you're gonna get a
phone that's going to be rockin and
rollin for however long you decide to
keep it what I like about the 6p is
really what I love about all Nexus
devices its Android as Google intended
it's not trying to teach you a new game
ik not trying to show you how to use a
curved display I'm trying to force to
use a stylus or to show you a new way to
answer a phone call by waving your hand
in front of it it just works and it
works well the question I asked the
beginning would I buy it that should be
very obvious at this point yes I would
absolutely buy in fact this is all
that's going to be in my pocket for the
next few months and I can highly
recommend it if you want a phone that's
gonna be fast it's got a nice green
great camera take beautiful 4k video
look no farther than 6p don't be
disappointed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
