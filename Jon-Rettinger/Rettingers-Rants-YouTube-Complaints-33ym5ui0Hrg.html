to you by carbonite what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of retinas
rants I'm your host Jon renders to show
where I get mad red-faced and sometimes
i will give some advice i put out a
question on twitter i said hey do you
want to see another advice video or do
you want a solid rant where I get all
mad and red in the face and we'll split
down the middle so I'm gonna do a split
down the middle video up this week I'm
gonna give some advice for aspiring
youtubers and I'm gonna rant a little
bit on my fellow youtubers this is
retinas rants go and get started I'm
gonna start with the rants up that's
been on my mind for actually quite a few
months that's me with my fellow
youtubers I don't know if I'm breaking
some sort of secret unwritten handshake
rule but I'm singing a lot of youtubers
complaint online about YouTube and I can
understand to the rationale behind that
then the more I thought about it the
more upset i kind of got so a few things
about YouTube that I'm guessing you know
first of all it is completely free
anybody can sign up for a youtube
account and assuming you're of age and
anybody can monetize their video you
don't have to pay YouTube a cent and you
can start making money immediately some
people start complaining YouTube's
having issues YouTube design stings
YouTube is slow youtube has a dumb face
in a stupid mouth I here's where I to
understand you to miss a free platform
if you don't like it you have the option
to go elsewhere if you don't think
YouTube is paying you enough you can
live in a free market economy you can
take your services take your talent and
go somewhere else don't yell at YouTube
essentially YouTube is your boss and my
boss too and I appreciate what YouTube
does I mean it's a free platform that
has given me a chance to live my dreams
the drive issues yet is what I like the
new design no not even a little bit the
things sometimes failed your scheduled
videos not always go out one hundred
percent but it's still free I'm not
paying for this service by a very little
right to complain it'd be like somebody
handing you a free ice cream cone and
being like um I want two chocolate not
vanilla you stupid face the maybe I'm
biased I got a bit of a warm spot for
YouTube has given me but come on before
you start complaining think about what
you're complaining about this is for the
new youtubers out there the new tech
reviewers who are just starting to get
involve
hold with PR companies so in previous
advice videos a few weeks ago I gave
some advice about how to get devices
from day one let's say now you've got
those devices be honest let's say you've
been working with AT&amp;amp;T for example
finally got your first phone from 18
teen I remember what this felt like I
could not believe that a complicated
sending me a phone to review was
absolutely incredible and then you use
the phone let's say you don't like it
are you going to feel obligated to give
the phone a good review because you
don't want the PR person to get upset
with you not send you another phone so
here's where the issue comes up always
be honest with your audience above
anything else be honest we don't like
something say it here are people
actually understand if you don't like a
product as long as you are rational that
and you give a reason for it don't to
say I don't like it because it's dumb
and stupid it's nearby microsoft i
hain't microsoft or its android android
stupid or apples elitist it's only for
rich people you know whatever it might
be keep all that stuff out use the
device be objective about it try and
look at it with fresh eyes and be
completely honest PR people understand
different like the product they will
completely understand inch answer if you
don't like it they probably don't like
it either are they noticed issues you're
bringing up in fact I think they will
respect you more for it I dealt with a
lot of PR people over my years and doing
this I'm best relationships I have with
folks the ones where we've been honest
with them like listen I don't like this
product here's why it's a rational
reason front like it i'm gonna share
with my audience I feel like you should
know and oftentimes they can say oh you
know maybe it's a problem to device let
me send you another one and see if that
you know fixes your internet speed or
the camera lag is too long whatever it
might be or they say you know what we've
heard those complaints it's a fine it
makes sense you know thank you for an
honest review I think people always can
appreciate it people will see through
the audience will see through a phony
review above all else don't be a phony
be honest with you honest with your
audience I cannot emphasize that enough
whether it's from PR companies or saying
what you think they want to hear that's
not really what you think be yourself
and be honest is the best advice I can
get to any of you we take a minute to
