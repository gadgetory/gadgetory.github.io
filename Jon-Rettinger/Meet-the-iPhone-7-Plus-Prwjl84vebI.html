two cameras in the back and new color
options it's a pleasure to meet you and
if you guys out there want to pick up
one of these phones gonna be available
starting September 16th the story here
is pretty similar say for the cameras
with the iPhone 7 cousin if color
options have changed a little bit got
rose gold still available Silver Gold
Space Gray is gone it's now called black
and it is just black and there is a new
shinier jet black option here as well
keeping this guy humming along 40 times
faster than a predecessor who 50% better
graphics is the a-10 infusion processor
it's also got water resistance now so if
maybe your sister pushes you in the pool
which happens to me about once a year
your phone it's not gonna be damaged
you're not gonna have to yell at her to
buy you a new one the big story here
though is the cameras on the back and
there are 212 megapixel sensors one
wide-angle and one telephoto with F 1.8
aperture 6 Element lenses quad led true
tones so the big story with two cameras
is the zoom so first you get 2 times
optical zoom with a single push of a
button which is nice you can also now do
digital zoom all the way up to 10 times
obviously it's gonna degrade the image a
little bit just by nature the image
you're gonna get it's so gonna be good
enough for posting on Facebook or even
printing out potentially we're gonna
test that once you get it back in the
TechnoBuffalo offices at coming sometime
in October
go ahead actually live blur your
background get that bouquet effect that
really DSLRs have been able to do for
quite a while but that won't be shipping
at launch
rounding out the camera department
you've got a 7 megapixel front-facing
FaceTime HD camera battery life is also
improved no mention at all of wireless
charging so maybe next year we go get an
hour of better battery life versus what
you had with the iPhone 6s plus an Apple
doubled the storage audio 16 gigabytes
32 128 and 256 are going for you the
options starting at 7 to 49 and if you
covet that jet-black like I think I do
that's gonna be 128 or 256 only and also
the home button I mean it's there but
it's now forced touch and actually works
pretty well so it's not gonna actually
move the taptic engine that we've seen
in the MacBook the MacBook Pros now
found its way into both versions of the
iPhone and speakers they louder in fact
I can quantify it for you they are two
times louder because they're stereo now
one at the top and one
the bottom and once again it's all gonna
be available starting on September 16th
resolution on the 5.5 inch screen is
still 1080 but Apple spent a while
talking about the color game and how
it's been improved how it matches cinema
specs so which phone is right for you is
the iPhone 7 plus is the iPhone 7 let us
know in the comments also let us know
your favorite feature is were you
excited we're you overwhelmed
underwhelmed let us know so next time
