TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
excuse my squeaky mike arm as I move it
there yeah right 50th sneaking up on it
yeah no it'll sneak up on what this is
the 50th episode yeah I know it snuck up
on me next I say yeah and this is also
than our longest an interrupted even
though you went to California joey said
you we're getting better nice now if
Microsoft would just stop scheduling
things on Wednesday although this week
it wasn't a scheduling conflict comes
just a catch up day for a situation but
yes we have a lot going on right now so
of course we had google i/o last week um
excuse me Google will get into the
second day though which I thought was
very funny I you know that was so
bizarre to me the second day was far
more interesting than the first day yeah
I feel like well we can talk about a
little bit but I feel like they should
have shared some of that stuff maybe on
the first day I agree I agree that the
first days keynote it was just too long
hey when you start off with an eight
minute animated video yeah that was yeah
yeah that thing was ridiculous yeah yeah
I just what killed me was it now I have
to bring up the google maps situation
okay the offline google maps yes
situation so Google comes up there
talking about google maps and they talk
about oh you can now save your google
maps offline they said now right you and
I have been doing this for literally and
I'm using that word correctly literally
years yeah exactly years I've been
saving my maps offline they actually
announced it I think it was a who I oh I
don't know
23 years ago well two years ago when i
went to Edinburgh Scotland I didn't know
what my internet connection was going to
be like on my phone I had saved edinboro
offline yes there was a new feature that
you can do turn-by-turn directions I've
searched and stuff like that right yeah
but over here on my right screen where I
always have twitter going Google's
talking about you saving maps offline I
cannot believe the people I won't name
them but people in our industry who are
going wow this is amazing I can't wait
to try this out oh I've always wanted
them to do something like this yeah and
weekend I mean it's been there for a
long time even in my posts that sort of
talked about the the whole conference I
talked you know this has been available
for a while and I link to a tutorial
that Google has already how to save your
maps offline but yeah I mean it's cool
they're just making it a lot more
detailed so it's more valuable sort of
sort of like what Nokia here has now
with their offline you know turn-by-turn
navigation stuff like that but yeah I
just I that blew my mind but that was a
theme throughout the day that they kept
talking about features we already knew
about mmm android wear for example they
were talking about the new features but
a lot of them were what we're already
introduced in five point one point one
which we already had hands-on with you
know and stuff on the Sun watch and I'm
not saying like we're ahead of everybody
or anything like that i'm just saying
that a lot of these things were already
released and it was sort of a lot of it
kind of came off as a recap like here's
what we have now puppy whining behind me
while she's staring at herself in the
mirror here I i I'm gonna grab her real
quick no no problem Todd I for those
that don't know todd has a youngish
puppy named Mabel and she is uh she can
say hi everybody she's discovered
herself in the mirror one of my dogs
does that except I know he wants to know
who that other dog is right I think
that's what's going on with another dog
and she does understand why it won't
play with her right but uh so yeah
google i/o is just now the second date
was far more interesting right yeah we
the a tab group so they talked about all
the inventions they're working on and
that came down to a radar that fits in
like a wearables like a smart watch
where you could just make gestures over
the screen and it knows I'll bring my
hand up like what your hand is doing so
you could like turn your watch dial say
but an invisible on they can recognize
that they also had a wearable technology
built into textiles so fabric and a guy
on stage head he's wearing a jacket
where for example you could swipe down
the arm to answer a phone call on your
phone which is pretty crazy okay now
they partner with Levi's so like it's
not just sort of a pipe dream or
something here's my problem with this
whole you swipe on your clothing you're
going to end up with the dirt streak
right there the girls not going through
yeah you're gonna be like well this was
great for the first month but then I
answered too many calls right yeah and
then they had um well so they showed
project ara finally workings of the
modular smartphones and um I'm not sure
we had a recap on this site so I don't
want to go too far in a tease of what we
already talked about but the they showed
the device working they put speakers on
I think they put the processor on and
then powered it on and then they added
the cameras or like a hot swap module
just right in there and then took a
selfie so is one of the first times we
actually saw it working which is really
cool well we have a question from such a
Mahal about what was your favorite that
was made at Google i/o 2015 I would say
it was I want to see more about this
integration of wearable clothing and I
because they didn't touch on it but like
how's it going to handle being washed
right you know are you gonna have to
remove everything every time you go to
wal should I don't think you can because
it's like sewn into the fabric it's just
exactly so it but then it's like you're
right there was like a power module that
they put in the pocket so I wonder if
that that must have to come out even if
the even if the components are water
resistant which I would assume they are
you know the the violence inside of a
washer being banged and thrown
round and hitting the side and
everything else you would think would
break down the components yeah
definitely I mean it's like look at the
lint you know who he takes something oh
yeah now I mean admittedly the the
jacket that he was wearing the sports
jacket yeah that's probably a dry clean
situation but right you know Levi's you
throw them in the wash yeah right so I
don't know it's going to be interesting
to learn more about that project but I
would say that was by far the most
interesting thing to me out of the
entire I oh yeah I think that in project
ara because you know it's like they said
from the very beginning like this we
don't you know it's it's what do they
call moonshot projects like we don't
know if we're gonna ever be able to do
this but we're going to try when they
took it over from the other company that
if they start working with I forget the
name of it blocks or whatever and and
now they're showing that wow this is
actually real they showed the designs on
the back of the device so you can
customize it you know if your own
personal look but so now I'm just
waiting for it to really go on sale in
Puerto Rico which they've said should be
coming in the future really interesting
a question here from Christopher miles
do you guys think Apple has an 8 app
like group working on long-term
technologies or are they completely
consumer focus working only on what they
believe will deliver maximum profit I
fully believe that they have something
similar to a tab yeah I think so too it
seems like it or at least you know
different certainly different divisions
working on these moonshots where
projects like with the Apple car or
something like that because if they
didn't it it would be like a missed
opportunity right we're google and all
these other companies are in Microsoft
for example with hololens would sort of
undercut them so I think they do have it
but I don't know if it's working the
same way that Google's does words and as
far as I understand a tap that you know
it's like this one big group working on
lots of different things where Apple I
think it's probably smaller secretive
groups working on specific projects well
for instance the apple television set a
it does not look like it's ever coming
to market but there is overwhelming I
you know evidence that at least
prototypes exist
right and that you know that it's been
documented numerous times that there is
some form of it in jony ive's all office
right right yeah you know so maybe they
weren't ever plan on coming to market
with it for all we know maybe it was an
in-house project right when you get
people this intelligent be it at Google
or Apple or any other company they can't
just sit around and work on just one
idea at a time that's just not how that
sort of brain functions and so I fully
believe that you know there's a lot of
things at Apple that we will never see
that will never know the thing about I'm
fine with that in all of these companies
i think yeah like for example we've seen
a little bit about what I think Google's
been doing with contact lenses and
diabetes I think and and it's sort of
one of those projects it's been
mentioned they've talked about it but
not in detail at you know I Oh with a
tap or anything like that word you know
who knows how long you know it's been in
progress or if it's ever going to hit
the market but they're sort of working
on these other projects too well
speaking of Apple we have WWDC next week
which is the worldwide developers
conference it's starting to I mean we
heard the rumor we'd heard rumors that
the new Apple TV the set-top box not the
time not just for clarification anytime
Todd and I say Apple TV from here on out
unless we say otherwise we are talking
about the set-top box the we had heard
the apple TV is going to be shown now
we're hearing according to I believe is
the wall street journal but it's not
going to be shown on your times may I
knew is one of the 2i what at one of
those the old fuddy-duddy newspapers but
what what is going on with this thing
has been so long since it has been
updated yep 2013 i think i saw when i
was looking up the other day I know I
well I mean okay in general terms that
doesn't seem like a long time in the
world biology that's a decade yeah and I
mean we saw two
that home kit the devices are coming out
now i'm sure they're going to talk about
that in some fashion on monday and that
apple TV is going to serve serve as the
hub of that and i think it requires the
most recent one which is 2013 but
everybody was sort of thinking oh well
it's going to have to be this new
version that's coming out or something
like that and you know it's i guess it's
going to be that one for now but it kind
of you know we're waiting for this
streaming TV service and all these other
things that seem like it requires new
hardware but again i don't know maybe
they can still do a software update to
this other one to sort of get things
going i mean as long as it's connected
to your home internet right it should
still be able to control your smart
devices it should right it's maybe it
does my power to to run you know series
one of the rumored features so and its
own app stores maybe i don't know yeah
well actually i just looked it up let's
see the last update to the apple TV was
march 2012 was it really 2012 my time
okay wow so there you go 1000 then he
said yes i'm using the mech buyer's
guide 1097 days since the last update
wow are you so so I'm gonna guess it
probably doesn't have enough power to do
everything they want with an app store
and everything so yeah that other models
still has to come at some time but you
know maybe the reason is that they can't
announce it because there's still
everybody's saying they're still trying
to finalize all these deals with the
cable provider since but couldn't that
be pushed out as an OTA update doesn't
you think or just like here's the Apple
TV coming soon and it'll have apple TV
streaming but you know maybe they're so
worried about getting these contracts
they might you know fall through that
they can but it seems weird to me that
they'd have this box ready to go and
they can't introduce it in some fashion
but it sounds like New York Times
sources you know correct they're not
often wrong you know what gets me is how
much I care about when the apple TV is
updating since it's not even my favorite
streaming device yeah we were just
talking about that too
for those wondering the roku is my
favorite streaming device yeah so but
all right so that narrows damn what
we're going to see next week we mean no
we're not going to see a new iPad they
very very rarely do new hardware at WWDC
if they do it's usually like a macbook
pro or something right I was thinking
maybe macbook air with retina and force
touch you know because the macbook the
macbook just the regular macbook now
with retina display has the core m
processor so there's still room for that
air upgrade with some core i5 core i7
chips in it just to bring it up to par
with what Apple did with the macbook pro
threaten enforced touch too so portrait
us also is one of them yeah so very very
low chance of hardware I would say so I
we're definitely going to see you know
the first Inklings of iOS 9 we're going
to see the next version of OS 10 and
whatever it ends up being called right
but beyond that I just don't know what
they're going to introduce on Monday
yeah well I mean I think there's a lot
of things we could talk about you know
i'd like to see and there's rumors that
native watch developments so like
absolute on off the watch not just watch
kid which is what we've already seen
where you know you have for example
today sunrise microsoft on sunrise
calendar just launched the apple watch
version of that and so it's like bundled
with the ios app but i think hopefully
we'll see these native apps come along
with the new software kit for that and
then you know iOS 9 like you said OS x
10.7 whatever that's going to be which
apparently you know ninety five five
9to5 mac 92 fox has said many times like
these are just going to be sort of like
performance improvements and stuff like
that so i don't know if it's going to be
as drastic as we've seen in the past but
um i forget what the features called but
i am looking forward to iOS 9 with the
new swipe swipe right to bring up a big
search menu and on all kinds of stuff
like that which actually was in iOS
before now you pull down from the top
but also to provide relevant information
almost like Google now where you can
have your flight information stuff like
that those are what I'm looking for ipad
pro i don't know i don't wanna say it's
like completely ruled out like i agree
that you know Apple probably won't
introduce it but if they're talking
about iOS 9 and sort of the multiscreen
support that we're kind of expecting in
it then maybe they have a chance to show
it but also multi-screen could just come
later you know in September at the
iphone event where they actually talk
about all the new features well don't
forget now there tends to be the
September event for iPhones in the
October event for iPads right right so I
don't know I don't know what they're
going to do it this is one of the bigger
mystery WWDC s in my opinion we just
simply don't have a clue as to what's
happening yeah I was really looking
forward to the apple TV refresh it was
kind of disappointed to see that news
today because I think there was a lot to
talk about their you know first home kit
because those devices are coming out now
there's supposed to be central hub for
at all so controlling everything from
this box that also serves as you know
you're streaming TV that also serves as
ever you know everything in the center
of your home so I thought especially
with all the developers in the room and
they want to create the own app store
for the Apple TV this would be the right
place to do it so that just seems weird
to me well speaking of WWDC such and
haul ass do you believe the apple TV
service won't be announced at WWE CM be
announced later is your 4 2016 release
honestly at this point I'm not sure if
that's ever growing materialized discuss
do you think i think it's it's got to
come i just i think it's gonna be sooner
like yeah this year that's just me
though uh-huh I just I don't know I
ain't it it's another case when you're
dealing with Hollywood studios they are
going to hold onto money like nobody's
business right and the way Apple does
business compared to the way Hollywood
does business
that's going to be a hard chasm to cross
yeah which is just like what we saw with
music action and we haven't talked about
that but apples relaunch of the beats
app the streaming application but
apparently that's sort of why they
bought beats with Jimmy I of on dates to
try to get into that industry the music
industry and so now they're sort of
facing I guess the same headwinds and
cable know and they can't just buy you
know somebody to get in there yeah well
there really is no magical person when
it comes to that sort of stuff
unfortunately but yeah I mean it seems
like if they could buy the streaming TV
service that CSU have it sling TV sling
TV but I know it's already owned by dish
right it's owned by dish so they would
have to purchase dish which according to
rumors may be joining forces with
tmobile right so I would say that is off
the table yo on the way that rumor rolls
but uh interesting nonetheless well we
have a bunch of questions rolling in
here from such a Mahal what do you think
will be announced shown at WWDC 2015 and
what won't we see at WWDC well we kind
of already answered that but I think
just expanding I think it's going to be
fairly quiet I just I think there's
going to be a lot of iOS 9 Makka was 10
but beyond that at this point I think
it's a I take that back there's
definitely gonna be some talk about home
kit yeah yeah with the first device is
hitting shelves now there there's no way
they won't discuss home kit yeah and
hopefully I mean originally they were
supposed to be rumors of this home app
you know that the central app which you
know we desperately need because like
i've said in earlier podcast i have my
Dropcam i have the nest which I mean
obviously those two are together and I
know their combined now but i also have
a d-link like smart outlet and i had
just had this folder called smart home
and I go in and I have to like open up
each app but I think with home kit and
again I'd have to replace all these
things to sort of get started
but if there's just one central app
that's a great thing to have because
then you can just sort of get in there
yeah but I don't know recent rumors now
suggests there won't be so I that's one
things i'll be looking for them from
christopher miles the earlier excuse me
the early results of does for Android M
seem mighty impressive do you think
Google will finally catch up to Apple in
terms of standby time from what I'm
saying about does it certainly seems
like it yeah it looks pretty good um I
know the guys in the office have Android
am I haven't installed it myself
personally but i think android does need
that because when you look at galaxy s6
for example a great phone but obviously
they put sort of the battery life on the
back burner and then and put the you
know the highlights on the quick
charging the wireless charging and sort
of you're gonna charge all the time but
you know that's one of the reasons why i
prefer android phablets because they
have larger batteries and i know i can
definitely get through the day and i
actually struggled with the s6 with that
so so yeah I think doze is great i'm
looking forward to catching up yeah yeah
exactly the same error uh let's see here
we've got some other questions rolling
in from dan legis do you think we will
see improvements to Siri I hope so yeah
I hope so too it's one of those things
where you know we were talking yesterday
soundhound released their new app hound
beta which is crazy i don't know if you
saw on the site there's a video of it
and you can really say like you know
sorry i have somebody vacuuming the
hallway you can really say like what
time will the sunset in 2021 you know
two days before Christmas and it
answered in like a half second and then
it can also search for they showed up
you know hotels that cost $99 with four
stars are more near me so all kinds of
crazy stuff like that and yet siri is
far more limited and google now is
getting there i mean a lot of things
they showed now on tap is really cool
where you can search right inside a web
page and then core temp Cortana seems
more advanced than the two of them I
think in a lot of ways depending on what
you're doing and so I feel like Syria
desperately needs an update but I don't
know yessiree
most definitely needs an update but
speaking of hound we have a question
from Christopher miles do you think
sound hounds hound digital assistant
will be bought by one of the Giants and
if so who my money's on Apple as Sri has
the most catching up to do yeah i agree
with you I'd like to see it happen I
don't know yeah I mean it's honestly I
think soundhound with pound is more
positioned for an acquisition than some
you know I enough people adopting it
because it's not baked in right you know
but of course there's always the chance
Microsoft could buy for katana although
katana seems to be doing okay on her own
you know Google ok Google is pretty good
i I think apple is the most likely
candidate for buying it yeah one of the
things I like about Cortana and Google
now in some instances but I can't do it
Siri is is one of those things where I'm
like remind me to get this at the
grocery store and it sounds so stupid
because it's in everybody's like
presentation right and you're like but
Cortana does a really good job of that
where you can really say it and she does
remind you in your near a grocery store
and so for example i was getting
groceries the other day and i tried to
do it through my Apple watch remind me
to get pickles is what I said
specifically and and you know like I
couldn't even set the time for the
reminder I was just like oh so I just
open up reminders when i get there and
see what was there oh good grief from
such as your problems you know exactly
from such a bahal hey Sean have you had
any issues with your nexus 7 2013
running android 5.1 i would not know
because i actually sold my nexus 7 off
dirt cheap to a friend who never owned a
tablet so i will have to i don't know if
she's even updated off to ask her but i
know i don't know anything about that
anymore but we know I guess John did cuz
yesterday he published a video at the
Nexus 9 yeah yeah I I don't know if I've
updated my nexus 9 yet or not I can't
remember I did not from Christopher
miles do you think apple's rumored
strong-arming of labels to remove free
options on other services room
free streaming options will garner a lot
of ill will among consumers even if
Apple music is cross-platform yes yeah I
think so we also have to wonder how many
consumers are actually going to know
that right like so if if Spotify ditches
that option and I don't think it's going
to happen but if they did how many
actual and consumers are going to know
it's apple's fault even if spotify tells
them a blog post or something and even
if we write about it it's not going to
filter down to everybody I don't think
but it is a bummer i don't think that
should happen I think that's a great
feature i think it's sort of one of the
reasons you know probably pires ease
down because you're giving people the
option to free and if you don't want the
ads and you pay you know 999 or if
you're lucky google play music 799 and
stuff like that so yeah well that's the
thing though I i I'm at that point in my
life where I'm trying to cut back on how
much I spend every month and the idea of
dropping ten bucks a month every month
for music I mean yeah I still subscribe
to pain door because it's the cheapest
you know but even at that I'm like do I
really want to renew next year oh yeah
for immediate I listen music all day
long and so Spotify pay for and I
actually have google play music too but
I use Spotify most yeah I just I don't
know I but at the same time and this is
why i always find so silly so many of
them won't let you stream to a mobile
device if you're on the ad-supported
version my well but what does it matter
what device i'm screaming it off as long
as the ads are playing yeah that's weird
that makes no sense to me because like
when i'm out an irvine you know i hate
listening to terrestrial radio so I'll
plug my phone in and go to the car
system and listen to pandora is a driver
and irvine right but you know i have to
pay if i want to do that that just makes
so sense to me yeah no I'll be
interested to see the pricing and what
it offers compared to Spotify and again
Spotify we talked about this last week i
believe was adding new features like
video content stuff like that obviously
you know
in an effort to bolster its services
ahead of that a question here from such
hall hey sean has life as a cord cutter
and what do you guys think of hulu
dropping Hulu Plus later this year I
have not heard about that actually
hadn't seen on either uh that I will
have to get back to you on as for being
a cord cutter I for those that don't
know I live with family and last night
marked one week since they gone back
from a business trip I cut the cord
while they were gone they knew I was
going to do it surprise yeah but last
night marked one week since I did it and
so I asked them both you know how are
you guys feeling about this they're
absolutely fine with it they got the
switching the different boxes and stuff
I know we talked well right now right
now just primarily keeping them to the
Roku but they're finding so much to
watch that they're not missing the other
stuff at all I mean last night I got
home and they were watching the to be
app tu bi which I was like I remember
loading that on the roku I don't think
i've ever used it I don't think I even
know what that is and they were like oh
there's so much great stuff on here bird
and we're watching the show from England
called kingdom with Stephen Fry I'm like
I've never even heard of that show okay
and so so far so good that he had saving
us a ton of money each month so i'm all
for it nice have you tried the video box
yet by the way i know you you're gonna
do i have you fitted abhiyan I I set it
up and I have done the initial like set
up and all that but Nvidia emailed me
the other day and asked me to hold off
on getting too deep into forming
opinions because they were going to be
sending out new OTA update so uh yeah
i'm holding off but i have set it up i
speaking for the physical design i'll
say i love the physical design of the
box i think it's very attractive I
haven't done much with the game
controller yet but the
extra remote that you can purchase is
pretty nice although it's kind of like
an extended apple TV remote although I
do like I really like this it is
rechargeable via micro USB oh that's
nice so it's not like one of those small
battery cell bad no just plug it micro
USB cable into it like once a week or so
and let it charge up is awesome yeah so
I like that idea a lot I know the the
nexus player nobody really liked it I
know you didn't really like it seemed
underpowered I guess was probably the
main issue and so now I was super
excited about this nvidia box the only
thing is the motto I'd wants probably
the 500 gig model mm-hmm 399 without any
of the accessories it's kind of a little
steep for me yeah hey uh uh it's 299 oh
sorry right because 199 59 yeah 299 guy
um that's a little steep for me I would
probably pay 199 for that model I mean
come on storage is cheap everybody knows
it's not yeah well then the next I think
a lot of that has to do with the gaming
and that that's the next area that I've
got to start for my reviews trying to
see how it plays on games you know using
nvidia grid and rice team and all that
well it should be pretty good i mean it
should be even better i guess then the
the shield tablet has got the more
powerful processor right right yeah so
no no so far I like it though to do from
aerial I'm going to try to pronounce her
name palette Nick what do you think
about Android auto and do you want it in
your car um and the two of us with our
old cars yeah I know I I Drive a 99 tile
so there's not much that I'm going to be
able to do with smart cars I totally
want to do it now I'd have to get the
you know yacht aftermarket pioneer
system I think which again is expensive
all these sort of boundaries if i had a
car that's supported I know honda i was
the first to sort of push it out i think
i guess it was like last week i would
totally want in my car and a lot of the
new car companies i guess are giving you
a choice i was with volvo on the
California last week their new xc90
has a space on their entertainment
system where you can use either one so
yeah well whenever I'm a turbine I
always were in a car and for some odd
reason I think all but like two of the
trips I've bended up in the Hyundai well
I'm just waiting for a newer Hyundai
it's gonna be in the riddle part that
has to do it doesn't Honda I have a
headquarters right there uh they might
be I'm not sure yeah but I end up in a
lot of hyundais but there you go next
time maybe you know but what happens
here's your sorry off off question topic
or off-topic question what happens when
you know rental cars they love to charge
you like the extra 10 bucks a day for
gps and stuff like that like when
Android autos default when you get into
Italy well here's the thing I can't
believe that a minute still every time
yeah every time I were in a car they
tried to upsell me on the GPS yeah I I
have a standalone gps unit I just bring
it with me yeah you could do that or I
just use maps like Google Maps the last
two trips I've left it at home and just
used I carry so many phones on me I'm
just like I have google maps why am i
bringing the gps with me and so i
started using my phone's i'm like why is
anyone renting a gps from you people
yeah it makes no sense no sense I've
seen people you know like when when you
go to the little booth you've been to
the John Wayne Airport you know where
the toll booths are downstairs so i'll
be there waiting for you know them to
bring me my keys I'll see a worker walk
by with a clipboard gain the GPS out and
ready I'm like who are you people I
guess tourists international tourists
they don't have a smartphone in the
country or something like that makes it
okay now that's possible because like my
gps whenever we it's a garmin modeled so
whenever we update you know they try to
sell you do you want by maps for other
countries and so yeah if you're coming
over from another country that would
make sense to me because then you may
not have data service on your phone you
wouldn't have the correct maps in your
gps quite possibly those folks i can
fully understand and i certainly would
not want to drive around irvine for the
first time without knowing
the world I was goin she but I just want
to be able to tell you keep me off the
405 because i hate the 405 but yeah that
would make sense to me yeah I don't know
I'll have to see from an M 9900 google
released an unlimited storage find for
photos would you like to see if they're
good if they could do an unlimited
storage for google drive but maybe with
a maximum file size that would be
awesome that would be awesome they
should do that yeah of google photos by
the way I've been using it for a long
time I also use apples photos I don't
know I always like I'm weird you know
it's like back in the day you'd have
like multiple backups of your computer
and now I do multiple backups of my
photos at the cost of a couple bucks a
month now for photos and previously I
had bought into google drive but you
know 12 megapixels is pretty good so all
my phones that's what I usually shoot
with are pretty much right there so I
just use that now up to 1080p video
perfect for me and photos is it's
amazing it's kind of creepy how good it
is it you know you click a person's face
and you get all the pictures of that
person or I searched hound the other day
and it brought up pictures of my dog
just to see if it could I searched
dachshund to it found her it's just it's
wild what it can do and then it creates
nice little you know montages if you
create if you take a bunch of photos in
a row it creates a little animated gif
or you know jiff if you want be
technically correct little video
montages automatically get creates
galleries based on where you were story
view it's I don't know it's my favorite
by far and I love its freedom but we've
got a ton of questions coming in and
we're running out of time so we're going
to rapid fire a couple of these from
aerial palette Nick what is the best
SmartWatch right now whichever one you
want to pick up yeah which everyone
you're wearing a pretty long Apple watch
I think yes which the reason I asked
that question before the next one is we
have a question from dan li
how is the Apple watch Todd are you
still loving it I am I am still loving
it I talked to Sean last night I see one
of the questions here is has your purple
time arrived yet mine is set for
delivery for tomorrow so I'm excited to
try that but they just told us yesterday
the iphone app is now yet so I've been
using this with my iphone of course I
also carrying an android phone right now
too so I'll be able to use the pebble
time but Apple watch I'm really liking
it a lot you know continued continued to
use i still i wrote an article over the
weekend one of the biggest problems is
the apps i think there is a huge quality
control issue actually talk to a
developer because i said look the apps
are there but when you open most of them
from smaller developers it just sits on
loading right like it barely loads the
app by the time the screen turns off and
that's terrible and i spent a dollar on
a nap recently only for tides for high
and low tides for when I fish on the
weekends and it doesn't work so I
emailed the developer and and I'm not
going to name it late he wrote back and
said well I don't own an Apple watch so
i was just using the tools they made me
to build it you know might hasn't
arrived yet and I was like well I didn't
even respond because that's just that's
kind of ripping off your audience right
like why are you building an Apple watch
app if you don't know how it's going to
work and it's like well I have this
emulator and stuff and that's a huge
quality control shoe but then you have
you know foursquare did a really good
job at loads really quickly we wrote up
fantastical to recently that's a really
great app and it loads quickly and it's
made by a small team just one guy or two
guys so those are sort of the exceptions
to the rule but then you have these
other apps where they're just being
added in and as I found out the
developers don't even own Apple watches
yeah which is really frustrating as
someone that's worked on quality control
for websites and all that I can tell you
emulators are never accurate yeah yeah
so I was like what are you kidding me
sergeant spent a dollar for an app that
I assume you know you put in some trust
here that I assume you built and you
know it works
it had a pretty decent rating because
the iphone and that's probably one of
the other problems here too is the
rating so to reflect the iphone ad not
necessarily the Apple watch app so you
see a four or five star app you buy it
and then the Apple watch app doesn't
reflect that at all you know it's junk
and that's so there there's fun we get
answered no I agree with you though that
that that's not good from Christopher
miles thoughts on google mail on tap so
cool that's awesome i love that you know
you can be inside of a page and sort of
bring it up and for me it reminds me of
what you can do in google play movies
and stuff where you sort of pause the
movie or whatever and you can get
information on the actor actress is it
sort of like taps into web pages and
brings you more information on that on
the web page and then stuff like that so
except it's like system-wide so sorry
it's not just in the web page so super
excited to try that from aerial palette
Nick do you use Android TV I am in the
process is currently reviewing the
Nvidia shield which runs on Android TV i
will say i have some issues with it
number one being that there's no way to
like creative favorites of your apps
list they're just all in a big long line
and whatever you've used most recently
is at the front well what if i only use
a certain app once a month i have to dig
for it and it's not in any sort of order
so that's my biggest issue with it
otherwise it's fine yeah it's it's the
no SI i think it could use some
flourishes though that's yeah i was
surprised actually we didn't hear more
on that at Google i/o yeah or like
here's what we're doing to change it up
may God better I've never I've never
used aside from in demos with Google
where it worked fabulously obviously to
close out this week's episode from such
humble hall since Sean the man 34 isn't
here this week I'll ask this on his
behalf have you returned anything this
week Todd I haven't yet but I did get
the Apple watch strap that I had ordered
that I said I was going to return so i
gotta return that so that's my two-week
return I don't know pebble time comes
tomorrow like it quickly
get rid of that or just hi I'm gonna
play with that I'm actually really
excited yeah mine hasn't shipped yet I'm
not sure what's going to thing is though
I gotta say that as I've grown used the
Apple watch I really do like the
hardware just like I like the Moto 360
hardware thing designs really nice and
the pebble I'm not not so crazy about I
kind of wish I got the seal version yeah
well it's even more annoying as you
ordered your pebble after I did yeah and
yours he's coming I know I haven't got a
show notice yet yeah that's wild that
was like no I was in the second batch
yeah so i'm not sure where my pebble is
I would like my pebble yeah well folks
