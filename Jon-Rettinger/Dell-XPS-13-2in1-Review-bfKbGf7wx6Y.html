couple months now and I guess it's
probably about time I did a review
first and foremost to talk about build
quality is part of Dell XPS premium
lineup and it feels like a flagship
laptop one of my favorite things about
this computer though is the screen it's
one of the best looking screens I've
ever seen on a laptop it comes in a
resolution a little under 4k at 3200 by
1800 there's also a 1080p variant color
vibrant everything is detailed and crisp
and clear it's perfect for editing
photos watching movies playing games any
sort of content consumption it's going
to look great on this device and the
cool thing about it it's pretty much
bezel is all the way around with five
point two millimeters bezels on the tops
inside those going this is a small 13
inch to and went on the market right now
and the form factor is probably one of
the most appealing things to me this is
a great travel computer John I went to
San Francisco a few months back I think
the computer ought to be there now the
first time I ever traveled with it since
then I've taken with me on pretty much
every other trip because it's such a
great laptop for what I'm on the go it's
lightweight comes in at 2.7 pounds a
small form factor makes it really easy
to get in and out of my backpack when
going through security that's four
different modes and you can fold it in
there's a traditional tablet mode where
you're holding it like a notebook you
can also set it down like a kickstand
and pull the screen up which is great
for watching movies and you're on the
plane drop down the tray table set it up
the other one too is tent mode where you
prop it up one things I wanted to see
you there putting it into tablet mode I
actually be able to trick some of flight
attendant so I could actually use it
before you're taking off and in the
ticket process on the way there is then
we get away with actually keeping it in
this mode on the return trip one of the
flight attendants spent a little bit of
time inspecting my computer and
determine that it was actually a laptop
after all so I had to put it away that
may be of interest to some of you guys
that might be using this laptop
primarily for travel the hinge is nice
and sturdy doesn't feel wobbly or cheap
I mean you could pretty much hold the
laptop out like this and the screen will
stay out on its own so that's really
nice so it feels durable
zoom embodied laptop feels really well
put together very sleek and smooth the
interior laptop has carbon fiber a going
all around the keyboards nice and smooth
it feels comfortable definitely great to
type on so let's go comes with a
fingerprint reader I didn't find myself
using it too much but fast and
responsive
my preferential waive unlock the
computer is using Windows hello I really
like using a retina scanner to basically
just look at the computer and
immediately be logged into my profile
let's talk about iOS this computer only
comes with USB see we're all kind of
moving towards that but if you're an
early adopter you're probably gonna need
some dongles it comes with you
we see the type-a adapter so you will
have one of those and the charging cable
itself is also USB see it's porcelain of
all three and also has a display port on
the other side another thing to also
keep in mind is that this computer only
has a micro SD card reader there's also
a headphone jack here and you have a
small battery power indicator as well so
let me talk a little bit more about this
tablet feature the computer that's one
of the biggest selling points I think of
this device is the fact you can fold it
over and you have a stylus and you can
use this really nice display of the
touchscreen as a writing device I
thought it'll be really great for
students that need to take notes in
class my use cases we were we're doing a
spider-man shoot over at the YouTube
space I went in and use it furnish the
length of a shoot as a thing to take
notes on I had my shot lists on there I
don't know if it's something that would
use on a day to day basis but I really
like the features there besides it's
really responsive and works well and
generally just like having the touch
screen it's a really nice feature to
have just because sometimes much easier
is tap on the screen to select what
you're looking for rather than having to
navigate with a mouse or using the
trackpad holding it back into a tablet
activates Windows tablet mode I tried
that a little bit personally I'm not a
big fan of it for some of you guys that
maybe you've been using other windows
tablets in the past that might not be a
concern for you but it is just there
basically the idea around is that make
some Windows interface options a little
bit more friendly to touch screen use
overall I found that I was able to use
traditional windows just fine in this
set up let's talk a little about
performance day to day use it handled
everything perfectly fine and that's
just typical watching movies web
browsing taking notes Word documents and
so on I did a little bit like Amy on
here plays a person own there's no
dedicated GPU it's actually using Intel
HD 615 graphics chip those relatively
well for lightweight titles I wouldn't
expect you to be playing far cry on here
crisis or anything like that it's too
intensive just keep that in mind if it's
not I mean most you guys probably
looking this laptop or not using it for
gaming primarily but if you wanted to
play a few games on there know that they
can but it's not going to be the best
option for that for this particular
review unit we're using Intel 7th gen i7
processors 8 gigs of ram in this one but
that can be upgraded 16 and then we have
the 256 gigabyte SSD but that can also
be upgrade to a terabyte let's talk a
little bit about battery that's the most
part it does relatively well it's able
ops me throughout the whole day when I
took it traveling I didn't have any
Jews didn't have to plug it in had
enough power to watch the movie on the
flight San Francisco a little bit of
work in between while we were there
ingesting footage watching all the clips
that we shot from that day and then
being able to watch a movie on the way
back
I've still left with a good 30 percent
the one thing that I did fine is a
standby time on the laptop isn't the
greatest so if I put my laptop away
earlier in the week and got it out maybe
like on a Thursday I found that
generally had to plug it in because the
battery be completely exhausted typing
on the keyboard feels great it's very
responsive it's pretty much what you
expect from to any of the Dell XPS
laptops if you've used other ones I've
got backlighting which is really nice it
looks great so in my couple months of
using spots up I've really liked it a
lot it's a great travel computer I've
really been using it it's just between
work and home because I'm usually using
a desktop at those places but going on
trips to San Francisco and other sort of
media events that we have this has been
excellent for content consumption I
didn't find myself on the weekend
sometimes just kicking back on the couch
watching some movies and using this to
spin the tablet mode responding email to
take care of any other sort of over new
taps that I have it starts at $9.99
which is a relatively competitive price
point for laptops of these specs it goes
all the way up to fifty 99 which is the
model that we have so on all it's been a
great travel computer I've really
enjoyed using it on my trips if that's
something you're looking for then
definitely take a look at it hope you
guys liked the video until next time I
manage it from techni buffalo I'll catch
you guys in the next one
all right I'm ready for my close-up I
know you've had a cure to the surgery
because my persona supposed to be not
trying to be I was trying to be the
douchey tech okay how about a lot of
those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
