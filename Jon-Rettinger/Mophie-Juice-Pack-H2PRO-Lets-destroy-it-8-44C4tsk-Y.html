Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and about a
week ago we received a rather unusual
package from OFI which contain different
vials of things like flour sand water
and even SpaghettiOs it was one of the
stranger packages we've ever received
but it all made sense when we realize
what else was inside which is Muffy's
new h2 pro battery case for the iphone 6
the juice pack h2 pro provides up to
100% of additional battery life for the
iphone 6 thanks to its built in 2,750
milliamp battery which Mophie says is
good for up to 10 hours of web 14 hours
of talk time or 50 hours of additional
music playback Mophie also told us that
the each.2 pro actually exceeds military
standards for protection against drops
up to 1.2 meters and has an IP 68 rating
which means it should withstand dust and
water immersion up to 1.2 meters for 30
minutes now all the ingredients Mophie
included with a package makes sense the
h2 pro is exactly what Mophie described
which is a rugged and durable case it
feels very sturdy and although it adds a
reasonable amount of bulk it's not quite
as thick as something like an otterbox
defender case so let's go ahead and see
how durable the Mophie h2 pro really is
Mophie gave us a few items to work with
to show you how their new each two pro
case holds up so let's go ahead and have
some fun now because Mophie sent us this
case with a bunch of random materials we
took it as a challenge to put the h2 pro
through its paces
that meant dousing it in sawdust and mud
and dunking it in our kitchen sink this
thing is meant to withstand the elements
so we did our best to mistreat the case
with an iPhone 6 inside and it seemed to
hold it very well and as you can see
from the video the phone is still fully
functional it's charging just like new
if you're frequently outdoors and need
to prolong your device's battery while
ensuring it's safe inside a case Mokey's
h2 pro is the perfect solution you get
the added benefit of a 2,750 milliamp
battery inside some amazingly durable
protection the juice pack age 2 pro
retails for 100 2995 and you can check
out the link in the description below to
pick one up for yourselves
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
