to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back to their pursuit of retinas
riffs to show her I can talk about
anything going on in my mind from the
world of technology up this week it is
all about Samsung I don't know when
you're going to watch this video but
Samsung Galaxy s5 event just wrapped up
at time of filming and I want to talk
about it you know and I think about it
when I think about the mobile
marketplace whether or not Samsung is
going to be super vulnerable in 2014 and
surrenders refs let's start riffing so
in case you've been living under a tech
rock the past couple days let me recap
the specs of the galaxy s5 before I get
into my riffy rant style thing about it
5.1 inch screen coincidentally it's got
a lower ppi in the galaxy s4 it's for 32
vs 441 although in all fairness the s4
is only a 5-inch screen it's a little
more powerful to 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor 2 gigs of ram available in 16
or 32 no more 64 camera got pretty
awesome camera upgrades 16 megapixel
camera but it's obviously not all about
the megapixels to you HD at 30 frames
per second it's got HDR video pretty
awesome image stabilization got a
fingerprint sensor built right into the
home button it's got a heart rate
monitor on the back it's got all kinds
of other awesome is crammed into that
little package okay speaking of that
little package so Samsung is now kind of
falling victim to same thing Apple had
fallen victim to if they don't
absolutely wow you and knocked it out
the park it's perceived as kind of a
failure the galaxy s5 could probably be
miraculous scribed as a galaxy s4 s very
incremental upgrades if you're the one
that has a galaxy s4 your poison pretty
right now look on your phone being like
and no need to upgrade wait for what
comes next and that I think is a really
really big problem Samsung has been
growing like crazy the fastest growing
smartphone manufacturer out there they
got phones and crazy sizes tablets and
crazy sighs and cameras and crazy sizes
and their galaxy s line of phones have
really been that anchor it sort of been
the halo car car dealership it's your
audi r8 and go to a dealership you might
not be there to get the guy right but
you might want to go dealership to see
it and water
there may be getting a four or maybe
again out ATT whatever it might be it
sort of been the same role that the
galaxy s line of phones have had I'm not
sure it's going on the same effect with
the galaxy s5 first to get said X of it
it's not a very good looking phones
available in four colors I really do
like the bright blue those are the
dimples back I don't think it's going
necessarily Wow consumers like folks
were expecting certainly looks on par
with other Samsung devices the galaxy s4
and galaxy s3 before that and the Galaxy
Note 3 you guys got that same look and
feel to it up there's nothing crazy knew
about it if you look at it might just
think it's another samsung galaxy phone
that's not what Samsung wants you to
think so they sold a crazy amount of
galaxy s4 is even the galaxy s3 quidsi
only was your best selling phone most US
carriers now have yearly upgrade options
so folks that purchase at galaxy s4
samsung i assume is going to want them
to upgrade to a galaxy s5 but if you're
sitting on a galaxy s4 not much
different so i get that same 1080 screen
you have a little slower spec froster
you get the same amount of ram maybe
even have more internal storage built
into it maybe you don't want that little
extra camera or maybe that's not worth
signing another year to your contract
for you you're going to look at other
devices coming out in the next few
months you're going to look at the next
HTC One your look at LG's pretty awesome
offerings with the LG yeah you know that
g2 maybe a g3 the g pro two if you want
to look at switching over to Apple the
iphone 6 what that might be there's very
little compelling reason I think to
upgrade to the galaxy s5 much like I
thought there's little compelling reason
to upgrade from an iphone 5 2 and iPhone
5s I think that really falls in the same
category so I think that Samsung really
has potential to lose some of their
significant market share this year I
think folks are going to jump to LG
gonna look at those and say I really
like that knock feature and I really
like what HTC is doing I like that
aluminum build alike to where the phone
feels I like their screens i like the
zoe software wherever it might be I
think they're going to be looking
elsewhere maybe they would have stayed
inside of Samsung's ecosystem so it's
going to be a tough year for samsung I
do think they'll return and sort of
bring the thunder of the next generation
phone which now we're talking about
rumors of the galaxy s6 but I think
Samsung now is more vulnerable than
they've been in many many many years so
