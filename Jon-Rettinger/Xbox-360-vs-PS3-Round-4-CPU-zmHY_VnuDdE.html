look at the controller's the SKUs the
design and the external features after
three round the score is 1:1 and now
we're starting to get into the stuff
that truly matters and sets these
devices apart in this round we're taking
an in-depth look at the CPUs its LP from
TechnoBuffalo and welcome to the next
installment of the console wars
back in the good old Nintendo
Entertainment System days no one really
talked about cpus and gpus when it came
down to game console performance back
then was all about the bits first start
with the 8-bit systems then 16 an
eventual assistant with a whopping 64
bits of graphics processing power pretty
amazing stuff but these days you
probably wish it was that simple game
console hardware is something one
doesn't slap together overnight a lot of
consideration is put into the hardware
because the life cycle of game consoles
can be from five to ten years the most
important factor for game console
hardware is to be balanced on low levels
this is obviously quite a task to
achieve on a limited budget some of you
guys may remember back in the day when
Sony execs introduced the concept of the
cell processor and the ps3 the device
originally had two HDMI ports that would
be capable of outputting to separate
1080p gameplay signals well that didn't
exactly happen and very few games are
running at 1080p from the single HMI
source the point is that Sony could have
manufactured Advice capable of this but
the manufacturing cost would have been
unbearable
when it comes down to hardware the
central processing unit is the heart of
the system so this round is the battle
between the Cell processor on the ps3
and then xenon CPU on the Xbox 360 the
power of the Cell processor has been
touted around the internet for years now
it's been claimed to be the chip capable
of almost super computing power contrary
to what a lot of people believe the ps3
does not have seven cores the cell
broadband engine is an IBM Power PC
based solution with the single core
controlling seven synergistic processing
elements or SPE s there's actually eight
SPE s but a single SPE is disabled for
better production yields also another
SPE is reserved for the ps3 user
interface X and B so that leaves a
single core and six synergistic
processing elements free for games code
so how the cell basically works is that
the computational workload comes through
the 3.2 gigahertz core and the core
assesses the workload and distributes
between the six synergistic processing
elements so you can basically have audio
processing handled by one SPE physics by
another and so forth it's a fairly
simple process in theory but game coders
have noticed over the past few years
that it can be a bit tricky in practice
the 360s xenon CPU is based also on an
IBM PowerPC core but that's pretty much
the only thing it has in common with the
Cell processor the xbox 360's processor
has three individual cores no SPE s like
the ps3 but three actual cores that can
accept computational tasks individually
multi-threaded code can be easily run on
any of the three cores which makes it a
pretty straightforward multi-core
solution that has raw computing power
when we start comparing the processors I
think it comes down to two main things
of course speed but also functionality
and by functionality in this case I mean
how easy it is to crunch out that speed
and power out of that CPU as the Xbox
360 had a year's head start over the ps3
it managed to get a large enough
installed base to make it the primary
development platform for most games so
the majority of multi-platform games
have been made for the Xbox 360 and port
it down to the ps3 and because the
primary processing element or the single
core on the ps3 is similar to the single
cores on Xbox 360s processor it's fairly
easy to get the same game working on the
ps3
but is not going to be running as well
if you do not take advantage of the 7 SP
es so a large number of multi-platform
games have been running thus far mostly
on the SEL single core leaving the
synergistic processing elements mostly
unused and unfortunately it shows but in
any case it's no secret that because of
the Zenon processor the Xbox 360 is the
main development platform for most games
because it's that much easier to develop
for having owned the ps3 from the very
beginning I've experienced enough bad
ports to last me a lifetime but there's
absolutely no doubt that the Cell
processor packs a serious punch if you
have the time capabilities of optimizing
and taking use of all the espys of the
ps3 you will get an enormous amount of
computing power but that's exactly just
it game developers these days are
pressed for time and money and capable
code writers are not abundant so the
lack of time money and expertise have
been the reason why ps3 games have been
having a tough time competing with the
same games on the Xbox 360 so a lot of
games have been running on lower frame
rates and inferior graphics and it's
definitely a frustrating situation for
Sony in particular as they know that the
hardware is capable of so much more
luckily the PSP counterparts have been
improving as the hope
without a better code for the ps3 but
unfortunately some major developers like
valve have stated that they will not be
developing for the ps3 for this reason
it's too much of a hassle and they
simply don't have the resources but the
PlayStation 3 and the Cell processor
definitely have a few aces up their
sleeve namely some very capable first
party developers like Naughty Dog who
will put in the extra mile to crunch out
the ps3 as well hidden potential the
guys at Naughty Dog have intimated that
with uncharted 2 they for the first time
been able to take almost 100% use of all
the PS threes SP ES and they've actually
managed to take a substantial load of
graphics pressing off the shoulders of
the GPU and pass it over to the Cell
processor which is definitely an
impressive feat as CPUs normally aren't
designed to handle complex graphics
calculations having played through
uncharted 2 I can say that it's
definitely one of the best looking games
made to date and it really shows off how
well the ps3 can handle physics
animations and high res textures or the
constant framerate 2009 has been a very
good year for Sony they finally come out
with some IPS that really show off what
the ps3 can do that Xbox 360 can and
according to game developers and Naughty
Dog in guerrilla games it's largely
thanks to the Cell processor but this
generation has proven that the time for
exclusives is coming to an end 1 Sony
exclusive like Final Fantasy and Metal
Gear Solid are now being developed for
the Xbox 360 and even the continuation
for exclusivity of the Gears of War
series on the Xbox is not confirmed it's
simply a matter of economics games are
increasingly expensive to develop and
the install base of a single platform is
just not enough multi-platform games are
the future and from this perspective no
matter how much power first party
developers crank out of the Cell
processor multi-platform developers like
EA and Ubisoft will not be putting extra
hours to make the ps3 counterparts run
or look any better than Xbox 360
versions in fall 2008 I would have
declared the Xbox 360 a winner in this
round but the games released this year
have really proven the cell processors
potential and in my opinion they finally
showed some stuff that the ps3
at the xbox360 can't the xbox360 exonym
CPU is more than a capable processor but
game developers have admitted that
they've already hit the limits of the
CPU the biggest way to tip the scales
for the cell is that it can also handle
graphics processing which enables the
ps3 to move beyond the limitations of
the GPU and that is what really sets the
Cell processor apart from the Xenon CP
on xbox 360 the PlayStation 3 takes the
process around by a slight edge and puts
the ps3 ahead of the Xbox 360 in the
total score so I guess the 400 million
bucks Sony invested in the cell
broadband engine is starting to pay off
GPUs are up next so stay tuned for the
next round of the console wars LP
