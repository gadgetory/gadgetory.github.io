for Lakers I'd like to give you guys for
my review of the iPhone 3G I'm gonna
start off with the hardware the first
thing you're gonna notice about the
iPhone 3G is opposed to the first
generation iPhone is y'all plus it back
and I'll show you guys in a minute why
that is the second thing you'll notice
is 9on recessed 3.5 millimeter headset
jack i mean that you can now plug any
head so that you'd like into the phone
and don't have to worry about buying an
adapter there was a lot of complaints
first time around with that recess to
headphone jack back in Steve Jobs
announced the iPhone 3G he made a point
to say that the headphone was no longer
recessed it should've been like that in
the first place
on the back of it you'll now notice
there are two screws right there and
there what people are suggesting make
moving the battery a little bit easier
but as of now it's still not user
replaceable battery you've got a speaker
and a microphone right there while
around the speaker the speaker phone on
this generation phone is very loud music
on it comes across it's about twice as
loud as a first-generation I'm gonna
watch a YouTube video or listen to music
to the speaker here I have to pull it
all the way up to be able to hear it now
about half way and it's still very loud
so speaker volume was an issue on your
first generation phone an iPhone 3G
really takes care of that and take care
of it very nicely now that probably the
biggest change not hardware wise is the
addition of a 3G radio and what people
hear 3G throw right all the time what
that stands for technically is
third-generation of a wireless data and
what the iPhone uses is technology
called HSDPA and UMTS and that's just
fancy talk for broadband like speeds on
your phone to compare 3G to edge it's
about two and a half to three and a half
times as fast and I'll give you guys a
little demonstration of the speed in a
couple minutes so you can see how
quickly 3G really is I think when you
compare 3G to typical Wi-Fi on the
iPhone but they had the first generation
and the secretary and generation had
it's about two or three seconds slower
loading and intensive webpage like ESPN
for example so you really do get
broadband light speeds on your phone
now I told you I mentioned the plastic
back and why Apple went to plastic as
opposed to aluminum what plastic enables
the phone to do is send and receive a
clear signal meaning a reception is
better now Wi-Fi reception is markedly
better I can go probably 2033 farther
now that I could with the first
generation phone and still get a Wi-Fi
signal so that is a really very nice
addition what other reason they want
plastic is there's now a built-in gps
chip in the phone and it's not just a
typical gps like you find in a car or
most cell phones Apple uses what's
called assisted GPS now while it still
does have a true GPS chip meaning it
sends a signal to satellite satellite
beams on your location definitely does
that as well but is it something called
the assisted like I mentioned earlier
and what that does it uses cell towers
and Wi-Fi hotspots to help triangulate
your location so that means you can get
a better location in a more exact
location rather a little bit quicker if
you're indoors for example and you don't
have a direct view to the sky to get
satellite reception now you'll be able
to know relatively close where you are
which is really nice additional feature
as of now there's still not a
turn-by-turn application on the phone
like a Garmin or Magellan GPS but you do
get built-in Google Maps which the first
generation phone had as well so you know
there's the some pros and cons of the
phone but I was talking about the 3G
radio which is very nice and the
addition of 3G also means decrease of
battery life 3G is a very battery hungry
technology whereas just my first
generation iPhone I could get through
the full day with checking email every
half hour maybe 2 hours of phone calls
and pretty heavy internet use by end of
the day
I probably have about 45 50 percent of
my battery left when I first got the
iPhone 3G and you're doing the same
thing by 3 o'clock in the afternoon the
battery was dead however the battery has
been conditions now for a week since
then and I can easily get through a full
day with no problem but instead of the
percentage I had before now at the end
of the day I usually only have about 30%
battery life so there's a significant
decrease so be aware of that as well
one thing that Apple is offering as well
they had in the old phone is capacities
of 8 and 16 gigabytes
I went 16 gigabyte you guys can't see
what it's down there I'm both available
in a white or black in the 16 gig
configurations the 8 is just available
in in black the white one looks really
slick by the way yeah check it out and I
really liked it so definitely something
to to check out so my review of the
phone is if 3g is important to you if
you need a faster data you know you
can't be be as far as browser wise I use
the internet a lot so that was a big
selling point for me I don't use the GPS
very much but it's nice to have and the
iPhone 2.0 software which is available
on the first generation phone and the
new one as well as the iPod touch really
is just a nice bonus features I'll give
you guys a real 30 second walkthrough of
that because I had cut off with time
because from YouTube
so in conclusion guys before I show you
the software stuff if you need a phone
that's three gene you need a phone that
has a GPS you know how they recommend
this Apple added this new feature called
mobile me which enables push email to
the phone which is very nice which push
means instead of having your phone check
this network for messages the messages
are actually pushed directly to your
phone different do teen pull is what
happened what they call it when it
checks and pushes when automatically
gets sent to your phone so guys I really
do enjoy the 3G iPhone if you're in the
US and your current iPhone owner or you
are coming on a new contract
it's either 199 or $2.99 for the 8 or 16
gigabytes if you are already an 18 key
customer that's not due for an upgrade
it leaves three
nineteen 499 so it's a little bit more
expensive if you're not due for an
upgrade but if you're looking to make
the move date teen teen you want an
iPhone highly recommend the iPhone 3G I
have not been disappointed in the
slightest with it so that's my review
i'll show you guys a real quick
walkthrough of the software alright so
here is the home screen of the new
iPhone 3G I'm gonna do another video
that's a full software walk over I walk
through but I want to show you guys this
and just very quickly it notice that
there's edition of the app store which
was not present on a first generation
phone and what that does is it lets you
download legitimate third-party
applications without having to jailbreak
your phone which is very nice
you can view by featured categories top
25 you know all kinds of different
features and different programs free to
choose from a really welcome welcome
addition I really like having it so
that's the App Store and you can you can
see some of the apps I've downloaded
here hey I am a remote application to
control your iTunes Texas Holdem box
office sodoku dial zero and monkeyball
which you guys all wanted me to download
so I did last night and I'll do a review
for you guys in a minute so software
wise it still looks the same the push
email is the only addition but you can't
really see that here you know there are
some new features like the calculator
when you turn it sideways you get a full
scientific one you can now take screen
captures of your screen but nothing else
revolutionary software wise so let me go
ahead and give you a demonstration of
the 3G radio alright guy that turned off
Wi-Fi and I'm here with only one bar of
3G so my 3G reception is not the best
but you'll get a sense of how quick the
lows I'm gonna load up ww John for
Lakers calm and we'll see how quickly
how quickly that lows
you guys can probably track this they're
on their YouTube time the thicker seeds
already started to load and there you go
it's still loading a little bit but it's
pretty much done very quick and that's
it so guys this is my review of the 3G
iPhone thank you all for watching be
