to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys the Markman sangin from
TechnoBuffalo and Google i/o has come
and gone headlined by the announcement
of Android M we did a video in Google's
new OS shortly after it came out which
will leave a link down below this video
but today we'll be showing you guys five
features secret features that Google
didn't show off during a keynote number
one on our list is the dark and light
theme Google's overall UI has been
steadily getting brighter and brighter
with a move to a white system theme in
Android lollipop
luckily Android M now offers an option
to switch between a light and dark theme
the theme option inside developers
option has settings for light which is
the default dark and automatic if you
enable dark mode all the settings
screens will switch over to material
dark and as far as we can tell it
doesn't affect any other apps or any
part of the device also we're not
entirely sure what automatic setting
does but we're assuming it'll somehow
switch from light to dark at a
predetermined time like at night keep in
mind that this is a Developer Preview so
what we're showing you right now could
be scrapped altogether hopefully we'll
see this in the final release and Google
if you're watching this please keep this
feature number two is to turn on or off
doze on a per app basis one of Google's
big projects for Android M is battery
optimization and it's doing this by
implementing a new feature called doze
that essentially puts unneeded apps into
an ultra low power state those should be
smart enough to wake apps up when they
have a high priority action and perform
so even if your alarm app has been
dozing it'll still work however if you
want a certain app to ignore doze and
want it to run in the background at all
times you can disable doze on a per app
basis by heading into settings battery
ignore optimizations and going into all
apps it's a nice feature to have though
we don't really see an advantage for
this feature just yet number three on
our list is the new RAM manager Android
does a pretty decent job of managing its
memory but unfortunately it doesn't
really show you what app is using the
most RAM and Android M there's a new
brand manager that shows a detailed
overview of what apps are always running
and how much memory an app uses on
average here you can check up on what
app is eating all the memory and you can
of course stop or for stop the app if
you're experiencing slowdowns now to get
to this page you can head on over to the
Settings app going into apps tap three
dots at the top going into advance and
going to memory number four on our list
is do not disturb mode during Google i/o
Google highlighted two simplified volume
controls which now
brings up the volume slider with an
arrow that expands the menu to give you
controls over alarms notifications and
media separately one thing that Google
didn't talk about is the addition of do
not disturb mode DND first arrived with
Android L though the final version of
lollipop refer to this functionality as
priority interruptions DMD and Android M
pretty much offers the same basic
functionality as previous interruption
options but there's a few interesting
changes as well including a new repeat
callers option that lets the caller
through if they call back within 15
minutes and automatic rules that give
you some basic options of when to turn
on do not disturb mode automatically you
like on the weekends weeknights or
during weekly meetings you can enable do
not disturb mode by either holding the
volume button down or toggling it
through the quick settings menu now to
access the new D in these settings you
can head on over to sounds and
notifications and go into do not disturb
let me stop the video real fast and
thank our friends over at domain.com

idea hits you so one-stop shopping for
all your domain names and web hosting

domain names and web hosting if you use
the coupon code TechnoBuffalo it's all
one word in caps at domain coms check
out number five is to turn off heads up
notifications heads up notifications
came to stock Android as a native
function baked into lollipop but not
everyone liked having notifications Papa
for every app with a major in EM you'll
be able to disable heads of
notifications on a per app basis for
example you're getting too many Gmail
notifications and you don't want the
notification banner to keep popping up
you'll be able to disable the
notification banner for Gmail while
keeping your other apps on touch of
course you can always enable do not
disturb mode and disable all
notifications but if you simply want to
avoid getting heads-up notifications for
apps you now have the options to disable
them on a per app basis now to turn this
feature on head on over to the sound and
notifications go into app notifications
go ahead and select an app and disable
peaking and that's about it Android M is
of course still in beta so everything
that we showed you today could
potentially be scrapped we're still
playing around with Android m and if we
notice any other major changes we'll be
sure to keep you guys in the loop if you
guys enjoy this video make sure to give
it a thumbs up and we will see you guys
in the next one
