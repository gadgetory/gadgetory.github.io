technobuffalo here over the weekend palm
finally unleashed webOS 1.42 their pre
and pixi and their + variant devices so
that will be everyone who's got a web OS
phone there is slew of new features i
want to show you sort of some of the the
biggest ones and show you what you can
expect on webos 1.4 before i get started
the one thing i want to mention is that
flash is coming to the pre and pre plus
not the pixi devices it's not available
right now with OS 1.4 it will be
download from palms App Store or their
application market so I'm going to keep
in mind and they are saying that it will
be coming very soon so it'll be another
nice augmentation to a pretty solid
platform this was an over-the-air
download that took from download to
install on the packing probably about 45
minutes total so 1.4 brought video
recording capabilities to palm devices
let me show you what that looks like go
ahead and launch the camera you also be
able to see one of the other new changes
to 1.42 you get a little icon that shows
up there when it launches the program to
show you what you're launching so the
interface here looks very similar what
we had before except now in the upper
right hand corner there is a little
camcorder button go ahead and push that
head into this video I will put a
demonstration as to what the video
capture capability in the palm pre and
the palm pre plus you go ahead and just
hit record you can record sort of as you
would on any other device now you also
get some cool capabilities as far as
editing that may look a bit familiar let
me show you what those look like as well
and you can edit and actually one touch
upload to your favorite social media
site go ahead launch videos Jim here's a
video that I recorded yesterday was
playing around with this and again you
can see how the like on shows up now
when you launch programs that was never
there before it just took a couple
minutes so here is my video role here's
one that I filmed go ahead and launch
that right there
you can see what playback looks like a
dwelled priest entered so again I'll put
a video how this works and what the
quality looks like then so you can get a
judge for yourself let me show you some
of the things you can do with this
though so you can do some one touch
editing hit the button in the bottom
right hand corner and you can serve drag
and trim around to clip the video as
you'd like we may have seen this before
on let's say another phone and beside
that you want to clip it going at the
check mark and it doesn't delete your
original copy it actually saves the
original one and saves the new version
as well so we'll go ahead and let's say
we want to accept that now you can also
upload it so go ahead hit that up on the
upper right hand corner she upload
YouTube share via email or share via SMS
are some of your options that you now
have so you can upload those directly so
aside from the video capabilities and
this is now on all palm devices let me
show you some the other changes that
you'll have go ahead and throw this card
away let's go ahead and launch email
this is where some of the other changes
reason I'd or some of the bigger changes
that I found most useful so go ahead and
launch the inbox you can now sort this
by date by sender and by subject which
is an option that wasn't there before
which makes it a lot easier for managing
your mail is very hard to sort of search
for particular item that maybe wasn't
set in the past day or two yet scroll
through and scroll through and scroll
through to find it this is a very
welcome addition also here now is the
ability to have the phone recognized
phone numbers be able to dial it right
from an email as a hot link that wasn't
there before something new that was
finally just added to webos device and
I'll show you right whether that means
you got an email here that I sent and
I'm not sure which format for putting in
numbers work so I put in a whole bunch
here and you can see that they all come
up hot link now go ahead just click one
of them and it should launch the dialer
and there we go and now i can scroll
head and call it and we
would be off so there are slew of other
changes here as well some of that much
I'm now going to demonstrate they
include custom notifications now for
calendar phone book transfer performance
enhancements within the phone and
calendar you can allow custom alert
sounds like I said you can forward tech
messages to email which is quite nice
you can press and hold on the pound
button to get more call options let's
see what that looks like actually press
and hold it's not a pretty doing it
without the p that's a little weird go
back try it again still dial the piece
so that was one of the updates I was
supposed to be there clearly is not the
case on their slew of other one this
again this will support flash 10 beta
will be available in palms at catalog
but it is not available today and that
won't be out for pixie owners it's just
going to be for the pre and pre plus
folks out there so supposedly as in cluj
performance and battery life and I
haven't had it long enough to be a judge
of that it does seem a bit more zippy
though I will tell you that much and I
got hope you enjoyed this very quick
overview of Palm webOS 1.4 for those of
you palm owners out there you already
gotten your download on are you waiting
to sort of see if there any bugs that
come out with it Andrey guys i'm jon
rettinger from technobuffalo i will see
you in the next video
this is a test of the view recording
capabilities on the palm pre plus and
the web OS 1.4 platform it's relatively
low light situations here go ahead and
see how that looks we got a video of
Mercedes go ahead and add some light and
see if that helps so a little bit we'll
keep moving along
