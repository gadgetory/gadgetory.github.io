technobuffalo with your unboxing of the
achieve Odyssey this Windows Phone 8
pack and device is got a 4 inch screen
made by samsung let's go and take a look
unbox it and see if it should be your
phone for the next two years alright so
here we've got the teeny tiny achieve
odyssey box going to be available in
just a few days on the 24th it's gonna
cost it just about 50 bucks obviously
check online because prices can totally
very and running Windows Phone 8 gonna
tell you what's in the box but of course
we're gonna go ahead and check that out
ourselves we will ceremoniously strip
this guy bear and boom there it is the
EU odyssey pushed off the side from just
a quick moment and see what else we're
going to have inside of the box we've
got a charge and sync cable it's pretty
standard microUSB variety wall adapter
with USB plug I've got some achieve
odyssey books nothing overly exciting in
there let's go ahead and push all that
stuff off to the side and here is the 4
inch of TV Odyssey after testing so many
phones and most are bigger than four
it's amazing that this feels teeny tiny
from the screen standpoint but just goes
to show how much can change in a year
alright so let's go ahead and run
through the specs of this guy so from
dimension standpoint its 4.8 2 inches x
2.5 15.4 3 it's a 4-inch screen as i
mentioned the resolution of 480 x 800
that is a pretty paltry 233 ppi go ahead
and peel it off the screen here I know
you guys hate that it's going to wait
for point 41 ounces it's got a removable
2100 milliamp hour battery it's a
Snapdragon s4 processor 1.5 gigahertz
it's got a gig of ram in here 8
megapixel camera living or right there
on the back with LED flash and it's got
a 1.2 megapixel shooter right there on
the front verizon LTE it's got bluetooth
4.0 and NFC on a board alright so
beneath this 4 inch screen we've got a
pretty standard Windows buttons in fact
these buttons are mandate
by Microsoft got a back button we've got
your windows home button and you're
being search button on the left hand
side volume rocker up and down this guy
is going to come with eight megabytes of
a gigabyte rather of internal storage
but of course you can expand that via
microSD I love they put this on the side
and not beneath the battery on the
right-hand side we've got a power and
lock button and we've got a blue guitar
and required for windows phone camera
button living down below on the top
noise-cancelling microphone 3.5
millimeter headset jack down below
there's a charging port speaker grill on
the back let's go ahead and see if we
can pull off the back here and take a
look at we're going to have underneath
Samsung been using plastic back from the
phones for quite a while this one is no
exception so here we've got the 2100
milliamp hour battery and there's the
verizon 4g LTE sim card and that is a
micro sim in case you guys are wondering
it's fine the battery looks like it's in
backwards but that's the way it fits in
there let's go ahead and put this case
back on of course we'll run through a
full review of this guy put it through
its paces any particular you want to see
of the achieve odyssey let us know in
the comments battery's dead it was
buzzing in the box so fortunately can't
turn it on but of course it is running
pretty standard Windows Phone 8 i'm
actually think it's got a little juice
in it nope I lied let's do a real quick
size comparison with its windows phone 8
friends here is the HTC made 8x and see
the size difference right there on the
backs and here is perhaps the Big Daddy
of Windows Phone this is the Lumia 920
see difference there as well and just
for fun I've got one next to me here is
an iphone 5 24 inch and 4 inch grade I
can see how these two look side by side
so again I put this phone through its
paces and let you guys know what we
think in our full review up your chick
is at a techno Buffalo compilation
greatest tech news i am jon rettinger
see you next video bye bye
