to you by audible welcome back to the
episode of ask the Buffalo I'm your host
John Wren just to show you could ask me
any question you've got from the wide
world of technology if you want when
your questions featured on ask the
Buffalo we made it super simple every
tuesday on TechnoBuffalo com you can go
ahead and leave a question we put an
article up and just leave it in the
comments or if you're more socially
inclined you could send it to me on
twitter either at your on for lakers or
ask TechnoBuffalo and use hashtag ask
the be that simple usually will pick
about four questions each week of this
week we're going to talk about the xbox
720 maybe throw some ps4 talk in their
galaxy s4 a little bit about why I
started making videos and all kinds of
other tech in between disaster Buffalo
let's go and get started so the ps4
rumors have been dominating the news but
let's not forget about Microsoft's baby
the xbox 720 allegedly first question
comes from Marcus renegade who asked hey
John do you think that the xbox 720 will
be called the xbox 720 no I do not that
makes no sense 360 made sense because it
was an immersive 360-degree experience
720 would be an immersive 360-degree
experience twice I may be able to be
xbox next or maybe they'll do microsoft
xbox you like Nintendo did cuz that made
sense I don't think it's gonna be a 720
named Alan dates gonna be xbox 360 um
other word you can expect support for 4k
you could expect and improved connect
with more points of focus on the body so
you can get a little bit more accuracy
also we're getting rumors that you might
actually get some sort of facial
recognition as well be able to sense
when you're smiling when you're blinking
and maybe even some sort of I control
since you're staring at a camera anyway
mitch is wishful thinking but that would
be pretty cool hopefully that helped
answer questions let's go from games to
phone to talk about the galaxy s4 next
question comes from Sasha Mahal I'm
sorry for this massacred your name hey
John what features you think you're
going to be in the samsung galaxy s4 i
think we're very very close to seeing
the
galaxy s4 be revealed at Mobile World
Congress in just about a week and a half
pending on when you watch this video's I
think a few things are going to be
flagship features first a bigger 5-inch
1080p screen if you've ever seen the
screen on the droid DNA I it looks crazy
real like there's a sticker on it I
almost doesn't look like a real screen
so expect that on a 5-inch screen with
Samsung's pretty impressive screen
technology eight cores packing that bad
boy with up to four gigs of RAM I'm
sings gonna be pretty much a computer
you can install windows aid or you know
OS 10 on it I probably use it as that
not saying it's gonna be a feature just
crazy powerful we're gonna have support
for wireless charging there of course
NFC and Samsung should update the touch
with a little less cartoony sort of what
we've been hearing so for that old enter
question let's go from tech to little
stuff that's personal sometimes like you
guys a glimpse in my life in these
videos this one comes from Twitter and
user at prison sing sorry again if I
massacred your name at John for lakers
what got you interested in making
YouTube videos this is back now five
almost six years ago before YouTube was
really a thing when YouTube was pretty
much a place where dudes got kicked in
the business and cat played piano I
always wanted to talk about computers I
was switching to OS 10 at the time I was
using a giant HP computer it was broken
and I was looking for a way to sort of
learn how to use new operating system I
never used a mac OS before and I wanted
to learn so why not YouTube see if there
was someone that could show me how to do
something as opposed to just reading
about it I really weren't any videos so
I figured it was an excuse for me to
research and get a video camera remember
i went to costco and I got this digital
tape camera from early videos you can
hear the tape being wound as I'm filming
I just I want to have fun I wanted a way
to talk about technology i love it i
still love that i used to go walk around
best buy just for fun I didn't have any
style of my own I so actually I modeled
my style initially after a guy and the
UK he does make videos anymore but his
name was danny is eight and he really
helped shape the style ultimately became
my videos so that's sort of the short
version of how and why i started making
videos so let me take a break from the
questions for a minute to thank our

alright let's jump back to phone to talk
about daily drivers user at Keio victor
s 80s at john for lakers the blackberry
z10 your new daily drivers and you
already made a review about it the
answer is yes it is now dig it out of my
pocket the blackberry z10 that we just
reviewed on technobuffalo calm ended up
getting an eight scorned the moral was
it's a great operating system it's
almost on par with iOS and Android but
it's not better doesn't bring anything
new or different I couldn't really think
of the one compelling reason to go out
and buy the blackberry z10 as opposed to
an iOS or Android phone and I mentioned
the review if you want to win a race you
got to run fashion the competition not
as fast and I don't think blackberry is
there yet though I will say this though
it is probably the best first generation
operating system that I've ever seen so
they certainly spent a lot of time
honing it and did great job so fettled
