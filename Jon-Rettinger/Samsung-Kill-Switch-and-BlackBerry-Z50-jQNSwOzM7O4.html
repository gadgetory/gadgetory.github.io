to you by Forza Motorsport 5 only on
Xbox one coming November 22nd what's up
everybody welcome back there pisode of
rumor roundup I'm your host John rent
and journey if you couldn't tell by the
title it's the show we take all the tech
lovers from the week and we tell you the
biggest baddest rumors that you need to
know of this week Samsung's trying to
play the good guy the US government
saying no the iPhone 5c is definitely
not selling as well as Apple hoped they
might be shutting down a supply line and
BlackBerry is sticking with the old
mantra if it ain't broke don't fix it
someone to tell them though it's
probably a little bit broken this rumor
roundup it's going to get started so
usually when you hear cell phone
manufactures in government you
immediately think of gigantic patent
lawsuits but this time Samsung was
trying to help its customers if you
believe the rumors for major US carriers
so that would be Verizon t-mobile Sprint
and AT&amp;amp;T have reportedly rejected an
attempt by Samsung to include a kill
switch in its phones according to
reports the New York Times Stanley
wanted to include the feature at the
request of lawmakers an effort to help
curb the increasing smartphone theft so
phones are getting stolen you could
contact Samsung they activate that kill
switch and then it's just a brett's
device but this is where things get a
little shady carrier executives did not
approve the feature because of the
potential for loss insurance of profit
which might cause customers to not buy
the insurance so they'd rather sell you
insurance and have you replaced the
phone that have to worry about selecting
a kill switch and getting your phone to
stopped either way though it seems you'd
have to buy a new phone anyway just the
thief wouldn't be able to use it so
maybe they're going after that really
important ever important thief's dollar
cuz they need to buy a new phone doesn't
make any sense it seems like a feature
that should absolutely be there
Apple High believe has the kill switch
in the iPhone 5s in the iPhone 5 they've
had I believe since about the iPhone 3GS
certainly it seems a company that only
helps consumers no idea why it wouldn't
get approved but insurance money is nice
so gimme so I'd imagine about a year ago
all the Apple executives sit in a room
or like you know what we're gonna
release the iPhone 5s but we need
something else I think we need an
unapologetically plastic phone
one that comes in colors and the world
will love it well he was the same
hardware we already have in the iPhone 5
and we'll pretend that it's all new and
everybody's going to buy it apparently
though that plan is not quite played at
least that's how it went in my head so
my version of the story is one version
another version might be that they just
already have enough stock sitting in
warehouses but one way or another Apple
stopping production of the full capacity
of the iPhone 5c according to report on
Monday when a Foxconn facilities
manufacturing this just mentioned 5c is
going to stop in an effort to produce
more iPhone 5s s-so Foxconn Zing's you
plant
excuse my miss pres Asian of Chinese as
a factor in question according to the
ever reliable digit times
Foxconn fest manufacturer just 30% of
the iPhone 5c production Pegatron which
always sounds like a really bad evil
transformer another supplier you're
still building the other 70% of the
iPhone 5c orders those originally
reportedly asked to cut production
recent weeks Apple probably makes sense
to cut the iPhone 5c cuz they just made
up 27% of all their sales
it hasn't been selling all that well
haven't seen that many out in the wild
perhaps cut the price might make them
sell a little more that was to be what
everybody thought when it was released
but either way the iPhone 5s is selling
so we make more of those certainly makes
more sense to me
and what would rumor around up be
without talking about blackberry so this
year we saw the launch of the Q series
or z series blackberry 10 everything
looked rosy until nobody bought it so
according to the rumor mill a quad core
is the 50 and Q 30 are due next year so
up until recently it looked like
blackberry z30 might be its swan song
but they're fresh in fact from a billion
dollar investment from Fairfax and
evidently they expect to continue going
on for at least one more round of phones
so on that note let's start the rumors
evidently blackberry is going to be
releasing two new quad-core devices in
2014 according to the Chinese site see
tech BlackBerry's next to smartphones
will be the Z 50 and the Q 30 the 50
only poorly be an all touch device with
a pretty nice 5.2 inch 1080p display and
supposed to launch in q3 of 2014 that is
like September of next year meanwhile
little is really known about the cute
it'll probably have a QWERTY keyboard
and looked a lot like the q10 did and
probably the same specs and a smaller
screen that one's luck to hit until q2
of 2014 I think of all the phones that
are gonna come out before that we're
gonna have Galaxy s5s we're gonna maybe
even have an iPhone 6 by the time q4
rolls around they're gonna compete
against some really heavy phones that
means are going to battle for the rest
of 2014 the beginning part of 2014 with
the Q 30 at the Z 30 and the z10 in
which I don't think is gonna be a
winning combination for them it seems to
me the BlackBerry's two-prong strategy
of the Q and Z is just not working and
maybe to go back to the drawing board
they got a fresh CEO perhaps they need
fresh ideas but things are not looking
rosy for the house that Blackberry built
let me stop for a minute to thank our
friends and sponsors at Forza Motorsport
5 only on Xbox one coming November 20
seconds if you're like me you love video
games that I'm super excited about the
next generation of consoles because of
the power and the graphics look
incredible I'm also a big car guy Forza
Motorsport 5 takes advantage the
Connecticut Billy's the Xbox one
delivering features that could really
only happen with this current console
takes advantage of the cloud and
actually mimics really human behavior by
learning how you and your friends are
going to drive then it creates a network
of opponents that are gonna compete and
counter whatever you do on a regular
basis that's right Forza Motorsport 5
