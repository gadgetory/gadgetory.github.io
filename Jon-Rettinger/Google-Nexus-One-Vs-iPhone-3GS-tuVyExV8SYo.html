TechnoBuffalo here there are a lot of
fantastic smartphones either available
now are coming out in the near future
but to have probably the most impressive
that are available today are the iPhone
3GS and the Google Nexus One we're going
to put these two but hemas head-to-head
in a battery of tests discussing browser
and half speed text entry customization
and scrolling navigation apps maps
operating system and some overall
specifications and you guys can
determine which phone is best for you so
before we get started with all of the
features and functions let me go over
some of the general specifications of
the devices because they do vary quite a
bit
the iPhones got a 3.5 inch capacitive
touchscreen compared to the 3.7 inch
screen on the Nexus One the iPhones got
a resolution of 320 by 480 and the Nexus
One has a resolution of 480 by 800 so a
big difference there the iPhones
processor is 600 megahertz whereas a
processor on the Nexus One is 1
gigahertz which is quite a bit faster
the iPhone can come in either 16 or 32
gig specifications whereas the Nexus One
comes with a 4 gigabyte of expandable
memory going up to potentially 32 gigs 5
hours of battery life talktime on the
iPhone compared to 7 on the Nexus One
300 is standby time on the iPhone
compared to 250 on the Nexus One 3
megapixel camera on the iPhone 5
megapixel camera on the Nexus One so
right off the bat Nexus One has an edge
in almost all specs that we've gone over
thus far
both have Wi-Fi GPS voice commands they
both have app stores the itunes app
catalog has about a 93 thousand
applications or a bit more now and the
Android Marketplace has about 20,000 so
enough of the stuff that you can't see
let's start with the stuff that you can
I use the browser on a daily basis
probably the most important feature that
I need in a smartphone we're going to
compare browsers on both of these
devices the iPhone of course is running
on e TNT's network whereas the Nexus One
is unlocked it can be run on either 18
- your t-mobile but if you want 3G
speeds that will only be t-mobile so to
take the networks out of it that's going
to vary depending on where you are in
your network speed we're running on the
same Wi-Fi network here so it should be
a relatively fair comparison to connect
to the same network we're going to low
TechnoBuffalo commas like that's been
put on both these devices before so
they'll simulate the speed of a website
that you visit on a pretty regular basis
let's go ahead and get this started
well queue up TechnoBuffalo on each got
it ready to go here let's get it ready
to go on the Nexus One okay see if we
can hit go at the same time and we
should be off to the races so again
these are on the same Wi-Fi network so
it's like the Nexus One has a pretty
early lead here it's almost done the
iPhone is catching up the Nexus One is
done and the iPhone 3GS is still going I
phone still loaded and now it's done
certainly the Nexus One has an edge in
speed and I will tell you that this is
not a unique I've seen the Nexus One
have an edge in all the web pages that
I've tested going head-to-head so let's
check out scrolling and navigation and
see how things work here scrolling on
the iPhone is very smooth you very
rarely get this sort of box pattern at
the end the processor can keep up with
where you want to go scrolling on the
Nexus One is much the same experience
relatively quick although I did find
that the physics engine on the iPhone
seemed to be a little bit better a
little more smooth on the Nexus One it
seems to be a little bit choppy but
certainly not bad I have it using an
iPhone through the first came out so
admittedly I'm used to the multi-touch
capabilities the pinch and zoom are
really essential for me the Nexus One
does not have that it has it's zoom
functionality there be a double tap
which of course the iPhone supports as
well or you can zoom in by the plus and
minus right there now for someone like
me is used to the iPhone I missed a
pinch and zoom if you're an Android user
you've never been used to it you're not
going to miss the features so it's
really going to come down to personal
preference what you prefer personally I
like the pigeon zoom but I could
probably get used to the lack of it just
because of the big screen and the
you're browsing room on the nexus one
it's a very nice browsing experience
I'll definitely tell you that and it's
probably as close to the iPhone browsing
experience as I've seen so definitely
Google did a fantastic job with the
browser so let's talk about text entry
very important for really most of things
that you do as far as email and text
messaging okay so let's go ahead and
check out the keyboards on each we'll
start with a keyboard on the iPhone go
ahead and open up the notes application
here and we'll see how things work so
typing on the iPhone is done really in
one way via its on-screen keyboard and
you can type it either in landscape or
portrait so you've got portrait here
rotate it over and you've got landscape
but I want to preface this and all in
all candor let you know that I am an
iPhone user so I am probably more used
to the iPhone keyboard but be able to
see the speed and the typing ability on
each so check out the keyboard here on
the Nexus while I'm going to compose a
new message and there it is and of
course you've got a landscape keyboard
as well let's go ahead and talk about
the portrait keys first I'll do a quick
test as to how this works and I'll type
this is a test and we can see how it
comes out I can see the autocorrect and
the overall speed so this is a test
pretty accurate let's try the same thing
on the Nexus One
this moose ate eat so not quite as
accurate but again I'm used more little
more used to the iPhone keyboard let's
turn this thing off to the side and see
how it works now I'm trying to say
anything again this is a test so a
little more accurate this is a test it
didn't quite correct it but it wasn't
bad now we're going to compare
out-of-the-box functionality as I
demonstrate in a previous video the
Nexus 1 also has speech-to-text meaning
I can tap that little icon right there
looks like a microphone say the words I
want and the text automatically show up
there the iPhone has abstract out of the
box does not do it so let's try
landscape keyboard on the iPhone
so this is a test I did spell something
wrong but Otto corrected it so at the
end of the day I think it's going to
come down to personal preference I'm
probably more accurate on the iPhone
again because I'm used to it but I can
certainly see myself becoming as
accurate on the Nexus one the larger
screen space definitely lends itself as
well to a bigger typing room I do prefer
the autocorrect on the iPhone but the
system on Android is quite good as well
so again that's going to be down to
which one you're used to and prefer
let's go ahead and move on to our tests
with customization and scrolling we'll
start with customization on the iPhone
this will be very short because there's
not much you can do out of the box with
the iPhone a lot of people talk about
jailbreaking and other things you can do
we're going to talk about just the stock
iPhone customization ability so the
customization is pretty much limited to
moving this these rows of icons I can
move them anywhere I like and I can
manage them you know pretty simple Avon
add elite 1h co-ed hit the X and that's
really the extent of the customization
that I can do on the iPhone is move the
icons to where they suit me best on the
Nexus One for example there's a lot more
customization options that are available
let me show you what those are so for
example let's talk about home screens
I've got several home screens that I can
use a manipulate think I have several
home screens of apps on the iPhone
however these are not dependent on
applications being there I've got five
home screens that I can choose from you
can see this one here doesn't have
anything on it so we'll start looking at
this one if I hold my finger down I've
got a ton of options that I can pick so
I'll make this phone my own I can pick
application shortcuts I can pick a
variety of widgets folders that I want
to go through right Nick wallpapers both
live wallpapers like you're seeing here
the ones that move around or static
images so I can definitely have much
more customization on the Android
operating system much more this is one's
not even close to what I can do I can
make this device really my own sort of
keeping pace and keeping things fair I
can also move the icons around just like
I could on the iPhone on the iPhone the
applications are stored just on your
desktop by a series of icons here on the
Nexus One they're stored in this folder
right here which is a little bit new
gone is the drawer that slides up in
have a pretty cool 3d looking array of
applications you can move these really
anywhere you like when it comes to
customization this is a no-brainer
Android clearly comes out on top and it
gives you much more ability to sort of
do what you what you'd like a little bit
more let's go ahead and talk about
navigation now on both devices
navigation on the iPhone is an exclusive
just to your finger really the only hard
buttons that you use are the home button
the lock and the volume on the side is
really not much else but for navigation
you're really only using your finger and
it works it very well it's smooth its
crisp and you really know where things
are navigation on the droid is a little
bit different of course you are finger
is still your main point of contact with
the phone you can navigate very smoothly
and scroll through all your screens
since you have a lot of home screens a
lot of customization options if I wanted
to go from the screen all the way to the
left the one all the way on the right
you know could take some time so as far
as navigation goes they've added a new
feature into Android 2.1 if I hold down
little dots in the bottom left or right
corner I get sort of a webOS car looking
interface that shows me to my home
screens and I can jump very quickly to
where I want to go so certainly are a
lot more navigation shortcuts that you
get with the Android operating system on
the iPhone if I want to jump back to the
home screen I can just hit the button
once and it will jump me back and I also
have a universal search functionality I
can double tap the home button if I want
to be brought into my calls I can set a
shortcut for that but that's really the
extent of it
as far as navigation here I can again
use my finger or I can also use the
built-in scroll ball which I don't find
terribly useful to be honest one of the
features that I really do want to talk
about is email and text editing that's
something that I do quite a bit so let
me show you what that looks like here
we'll go back to the note that we made
earlier now if I want to edit it so
right there it says this is a test if I
want to take out the is it's quite easy
on the iPhone I take my finger I hold it
down get that little magnifying glass
drag it where I want and I can go ahead
and do what I like of it I can delete it
I can edit it or I can copy or paste it
pretty easy let me show you how this
works on the Nexus 1 let me go back to
the messaging application if I want to
get rid of that s right there I can tap
it and try and get close but it's got a
fat finger on a little screen I can use
the scroll ball to go to where I want
but it's not quite as accurate as a that
magnifying glass and knowing exactly
where you want to go something a little
more inaccurate on the iPhone or on the
next one something that I definitely
wanted to for you to keep in mind and be
aware of as you gotta ponder your
purchase so let's talk about
applications apps are a huge deal for
the iPhone and Android and they both got
thousands and thousands of choices you
guys have probably seen the apps Taurani
I thought we show you what that looks
like there are right now well over
93,000 and leave this close to a hundred
thousand given applications right now
and the way the applications to we're
set up is pretty simple you can view by
new what's hot or genius features check
out by categories top 25 and there are a
ton of applications ranging from free to
very expensive and they certainly add a
lot of additional functionality to the
phone now when it comes to app stores
there's really nothing better than the
iPhone hi my opinion but Android Market
is a very close second offering many
many more free applications let's take a
look at Android Marketplace you can see
what that looks like you guys kind of
right there Market you've got a very
nice looking interface and you can view
this by apps games or all your downloads
let's go ahead and hit apps and you can
view it by all these different
categories and downloading is very quick
and very smooth you notice that
scrolling is really fast on the
Snapdragon processor let's take a look
at how fast applications load and launch
speaking of processor so the iPhone 3GS
certainly no speeds slouch and prior to
the Nexus One launching is probably one
of the quicker phones out there let's
take a look at how fast standard
applications open things that you might
use on a regular basis let's take a look
at calendar so go ahead and open up the
calendar functionality on each and we'll
see how quickly they both load Nexus One
loaded a little bit quicker but not much
and
bad and one thing that I would be remiss
to not discuss when I'm talking about
both platforms is multitasking Android
can handle multitasking out of the box
and look quite well the iPhone certainly
is not known for its multitasking
capabilities let's next take a look at
Matt not quickly that loads now what
take is very nicely into the map section
of our comparison we've got Google Maps
on each different icons but the same
application
go ahead bunch of both the same time so
load it up a bit quicker on the Nexus
One but not that much certainly nothing
you're going to notice but overall the
speed is a little bit faster on the
Nexus One certainly can take advantage
of multi-touch on the iPhone and as far
as zooming you have to use the plus or
minus magnifying glasses as far as
Google Maps goes you get the same
functionality right out of the box
however there's additional functionality
that's built into the Nexus One let me
show you what that looks like
you get Google Maps Navigation now get
free turn-by-turn navigation you can see
sometimes I struggle with these buttons
across the bottom that are touch
sensitive that don't always respond as
well as I would like let me go and open
on that up and right now the box
I get turn-by-turn navigation I've
demonstrated in previous videos worked
it very well it'll say left turn on
wherever you want to go and it's free on
the iPhone you have to either pay for an
application or pay for a subscription
certainly the edge clearly goes to the
Nexus One when it comes to mapping okay
so let's talk about the OS overall and
we'll sort of wrap this up there's a ton
of features we can cover but interest of
brevity we just can't go over everything
so as far as the u.s. is concerned I
think the operating system on the iPhone
is very very elegant I've been using the
iPhones of the first came out and it
will just works
certainly the functionality that you
might get out of Nexus One is not there
as far as customization and the
navigation options really limited to
just your fingers you can use the scroll
ball on the Nexus One and the Android
operating system as a whole it's this
again is going to connect your personal
preference up personally I think the
iPhone operand system has gotten a bit
stale since it first launched other than
the addition of the App Store and
additional icons that you have now it
really hasn't changed that much since
the first iPhone launched a couple years
ago so if we get really going to come
down to personal preference both these
phones offer
of fantastic features and a lot of
really great customization options and a
lot of great usability it's going to
condense with user prefers from a size
standpoint we'll go and show you these
one more times you can sort of do a
comparison there's been want to talk
about the Nexus One being thinner than
pencil I don't have a number two I do
have pretty a standard mechanical pencil
you can get a sense of thickness and
size and it definitely does cover up the
Nexus One overall I've been really
impressed with the quality of the Nexus
One and the quality of the iPhone with
feras picking which one to choose it's
going to come down to which one again
you like more if you get 3G service with
timo 118 T I recommend trying to get
your hands on the next one to play with
if customization is more important for
you the Android is going to be a great
way to go if you're looking for maybe
more apps then the iPhone is gonna be a
great way to go if you're a Mac user and
you like to keep things within sort of
the Apple walled garden and all your
photos are an iPhone or music isn't
iTunes you know it's going to be a sort
of a pretty easy decision to make
however if you're a little bit more open
and you've got mp3s in different places
and you don't use iTunes or you know
take care about iTunes this is going to
be a great way to go for the Nexus One a
lot of other things we can talk about we
may discuss them in upcoming videos
camera quality and video and video
playback and music downloads cuz both
have their own download stores but for
this version we just focused on the
browser text entry customization
scrolling navigation apps maps and
operating system hope you guys enjoyed
it I hope to shed a little bit of light
on make decision easy for you when it
comes down to which phone you want to
choose the last thing I want to mention
is pricing pricing on the iPhone 3GS
it's going to range depending on whether
you're on contract or not anywhere from
$1.99 to $5.99 and the same thing for
the next one the Ronnie was cheap as 179
or it expensive as 530 so hope you guys
enjoy them John Ranger from
