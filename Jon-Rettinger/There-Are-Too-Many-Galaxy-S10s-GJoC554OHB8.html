the galaxy s10 I love smartphones I live
and breathe on rumours leaks and finally
releases and a few times a year I get
the absolute honor and privilege to see
these smartphones before the rest of the
world does it's a great time to meet up
with old friends so I generally only get
a chance to talk to on Twitter but the
whole experience might not be as
glamorous as you'd expect one get out of
like the San Francisco super early to
catch an uber and figure out where we
needed to go three grab lunch before our
meetings for climbs the top of what
seems like mount San Francisco
I don't probably fooled you if I'm not
in the best shape
five catch another uber because that was
a horrible idea
six hang out with some friends and
finally get a chance to hold the Galaxy
S ten line of phones there's a bunch of
videos that are out talking about the
specs and what the phone serve looks
like but I don't think you're gonna see
if someone showing you the very first
reactions to the s10 line of phones I
just got out of about a 20 minute brief
of the phones but I have not yet held
one in my hand or actually seen one up
close so for the very first time I'm
gonna share with you my reaction to the
s10 line of phones got a very lovely
hand model alright so you've got three
of them I'm gonna start with the Big
Daddy I'm gonna start with the plus this
probably do the one I'm gonna order so
the cutouts different so looking at the
all the notifications kind of get moved
those wondering how Samsung was actually
gonna handle the notifications link just
kind of get moved out so what the plus
you've got the two camera cutout they're
calling it infinity oh this boy I mean
Samsung does the best displays to the
business that's like a matter of fact at
this point this one looks really good
the phone feels lighter than you'd
expect
planets heavy in the past so I've got
three different versions of the Galaxy S
ten line a phone so you've got the s 10
the s 10 a and the S 10 plus there's
also the Galaxy S 10 5g and you combine
the phone's storage options and the RAM
options and then the colours we've got
over 30 different variants of the Galaxy
S hiya 10 line of phones there's a lot
of phones to pick to find the right one
for you but I think what most excited to
try aside from sort of seeing the whole
punch cut out is you ultrasonic
fingerprint sensor so it's built right
into this play I'm gonna set it up and
try it so this is supposedly also sort
of looking like like three-dimensional
scan of your fingerprint to not like a
2d thing so a little more secure see an
icon and shows up where you put your
thumb you just smack them on it so it
doesn't look pretty fast and I think you
can do it too without the screen and lit
up if you can sort of get muscle memory
where you supposed to go so it's pretty
quick and it worked fast it seemed as
fast as like any of
a fingerprint sensor I've use whether
it's built into the screen or not so
three cameras on the back here so it's
kind of interesting is that you'd only
have to pick the lens you just kind of
zoom and crop and it automatically will
pick the right sensor for you but there
are three of them you got an ultra wide
to give you 123 field of view haven't
seen 123 looks like it is insane I mean
you can see like everything imagine sit
around a family table you can get
everybody in not having to tell people
to shuffle around I've got a regular
wide-angle which is your default that's
got a 77 degree field of view then
you've got a zoom which is 45 degree
field of view so that sensor though did
not make its way to the third phone is a
galaxy s 10 e most of the other specs
are the same like I said there's a
billion different variants you can get
an S 10 plus with a terabyte of storage
and 12 gigs of ram and the higher
gigabytes storage for the 512 or one
terabyte will come and surround the
colors you could pick if you want white
or black ceramic and you also have
limine go pink you've got the canary
yellow which is not coming to the US you
also have a prison green which is not
coming to the US code and cos you've got
flamingo pink prison black prison white
prison blue you add that to the two
ceramic colors and different stories
ratings you've got you've got a lot of
phones she guesses a nice you can sort
of pick the phone that you want at the
price point that you want so while there
might be just an obscene amount of
choice at least you've got that choice
to pick the phone that's right for you
just a Sanford WREG Nate 55 I'm not sure
how much RAM this variant that they gave
up has but the phone feels really quick
one of the things that it's gonna do
it's gonna sort of learn your routine so
if you always open up the weather after
the more and you'll start to cube that
up for you
so it'll you know know that that's what
you want open I'll start the load thing
is really fast but kind of learn your
routines but the hole punch looks good
and makes the knotch
kinda look old and busted on here
Samsung did a really nice job with this
phone so again this is my very first
time picking
the phone yours turns being walked
through my thought process it's a lot of
stuff to like here and a lot of things
you'd expect from Samsung ip68 Riggin
headphone jack is still here quick
charge 2.0 to charge it wirelessly
pretty damn fast Samsung pay and the
rest of the kind of the same some things
that have become staples Knox and and
the rest of it are all here we're gonna
be doing a full review I'm gonna go do a
full dive we'll go through all the specs
but first impressions are really really
good with the s10 line of phones that
with the bajillion and variants you know
you can probably find one that's right
first or what you want and your budget
so again 40 of you coming first
impressions are pretty good you get
probably jumped me if I put this in my
pocket but hopefully I'll do one of my
pockets enough so that was the s10 but
our day was far from over
we still had to get home seven finished
filming and catch yet another uber eight
arrive at the airport way too early
9 finally board our plane home so that's
what it's like to check out a flagship
phone before the rest of the world
it's totally rushed it isn't glamorous
as it seems on the other side of the
camera it's tiring it's stressful but I
wouldn't trade the experience for
anything in the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
