from TechnoBuffalo here I know there are
a lot of you that are considering
upgrading your first generation iPad the
second generation model and I also know
there are a good chunk you that are
considering cashing in on the hundred
dollar cheaper price of the first
generation model so I want to help
clarify whether or not it's going to be
worth your hard-earned money to upgrade
or whether or not you're better sticking
with or purchasing the first generation
so let's go ahead and put these two
head-to-head so let's run through some
of the most salient specs of these two
tablets the screens on both are exactly
the same diagonal 9.7 inch with a
resolution of 1024 by 768 and 132 PPI
which stands for pixels per inch the
first generation is running Apple's a4
system-on-a-chip processor that's a
single core clocked in at 1 gigahertz
the app iPad 2 is running the updated a5
chip it's a dual core processor clocking
in each core at 1 gigahertz so you're
potentially going to get double the
processing speed from a ram standpoint
the first generation iPad and we only
know this because of iFixit staredown
has 256 megabytes of RAM compared to the
iPad 2 512 cameras we don't have them on
the first gen we've got two on the iPad
2 we've got a VGA camera up top and on
the back we've got an unknown resolution
that takes 720p video and take still
image if you're curious the video
quality is there'll be a link down below
I did a full video of showing the
quality of the video capture on the iPad
2 from a color standpoint iPad 1 only
comes in black iPad 2 you can get in
black or white of course this is the
white version and you can get ipad 2 on
the 3G models either on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T
if you want to go 3G at the first
generation you are limited to just AT&amp;amp;T
so it's got an extra core it's got a
double Ram but how does that translate
to a user experience the iPad 2 is
definitely faster but how much faster is
going to be let's go ahead and run some
speed tests let's go ahead and close
everything that's open and I know that
it doesn't matter all that much when it
comes to the Apple products leaving
stuff open in the background but I want
to make sure that we have everything
closed we're gonna run a browser speed
test these are running on Wi-Fi on the
same Wi-Fi networks generally I don't
clear the cache before I do these video
compares since I like to show what it's
going to look like for a website you
visit regularly however I'm going to
make the exception here I'm going to go
in I'm going to clear the cache so I'll
go ahead and clear cache clear it there
and we'll do the same thing on the first
generation iPad you know I never thought
the first generation iPad was slow you
definitely notice the speed difference
on the iPad 2 but let's see how much of
difference that's going to be alright so
cache has been cleared let's go ahead
and load up TechnoBuffalo on each
alright so let's go ahead and queue that
up got it ready to go there let's do the
same thing on the first generation let's
go ahead and push them at the same time
or at least attempt to alright and they
are often again connected to the same
Wi-Fi network of course iPad one on the
Left iPad 2 on the right
iPad 2 is almost loaded the entire web
site iPad 1 is still loading iPad 2 is
done iPad 1 is about halfway we haven't
even seen the content show up yet I
should mention this is a pretty fast
Wi-Fi network speeds range anywhere from
30 to 40 megabits per second so now
we're starting to see some content it's
queued up almost done still loading so
clearly what we're seeing at least with
TechnoBuffalo is the iPad 2 handles it
much much faster however is that
representative of other sites or is it
just maybe TechnoBuffalo is more
optimized for the iPad 2 or has more
pictures and
intensive takes better advantage of what
the iPad 2 has to offer
I've got one here still loading so let's
just suffice it to say that the iPad 2
is significantly quicker at least in
this test for loading the site let's go
ahead and load the YouTube channel so
I'll be to calm
/john 4 Lakers and let's see if there's
any sort of speed difference here and
this is still loading and now it is done
so let's go ahead and try and get both
of these to load at the same time and
see if there's any sort of speed
difference all right so those are both
set at the same time to load and use
just representative tests with neither a
ton of other websites we could run try
this one looks it a little bit quicker I
pet to finish just a hair before I let's
see how scrolling works
we've looks pretty smooth pinch-to-zoom
pretty smooth on each not that giant a
difference I will say in browsing tests
that TechnoBuffalo test was a bit on the
unique side the iPad 2 is definitely
quicker it's not a giant amount quicker
when loading web sites especially on the
same Wi-Fi network but it's definitely a
little bit faster so let's go ahead and
try a YouTube video so go ahead and
close both of these and we'll open the
YouTube player how quickly is it open
and how quickly does the video come up
so let's go ahead and open these and
we'll do some app test 2 in just a
minute as well all right so let's go
ahead and go to my videos and this is
playing some here playing some here I
was watching a car review let's go ahead
and go to my videos and my videos and
we'll play the same one so here is the
photobooth video for the iPad 2 that I
did actually let's do the red white and
blue iPhone unboxing that was kind of
fun to go ahead and hit them both at the
same time iPad 2 again just a little bit
quicker
and I was pairing myself in stereo um
but again iPad 2 being just a little bit
quicker and that's going to be a theme
that we're going to see as we continue
to go through everything here alright
let's go ahead and close out of this and
again since we sort of closed everything
we should have exactly the same
applications open the background
settings browser and YouTube so let's
try some of the same applications that
obviously met for each let's start with
Angry Birds one of my favorite games so
go ahead and move on over Angry Birds
here Angry Birds there Angry Birds
everywhere let's go ahead and try and
open these at the same time which is
really sometimes harder than it you
think it would be let's see if there's
any sort of speed difference so we
definitely saw it load up there on the
iPad to faster now we're seeing the
screen so again a little bit faster now
we're ready to play on the iPad - almost
ready to play on the iPad one this was
definitely a significant difference
that's probably a direct result of the
faster processor and increased RAM
alright let's go ahead and close this
and close this again and to keep
everything fair I'm going to go ahead
and close all the applications here that
are running the background as well just
to make sure that everything is
optimized I know it's sort of
application switching and this isn't
necessary but I do want to keep things
as fair as possible
all right next let's open up a very
intensive game or open up Infinity Blade
now the iPad 2 is a potential to have 9
times the graphic prowess of the first
generation Infinity Blade is one of the
more intensive games out there so let's
see if we notice any difference in speed
and graphics quality I will say that the
screens here are exactly the same so if
they look one looks brighter not
brighter we should have had the
brightness set it exactly the same so
you shouldn't notice any screen
difference you can see the brightness
there is almost identical all right
let's go ahead and open up Infinity
Blade and this is a pretty intensive
game again I actually haven't played
this one as much as I'd like so Unreal
Engine you see it kicks up much faster
again on the iPad 2 Epic Games games
it's like almost watching things in a
slower mirror here on the iPad 1 alright
stand playing looks like now we are just
about ready to play content pack 2
coming soon that's great to go ahead and
skip out of this hit play here we should
have the same message pop up and it did
indeed so you're looking at this a bit
sideways hopefully you can still see the
content and go ahead and see what I can
push them like this and you can see the
graph
Fix performance of both move around and
look at exactly the same thing there
they both look pretty good I'm not
really noticing that much graphics
difference on the iPad 2 versus the iPad
1 all rights go ahead and close out of
these and certainly we could get a
little bit more granular but interests
of time what's do they both look decent
the iPad 2 definitely has more potential
and the potential is really the big
differentiating factor here so right now
almost the applications that were built
were built with the iPad one in mind and
the iPad ones power in mind applications
moving forward or probably be shifted to
the iPad twos power it's potentially
double the CPU and potentially nine
times better graphics so while you might
not see a big difference now between the
iPad 1 and the iPad 2 and performance
comes into play in games I carefully are
going to see that moving forward so that
being said is the iPad 2 worthwhile to
upgrade over your iPad 1 and for me and
for my money the resounding answer is no
I don't see much of a compelling reason
to upgrade from the iPad 2 to the iPad 1
it's certainly you're going to get a
little bit faster speed you're going to
get a little bit better graphics
performance but the iPad 1 is still
extremely capable device I think you're
going to be better off saving your money
unless you have to have the latest
generation product or you can sell it
for a good deal I think you're going to
be better off hanging on to the iPad 1
and if you're looking for a bargain you
might want to pick up an iPad 1 for $100
off come in all the same configurations
as the iPad 2 if you've been waiting to
pick up an iPad and the $100 doesn't
matter that much to you certainly go for
the iPad 2 the increased speed and
performance is going to be nice to have
it's 33% thinner which is definitely a
nice thing it feels a little bit lighter
in the hand you're going to get the same
sort of 10-hour battery life you can see
the two of those side-by-side I one last
thing to mention and you compare these
to the iPad 2 doesn't have what I call
the iPad wiggle when you push it on a
desk and you push on the corners it
stays flat die pad one that's a little
bit of that wiggle the iPad one is still
extremely
capable device and is you know according
to most people head and shoulders above
the closest competition at least right
now so you're going to get a device
that's going to be capable for the next
year or so again if you're looking to
sort of dive into the tablet world the
iPad 2 might be your best bet but it's
not the most compelling of upgrades
anyway guys I want to hear from you you
have to say whether or not you think the
iPad 2 is worth the upgrade whether or
not the color alone is worth it getting
it on Verizon or the thinness definitely
want to hear you guys have to say did
you see any big difference in speed that
would make a difference for you leave
