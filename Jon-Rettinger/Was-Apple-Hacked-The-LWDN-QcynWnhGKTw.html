am Robert Rosenfeld um this is the show
that breaks down the top three stories
the tech world 3 every Tuesday and every
Thursday today we're going to break down
the report claiming that China has
infiltrated top tech companies here in
the US also a new Nintendo switch may be
on the horizon for next year and the
pixel 3 has leaked again here's the
lowdown
a new report claims that Chinese
microchips were secretly installed on
motherboards used in servers by Apple
Amazon and other big tech giants the
report from blue Merc emerged this
morning and is throwing up a bit of
controversy after Apple and Amazon are
flat-out denying the allegations in the
report and that report alleges that
Chinese officials forced Chinese
manufacturers to install super small
chips on super micro motherboards
specifically delegated for US tech
companies mainly in data centers and
both Apple and Amazon discovered these
chips in an internal investigation and
reported it to the FBI it's being
reported that these chips were capable
of siphoning off data and letting in new
unauthorized code but both tech giants
are flat-out refusing these claims that
are standing strong by their statements
Amazon says the report is simply untrue
and Apple is taking an even stronger
stand saying in part quote on this we
can be very clear Apple has never found
malicious chips Hardware manipulations
or vulnerabilities purposely planted in
any server this story is a big one and
is still developing and some things are
a little bit unclear so we'll bring you
any developments or any updates over at
TechnoBuffalo com I know Nintendo switch
is rumoured to be in the works but don't
get your hopes up for any big
game-changing features coming to the
next version of the switch we're hearing
some reports that the new switch will
arrive sometime next year and though
details are currently a little sparse
we're hearing that it will not
unfortunately
adopt an OLED display because of cost
refuting those earlier rumours we heard
that we'd see a similar OLED panel on
the new switch as used in phones like
the iPhone 10 the console Hybrid has
been a pretty big success for Nintendo
and it looks like they want to keep that
momentum pop with a bit of an update to
that console though we don't really know
at this point exactly what those updates
are going to be and it looks like
they're still being decided on
internally will most likely see some new
internals maybe some small design tweaks
but I wouldn't get excited for anything
too big but I actually think this would
be a great question for you guys to
discuss down below in the comments what
would you want to see on the next
generation in tennis which something
changed with the design internals maybe
a higher-end display leave that comment
down below and let us know if you leave
a comment you could be featured in the
next episode
and more less than a week away at this
point where does days away from the
launch of the pixel 3 in the pixel 3
Excel and just when we thought the leaks
were finally over they're not we've got
some images of the alleged pixel 3 in a
pink color joining the lineup and
launching next week and we've covered
the leaks of both phones here
extensively on the lowdown so if you
want to see the full details on what
we're expecting this phone you can watch
our deep dive video on that but we can
of course expect the knotch and a not
just pixel 3 &amp;amp; 3 XL to launch next week
with wireless charging and improve
camera super selfies and a whole lot
more we'll have full coverage of
Google's Hardware event next Tuesday so
be sure to stay tuned to the channel for
that and if you haven't already now it'd
be a really good time to hit that
subscribe button so you subscribe to the
channel and hit that Bell so you're
notified about upcoming video so you
automatically get the videos when
they're published for you and on the
last episode of the lowdown Shawn McHugh
asked the question we seemingly get
every single day what is the soundtrack
you use for the lowdown reminds me of
stranger things on Netflix yes this
soundtrack does sound really good and a
finally answered this question the track
is called expanding by this artists
which I'm not going to say because I
would butcher the name
it's from our epidemic sound music
library but if you want to find it on
YouTube you can find a copy of it
floating around for your listening
pleasure alright guys that's all I've
got for the lid on today thank you as
always so much for watching I'll be back
here on Tuesday to talk more tech news
and I'll have all the details only
finally unveiled - pixel 3 + 3 XL so
stay tuned for that until then have a
great day and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
