TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing a
teeny-tiny little guy this is the
Samsung Galaxy s4 his little brother the
appropriately named the Galaxy s4 mini
about the decent amount of punch in its
moderately priced package go ahead take
a look first let me thank our friends at
nebula hooking us up with this phone be
sure to check them out add to Negri
electronic comm so here is the samsung
galaxy s4 mini and oddly has very
similar specs say for the screen size
and resolution - it's gigantic brother
the galaxy mega let's go ahead and use
our a buffalo knife to cut this open and
it literally has a buffalo and I was
just being cute we'll go ahead and open
this up and I'll run through the specs
and tell you what this guy has I would
not expect this to ever come to us
Shores at least the galaxy s3 mini never
did so if you want to pickle these guys
up your best bet is going to be unlocked
probably through our friends that Negri
I'm just go ahead and pull off the
plastic we've got a 8 gigabyte version
right here it's like there's one last
little seal that needs to be cut and
will be all good this guy has a 4.3 inch
screen with a very low resolution of 960
by 540 giving it a not so awesome PPI of
256 which is about half of what we see
on most sort of higher-end smartphones
but get this out if we can boom so there
it is a screen is qHD and it's an AMOLED
display look so tiny compared to all the
other phones we use and it's funny we
consider tiny now 4.3 inches used to be
giant and we go back and look at the HTC
Titan or was originally Evo phones that
seemed really large and now seem really
miniscule just goes to show what a few
years can do for you so push it off to
the side for just a quick second and see
what else we got in the box a Quick
Start Guide for getting started quickly
I know something I'd like to know what
the model number is so it's the GT one
nine one nine five we've got a charging
cable and white it's kinda nice don't
see what cables all that often we've got
it looks like an adapter
or the power cables so depending on what
country you live in
you could have the right adapter we've
got ear buds
we've got headphones with a noise
cancelling mic and volume control on it
and we've got the battery which is a
1900 milliamp hour ferrule pull it out
get that ready to be put into the phone
so this looks very similar to the Galaxy
s4 as you'd expect to the phone that's
called the galaxy s4 mini will peel all
this stuff off here for just a second
and to show you let's bring in the
galaxy s4 and you can see they look like
big brother little brother 5-inch screen
obviously versus the 4.3 inch very
similar design languages on each so
let's walk through what we got we got
one big home button it's definitely
raised more than the s4 so really easy
to feel it's flanked by two capacitive
buttons back in the Menu button volume
rocker up and down the left hand side
you got some metal esque accents and
it's still plastic but doesn't a nice
feel to it your power and lock button
charging and sync noise cancelling mic
3.5 millimeter headset jack some more
noise cancelling mic it looks like you
also have the IR blaster let's go ahead
and pull off the back we'll pop in the
battery I'll run through the rest of
specs while this guy is booting up it
does take micro SD card or sim I believe
there are two versions available one
that supports LTE and a dual SIM model
which only has a port for HSPA+ we have
the LTE model here I'll see you guys I
can decide which one you want so I'll
power this guy on and while it's doing
its thing I'll walk you through the rest
of the specs something powered by a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core processor Android
4.2.2 I launched 1.5 gigs of RAM eight
gigs of storage but again you can add it
to that with a external card the main
camera on the back is a megapixel I just
think it was sort of uncommon to have a
1.9 megapixel shooter up front but same
time to doing that on a lot of phones
sim camera again that we saw in the mega
802 11 a B G and n we don't have
anything here for AC bluetooth 4.0 that
1900 milliamp hour battery that we
talked about it does have NFC which is
kind of nice so
dimension standpoint it's a hundred and
twenty 4.6 meters or 4.91 inches by
sixty one point three millimeters not
meters rather millimeters two point one
four inches eight point nine four
millimeters or 0.35 inches in a weighs
one hundred and seven grams or three
point seven seven ounces depending on
where you live we'll skip through this
year you know again it really shows how
far technology has come just Horta it's
been over a year here the screen
resolution would've looked fine about a
year ago but now it definitely looks a
little bit pixelated the mo of
Screenland does make it look nice the
colors definitely pop but definitely not
one of the more high-res screens we've
seen recently we should be right in to
the operating system so we got some of
the s4 features here SPM voice control
easy mode and adapt this point go ahead
and finish one things I want to see
obviously is I want to see if it's got
some of the touch features I mean you
can hover over and that kind of stuff
air view and the rest but it looks very
s4 ask dual-core processor is plenty of
power for most folks so shouldn't have
any issues at all
processor speed and gigan half a ram she
could be plenty just go ahead and jump
in see what kind of apps are gonna be
stored here this isn't a carrier phone
no real sort of carrier bloatware but
certainly Samsung's got a lot of Samsung
proprietary stuff and it's Samsung's app
Samsung hub watch on their video a music
store I can see would else we got here s
translator which is really cool
the seldom-used s voice story album I do
love Samsung's deal with Dropbox so a
hundred gigs free storage is pretty
freakin sweet actually
let's go into settings well scroll go to
my device scroll down to the bottom
motions and gestures smart screen and
see we got here so palm control control
your device with touching the screen
with your hand and motion so that is
here let's see what we've got under
smart screen so screen sits on as long
as you're looking at it so that's kind
of neat
if we go to connection the state else we
got here NFC SP nearby devices and
screen mirroring of course access for
keys as well driving mode through the
rest that stuff you would expect
again just for again for comparison's
let's bring it in to a galaxy s4 it
could see difference between these two
guys
scan screens the lower resolution but
for most people it's not going to eat
that big a deal it looks a little bit
low res as he'd expect but very
serviceable it's certainly easy enough
to use looking for a lower-cost phone
you want to get one unlock you won't be
stuck on a two-year contract now you
sort of want some of the Samsung look
and feel this might be a very good
choice for you please give the video a
thumbs up with us definitely appreciate
it
check out our friends at Negri
electronics comm I'm John renter from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
