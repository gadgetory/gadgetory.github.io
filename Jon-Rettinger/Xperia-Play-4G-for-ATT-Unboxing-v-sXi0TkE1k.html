TechnoBuffalo here at that unboxing for
you of one of the latest Android
smartphones and 18 T's lineup this is
the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play that I've
got blocking my face right now this guy
brings a lot of fun stuff to the table
let's go ahead get her unboxed alright
so here is the box of the Xperia Play
you got a picture of the device on the
front letting you know that it's 4G
that's HSPA+ variety this is playstation
certified so you've got all the
playstation controller business going on
here on the front we saw this guy first
launched on Verizon now we've got a TTT
so it should be a very familiar package
on the back you get some more info and
what it can do for G gaming phone dual
cameras it's Android four inch
touchscreen
alright great let's go ahead and rip it
open out of the box we'll run through
all the specs and I like goodness you
know how it works here alright take it
out he's got some Quick Start Guide do
you guys read these kind of like to here
we have to say but I don't so push that
off here is the phone then slide that
out of the box xp really pushed it off
for just a moment see what else we're
gonna have in the box there's a lot of
business here in this box uh it's very
busy alright so from a battery
standpoint I believe we are looking at a
1500 milliamp hour battery and we are
indeed looking at a 1500 milli amp hour
battery 5.4 watt hours so we've got that
pushed it off that off to the side
there's the wall charger pretty standard
rectangle the USB cord and of course
it's going to charge micro USB we've got
a decent looking pair of headphones here
actually you know sony is known for
making a nice headphone so there's gonna
be included with some ear gels for your
listening comfort we also have a
charging cable so
there is that and then we also have a
3.5 3.5 extension cable you also like
use that sometimes for data so perhaps
to make the microphones a little bit
larger take a look at the adapter here
in just a minute we'll see if maybe
these two things go together we'll take
a look at that at the end because that's
not overly exciting and then we've got
something usually I can predict it's
gonna be in the boxes but this Xperia
Play is kind of throw me further these
looks like we've got hung out there
including a dock just kind of nice so a
3.5 Jack protruding right there microUSB
charging port and then you've got your
power in and out and audio so you can
plug in all kinds of neat different
stuff to this it's kind of cool to
include that alright
great great great let's take a look at
the phone itself here we have the Xperia
Play texting and driving it can wait
that is a true statement I'll go ahead
and rip this off that whooshing noise
you get down to microphone that's always
fun is any on the back because any on
the back I get yelled at in the comments
and I do read the comments so boom so
this guy's all gussied up in blue
slide it up there's where all that
PlayStation certified business comes
into play you've got a four-way
navigation pad here touch sensitive
controls which always makes me feel
dirty when I use them but they do work
very well and then your PlayStation
buttons triangle circle X and square I
do know my shapes
we've got your Android buttons here
there's your menu option I mean you've
got to start and select but that's not
the only buttons this guy's got it also
has shoulder buttons so when you're
gaming go ahead and do those shoulder
buttons this is not really spring-loaded
sorry I got a push up and then it'll
kind of like go on and so if you
definitely gotta give it a bit of a push
to get it to go on the left hand side of
device there's your 3.5 milimeter
headset jack there's your micro USB
charging port on the bottom there's some
microphone action on the left hand side
got those shoulder buttons that we just
talked about and a volume rocker kind of
hidden there in the middle on the top in
the upper right hand corner which is I
write like it the most
is the power and the lock button
front-facing camera on the front
obviously which is a VGA on the back is
a 5 megapixel camera LED flash 8 times
digital zoom and autofocus so how to
focus in and out depending on what
you're doing I've got of course your
Android buttons here which aren't the
normal Sony buttons that we see on a lot
of their phones the Xperia Arc for
example these are normal Android looking
all four of them then a bit of a
different order though you've got the
back button on the left home menu and
then we've got search there as well
which is kind of interesting that they
did it like that alright so let's go
ahead and pop in the battery and see
what this guy is got going on it will
power it on here battery pops off
plastic piece I assume is what's gonna
get that battery animus housing oh you
never know sometimes you get big battery
door fails trying to open these things
up
I've open so many phones it never gets
easier they all do something different
so let's see I suppose if I read the
instructions that would be helpful but
you know I don't really do that alright
I have to cut back here after getting
this open
alright so that was probably one of the
more difficult back to get off but we do
have that offs we go ahead and pop in a
better here go ahead and that on in in
order to hear the jokes in the comments
I'll power it on this is not for the
faint of heart kind of get the back of
this phone off so one of the best things
about the Xperia Play for me it's a fine
phone at least I expect it to be a fine
phone it was fine on Verizon isn't this
keypad is awesome for game emulators so
assuming you own the original consoles
and original games those usual caveats
apply playing Super Nintendo Nintendo
games on here is pretty awesome let's go
ahead see if this has any juice after
that hassle of trying to get the backup
I hope it's gonna have enough power and
while it is booting up fingers crossed I
can run you through some specs and yeh
it is booting up alright so weighs 6.2
ounces so not heavy not light it's got a
little bit of heft if you can see there
it's got a nice amount of junk in the
trunk but not enough that you're gonna
like turn your head twice and be like
wow that phone needs to go on a diet or
that phone should stop wearing spandex
if you saw this phone on the beach and a
two-piece you probably wouldn't think
anything about it so it's running
Android 2.3 micro SD card 30 2 gigs
pretty standard I would take the back
off here we can see if it came with one
but I'm not even gonna try that again
five megapixel camera we talked about
its being powered by a one gigahertz
single court Snapdragon processor so it
should have a decent amount of juice not
a notic juice but power to let it do it
needs to do VGA front-facing camera
slide-out game pad and 512 megabytes of
RAM you can see a little bit of that
sort of media escape finish interface
they have here let's let it do its load
up and boot up Fang please insert your
SIM card reset your phone I don't have
some credit in there so I'm not going to
restart my phone we can see some of what
the custom interface to have here is
it's a bit unique if you go ahead and do
that you can see all the widgets that
you have selected you can move them
around it's nice it's not my favorite
it's relatively heavy I do like the
dialer though they put on here so keep
that in mind under applications let's go
ahead and see it we've got we should
have all the PlayStation
store stuff here Crash Bandicoot is one
of their highlighted games you scroll
from left to right on this one
Madden 11 live wire manager and there's
play games so I do a full review I'll
walk you guys through this but
definitely if you're looking to get a
phone that you want to play some games
on this is a great phone to pick up just
for an emulator even if you have another
phone that you want to use and you just
want to use this for say playing games
an Xperia Play scum with me on many of
plane trips because I got to get my
Mario on so you know take that with a
grain of salt or ever you want that to
mean so guys I'm John Breton your
TechnoBuffalo this has been a first look
at the Xperia Play 4G for those guys 18t
anything you want to see covered in the
review go ahead and leave them in the
comments down below and I'll see you in
the next video bye so I did by the way
want to mention I was talking about
these headphones earlier there's
microphone built in and it's pretty
standard stuff can't your calls right
there that little cable is not for the
microphone but this little cable is for
actually goes with the dock so you can
plug it in the back here I can plug this
into a set of speakers and you can get
yo music on so that's what's that's for
case you're wondering I was super
curious but there's the dock as well now
I'm not lying I really will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
