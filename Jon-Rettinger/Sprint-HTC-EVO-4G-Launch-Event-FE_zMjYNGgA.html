they know I like that Zeppelin by the
way if you want to see a great
documentary it might great look if it
might get loud is out strongly
recommended by the way it's great to be
here it's great to be here in New York
good evening and welcome Disney is
getting ready to release the highly
anticipated summer blockbuster of prince
of persia and sprint is getting ready to
release the highly anticipated HTC evo
4g America's first 3g 4g android handset
tonight you're going to get a sneak pink
of both when you think it isn't you
think of magic you don't just watch a
Disney movie you experience likewise for
gene needs to be experienced and the evo
4g brings for jay to life for gene could
ultimately change the way entertainment
is consumed Sprint is leading this
transformation with the launch of the
evo 4g which runs on the nation's most
dependable 3g network but there's more
we are also the first national carrier
launching a nationwide 4G wireless
network currently available in 32
markets with more markets launching
later this year 4G will mean a faster
browsing experience by definition
quality video without pixelization true
multiplayer gaming and live video
streaming without waiting and speeds can
rival your office or home cable and
since it's wireless you can stay
connected to your favorite entertainment
content whether at home at work or on
the go the HTC evo 4g will arguably be
the best 3g device on the market it
comes packed with camcorder like video
capture and HD quality playback so did
your camcorder it has an 8 megapixel cam
this your digital camera too it features
a large 4.3 inch screen if I can keep it
on here I have this energy saving
feature on here which is great for
watching movies or TV it even comes with
a kickstand so you can watch hands-free
I'm also excited to announce that the
HTC evo 4g will be the first device that
can power video chat on either a 3g or
4g network that's a big deal this means
you can have a conversation while
sharing real-time video between mobile
devices the device comes equipped with
the one gigahertz Snapdragon processor
that makes websites including flash
applications appear in a snap the evo 4g
has the latest operating system
available from goo from google android
two dot one that includes more than
35,000 apps now if you're asking when
can I get one it will be available on
june fourth about three weeks from now
and on top of that how does 199 sound
amazing value considering everything
we've packed into this device when you
compare our monthly service plans with
the alternatives our value looks better
still the evo 4g can even do
simultaneous voice and data in forging
markets so you can talk while serving
imagine yeah
so imagine these industry-leading
capabilities in the hands of small or
large businesses as workforce has become
more mobile employees need the speed and
capacity to enable high bandwidth
applications like viewers or sending
power points which by the way I hate so
don't send them to me real-time video
video conferencing or video monitoring
of off-site locations even though we
haven't launched 4g in new york yet we
brought Sprint's 4G network here tonight
so you can fully appreciate a
demonstration of the evo 4G it's now my
great pleasure to introduce Chris Conley
senior vice president of product
management for Disney Chris knows
firsthand what cutting-edge technology
can bring to the entertainment industry
he's a big believer in how 4G will
expand access to entertainment content
so let's give it up a Chris
Thanks been really excited to be here
this evening on behalf of the Walt
Disney Studios celebrate our tremendous
promotional partnership with sprint you
know there was once a Kansas City native
named Walt Disney who once was quoted as
saying we keep moving forward opening
new doors and doing new things because
we're curious and our curiosity keeps
leading us down these new paths and what
an exciting new path we're headed down
this evening we've got new cutting edge
technology from sprint combined with
consumers curiosity for new experiences
this is literally changing the world of
how entertainment content is being
consumed today think of some of the
other dramatic change is entertainment
delivery taking place around us I mean
my goodness the 3d movies the whole
landscape has changed since this last
holiday holiday season and the Hollywood
studios and the exhibitors are rapidly
rethinking the ways in which they will
be delivering films of the future and
thanks to these 3d technological
advances consumers can now experience
the world of disney's alice in
wonderland and feel it come to life and
waste CS lewis might not even imagine
and in the home about half of american
households now on a high desh
high-definition TV and enjoy watching
their sports and receiving their
entertainment content with beautiful
pristine HD clarity it seems hard to
believe that we used to view these same
major sporting events in standard
definition our way back in the dinosaur
ages in 2008 it's remarkable how fast
things have changed and the blu-ray
technology that Disney's help champion
is now growing at an exponential clip as
consumers look to harness the full power
of these HD TVs and importantly blu-ray
will next help us bring that wonderful
3d cinema experience into the homes as
well from a technology standpoint down
the road given this rapidly evolving
entertainment landscape my role within
Disney's
lead our studio efforts in determining
how will deliver Disney content to
consumers in a high quality manner on
their terms in the future what they want
when they want it where they'll want it
and importantly how they want their
entertainment content delivered going
forward and the new HTC evo 4g is a
great example my mind of delivering
entertainment content on the consumers
terms as they'll now be able to
experience the future of live video
streaming at lightning fast 4g sprint
speed whatever and wherever they want it
and that's why we have disney are so
excited about this partnership with
sprint is it allows to industry leaders
to come together to share breakthrough
technology imagination and innovation
thus creating a wonderful mobile
multimedia experience as america's first
4g phone the evo 4g enables users to
download music pictures files or videos
and seconds not minutes and it's Dan
alluded to you can watch streaming video
on the go with network speeds that are
up to 10 times faster than the 3g speeds
we're all accustomed to here in the room
tonight I had a chance to demo the new
phone this week in New York and it
really does come packed with everything
you saw the screened and reference that
4.3 inch screen wonderful great way to
experience Disney content fits great in
the palm of your hand that cool 8
megapixel camera would be a big hit with
two teenage consumers in my household at
home and I personally like the HD
capable Video camcorder because I could
see using that as a parent both there's
a consumer as well as in my professional
world of Disney video a retail locations
and other business settings so for those
of you who travel lastly a lot like I do
I know we'll all certainly appreciate
its mobile hotspot capabilities and as
Dan showed you I think that kickstand is
a really neat so we can enjoy that
content on the gutter in summary this
lightning fast 4G technology that sprint
is pioneer looks to be pointing us all
down a new path for the future and will
enable our Disney films that feel larger
than life all right in the
the consumers hands and give it our
Studios highly successful long-standing
relationship with the extraordinary
Hollywood filmmaker Jerry Bruckheimer
we're very proud to be partnering with
sprint to help bring to life Jerry
Bruckheimer and Disney's big summer 2010
blockbuster that you're going to preview
this evening prince of persia and
importantly no one in Hollywood I mean
no one today is more capable than Jerry
Bruckheimer and helping content feel
bigger than life he's helped Disney
creates such amazing action-packed films
as all three Pirates of the Caribbean
films both national treasure franchises
Conair gone in 60 seconds one of my
all-time favorites Remember the Titans
Armageddon Pearl Harbor the list goes on
and on his track record is unparalleled
and he has delivered over 10 billion
dollars in worldwide box office and
video receipts over the years just a
staggering figure and we're going to be
celebrating his remarkable success this
coming Monday evening in Hollywood in
conjunction with sprint at an event
entitled a cinematic celebration of
Jerry Bruckheimer and as good luck would
have it I've managed to commandeer a
brief clip from the trip tribute real
for money evenings benefit sets that I
could personally share it with you this
evening and let you experience some of
the success that the walt disney studios
and jerry of experience together over
the years so sit back we're going to
take a quick look at the jerry
bruckheimer real
clever one thank you and we appreciate
you spend some time with us tonight
we're going to spend a few minutes just
giving you a demonstration of some of
the capabilities that Dan and Chris
mentioned and kind of illustrate for you
what it means to have these kind of
capabilities built into a device when we
started this process of designing the
evo 4g with HTC really was from the
ground up it didn't just take an
existing 3G device and try to cram porgy
into it because that really wouldn't
have brought to life the capabilities of
this device I think you'll notice we go
through here really is kind of a
redefined rich multimedia experience
that's very unique and you won't get on
any other device that's in the market
today if you think back maybe 10 years
ago when you have a dial-up connection
at home and what the internet meant to
you is very limited you always have to
think twice about whether you're going
to click on a link you don't think about
what shopping was like 10 years ago on
dial-up you know trying to pick out a
different color of a shirt was a
dramatic experience click on everybody
wait you waiting like all right losers
going to find out of time to wait for
red now the broadband the Internet is a
completely different experience and now
as a lot of multimedia the the entire
evolution of the Internet has changed
because of the speed that came of
broadband we think that exact same thing
is going to happen with the HTC evo 4g
it's going with a lot of things to the
mobile experience that a lot of people
never imagined before and so we're
excited to introduce to you today and as
we mentioned I think you'll see that
even on 3g or the market doesn't have 4g
available today this is truly a
genuinely unique device a lot of things
that are very special about it we're
going to give you a few illustrations so
the person i'm going to start with is a
new capability that Google's introducing
to youtube feel free so what's up yeah
so Kevin the first thing we're going to
do is
youtube high quality this will be the
first product in the market that will
have this YouTube player what high
quality is is it's really a better
experience with YouTube video YouTube is
the number one video player in the world
and has the largest content of video
services in the world but the big thing
is to really understand what YouTube
high quality is you really have to
understand what most people's
experiences are with mobile devices in
YouTube and that's typically in a
standard quality type environment so one
of the things we're going to do is I'm
going to show you a high quality feed on
the EVO 4G and it really will show the
power of the 4.3 inch screen and the 4g
network and how you can stream high
quality video via this this great
network so frado's has got a HQ in the
bottom right corner there yeah so this
is the HQ player so that tells you it's
actually in high quality mode all right
let me start up on the verizon droid
here what a state of definition so this
point will start as a networker that was
not planned there's oh we're going to
miss contest equal here but typically
the motorola droid this is playing a
video in standard quality this is what
most people on their iphones their
motorola products their Android products
are used to the biggest thing you'll
notice is that on the motorola droid the
quality of the pictures it's a lot
smaller it's block year there's not as
much color in contrast in the video and
the sound quality tends to be a little
bit
stereo light when you look at the evo 4g
the biggest thing illumise's that is a
higher quality picture it's got more
contrast more color and sound quality is
phenomenal and you know really if you
put these things by side by side you can
really tell the difference so we haven't
manufactured this this is very really
the same same feed for both devices and
that is actually yes definitely a
massive difference in quality one of the
other features that we've introduced on
this device Creed is the hdmi port on
the bottom so you can plug this device
into a flat panel high-definition TV
yeah so the great thing about the evo 4g
is that we do have this hdmi important
so what allows you to do is have this
high quality content strings your flat
panel television so what we're going to
do here is we're going to actually play
a trailer for you from another jerry
bruckheimer would be coming out later in
the year kool sorcerers apprentice so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
ahead and hit play and this is actually
that we screen from this device to all
these flat panel TVs that we have in the
room as we have the player controls on
the device and then the content is
bringing out for the agent like it you
were going to be used for good and for
sorcerer that's right now and my
apprentice on what basis
for me
everything you do is the protector not a
hero just the physics nerd theme song
let's go trans no other choice
let's do that not a sorcerer oh yes yes
so so amazing content as you can
strengthen advice to a flat panel TV and
as well to have an 8 megapixel camera
yeah so the great thing about the
cameras that you know it takes these
high quality pictures you know problem
tradition with a high resolution cameras
on mobile devices and files become very
big so when you want to share those over
the mobile network or take a lot of time
to upload to your Facebook or to your
favorite photo service site so what
we've done is using the power of the 4g
network again you can actually take
these big 8 megapixel pictures and send
them to your friends and share the
quality of those pictures
instantaneously the other great thing is
that because it does have this forward
facing 8 megapixel camera it also has
the ability to record high definition
720p content so that you can now create
your own videos whether you're here in
New York or at home and then actually
share those via the hdmi port out to
your flat panel television your friend's
phone yeah so really does allow you to
take your entire multimedia experience
with you so as a matter of your hotel if
you're at the airport of your grandma's
house if you're driving in the car or
just want to hand the device back some
kids to watch content you can create it
or you can take it with you anywhere you
are and we've also will have available
to launch the accessory with a docking
station so if you want to have a
permanent connection to your TV to
playback content you can just dock the
evo 4g and it will charge it and allow
you to playback contents that you can do
it with the dock or you do with the
cable either way should work fine one of
the other exciting announcements that we
made today that the potato crisps
mention was the
they do simultaneous voice and data now
while this has been done before on
several other devices this is the first
time where you can truly have a real
voice experience with a mobile broadband
experience and you have all of that rich
content coming at you while you're still
making voice calls so it really is
different than anything else it's
available today so three let's see if we
can get something working with this I
will take his voice and data and so I'm
going to try to show you guys is I'm
going to make a phone call to my friend
Ryan who lives here in New York say so
i'm going to go ahead and down the phone
and now there's right so this is just a
hero and so we've just hook this up so
you can hear the call
haha hey ryan its freedom Kevin how are
you and god you're here hey you know I
know this kind of awkward we're in the
middle of this event but I'm you want to
meet up for dinner later really you know
what we don't know New York that well
but I'll tell you what why don't we well
you know what we've got this book here
it's got a picture of a building we
don't know really what this picture is
what i use my evo for gene let's let's
try to figure out what this is so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go into
my google goggles and pretend for a
second that you have a friend named
Brian and you want to figure out where
this building is this could be a poster
that you've seen in a subway station it
could be a magazine cover it could be a
book it could be a monument that you're
actually taking a picture of what Google
Goggles does is actually a visual search
engine that Google has scored a whole
bunch of different visual pictures in
their database and it allows you to go
and search against that database and
return results so hey Brian you still
there okay so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take a picture with Google
Goggles of this building and what the
evo 4g has done is taken a picture that
scan an instantaneous it over to 4G
network that's returned to a website now
is actually identified this is the
Guggenheim and shouldn't know imagine
that was so I saw how quick that was so
what I'm going to do is write i'm not
exactly sure what the Guggenheim
so when I just go ahead and click on the
website and what it's doing its loading
the website over the 4g network and one
thing you'll notice is that this is a
pretty big website it's got a lot of
animation a lot of graphics just like on
your desktop you can you can scroll
around you can see all the different
menu items in contention zoom so if we
looks like that's actually has flash
content on there as well so it's the
real internet yes it is Kevin is you
know what we believe in the middle
internet experience and that's what
we're delivering with EVO 4G so the
great thing is ryan i can actually tell
you what the hours in ticketing events
are you know what it looks like we've
missed the last time for exhibits there
itself looks like there's dinner yeah
it's just dinner oh I guess what why
won't beat about 20 minutes once we're
done with this shindig all right talk to
you later see you so one thing we forgot
to figure out how to get the goofy kind
of medium it's a pretty good point have
enough you know one thing we need to do
is you know we need to figure out where
the closest subway is that that's
probably the fastest way to get there do
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
bring up my lair reality browser and for
those of you who aren't familiar with
layer what it is is an augmented reality
browser and what it does is it takes
your GPS location and it uses the camera
in the phone it actually gives you
visual overlays of where things are
based on where you are so there's a
filter in here for the looks subway
lines and where they're located at but
this could easily be other filters that
layer has in here like local restaurants
bars whatever you may have wanting to
look for it so I'm going to go ahead and
click on this and what it's doing is
it's actually using our GPS location and
sexually return the closest subway
station so if you notice there's a
Hawaii
as I move it it actually shows an
overlay of where the different subway
locations are how far they are so if I
turn it you notice in the top right-hand
corner says there's a subway location
it's a 42nd Street main avenue and it's
about 868 meters away so for those of
you from New York you're probably very
familiar with it so the other thing i
can do is i can actually click here and
it will actually take me to a map it
will show me where I'm at and relative
to that location and if I want since
I've never been here before it will
actually even give me navigation
directions and a physical or street map
seamlessly if you've never been there so
you can identify it there one else how
fast that loads up that really does
change how you use navigation on your
device in the motor setting so free
looks like we're going to a few minutes
so clear we're going to take the subway
over to the guggenheim me Ryan we have a
few minutes of downtime and we could do
work since Dan's here will tell them
we'll be able to email some productivity
apps on our evo 4g but in our like
entertainment things we could do to pass
the board well yeah my big thing is we
should probably just games you know one
big thing on Android that you know a lot
of people have been asking for is the
gaming experience and really what we're
going to be able to do
with EVO 4G launch is an example of that
here today is a need for speed shift
it's a new game from Electronic Arts
that will be available at the time of
launch of evo 4G and it really shows the
capabilities of this device so what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to
start up this game and you can actually
see with the score pointing 3 inch
screen it really highlights the great
power of the 3d capabilities of the
phone as well as the one gigahertz
processor and you know this is the way
gaming is meant to be done on this huge
screen you can really kind of get into
the game absolutely i think i speak for
everyone in New York as they were glad
you're taking the subway tonight driving
the car but if you were going to drive
the car we have some special accessories
I mentioned the docking station for HDMI
earlier we also have a semi for the car
that you can dock the device in your car
to automatically switches the evo 4g
into a safe mode for the vehicle so it
does navigation voice search voice
dialing really helps for people who are
safety conscious and trying to have the
mobile experience in the car without
about having any safety problems so also
available we launched the device so
freedom way one of the features that we
announced at ctia we launched the the
evo 4g or announced it was this ability
to have a mobile hotspot so with the evo
you can actually connect 8 users
simultaneously the device using Wi-Fi it
really becomes a mobile browser so what
devices GF connected well the great
thing is you know because you can't
connect other Wi-Fi devices and there's
millions of Wi-Fi devices out there I
can take something like this iPad which
has Wi-Fi and it's connected via the evo
4g to our 4G network and why we're
streaming right now is actually content
from ESPN on the ipad via the evo 4g at
the same time to doing this we actually
also have this picture frame here that
has is downloading high quality I big
file size pictures from staff
over our 4G network via the evo 4g all
at the same time and then to the right
here you actually see a laptop it's
actually streaming live security camera
content from the Apple is Marilyn Police
Department via the evo 4g so when you
combine all that together you can have a
date connections all using the single
mobile broadband network and you know
the evo 4g is just that good cabinet
can't our other devices you know I would
even probably say for a lot of you have
this phone even power the iphone 3g it's
amazing so even here in New York I can
get a real signal and stay connected on
