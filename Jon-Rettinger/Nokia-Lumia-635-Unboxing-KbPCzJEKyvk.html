to you by go daddy what's up everyone
john wrench from TechnoBuffalo here and
in this lunch box I do not have my lunch
I wish I had like a thermos and like a
sandwich like a pudding cup and like
some bag of baby carrots I'll be super
happy but what I have in here is not
that it is the Nokia Lumia 635 available
for t-mobile sort of low cost entry
point into the Windows Phone world every
cuz I take a look at it and also see why
it's in a lunchbox let's go and take a
first look so on the outside is metal
lunchbox you got this circle for two
circles or probably saying John would
eat two circles and I will tell you
friend
that's the Cortana logo and it is here
because this is one of the first phones
to ship with Cortana already working
meaning it's gone Windows Phone 8.1 on
here that point one might not be a lot
in the decimal world but it's a lot in
the phone feature Department brings a
ton of really cool stuff on here clear
notification shade Cortana and a lot of
other settings will then open a sucker
up I'm should go ahead and assume that
this is not retail packaging hi I'm
Cortana thank Ratana I'm John and there
we have the Lumia 635 sitting what's
this idiom a little bit of foam there's
a foam push off the side for a quick
second run through all the specs as well
just so you're before I get to the specs
so you know this is an entry-level phone
it costs a hundred and sixty eight
dollars full retail price so it's
competing against something like the
Moto G we've got this little plastic
thing got a charge cable the wall wart
connect it to microUSB and there's your
teeny tiny sync cable we also have some
books here
we got a welcome getting start guide and
the rest of that I don't think we have
anything else hidden away inside of here
nope nothing else push off the side for
a real quick second here is the phone
I'm gonna go ahead turn it on and I'll
run through the specs and sort of show
everything that it can do stop for just
one quick second to thank our friends
and good peeps at GoDaddy
they want to let you know that it's go
time and they're here to help you kick
butt online start your website today
with h2o on 95
and calm visit godaddy.com enter promo
code techno 75 we get here dot-com for
chillers and 95 cents it's time to start
your blog go ahead and get back to the
video alright so you've got the phone
all booted up good and take off the
screen protector come on whooshing noise
boom I didn't get quite that whooshing
noise so here is Windows Phone 8.1 with
Cortana so you're looking at here is a
4.5 inch print resolution of 854 by 480
which means it's got a 218 PPI but again
remember 168 bucks to pick the sucker up
full retail again running Windows Phone
8.1 being powered by a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 400 512 megabytes
of RAM 8 gigs of internal storage if
they can also expand that with a micro
SD card I can go up to hundred twenty
eight gigs there does have a camera on
the back that is five megapixel and it's
got a 1830 milliamp hour battery missing
here though are things like NFC but does
have bluetooth 4.0 so a real quick tour
of the device is pretty standard Windows
Phone as far as the software goes we've
got your main Windows button right there
you've got a search button you can
activate it these are not physical
buttons these are on-screen buttons so
they will sort of move and be dynamic
but set for Windows Phone you've got
back windows and search of course you've
got all of your apps if you scroll on
over you can see that sort of an a huge
list format a Wi-Fi calling is here as
well for timo what lives inside of an
app so if you want to Avenger that
you've got the option now this does have
LTE built in but people were concerned
on the left hand side you've got nothing
right-hand side you've got your power
button your volume up and down rather
and your power and lock but you don't
have as a camera button which for the
first I can remember from the Windows
Phone on the top we put that in
millimeter headset jack and the bottom
that's where your charging ports going
to live in you're probably saying to
yourself self how do I put the battery
owner where does the SIM card go because
don't have a slot for it
well you have to go ahead and pull the
top off like this sorry
fiddle with it to get it out what the
back does come off I can do it on camera
it go pops right off and then that's
where your battery your SD card and your
SIM card are going to live and just sort
of thin plastic but it does feel good
when it's on the
it's relatively flush with the battery
so you know feeling a sort of that
plastic give sometimes you can get go
ahead and snap that right back on let's
do a quick size comparison here you can
see what this sucker looks like it is
4.5 inches let's bring in I don't know
close cousin here here is the Android
powered nokia X so there are those two
butts a 4.5 inch strong we've seen a lot
of phone comparisons compared to some
other stuff here it is next to Raphael
in case you're wondering how many
Rafael's the Lumia 635 is now you're
going to know here it is next Batman
Lego Batman you do wonder how many Lego
Batman says here's it's side-by-side
with Lego Batman you can really see the
width of both and here it is next to
John Snow who wants to remind the Lumia
635 it knows nothing so it's a couple
Jon Snow's really long but it's not as
as wide as one Jon Snow so sort of keep
that in mind when you start with out to
Lumia 635 is going to be for you I think
