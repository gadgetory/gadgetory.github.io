to you by the LG g3 what's up everyone
john wrench from TechnoBuffalo here you
can tell by the weird new backgrounds we
are in a new office which means we need
a new TV for our twitch channel for
streaming and just because we need one
Vizio just last week took the wraps off
the new P series TV we're looking at
some giant 80 and even 90 inches from
sharp but then Vizio is like hey we'll
give you 4k for twenty five hundred
bucks and the 70 inch sets that seemed
like a no-brainer there's also a 50 inch
model that's going to be about a
thousand dollars so I mean really
incredible pricing I mean this is 1080p
pricing for 4k so a lot of stuff packed
into this box I'm gonna need a few a
little bit of help to probably unbox
this is one of the biggest unboxings
we've ever done fortunately we got Ryan
brand here so as they sort of unsheathed
this giant beast from its box I'll tell
you a little bit about it so it's got 72
active LED zones it's got active pixel
tuning technology and huge dynamic
contrast ratios of 50 million to one
which is fancy pixel talk for things
should look super awesome it's got full
array LED technology
it's got active pixel tuning those
things pretty much SPECT like a computer
it's got a v6 processor which is sort of
videos talk for a quad core GPU and I do
a core CPU which means you're gonna have
crazy speed for boot up and saw and you
know working the remote everything
should be SuperDuper fast on this guy
we've got a beastly processor in here so
according to vizio the p-series was
designed with an h VEC h.265 codec which
is one better than h.264 to also need to
be able to stream 4k Ultra HD content
over the Internet so if you want to
watch house of cards in 4k has Netflix
now streams that that's got what you do
it so not all 4k TVs can do 4 K zoom you
got to have support for that new codec
supposedly also going to blow away
traditional a 3.2 pulldown with a pure
cinema engine
and adjust to frame rates to show films
as the creator's intended in a native 24
and 48 frames per second so let's go
ahead and just take this guy out of the
box and I talked a lot about attitude it
looks like I have not seen one of these
things in person yet plugs are being
pulled you don't have to cut the box and
pull the TV out you can just lift the
box up and reveal the television set
important
please read do not attempt to move this
TV by yourself I'm not I have help so
yellow warning label be damned go and
pull the stuff off looks like this thing
has super thin bezels you could say it's
like the LG g3 of TV's see we got you
don't vacuum me the TV also has 802 11
AC for wireless built-in it's got just
ports of plenty here you have a hardwire
Ethernet port but I don't know why you
would do that you've got a DTV TV port
you got audio out I also have an
obstacle out you've got a another audio
out cable
you've got five HDMI ports and you've
got component also a USB port for either
power or peripheral accessory so this
thing is just ported up stop the
unboxing real quick to thank our friends
at LG and particular the LG g3 this is
the highest rated phone that we've ever
reviewed and when my favorite films of
2014 it is the Android phone that always
has a place in the warmness of my pocket
it's got a 5.5 inch quad HD display it's
got laser autofocus the screen looks
absolutely gorgeous and probably my
favorite feature the phone out of
anything is that it pretty much has zero
bezels it's all screen and it's all
awesome it's available now from all four
major US carriers so it's been a couple
days since we started the unboxing we've
got the set mounted to the wall and it
looks absolutely gorgeous I love how
thin the bezels are but instead of the
bezels are the whole TV itself is also
on a little bit of fat site if we're
going to mount it to a wall probably not
that big a deal but if I keep in mind if
you need something that's really thin
and you're gonna fit pretty flush we're
able to get some 4k content up here able
to stream even some 4k stuff watching
some house of cards on
 things look absolutely gorgeous
where to put it through its full paces
oh if you guys want to see anything
secure in the floor you let us know
we'll check refresh rate see how things
look I faster frames per second we'll
check for K will check blu-ray we'll
check everything in between I want to
know what you guys want to see about the
site we'll see if it's worth 2500 bucks
