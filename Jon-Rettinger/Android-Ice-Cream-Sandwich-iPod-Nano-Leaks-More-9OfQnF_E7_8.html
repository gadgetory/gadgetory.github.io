technobuffalo here with my vlog asst
tile tech recap videos few things to
note first yes this is the same shirt
that I work in my old John for lakers
icon which proves one thing I don't go
shopping very often and that was an old
old old picture on another side note I
have a smoke alarm which is on a high
ceiling that don't have a sladder high
enough to reach and I was screaming low
battery all day till I was finally able
to get a big enough ladder and take it
down it's all i can hear as i'm talking
is low battery low battery kept
squawking screaming at me but that is
probably more information than you
needed but i thought i'd share so we had
a ton of stuff happened today on
technobuffalo calm a lot of it has to do
with google so we ended yesterday with
Noah's unboxing of the samsung nexus s
4g so that's available it's the same
next best that we've seen since like
january ish except now it's got wimax so
hooray we had a post from Joey saying
the cap con PSN outage could cost them
hundreds of thousands of dollars that's
probably true for every manufacturer
that makes games for the playstation
network people aren't buying games i
imagine the people taking the biggest
hit financially though it was sony a lot
of folks like soon we're looking to buy
consoles you know for every day and if
you're looking to buy a Playstation or
an xbox you don't have an allegiance one
way or another and you look at the two
and you know police agent got hacked
xbox live has been ok get promptly pick
an xbox you know regardless whether it's
right or wrong or your gaming preference
is it's just a reality so that's been
going on we had a fun video of from the
gel GTL conference with that Improv
Everywhere doing some dancing I was kind
of cool there's a video in there I
definitely recommend and go and check it
out if you're having a bad day and you
want something to make you laugh going
and watch this video hit play sort of
made me happy there was a long day with
Google i/o and coordinating coverage and
filming and what
I so watching that always kind of nice
so that happened you can see how far
down I got a scroll to get back to stuff
here and then the news that broke kind
of yesterday Microsoft acquires skype
for 8.5 billion with a B which is a lot
of moola scratch scrilla clams oh I
don't know what other names you can
think for money but it's a lot of them
they also promised support for
non-microsoft platforms so that means
you're not going to be stuck with the
same version of skype for math that
you've been probably be using for a
while what's most exciting about this is
the possibility of skype working its way
into the xbox platform and certainly
tremendous if you're a Windows Phone 7
fan wondering what they're gonna do
gonna do with it 8.5 billion i believe
is the biggest purchase a company made
are never made so that's awesome if you
want the full details about what it was
about and what its gonna mean for you go
ahead and check out that article and
speaking of which what Microsoft buying
skype might mean for the xbox Joey
answered that question what it's going
to mean and he also said that's billion
with Abby who talked about what you
might see for the kinect you think about
being able to chat and video chat you
know using the Kinect in more ways than
you can already and now we're onto
google i/o so first audrianna defined
what Google i/o was it's google's big
developers conference go ahead and read
this if you want the full details you're
gonna be hearing a lot about it in the
tech world we were at the keynote noah
was there doing his rhyming live
blogging of the event they streamed it
live of course on youtube so we have a
full recap of that one of the things
they announced was the next version of
android presumably four-point-oh they
served gone alphabetically with dessert
so donut Eclair Froyo efg H honeycomb
and now I so I also know my alphabet ice
cream didn't talk much about it I didn't
give that much detail and that many
details before they did give including
some awesome stuff about the cameras and
tracking and that kind of business and
unifying platforms be sure to check out
this article
she was written by me this guy what has
two thumbs and wrote an article about
ice cream sandwiches this guy and also
loves ice cream sandwiches they are
delicious my wife sometimes buys i'm not
a big into soy but sometimes buys the
soy ice cream ones from Trader Joe's and
they're just a little bit of awesome
google launches more information you
needed google launches music streaming
service so there's now a music beta by
google it's a pretty awesome service so
if you're interested in streaming your
music in the cloud and always having
your content they're definitely go ahead
and give that manage am a reed also now
we've got movie rentals now on the
android market itunes put on notice i
also wrote that one yay movie rental I
mean it's pretty self-explanatory movie
rentals now in the android market the
cool thing though as you can select the
download from your desktop and have it
downloaded on your mobile device in the
background so kind of neat all that
informations right on here google
finally deals with fragmentation
audreanna wrote that i put up a video
that i filmed yesterday right before
google i/o ranting about it on how I
thought fragmentation was really
detrimental to platform well event Lee
Google listen to my video that I hadn't
published yet nobody else and seen but
my cat and released or game details
rather on what is it ice cream sandwich
Noah did a live show TechnoBuffalo live
chance for us to interact and talk with
you where he was live from google i/o so
he chatted and did his thing he's bald
and sometimes his head get shiny so
before he does like CNBC your TV things
they have to dust it so that's that
pictures which is kind of funny you can
go ahead and see that this head was
shiny next they get to get out to the
folks in attendance the samsung galaxy
tab 10.1 which is gonna be coming next
month we've got an unboxing video of it
done by this guy Noah Kravitz so go
ahead and take a look at that it's
similar spec to the zoom but way thinner
lighter and made by samsung which i
think is an exact quote from this
article so check that out a new Alan
Wake tattle confirmed not Alan Wake two
or downloadable content so kind of neat
new game coming up
written by Joey audrianna came back
strong with showing Google at home this
is something that you definitely need to
see how Google wants to integrate into
your house a lot of really interesting
things here and how Google can interact
with your everything from your lights to
your treadmill definitely give this one
a read there's a lot of information here
and some funny graphics definitely
definitely definitely go ahead and give
this one a whirl if you're interested
and what Google wants to do in your
house so continuing is this the new ipod
nano 7th generation it's got a camera
and no clip I don't like the new ipod
nano the one with the touchscreen in
fact I find a borderline useless so I
camera is going to just make it a little
less useless I'm hoping that they
ditched the full touchscreen and give me
a little bit of a click wheel or at
least changing user interface to make
the touchscreen a little more useful so
we got some pictures of it here up on
TechnoBuffalo check that out
technobuffalo to find boning let's talk
about boning it's part of our new series
that emily is doing on technobuffalo
defines so you know a term you've heard
it used we've done fanboy and a few
other ones in the past we want you guys
to help us define what it means and you
get a chance to win some stuff so go
ahead and give your definition we got a
ton of cool choices and heck you can win
free stuff so that's fun so Emily put
that out today we got more google i/o
stuff reveals more content and more
everything for Google TV audreanna sort
of brought that to us Google TVs sort of
been laboring there nothing doing
anything with it so now we got some more
business and information on Google TV
and we've got more contact coming today
but least what we've got it was recently
as of filming this no also got some
hands-on time with Sony Ericsson's new
Xperia mini Xperia mini pro it is small
on size big on power as you can watch
the video on the site it's pretty
powerful phone Giga her processors do
cameras HD video capture and very very
very very tiny phone so if I go ahead
check these suckas out so this has been
a very rambling video i'll be showing
what we got going on what's been
happening in the world of tech telling
you more about my clothing and beeping
noises that i had going on and things in
my head and my ice cream eating habits
probably more you needed to know i'd say
good-b the moral i hope you guys enjoyed
