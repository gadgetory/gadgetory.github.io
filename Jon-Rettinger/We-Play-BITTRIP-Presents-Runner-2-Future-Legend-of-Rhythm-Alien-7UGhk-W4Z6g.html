for bit.trip presents runner to future
legend of rhythm alien okay so why did I
leave that Charles Martin a intro in
place I can almost guarantee that you've
heard Martinez voice several times over
this man in your life but you might not
know who he actually is Martin a is the
voice of mario luigi waluigi baby mario
baby luigi and even Paarthurnax dragon
from the skyrim
he's a gaming icon and legend whether or
not you've ever actually heard his name
before he has been representing Nintendo
alone since the dawn of voice working
gaming for that company anyways I'm Joey
Davidson senior gaming editor at
TechnoBuffalo and I'm bringing you a
look at the recently released Runner 2
from the gaijin games or as it's known
entirely bit.trip presents runner to
future Legend of rhythm alien before we
go breaking this game down further I'm
just going to step away and let you
listen to the music and pay attention to
the visuals
run our - in case you haven't already
figured this out is an infinite running
game just like its predecessor players
are charged with pushing buttons in
order to jump over duck under smash and
block the obstacles that get in that way
I'm actually playing this game on the PC
I can use a keyboard but the user
interface the the menu that gaijin games
created for this one really recommends
using a gamepad or a controller so I am
music and controller and the difference
is remarkable it's a much better game
when play with the controller so maybe
you can use that to inform you and in
regards to which platform you pick this
thing on on but much like everything
else in the bit.trip series from gaijin
games runner 2 is also based heavily on
the music that you hear in the
background so everything you do in the
game builds that song that you hear
while you're playing and the result is
just really charming fun ambience that
accompanies the controller hurling
frustration that comes from memorizing
patterns and reacting quickly so yeah
despite the overall sunny disposition
and exceptionally cheery music run or
two is a tough game you're gonna repeat
levels over and over and over just to
make sure you've collected each and
every stack of gold unlocked all the
costumes and add the extras it's an
insanely addictive formula that works
really well and one of the compliments
that I have to pay gaijin games is that
they made things happen quickly so yeah
you're gonna play levels that are really
frustrating but when you die or when you
hit something you'll either revert back
to a checkpoint or get sent back to the
beginning of the level and it happens
really fast you're not gonna wait for a
loading spring every time you run into a
brick wall that would be exceptionally
frustrating and make this thing no fun
so I'm sure you've noticed I've hit a
few obstacles already this was the first
playthrough I had with this game but
just like that you're sent back to the
starting block if I had hit a checkpoint
in the middle of the level and I think
checkpoints are new to this game at
least memory serves they weren't in the
original
you're sent back to the beginning of the
level quickly so there's no real
frustration that comes from up I just
died I got to sit through a loading
screen I hate that game and at least run
or two skips that and kind of
incorporates losing into the overall
scheme of eventually winning it's part
of the reason why this formula so
as a recording this video runner 2 is
available for the PC Mac Linux Wii U and
Xbox 360 platforms it's bound for the
PlayStation 3 and PS Vita soon but those
others are released right this very
moment that might change by the time
this video is posted but as of Wednesday
it's the 27th of February 1 I'm
recording us those are the platforms
that it's available for it's a $15 game
I believe on Steam if you paid 20 bucks
you can get the soundtrack as well so
definitely worth it it's a cool cool
little pick up and these support indie
gaming and gaijin games has been doing
this for a while and it's the runner
game is really are probably their bread
and butter I'm in a bit rip series
anyway it's really a fantastic gorgeous
game and I highly recommend it to anyone
with some free time and some extra bucks
