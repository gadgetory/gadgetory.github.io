Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and today
we'll be taking a look at microsoft's
personal voice assistant Cortana running
on Android the apk was unofficially
leaked last week and we've been playing
around with it over the weekend is that
any good
well let's go ahead and take a look
setting up Cortana was fairly easy just
answer a few questions and through your
name log into your Microsoft account
agree to its terms and that's it after
that you'll be up and running open the
app and Crotona will be at your every
beckon call cretinous interface is very
simple matching the same look you find
on Windows Phone a lot of black chucks
opposed by neon colors it by no means
looks finished but there's enough here
to get a taste of what Microsoft's voice
assistant has to offer it looks strange
seeing Cortana on a different platform
but she surprisingly feels at home on
Android you can either use your voice by
tapping on the mic icon or type keywords
in a search field you'll be able to ask
her questions or pull data on upcoming
events locations nearby weather and news
grabbing search results is a little slow
right now though that could be because
Crotona on Android is currently on beta
Crotona can also access your notebook
where she lists all the information she
has on you from places you'd like to
visit to your home and work address to
your favorite contacts however if you're
uncomfortable with Cortana having this
information you'll be able to opt out
but you'll only be able to get the full
experience if you go all in
by giving Crotona your information the
service will be able to proactively
provide information before you even ask
for it unfortunately one big feature
that's missing from the Android version
is the ability to say hey Cortana you
also can't ask Ratana to send a text
message which is a bit disappointing
Crotona does however provide
location-based reminders for example you
can ask Cortana to remind you to buy
eggs when I'm at the store and Crotona
will automatically pull up a list of
grocery stores nearby where I might want
to buy eggs and then remind me when I
get there the leaked version of Cortana
is pretty stable so far though it
definitely needs some polish and because
it's not deeply integrated inside of
Android it isn't better than Google now
Google service is renowned for offering
information before a user asks for it
and an Android M which is launching for
free to small it'll be even better with
now on tap from our brief experience
with Cortana she doesn't appear to be
enough for Android users this is an
unofficial leak so we can't really judge
the app too much based on this early apk
hopefully we'll get our hands on the
official build from mic
soft soon since windows 10th is just
right around a corner anyways thank you
guys so much for watching and if you
guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up and we will see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
