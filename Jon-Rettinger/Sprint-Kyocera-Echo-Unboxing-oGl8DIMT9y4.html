from people saying they're getting a
little tired of unboxing videos and
boxing videos aren't as fun as they used
to be that kind of thing you know it's
hard to know sometimes because you get I
like to call it the vocal minority you
know you get like a few people you know
you do a video and it gets say 30,000
views and if you have like even a
hundred commenters all saying that you
know that's still just a small
percentage of 30,000 so it's hard to
know but I was thinking about I'm
thinking you know maybe doesn't have to
be an unboxing video every time you know
maybe you know we kind of wait and you
know just do sort of a hands-on video or
a review but then then this happens to
boxes
what's going on everybody I'm nor from
TechnoBuffalo calm I got the Kyocera
echo from Sprint today it hits on April
17th for 199 99 on contract after rebate
1 9999 today's the 13th I read a few
days ahead of time thanks to the folks
at Sprint for sending it out and I
opened up the FedEx package and there
are two boxes and so it's like a sign
that I'm supposed to do an unboxing kind
of a dual unboxing video I don't know
how this is gonna work but I'm gonna try
it I think you know it's the whole dual
thing the dual screen phone dual
unboxing there at there's a website up
on Sprint they don't microsite for
pre-ordering the site and it says we
chopped pre-ordering the phone it says
we challenged you to a duel dua L and
there's a little animated gunslinger
like a duel anyway alright so here we go
duel unboxing will unbox the big box
first inside box number one you get the
phone and what looks like probably a
media guide on the flash drive here's
the phone itself here is a lot of
styrofoam here is nothing oh I see so
this was supposed to be in here I bet
this is probably just the media kit with
the and this was supposed to be but this
doesn't fit
maybe somebody cut it wrong maybe when
they ordered these custom foam inserts
they were all cut wrong and the retail
box wouldn't fit and that's why they
sent it out
here I was thinking there was some kind
of high concept dual unboxing thing but
maybe they just messed up when they cut
it so did they send me two phones well
let's look inside box number two it's a
box now it's a triple unboxing and
inside of this box oh it's empty so no I
only got one phone I thought I was gonna
have four screens across two films but
inside here there's the USB cable
there's the power adapter and there is
the infamous second this is the second
battery battery charger external battery
because a dual screen phone means eating
up a lot of battery power here's the
phone itself the Chi 0 echo Kyocera echo
and you know I'll tell you what I don't
even know what to make of this thing I
have to learn how to use the latch I
have to it's an Android based phone
Android 2.2 Froyo with two screens it's
unique that's for sure
you know Sprint has never and as long as
I've been covering mobile tech which is
a little over five years now Sprint has
never been afraid to take chances and
that try to be innovative with their
their products and and that you know
their services and everything so you
know way back when it was the back flip
phone when at the back look the up stage
it was a music player on one side phone
on the other it was like a mullet
business in the front party in the back
now it's the it's the echo it's a dual
screen phone with this crazy hand of
design and the deal is that it runs it
runs some apps in full dual screen mode
so it's almost like a little mini tablet
you know you've got Android 2.2 and it's
stretched across the whole thing and you
can turn it to that an accelerometer yep
you can turn the phone and stretch it
across this way stretch it across the
whole thing I'm so professional it
stretched across both screens so you've
got you know this combination dual
screen setup and you know they just they
redid Android 2.2
to fit the dual screens here and then
there are certain apps that can be used
in batteries dead already certain apps
that can be used in in the full-on you
know - screen mode and the certain apps
that are customized to - how to take
advantage of both screens at the same
time so alright so I have to set up the
Google account also see this is why I'm
boxing or aren't as cool anymore because
you have to get these things all set up
and you can't just get that set up you
know right out of the box it takes a few
minutes let's get some some you know a
little tour around the phone here so you
know you've got basically the the dual
capacitive touch screen is kind of
mimicking each other with the three
buttons on the bottom there the three
capacitive touch buttons for home menu
and back and then you can learn how to
use this slip properly then you can
close it up and just go into single
screen mode when it's closed up you know
it's a thick phone for sure thicker then
smarter than your average bear here I'm
gonna get a another phone here's the
Thunderbolt which is also a giant phone
you know single screen four inch screen
definitely not a small foam but you can
see the echo much much thicker than the
Thunderbolt anyway on top here there's
nothing there's the hinge on the left
spine you've got a three millimeter
headphone jack you've got a card slot
you got your power button you've got a
rocker switch you've got a USB port on
the bottom nothing here just a little
Qualcomm 3G CDMA it's a 3G phone not 4G
on the other side again just you know
just your all your controls are on the
ones fine here because the rest is is
taken over with the hinge and all that
stuff and then on the back you've got
your camera five megapixel with a flash
autofocus 720p HD video capture and you
know you can use your you can use your
your dual screen kind of is a little
mini laptop mode or
in the mouth in the tablet mode to
launch a second application touch both
screens at the same time after tapping
okay so I think what you can do let's go
home and just locked in so you can touch
both screens at the same time oh wait no
I see let's get back to where we were
and now touch both screens at the same
time and now I can launch a second
application so I could have the UQ so I
going to my browser going down here and
then separate of that I can have you Q
which is the customized YouTube app
going up there just all kinds of
craziness going on with this device I
will say you know sort of out of the box
here that you know obviously would have
to spend some time playing around see
this was bad I got suckered into the
unboxing app but if there's unboxing
video but there's any phone that
shouldn't have an unboxing video it's
this thing because really I need to
spend some time figuring out what is
going on with the two screens and which
apps work across both and you know all
the different configurations here but
basically touch this again and see what
happens now we're back across to the now
I'm back I've got just it that's it's
all very interesting that's all I can
really say right now is very interesting
very interesting very interesting
basically you know just out of the box a
couple things I'll say about it the the
snap on the hinge feels pretty solid and
it definitely locks in and locks out you
know very you know it's definitely you
can tell when it's locked into tablet
mode or when it's open and then you know
it snaps nicely into this laptop style
mode as well and I could see using this
you don't have to try out the email app
I can see using this with the typing
down here and you know viewing your
message paid up there you know just like
that just like that but I have to
configure my email account so I'll do
that offline obviously it's a thick
phone it's not going to be forever
buddy there's a lot of bezel in between
the two displays when you're in tablet
mode and even just looking at this
little you know tip button there there
cursor arrow to display to provide you
with more possibilities as a phone or a
tablet and I wonder if that's the sort
of thing that you'd get used to or if it
would just always be annoying to see
content you know this great like you
know it's almost the resolution of some
of the tablet devices out there in terms
of pixels get the spec sheet here all
right and so what you wind up with when
the phone is open each screen is 3.5
inches so opening them up you get
effectively a 4.7 inch roughly display
and the combined resolution of both
screens is 960 by 800 so you're you're
on par almost with you know iPad is 1024
768
so 960 by 800 you know a little
different proportions or whatnot but but
you're almost at a full tablet size in
terms of pixels but the problem is that
that nice giant screen feeling is broken
up right there and you know so you're
you're sort of if we go back to the web
browser here and you know load up let's
not load up that
yeah let's load up this frame so we load
up a screen here and you know we want to
zoom in and out is this a oh this is a
mobile yeah trying to make a point here
people
oh all right and then so here you've got
you know the the keyboard only spins
doesn't span all the way across so let's
go back and do let's tilt it and going
to this mode true hoop has been my
standby for a website that loads up in
non mobile mode
it's running on Sprint and you've got
you know the Android notification barn
all that stuff it's pretty standard
Android 2.2 from what I've seen what I
saw before I got the device and what I
see now anyway so here's true hoop
opening up and you know if we're if
we're gonna so can we not not doing
multi-touch gonna have to go old-school
style Oh interesting I thought it was
multi-touch but seems not to be well at
any rate you know if you're looking at
something especially if it's a visual
you know we'll just use this ad just
because it's there and you know it's
broken up by that bezel and I just
wonder if after using this phone day-in
day-out you just get used to it and your
brain just sort of learns to ignore the
bezel or if it's just going to be
annoying to have that all split up and
started defeat the purpose at least as
far as using the expanded screen now the
dual mode you know apps that that you
know using two apps at the same time or
using an app or it takes advantage of
both screens you know like this where
you've got the keyboard down here and
then the screen up above that could be
kind of cool so an interesting concept
I'm excited to play with it I'm dubious
right now I was dubious when they
launched it I'm dubious now it just sort
of feels like one of those things that
is either maybe ahead of its time or you
know just never had a time but I'm
withholding I shouldn't even said that
because I want to withhold judgment
until I use the device for a while but
you know but as always kudos to sprint
from trying to push the envelope with
the Kyocera echo the amazing dual screen
phone with two boxes that turn into 45
boxes and its own external battery extra
battery external charger that it had to
come within the package because two
screens take up so much power so here
you go you get this little little
charger and it's got take them off of it
and so you've got your charger and then
USB powered oh man see I failed with
batteries I fail with extra chargers too
where's the extra battery
extra batteries inside the box and well
anyway so you can carry this around and
snap the battery in and out because um
because you need that much juice for a
phone with this many screens one $99.99
on contract with a after rebate through
sprint on April 17th which means I have
a couple days to mess around with it and
let you know what I think of it before
it hits the stores much much more on the
echo and you know the old fashioned one
