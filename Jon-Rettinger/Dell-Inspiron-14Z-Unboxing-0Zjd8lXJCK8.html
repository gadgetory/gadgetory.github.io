here with an unboxing for you of the
Dell Inspiron 14z laptop this is a range
a notebook that sort of slated above
netbooks and below your full scale Core
2 Duo chips this is writing an ultra-low
voltage chip which is either a core duo
or Core 2 Duo I'm not sure what which
one Dell says you can configure it with
either 2 gigs of ram or up to 4 these
things are really nice they sort of are
the nice middle ground between
portability and workability you can run
full scale HD movies if you even do some
editing and possibly even some light
gaming on these we'll see and you get
the battery life that you'd get with an
atom processor coupled with really the
usability of a Core 2 Duo chip or a cord
to achieve depending on which version
del sent these prices range anywhere
from 650 all the way up to 800 bucks
hang on how you configured it so enough
with me talking let's go ahead and dig
in typical Dell box here what do you
know it's certainly Intel and a lot of
Dell tape so we'll take the obligatory
knife looks like it's gonna require a
decent amount of cutting to get into
this and we will start chopping away
a little bit more tape all right that
should be good see if we can get into
this there you go turn up and see what's
inside
a typical Dell packaging it's styrofoam
with the laptop tucked away in there it
curious what the specs on this
particular machine are and of course as
you deal with all my computer reviews
I'll be running through through specs
I'll be doing comparison videos I'll
show you how quickly it does things and
sort of how it overall performance is
let's take out this little box on the
side first
put that off so we can get the laptop
out here lift off the styrofoam so
you're going to get looks like a full
restore CDs which is quite nice
I give 8 your free 60 day trial of
Microsoft Office and then a full version
of Microsoft Works some warranty
information there a ton of CDs in here
you've got your restored discs and
drivers it's like some more restored it
there's a lot to restore and Roxio CD
creator that's nice to deltablue lights
up but take out the laptop and this is
the 14 Z so it's a 14 inch screen
there's also a 15 Z which quite
obviously would be a 15 inch screen
let's go ahead and move this off to the
side
yeah the packaging does look to be a new
unit so that's nice this one comes in
red and does have a DVD drive which is
which is quite nice it's a very light
feel to it let's go over some of the
ports on the side you've got a card
reader slots you've got one USB port
Gigabit Ethernet HDMI VGA vent port on
the left hand side on the right we've
got two more USB ports your DVD writer
and your power on the back you've got
nothing and then there's the other side
on the front looks like you've got your
mic and audio on the back you've got
some ports for the RAM and stuff let's
go ahead and open this up does have a
nice full keyboard it's not the chiclet
style but they're flat keys keyboard
does seem to be quite nice let's take a
look at the first boot up and this is
the Centrino chip inside so I'm not sure
if that's going to be the core duo with
a Core 2 Duo I'll boot it up and take a
look it does appear to be glossy and
there is a webcam in there as well
let's go ahead and power this thing on
and see how quickly the boot up is and
take a look at some of the specs on the
computer hopefully it has some sort of
charge enough to turn on at least I'm
not sure if this is a multi-touch
trackpad or not but again we'll try it
out I really do you like the keeper on
this looks to be quite usable starting
up Windows 7 and while that's starting
up we'll take a look at the accessories
that come in this box I pulled out I
assume it's just the power brick what's
the other thing that power brick is its
to be sure your typical Dell fair but it
is on the thin side which is nice but
it's a little bit on the wide and the
bit chunky and of course a little bit of
an extender cable that back in the box
preparing your system for first use so
the computers boot it up you got to go
through this first few stuff all soft
the camera and come
once you guys know what the specs on the
machine are self respect to this
Inspiron 14z we're looking at the a full
Core 2 Duo ultra-low voltage chip you
can tell because it's the you 7300 clock
in at one point three gigahertz this
particular model has three gigs of ram
and comes up to four and it's got 64-bit
Windows 7 home premium so say a
relatively powerful computer let's take
a look at the rest of the specs and I'll
run through and do a full Windows seven
rating in an upcoming video hard drive
this comes with a 250 gigabyte drive I
believe you can get it up to 320 if
you'd like depending on how you spec it
out from Dell and it's got a screen
resolution of max 1366 by 768 those look
to be a quite a nice computer brightness
goes all the way up I've turned it down
it also looks like Dell left a lot of
the bloatware off of this which is
definitely on the nice side for a size
comparison to another laptop you may be
familiar with the 13-inch unibody
MacBook are the same size as new MacBook
Pros let's go ahead and pull this off
and see what it looks like go ahead and
stock them side-by-side and I'll pull
the camera down so you guys can see so
here's the thickness comparison of the
13-inch MacBook MacBook Pro and the Dell
Inspiron 14z as you can see there's
definitely a difference as far as
thickness goes the Inspiron is a little
bit on the thicker side size-wise you
stack on top of each other this the Mac
only has a 13.3 inch wear the Inspiron
is a full 4k inch that accounts for the
exercise across the top the Inspiron is
by no means a stick or a fat computer
it's definitely on the lighter side it's
powered by a six cell battery in the
back which Dell claims will get you
probably about five to six hours which
you probably translate to an actual
usage time of around four or four and a
half hours let's say but I'll keep it in
the labs and but it through a full gamut
of tests so as if you're interested in
the Inspiron 14 Z's to go out to the
channel I'll be running it through just
a ton of Diagnostics I'll be testing how
it handles sort of your daily usage in
my
usage how it handles Full HD YouTube how
it handles streaming video including
Hulu how it handles multitasking and
just how it works on an every day to day
use I would also give it a Windows 7
benchmark test you know the wonder
windows 7 standard scores you can see
you know how things rank but this is by
no means a powerhouse computer but it's
definitely in every day computer one
that you can do most everything with
graphics wise this thing is running the
Intel graphics media accelerator I
believe it's the X 4500 HD so it has to
have integrated graphics but a couple or
three gigs of ram or define how you spec
it all the way up to four that should be
quite enough for your everyday use and
certainly will get you through a good
game a world of warcraft center you guys
hope you enjoy the unboxing and stay
tuned for the rest of the videos I'm
