of a stir with our here's everything
wrong with apple video check that out if
you have it I promise to be a flipside
Apple has done it continues to do a ton
of awesome things so here is everything
right with Apple and before I jump in
Apple as a first company we're gonna be
dissecting in this waste we sure hit
subscribe button sure notifications
Microsoft Amazon Google and more are all
on deck I'm hoping you guys aren't gonna
want to miss them so I'm gonna get the
design part out of the way pretty
quickly
Apple sets the design standard the
consumer electronics to the string
everything from phones to tablets to
laptops influenced by what Apple does or
is allegedly going to do next before the
iPhone Android was being developed to be
non touchscreen or lying on a physical
keyboard it just looked like a fancier
blackberry big ol home buttons on the
front below the screens for better or
often for worse nowadays that was all
Apple while essential had the first
notch every notch since it's copied
Apple design language to a freaking tee
and even if you're the biggest Android
fan in the world you go a small like
what's up head nods Apple for pushing
design forward and making the
competition step up their game I'm not
gonna dwell too much on this I imagine
most you guys are already pretty well
aware of that
when it comes to ecosystem I'll go on
record saying no one does it better than
Apple messages coming in to my MacBook
Pro well sing it to my iPad and iPhone
seem like cloud magic and it's not that
you can't have this with Android or
peace diva services like push boa you
can configure a pretty similar
experience but needs to be set up and
often those services need to be paid for
and that's kind of the beauty of what
Apple offers it just works and works
right out of the box and that is a huge
appeal to people who just want to
passively use their tech even for me
someone who lives and breathes stuff
there's a beauty to that simplicity now
great to get to sometimes swallow extra
hard and live in blissful ignorance
inside apple's walled garden once you're
in there
the experience is
was even going beyond the consumer side
things like Final Cut Pro work and it
worked better than the competition you
check out a video John at TLD did
comparing the latest MacBook Pro with
Final Cut Pro 10 and Premiere Pro and
I'll speak for itself I also think it
speaks to the beauty of the offerings my
89 year old grandmother decided she
wanted a smartphone which I fought for
about two years but she won so I got her
an iPhone as seen he picked it up and
learned how to use it we now face time
with my kids she forwards me emails and
the fact that someone her age and
someone my age and people younger than
me can use the same OS go so it shows
the power of what that OS can do and
taking their products completely out of
the equation what's right with Apple as
an entity and I'm gonna use rough
numbers here but if we say that in the
US economy is like 17 trillion then
Apple is equal in size to 0.5% so half a
percent of the US economy and at the
global economies again rough numbers
about 60 trillion and that is 0.15
percent of the global freaking economy
the size of Apple is crazy so let's stop
and just take a break and just guess how
much Apple makes per second pause the
video and just leave your guests in the
comments Apple makes one thousand four
hundred and forty-four dollars in profit
per second this is equal to five point
two million per hour
one hundred and twenty seven million per
day or just over forty five point seven
billion per year and those are based on
2016 net income figures that is a crap
ton of money and it's not news Apple's a
big company but if Apple was like a
country I think it would stack up apples
revenue is comparable to the GDP of
whole frickin countries it's about the
same as Israel Greece Denmark and Hong
Kong
so yeah apples jive freak enormous
they're a for-profit company to hold
into shareholders they don't have to
give anything back but the sheer amount
which they do give is actually pretty
startling apples product Reds raised
over 160 million dollars was a
staggering numbers
more about Apple's product right and
what it does or doesn't do Dom Esposito
actually did a great video while back
talking about product read how Apple
implements it and also how they can
improve it recently Apple donated 50
million dollars to Stanford hospitals
with 25 million for new main building
another 25 million for new Children's
Hospital when hurricanes
Irma and Harvey hit Apple gave over 10
million to relief efforts they donated
another a hundred million to advance
diversity and tech and Tim Cook himself
plans to donate his entire 800 million
fortune to charity before he dies it's a
lot of money depending on when you check
Apple is teetering on being the first
trillion dollar company in the world
being such a large entity they naturally
take advantage of tax loopholes a fact
I'm not glossing over or excusing just
stating the fact and part of their
strategy is to keep a huge chunk of that
cash overseas mostly to avoid taxes on
it which is not cool especially if you
live in the u.s. Tim Cook though
announced that Apple is paying thirty
eight billion dollars to bring cash back
to the US a good portion of that is
going to taxes and it's going to be
investing the rest in domestic jobs
manufacturing data centers all in the
coming years so I'm not excusing Apple
taking advantage of the loopholes here
but I am saying that at least the
company is bringing some of that money
back to the US especially when they
don't have a legal obligation to do so
so Apple is far from perfect factory
conditions are still a concern iOS
hasn't really changed much over the
years
Siri is still way far behind the
competition as I tried to objectively
look at Apple I saw a company making
powerful products with mass appeal that
at least on the surface appears to have
a social conscience if you're filling
the rage inside you grow be sure to
check out the flipside its argument that
I mentioned at the beginning and what
company do you want to see dissected
next let us know in the comments down
below give the video a thumbs up we
appreciate it
until next time I'm John render</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
