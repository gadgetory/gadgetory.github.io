TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of one
of the first tablets to come from Nokia
this is the brand new Windows 8 RT
rockin Lumia 2520 let's go ahead open it
up see what it looks like
so here is the box for the Lumia 2520
picture the device on the front we've
got it in Verizon you can also pick it
up I believe for AT&amp;amp;T I have an email
here from Emma Roberts don't be jealous
she's pretty awesome on this season of
American Horror Story nothing else
really here in the box some specs but
we're gonna run through all of those I
wish they made this easy to open I mean
how do you open this box I can't I can't
seem to find a way to get it open
bad unboxing humor go ahead slide this
off and there we have what looks like a
gigantic Lumia device I guess that would
make sense considering it is a Lumia
device push it off this side for just a
quick second step we're going to have in
the box I'm guessing we got a charger
and some information and there is that
charger and that is a gigantic charger
see what ends it's got it is totally
proprietary so take that for what it's
worth you also have a sim removal tool
for getting to your LTE SIM card some
verizon books welcome to Windows and
that appears to be it but that is not
the reason you're here you are here for
this tablet so what are you looking at
you're looking at a screen protector
I'm gonna head and pull this off and
then I'll tell you what the screen is
satisfying whooshing noise you're
looking at a 10.1 inch screen surrounded
by a black bezel it is 1080 so it's 1920
by 1080 giving it a 218 PPI its Gorilla
Glass 2 so it should be pretty durable
Windows RT 8.1 on board here to point to
get Gertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chip
so pretty powerful 2 gigs of ram 32 gigs
of storage but there is an external
option living somewhere on here
also has NFC you've got cameras galore
you're not getting any sort of fancy
optics just a six point seven megapixel
autofocus is iceland's with f 1.9
aperture and a two megapixel wide-angle
lens I do like to make the Front's
wide-angle so I can take my best selfies
802 11 ABG nn8 thousand milliamp hour
battery in weighs six hundred and
fifteen grams comes in red white black
and cyan I like that we got the cherry
red one here because it matches our
other
red friend here the Lumia 1520 they look
like they just go together like you can
sort of SiC them together and they can
just be an extension he's you can get a
chance to see how tall the 2520 is let's
do a quick tour while I try and boot
this sucker on on the bottom you've got
it's looks like a connection for a doc
there is an external keyboard and kasich
is a full-coverage they can use it for I
assume it connects right there 3.5
millimeter headset jack right there
but look like a 3.5 millimeter headset
Jack's also that we're prior to
recharging point here is where your SIM
card external storage is going to live
volume up and down and power but looking
very lumia esque so these ports on the
sides actually USB 3.0 and micro HDMI so
here we are windows 8.1 modern UI and
I'm a real big fan that it took me a
while to get used to but once I did I
really started to enjoy it and things
move along very quickly as you'd expect
from a snapdragon 800 processor so i'll
take a quick look around if you're not
familiar with the UI you can swipe up
and see all of your applications i can
only install app from the windows App
Store here you can't install legacy
windows apps it worked on Vista or
Windows 7 or even XP or farther back so
go ahead and go home there are a lot of
apps that are available in the App Store
in case you guys you know are looking
for it I'll take a look here at some of
the settings you can see what we got
going on so we're gonna be able to
access your verizon settings as well if
you want to get to their LTI logic I've
connected to the Wi-Fi here at the
office you do kind of get a desktop now
if you want to go ahead and be like
either hit run the office documents or
slide up go to desktop and it looks like
a regular version of Windows except
again you cannot install legacy
applications but you do have access to
the desktop version of Internet Explorer
go ahead and close that up or these
attempts to close that up
you can still sort of view a file
explorer you can get around wherever you
want of the big deal here is that it
comes with a free copy of Microsoft
Office so outlook Word Excel PowerPoint
OneNote all will work and load up and
this isn't sort of a neutered
touchscreen version this is the full
version of Office just sort of ready for
you to use and it works very very well
I'm afraid of quicks they can plug an
external keyboard use a wireless
keyboard or pickup and Nokia's
keyboard cover
and be good to go the device feels
really really slim actually very
impressed with how thin and light
they're able to make this again winged
is six hundred and fifteen grams or
twenty one point six nine ounces it's
really light and incredibly thin so you
have no peer credit for doing a very
nice job with the design of this tablet
I really can I take a look at it to use
it put it through its paces again become
sort of able to appreciate the Windows 8
you WAIS hopefully it'll be an easy to
use and elegant experience like I hope
that it will be you have any questions
and things you want to know about it or
