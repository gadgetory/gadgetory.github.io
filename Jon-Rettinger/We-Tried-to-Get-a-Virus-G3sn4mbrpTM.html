sponsoring this video and just generally
helping us make TechnoBuffalo videos
possible so being gone for a week in
internet time is like being gone for
years I miss you to rewind while I was
out of the office but I'm back and I
watched it and it was very very
cringe-worthy
and kind of the Internet's all was
turned into sometimes cringe-worthy
videos we got tablets being bent we got
phones being bent so we got phones being
thrown off buildings all in the name of
testing but I'm not seeing a lot of
testing especially when it comes to the
destruction is a brand new laptop that
you just got maybe picked it up for the
holidays maybe mom and dad finally caved
and got you something new and shiny and
you want to be smart with it you want to
click links that you know we're gonna be
safe when you're incognito mode going to
sites that are approved it's a dangerous
world out there so to prove a point
about how easy it is to maybe infect
your computer I'm gonna do what my
parents sat me down before college and
told me not to do so I'm gonna try to
get some viruses we're gonna see if we
can clean up those viruses to try to
make your computer just a little bit
safer so the moral here is don't be a
John but let's learn how to protect our
bits Windows 10 has some built-in
antivirus it's called Windows Defender
and for most basic protection it's
pretty decent for this arguments though
I'm gonna turn it off I'm gonna go
completely unprotected
into into the Internet all right so the
first website we're gonna go to it
sounds very innocuous nothing bad is
gonna happen it's malware domain
list.com
so let's do that our websites on this
domain should be considered dangerous if
you do not know what you were doing here
it's recommended you leave right away
generally I don't know what I'm doing
but hasn't stopped me from leaving this
website is a resource for security
professionals and enthusiasts well I am
an enthusiast but not a professional so
I'm gonna click some links this one's
called Kings drove Viacom how in trojan
they must be USC fans
I need a virus please all right look
this link says I can download more ram
for my computer that's got to be legit
we just blur the screen and try some
like adults adult ii websites for the
name of science i'm gonna go ahead and
go to an in private window I'm not a kid
today you are out loud so I am learning
that there are singles near me that are
excited to meet me but it's not okay so
that got a little yacon graphic fast um
Microsoft spyware risk where detected
error number zero by eight zero zero
seven two EE seven your computer has
alerted us so they're saying we should
call for support should we should we
call for support I got a very alarming
message on my computer that I was
infected with a virus and I was gonna
get up to three years in jail and to try
to call this this number I don't I don't
want to go to jail that was probably
like overly dramatic I'm guessing you're
not gonna be that stupid with your
brand-new computer but you might go to
websites that you don't know aren't
trusted or you might download some links
from an uncle that maybe you shouldn't
be downloading and chances are with the
new computer you'll find yourself in
some sort of precarious situation with
stuff on it that really you know you
know what you did so BitDefender who
respond to this video has a solution to
not only protect you from yourself and
in silly link clicking but also to get
rid of some of the things that might
behind a computer Lilla some added
benefits like a full-blown VPN one of
the big things you'll say isn't they
called ransomware I actually got a
ransomware letter saying they were going
to tell my wife my horrible secret
unless I sent two hundred dollars in
Bitcoin to this wallet address this
stuff happens and it can be terrifying
if you don't know that much about
computers this has ransomware
perfections protect you from that
stuff so you're not in a weird position
where you gotta make me wonder did I did
I do something did somebody actually
record my webcam of me doing something
perhaps a little private this is going
to give you that next level of
protection but defenders been around
they offer best-in-class security
there's apps available or for Windows
Mac OS Android or iOS and you get one
account to kind of protect what matters
and I think most importantly if
something does happen sometimes doesn't
always happen at like 3:00 in the
afternoon they offer 24/7 support to
kind of help you figure out what you did
to your computer and get it undone it's
trusted by over 500 million users it'll
work on whatever platform it'll work on
Windows it'll work on Mac OS it'll work
on iOS and Android it's just another
layer of protection it's another layer
of peace of mind as you start going out
and computering so I think you can
extend the life of your computer if
you're smart with it and you're smart
what you do something like BitDefender
can help you get there and protect you
from yourself and keep your bits safe we
defended so if this sounds like
something that you want to try but
defenders giving away six months free
trial so hit the link down below trying
to get a shot six months free all right
so we just wrecked that Lenovo didn't
even see it coming but we've got a very
nice virus free
razor blade stealth here that has
BitDefender installed we've got it up
it's telling us we're out we're safe but
I feel like we should test it and go to
the same sites that we just went to that
completely destroyed our poor Lenovo all
right so let's see what happens this
websites been reported as unsafe
infected webpage detected another one
websites been reported as unsafe let's
check BitDefender records one minute ago
good job BitDefender all right so if you
take anything away from this like yes it
wasn't add and we thank bit defender for
sponsoring this video but think of it
defender like a seatbelt you probably
don't need it while you're out there
driving very willing to risk going for a
ride without it on it's kind of the same
thing here you'll probably be fine on
the internet without protecting your
computer but that one time to get in the
accident you're gonna be really happy
you've got that seatbelt and you'll be
really happy you've got fit defender
installed
it's not a lot of money keep your
computer safe keeps your investments say
if it keeps your parents from finding
out what's going on on your computer
keeps whatever you're doing to yourself
which which I can personally attest to
is a pretty solid thing to have so it's
one bit of software it's easy to install
you get a VPN it's trusted 24/7 support
wear your seat belt
try BitDefender Happy Holidays stay safe
out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
