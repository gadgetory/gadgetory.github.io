TechnoBuffalo here there's a lot to like
about the Nexus One whether you want to
talk about its processor speeds gorgeous
screen you know the fact that it's
running the newest version of Android
2.1 you can really take your pick
however one of the knocks on the Nexus
One is that it's lacking a full physical
QWERTY keyboard well it does have I
think my fantastic virtual keyboard it
also has another trick up its sleeve
that almost makes a physical keyboard
obsolete let me show you what I'm
talking about Android 2.1 currently the
Nexus One is the only phone that
shipping with this has a brand-new
speech-to-text feature and those of you
that aren't familiar with that
essentially what it means is you talk to
the phone and take your words and puts
it into text and the Nexus One actually
does it surprisingly accurately I
remember having to use Dragon
NaturallySpeaking
years ago and it didn't work nearly as
well as that and that was certainly a
desktop experience so I'm very impressed
in certainly the future for
speech-to-text is really good but enough
about me yapping about it let me show
you how it works let me unlock the phone
and you can use this in any text entry
fields whether it's a text message or an
email anything will work so we'll go
ahead and hit messages type to compose
and on the keyboard there's a microphone
icon and when you tap that same thing
you start talking so I'm gonna pull the
phone up it's a little bit more accurate
when I hold it up to my mouth instead of
talking to it when it's on a flat table
like this so I'll give you a test as to
how well it works go ahead and hit the
microphone this is a test of voice
recognition on the Google Nexus One
period so start interpreting the text
this is a test of voice recognition on
the Google Nexus One and to put a period
there you can actually say whatever
punctuation you want and it saw that it
works really accurately their cover when
you text certainly you're not going to
always use this form of language what if
you want to put in a smiley face for
example let's see how well that works on
here go ahead hit space and let's just
say smiley face or where are you smiley
face
where are you question mark smiley face
now it sounds super silly to say that
things out loud but that's why people
talk where are you question mark smiley
face and it put it all in there and it
did a very very good job this is a
fantastic tool if you're used to a
physical keyboard or you do a lot of
typing and long emails I know I type a
ton of messages out and I might not want
to use the QWERTY keyboard that comes on
the Nexus One but it is quite good and
has a landscape version as well
but for long emails it's a great thing
to do it's really you may have to go
back and do a bit of editing but for the
most part it's really accurate quick and
simple just a short tip for all of you
