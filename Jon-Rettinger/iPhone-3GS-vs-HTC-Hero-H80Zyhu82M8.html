TechnoBuffalo here the HTC Hero has been
out for a little over a week now and its
main competitor at least in all major
markets is the iPhone 3GS so I got an
only fair to give you a head-to-head
comparison of the iPhone versus the HTC
Hero this is just part one that's going
to cover browser and keyboard input
let's go ahead and get started
also I want to mention one more time
this is the 3GS and this of course is
the HTC Hero that does not have us 3G
bands so these tests are going to be
conducted on Wi-Fi using the same Wi-Fi
network we could do a test over edge
beads but edge speeds are going to vary
depending on where you're at Wi-Fi sort
of levels the playing field let's go
ahead and get started gonna go ahead and
open up each browser so they're Safari
this is gonna load HTC's website so the
comparison site that we're going to use
is TechnoBuffalo comm and i'm gonna go
ahead and put that right now and we'll
start the loading process okay so we've
got a queued up and ready to go on both
devices here and this is just gonna
measure the speed again over the same
Wi-Fi network how quickly it loads a
standard website so I'm gonna go ahead
and try and hit go at the same time here
at least as close as I can get much more
difficult than it looks there we go and
they are both off the iPhone 3GS does
have a little faster processor and it's
already loaded the site and the hero
just finished so a little bit behind the
iPhone definitely was a clear winner
there so let's check at how smooth
navigation and scrolling is with the
iPhone scrolling is very smooth I can
scroll down to the bottom pretty quickly
and I don't get any sort of pixelation
letting me know that it's loading it's
very instantaneous and it looks very
smooth it's physics engine goes nice and
easily with my finger I want to get to
the top does little bounce and let's see
how it looks on the HTC Hero on the
iPhone you'll notice that it's actually
scaled to have the whole
I fit in on the iron the iPhone and
scale to have the whole site fit in on
the HTC Hero it's sort of zoomed in on
the upper left-hand corner let's see how
it looks with scrolling scrolling is
still pretty smooth
no pixelation either you don't get the
same sort of balancing on the physics
engine but it does work and it works
quite well you we're gonna call this one
a draw I get the feeling that both do
very quick and relatively painless job
at navigating around
so both these devices do have
multi-touch so let's check out how that
multi-touch works on the iPhone of
course the famous two fingers so this is
the TechnoBuffalo beta site that
actually all our beta testers are seeing
so you can get sort of a sneak preview
take two fingers can zoom in
so I'll smooth that wasn't it kind of
clears up the text and you can see
here's a note to our beta testers go
ahead and zoom out zoom in zoom in zoom
out see it's very quick and we can do a
double tap to zoom in double tap to zoom
out now the HTC hero claims to have the
same features let's put that to a test
and see how they work we're gonna use
the same two fingers and we will zoom in
and zoom out the mountain though that's
the same part here that were using
before there's some text zoom in zoom
out zoom in and zoom out takes a little
bit longer it's not as fluid but it
definitely works and really works quite
well the double tap that I showed you
earlier
double tap in double tap out so that
definitely works and it works actually
probably one of the better
implementations that I've seen so one of
the cool things about the HTC Hero
browser the iPhone doesn't have is flash
so let me show you what it looks like if
you want to play a YouTube video and
you're on a website it's got a youtube
video so here's a video that we embedded
here of let's say the irobot roomba
unboxing from a while back I'm gonna go
ahead play and that's gonna launch the
Apple YouTube player that plays in a
separate window gives it a second to
load up and it should start playing
there it goes
so there's a room button boxing you had
done and you go back to the website so
this has flash capability so I should be
able to just hit play and I would assume
that it would play right within this
window so I use that multi-touch feature
and zoom in and you get the same play
button that you would get right on your
main computer hit play and it opens up a
YouTube viewer just as it did on the
iPhone which is a little bit strange
though expected to play it right in the
window
there's loading a video that Brandon did
on Pocket now so get hit stop well hit
the back button will go right back to
the website so that was interesting one
thing that I was quite excited about
with having the Flash capabilities I
thought hey maybe I could check out Hulu
when I'm on my device well who who does
not work but I'm going to show you that
I'm actually gonna load the Hulu web
page to do another speed comparison
alright so you've got hulu.com queued up
and ready to go on each I will hit go at
the same time and we'll see how the
ships up our items like actually got it
at the same time the iPhone showing
first progress and again the iPhone is
done and the hero is still lagging
behind quite a little bit and I should
say that these speeds are actually
pretty representative of my own
comparison tests that I've done the web
browser and speed on the hero is quick
not quite as quick as it is on the
iPhone that may be due to a relatively
anemic 500 megahertz icon the 28
megahertz processor found on the hero
and not to say that's not fast but with
the Sense UI that's on the hero
it is very processor intensive so both
are done and you can see again this
formats it as you would see on a regular
web page but of course you can't play
any content let's see what we can do on
the hero now you should be able just to
play videos right from here but
unfortunately you can't just zoomed in
and I was a little bit disappointed I
thought it would have been a great
feature to be able to play videos so you
make your own comparisons if I
to declare a winner of the browser wars
here of the iphone 3gs versus a hero I
do have to give it to the iPhone to give
you a full disclosure I am an iPhone
user so perhaps I'm just more used to
the iPhone but the fluidity and the
speed really make me tend and trend
towards apples offering that's not to
say that the browser on the hero is bad
it's actually very full-featured and
quite robust and I think you would be
very happy with it I equate it to if you
go to a television store looking at two
TVs right next to each other you might
notice that one's a little bit brighter
in the pictures a little bit crisper
than the one next to it but if you take
the lesser of those TVs home you put it
up on your wall it's gonna look
fantastic and you'll never know and then
remember how compared to that one TV
stay next to it so let's go ahead and
move on to the next phase of our
competition the keyboards so here are
the two port your keyboards found on the
devices certainly in the iPhone people
may be familiar with and the keyboard
that is found on the HTC Hero this is
not the keyboard that you find on other
Android devices running the donut build
like the g1 or even the mytouch 3G this
is more of a touch flow ish HTC keyboard
and might look familiar if you've used
touchflo up on any windows mobile
devices its spaced in between on the
iPhone it's not spaced on the HTC here
that's more of a preference the iPhone
does not offer haptic feedback meaning a
little bit of vibration when you touch
the key but it is on the HTC Hero
actually I think the haptic feedback is
quite nice so when you type put your
finger over a letter and you'll see that
letter pops up on the iPhone you do it
on the HTC Hero and you get that same
option it pops up I think it makes
typing a lot easier to know what you're
typing both keyboards are actually very
forgiving if you're sort of hitting in
the middle you generally get the key
you're looking for so I've actually been
quite happy so let's go ahead and do a
speed test and again full disclosure I
am an iPhone user so I'm probably more
familiar with the keyboard on the iPhone
so I want you to know that four hand
before I get it to do my own typing
let's go ahead and type a message push
that off to the side for a minute
well type hi I'm recording a video and
I'll try and do this as fast as I can
so hi I am them's a little bit of
mistake there you saw some auto crack
but it is quick and it is I think
relatively easy to use and maybe just
because I'm familiar with it so we'll
move the iPhone off to the side and
we'll try it on the hero no recipients
that's okay
let's go ahead and start typing
so hi I'm recording a video they
actually got it right I think I
massacred the spelling but the
autocorrect that you may have seen
stepped up so what we're talking about
auto auto cracks let me show you how
that works on both devices so let's say
I am typing away on my iPhone I mean to
spell the word every so Evie and I don't
hit the e I ate the w ry circo's it
tells me that I've gotten to spell the
word and if I want to accept it I just
hit space and it'll change it and if I
want to keep the misspelling because
maybe it's an abbreviation or something
I just tap that little X and that's how
it works on the iPhone so how does it
work on a hero let me show you I'll do
the same mistake here you'll see that as
I type it starts to fill in the word and
if I want to just keep typing I can and
it automatically auto corrected if I
don't want to use the word that's
autocorrect and I've actually hit the
one next to it so that's what it uses in
place of the X the autocorrect feature
and sort of the word filling in as
you're typing on the HTC Hero is
actually quite good and I was very
impressed with it so one of the things
that both of these offer in addition to
these portrait keyboards is a more roomy
landscape keyboard so let me show you
what both of those look like in addition
I'm going to show you the screen
rotation time I know that's a software
feature if it also can compare maybe the
hardware speed and the responsiveness of
the accelerometer on each device so let
me show you that first on the iPhone go
ahead and give it a turn it takes a
second and there you get your landscape
keyboard on the hero screen goes gray a
little bit and then it will rotate so we
can pull back a little bit and do both
of those at the same time let's see if
we can see the speed that these rotating
so looks like to here with a little bit
faster there let's try it one more time
the other way and the iPhone was a
little bit faster there so really just
you're gonna depend on your usage
landscape keyboard it's sort of the same
keyboard that you're you
- on most non physical QWERTY devices
and it follows the same rules that I
talked about earlier very easy to type
on quite easy to use if you want to type
number symbol there's a number and
symbol button that will pull that up
same thing on the iPhone so many guys
hope you enjoyed the overview and really
the first comparison of the iPhone 3GS
versus the HTC Hero a bit very
impressive the hero for more iPhone
versus hero comparison these be sure to
stick around to the channel this is
going to be plenty more covering UI and
a lot of other features so for exclusive
