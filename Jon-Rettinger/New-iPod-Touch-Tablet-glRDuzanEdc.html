technobuffalo here yesterday august 31st
Apple sent out press invitations for
their it's all rock and roll press event
scheduled for September 9th really to
the surprise of no one so what I want to
do now is leaving my predictions for
what I expect Apple is going to announce
at this conference well the first thing
if you look at the invitation they sent
out closely you'll see the headset that
the old dancers use it is plucking on
the bottom definitely leading me to
believe the dobie ipod touches rumors of
a refreshed ipod touch and going around
for months now here's what I think you
can expect with relative certainty a
camera on the back so for taking
pictures and videos probably similar
functionality you have on the iphone
I'll also expect the ipod touch to have
a built-in microphone for voice over IP
calls so for those you that are big
skype or frame whatever client you use
and ipod touch is going to be a great
alternative almost 2 and iPhone as long
as you have a Wi-Fi connection something
to keep in mind i've also heard some
rumors that we may see a refined UI for
the ipod touch oh I'm glad to believe
that will first see this new UI on the
iPhones next release I also expect the
ipod classic and ipod nano to get
cameras as well the ipod nano more
certainly the classic is possibly a
little bit far-fetched also a refreshed
ipod user interface on the nano in the
classic despite what people are saying i
don't believe that either of those lines
are going to be killed especially the
classic I think classic is actually
finally going to go solid state as well
seeing as 64 120 gig solid state drives
have dropped in price so I'll look for
that to happen as well I think we're
also finally going to see the release of
the beatles catalog on iTunes which will
be quite quite nice and speaking of
itunes i think we're actually going to
see an update to itunes they've been
rumors of this sort of box art cocktail
has been going around i think that's
what's that's going to entail is sort of
more detail when you buy and when you
buy songs from itunes so you buy a song
or album you're going to get the cover
art obviously we're also i think it's
sort of a digital booklet like used to
get with the CD or if you bought a
record of the day or tape invalid
information sort of put in that I think
we're going to see more of that as well
also i'm expecting itunes has some sort
of social networking integration i would
expect a facebook twitter and things
like that to have a relative degree of
social integration definitely look for
that as well also there have been rumors
of an apple tablet circling around for
actually creating iphone rumors so for
good four or five years I do not think
we're going to see this tablet its
mythical tablet at this press conference
I would expect that's going to be held
at some special event probably some time
next year I don't think the iphone is
even going to be mentioned I don't think
we're going to see any computer or
really other hardware refresh is and
he's going to focus really just on the
ipod also i expect Steve Jobs to be
there I think he's going to be the one
that's going to be given the keynote at
this thing I think that Phil shoulder
and the rest will definitely be
presenting I think that Steve Jobs will
definitely returning and will be back on
stage so guys what do you think are you
holding off on by an ipod touch you
excited that new ipod touch did i miss a
feature that you'd love it to have you
know what are you going to sing leave a
text or video response and love to hear
from you for exclusive content to be
sure to check me out on twitter
twitter.com / john for lakers and to
learn more about technobuffalo check out

bye bye
thinking about you today we're going to
see

I'll be dangerous if your hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
