TechnoBuffalo we're here at CES 2015 and
I'm super excited to be with 50 cent I'm
chilling I'm chilling with pretty boys
and all that we hate baby he's doing it
big see yes 2015 is going down as my
Fulp CES first when I was here with just
a rendering second one I was here I made
a little bit of money
third when I came back with time I'm
back now - I feel good and I'm here to
interview see me show you see if I show
you my back teeth my molar if we talk
about the checks the other says mean
things are going in the right direction
baby but it's just just good times man
little piece of a little piece for you
you might enjoy knowing this actually
the first song when I first started
getting your music the first song I ever
bought on iTunes was actually candy shop
see that no joke seriously I told you
told them that that is 100% the truth
crazy for me to be here it's like it's
it's awesome and all come like full
circle it's cool and look it relates to
why we get right to music right you know
it's my passion for it and that's what
SMS is about studio master cell it's the
process for artists you know like when
creatively you come up with a good idea
and you listen to you like yo you
excited about the idea feels good the
music's there and after you know you
have the great idea there's a process of
making the sound right right the
fine-tuning process you're mixing it and
you're go to and be critical of
something that you was already extremely
excited about him because you wanted to
be perfect when the public hears it and
if they're listening to it on things
they can't offer the sounds quality they
never get a chance to have the true I
heard you had Timbaland come on as an
investor correct how is his influence as
one of the great producers of all time
how is that influenced the way the
headphone sound that's what he does he
helps with the signature sound on each
one of the actual headsets because with
the cup size that you know it changes
mm-hmm actually sound and sometimes may
have the same type of driver in it
product but it has to be tuned
differently to each one of the cups
um what what was kind of the inspiration
behind the Star Wars headphones like why
Star Wars Star Wars initially when the
idea came up I was like yeah like I'm
like it was like I was like I really
want to do start with that we can go I
could get Kobe right Kobe you want to do
okay and then it was like it made a lot
of sense like after we finally buckle
down and we came with last year what our
projections were for the first quarter
we saw the two days and I don't know I
thought like the people who fell in love
with Star Wars right they don't lose any
steam any a lot they wanted things in
connection to the release of the actual
phone right to keep it from others for
collective's purposes uh-huh but they'll
get those things and they know that
they're gonna go to a while value later
as a fan of Lucas Films I would like to
know what's that process like like how
are you guys balancing back and forth
creatively who has how much say in the
headphones it's not an easy process to
get the license from okay because they
only wanna be associated with high
quality products with names so it was it
was easy for us because we had a
relationship already built and with
Disney but what SMS were creating all
the Disney's product in the future
whether it's in the Disney World
Reverend parks or love you see em and
you know doorman amenities is Foster
actually because they do such diligence
to check third they're really good at
what they do and every they're really
good at what they do know they didn't
work overseas on the ground to see if
everything was right lucasfilm's will
come and we're going into this and it's
cool it's the second generation of it
right here you see the details r2d2 type
what's change from the first generation
of the second generation you see now
that there's a lot more texture change
and these in the new ones that came and
buttons and things that stick out so
it's cool I mean I think all everybody
is extremely passionate about it I'll
start to collect you know it's the thing
like the these will be out made the film
doesn't come to December right so we you
still haven't even seen the momentum
that builds our editor Shana he's a huge
Star Wars fan so I'm sure he'll be he'll
be trying to get a pair and maybe like
we might have surprised me let me get
those and put those over here you know
we touch those later is that fun of
choice immediately say you said the
editor gave him the Star Wars do you own
a computer right I don't know what music
you listen to those so I'm not making
any promises I don't know I'm not sure
what he's into but um worth see yes so
what has been the craziest or most
amazing or your favorite thing you've
seen other than your favorite so I like
cars that can drive themselves that's
amazing right Mercedes
yeah that's crazy that's awesome I want
it now like I don't want I don't want to
wait for the concept car I want it now I
wanna drive it out yeah or not drive it
out yeah I'm in the concept you just
sold me on the concept now I should be
able to buy it like it was really
expensive especially people yeah she'd
be over the bottom so okay so what tech
you can buy other again other than the
headphones what is your kind of go-to
piece of tech something that you can't
live without something you can't leave
the house without well my telephone what
do you have I Oh s or Android I had a
Android for awhile
samsung and then now I got the moves
just six okay there you go
there we go good choice good choice
what's up this is 50 cent thank you for
