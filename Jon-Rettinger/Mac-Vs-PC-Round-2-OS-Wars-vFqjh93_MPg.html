systems will go head-to-head to see who
has the greatest ability to be
customized in terms of hardware
interface and software but before we
begin a quick story Samara was guys it
was about a year ago and decided I
needed a new computer for my workshop
now I really wanted a small form factor
and because I had some allege 10
specific software Warren to run I want
to be a mac right so in that case what
does that mean mac mini but you know I
didn't need an optical drive I didn't
need a firewire and didn't care what it
look like since it was just going to
basically a garage so you know the mini
would have been a complete waste of
money for me so what does that mean well
time to hackintosh right now I built
hackintosh just before but when I did
before I kind of you know you go on the
forums you find the parts that work best
turn to a hackintosh and you make it
happen I found it a lot more difficult
starting with specific requirements that
wanted for this machine like you know
for example I want him a mini-itx pork
so I wanted that small form-factor
building components on top of that and
then making sure that they could
actually work with OS 10 now it turned
out to be a lot more difficult than I
thought and not even worth it so what
ended up doing was just buying a net top
that ran windows and then finding an
alternate version of the software that i
was using that would do the same thing
and work with windows so i think that's
a problem that a lot of people run into
up there it's not that they happen to
love windows and hit OS 10 it's that
windows is really their only option for
the specific needs they have for their
computer I know this is an obvious point
guys but I really want to hammer this
one home so let's do a quick search for
a windows pc here on amazon you see I
get over 2,000 results pcs of all shapes
and sizes you can possibly want running
windows let's go ahead and do the same
thing but with Macintosh 42 results and
that includes
really old models this really
illustrates one of the biggest problems
people have with OS 10 and that it's
nearly impossible to get it on the exact
type of machine that you want even if
you're willing to go the hackintosh
route you never have this problem with
windows of course customizing is not
just about hardware it's also about
interface and ever since the earliest
days of guis people have liked to tweet
the systems to meet their personality
when those wins in this as well for
example look at this setup i have here i
use a program called rainmeter to
actually customize my interface to match
that of the new windows phone which
improves my productivity and looks
really cool there's no way to do
something like this with OS 10 overlay
skins on top of it in what Stan you can
tweak things in terminal or use software
such as geektool to customize it but it
doesn't even come close to what you can
do with Windows we haven't even gotten
into making changes to the underlying
system but I don't think we need to this
is an obvious dominating win for Windows
this win for Windows however does come
at a price and that's something we'll
talk about in a future round of our OS
battle here on TechnoBuffalo one last
thing before I go your question to
answer in the comments this week is that
do you feel Apple should license OS 10
to other computer makers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
