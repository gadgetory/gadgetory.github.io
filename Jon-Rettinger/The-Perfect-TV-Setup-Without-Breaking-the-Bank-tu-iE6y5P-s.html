can be fun but also nerve-racking
because a lot of the products out there
can totally break your bank so I wanted
to show you guys what the perfect home
TV setup would be we're giving you five
products that are all under two hundred
dollars and I'm gonna assume you already
have a TV so I'm not gonna give you a
huge thousands of dollars recommendation
there this is what's gonna make your TV
and your setup in your apartment or home
really close to perfect so let's start
it the biggest component you need with
your home TV setups a streaming device
I've been using the Roku ultra for the
better part of five month and I loved it
so much I bought two of them they're
generally on sale off between 89 or 99
bucks so under $100 and it does
absolutely everything I had a big
concern living from an Apple TV but the
movies anywhere app picked up all of my
movies from iTunes and lets me watch
them on the Roku ultra it's got 4k
capabilities of course it's a full on
chromecast the remote control is
probably of my favorite parts of it it
feels really good in the hands but it's
got a 3.5 millimeter headset jack you
plug in a pair of headphones for quiet
listening you plug it in at night it for
somebody partner someone sleeping and
you can still watch your TV while
listening to your audio because rope
doesn't have their own app store it
works with everything out there it's got
voice search built in it is the best
most complete streaming system I could
possibly imagine
so next product is all about the audio
to get the best audio it's usually goes
beyond just plugging in speakers or
setting up surround sound you want
something that's gonna give you the full
breadth of audio and the after master
Pro brings out depth in audio that you
didn't know was there I know this might
sound although infomercial II we tried
at the office and it works incredibly
well it's not just a compressor it's
gonna bring up dialogue levels you're
gonna be able to hear things in the
background you couldn't hear before we
tested it with Superman for example in
the scene where Clark Kent's talking to
his father before we plug this in we
couldn't hear crickets in the background
once we plugged it in you could hear the
depth of the audio in the background so
don't think of it as like just a
compressor it's actually got proprietary
tech that was really developed for the
music industry it's got the first
breakthrough audio tech that can master
and remaster audio to professional
standards in real time the DSP chip
inside is gonna remaster audio with zero
this is on those products that you have
to actually hear to believe and it does
work together advertised which is kind
of rare nowadays so we'll link to it
down below in case you want to learn a
little bit more and a special thank you
to after master pro for sponsoring this
video
so the third device is a perfect pairing
with the after master pro it is the
vizio 3.0 channel sound bar it's about a
hundred and fifty bucks we actually
found it for a hundred dollars from Best
Buy it was an open box and it works
absolutely perfectly so it's got Wi-Fi
of course built in there's also an
Ethernet jack and it's got chromecast
capabilities so I can chromecast to it
bluetooth in there it's got multi room
capabilities it makes for a really nice
sound for a really small price and again
when you pair it with the sound quality
you get from the after Master Pro it
makes for almost a perfect sound
experience you know for a very
relatively low price and the fourth one
is a streaming TV service and I have
tested every single one of them and I am
recommending YouTube TV I got it when it
was thirty five bucks it's now $40 it's
missing some channels I wish I'd had the
Scripps Network things like HG TV are
not here but what it does have is really
awesome you've got unlimited cloud DVR
you've got an incredible UI it's easy to
use and perhaps the best part is you can
share it with five different people not
just let them see what you have they get
their own unique wall to log in if you
want to pick one streaming TV option
that's gonna give you good channels
leased with local channels and a really
incredible price and the best UI YouTube
TV is absolutely awesome plus you get
access to the YouTube bread shows for
free and last but not least the life XZ
LED strip the bedrooms at the only place
just be spicing things up you can splice
up your TV experience with this LED
strip it looks awesome first of all but
it's gonna create depth between the TV
and the wall behind you it almost makes
a picture seem like it's popping a
little bit more because it's lifx of
course it's Wi-Fi you control it via an
app if you have a smart home assistant
you control it with your voice and put
whatever colors you want depending on
the mood or what kind of atmosphere
you're trying to set up at home it's not
necessary but it's really nice it's
about a hundred bucks I think is a
pretty cool vibe
so if you guys enjoyed we had a lot of
fun searching for the five most
reasonably priced products that we're
going to really up your game hope you
guys enjoyed if you want to see more
videos like this where we sort of give
you low price options for really high
quality products to be the video a
thumbs up to let us know the next time
