comment on Twitter and asking my
followers would they like to see a video
on and I received an overwhelming number
responses asking for applications in the
iphone so i'm going to show you guys
what i have on my iphone i did one of
these little while back but it's
certainly I'm download it's a new app
since then so let's go ahead and get
started go ahead and unlock the phone
slide to unlock here is my home screen
it's kind of very simple i moved my
messages icon down to the bottom right
my ipod up to the top all these here are
standard except for twitterrific which i
use as my default twitter client MLB at
bat which is a MLB application lets you
track all your teams on my big angels
fan so actually you can get live audio
from games you can get game highlight
video and once three point 0 becomes
official I think you'll be able to get
streaming video which should be really
cool some very excited about that if
you're a baseball fan it's a must-have
so go ahead and keep going here I'm not
going to show you anything there it's
not that exciting bloomberg app for
tracking some of my stocks skype is must
have i did a review on it about a week
or so ago allows you to make calls over
IP and actually with the three-point o
software you can actually make calls
over 3g but i soon i'll be fixed once
three point 0 becomes official 12c light
it is a financial calculator very boring
but i didn't need it it's the dollar
application so it's nice to have go
ahead and move that back hey i am I
don't use that very often here anonymous
that is just an alternative web browser
that i was using just for demo purposes
oh what that looks like for a
little while app will allow some
alternative browsers they still are some
few up there essentially it's just a
different version of Safari it's very
pared down it's very simple nothing
really that robust doesn't work all that
while I they're just fooling around them
and that's a free download bubble blast
is a game dealer no deal dial 0 is a
free application that is actually very
cool i'm sure you've called any company
let's say you call AT&amp;amp;T or you're
calling fries and you're calling
over your carrier's even calling apple
you have to go through a line of
automated messages you know thank you
for calling your call is important to us
press 1 for specimen service press 2 and
all that stuff I hate going through that
I'm sure you do too what dial zero it is
it tells you what prompts apush actually
get to a real person for a myriad of
company is actually very cool so accuse
up online here and really type a name
the company you want any of them here so
here are some of the A's let's say I
want to call air canada and i've got a
lot of canadian folks that watch the
videos to go ahead and hit it to get a
live person there's a number you call
press one at the prompt to then zero at
that prompt press 0 and at that one
press 0 again seeing blast right through
it really get a person you know have to
stay on hold listen to the information
for that long it actually is a really
really cool applications give that a
download epocrates is a online
physicians tool I have some friends who
are doctors and they wanted to play
around put on the iphone so i let them
this right here is voice memos this is
part of the three-point o software and
this will come as a standard application
just like itunes and calendar on any of
the three point of phones essentially
it's just an inline recorder so as I'm
talking you can see that little bar
right there move I'll get closer to it
you see it move a little bit more go
ahead record and it just records you
talking that's it nice and easy a little
red line across the top but you know
it's recording hit the button when
you're done it stops and it keeps all
your files in a hierarchy actually very
cool did I hit that right there pitstop
brother there we go and you're done
recording go ahead and play it back or
whatever you choose simple application
put is very handy facebook its facebook
integration on your iPhone iTunes I
don't download much music on the go here
that's why it's on my second page but
there's iTunes fieldrunners is a very
cool application it's a couple bucks
it's a simple tower defense game but
game I play all the time so let me show
you what that looks like real facts
since I can become rather addicted to
the game when I did a video on
defense a lot of you recommended this
game here so I decided to give it a
download based on your recommendation so
I'll show you what it looks like by
subatomic studios thanks a couple
minutes to boot up here got some music
playing hit play we'll start a new game
can pick your level start essentially
these little army guys kind of run
across the screen and you get a put-up
towers to stop them and the guys get
bigger they get stronger different
things pop up and you get different kind
of towers you can build so i'll show you
real quickly i'll put a couple towers
here i'll do the first level just you
guys can see what it looks like alright
so little guys you're gonna see them run
across screen essentially they're trying
to get from here to there and you gotta
stop them no matter what guns are
killing them that's it guys the very
simple premise of the game it's a lot of
fun I really enjoy it that's called
fieldrunners so I got Frogger it's a
iphone adaptation of the classic arcade
game I've got urbanspoon is very cool so
urbanspoon when it does if you mean
every been out with some friends and you
say we're out with a girlfriend get
decide where you want to go for dinner
this takes decision out of it for you
did I to use your current location you
can hit yes so you can pick your city
and essentially you give the thing a
shake and I save a kind of restaurant to
go to to pick your city so we'll use
Irvine California what kind of cuisine
you like I'm failing to go for mexican
food so i will lock it and for price i'd
say i'm open on price pick up the phone
give it a shake and a pic restaurant for
you Javier's cantina and grilled
actually been there it's delicious you
can get more information on Javier's and
there you go call it read reviews gives
you recommendations it's just an awesome
application it's a lot of fun i can be
very indecisive about dinner so good to
have google this just just a voice
search i did a video on this while back
it talked into it you say what you
wanted to search and will search for you
that's all it's kind of some simple
animations there
on my next screen flight control this is
a game that a few of my friends are
really addicted to and it we got that
into it very much but I'll show you what
it is real quickly so essentially what
you do all these planes and helicopters
are flying you guys steer them into the
landing pad so we'll turn sounds off
will it play so I'll zoom in here just a
little bit there we go you know see like
these planes here at common you gotta
steer it cocktail landing pad and it
seems pretty easy we get a lot of planes
coming at once and you steer it right
onto the landing bed you control their
flight pattern moving around as you want
to go and more planes start coming and
you got to steer all those onto the
landing pad a lot of planes a lot of
landing pads you also get helicopters
that come too it's a really hard game my
high score is only 17 but I got friends
have gotten up to three hundreds or 140
really very impressive go ahead and zoom
out of here a little bit we've got Texas
Hold'em it's actually one of the first
games an apple released when they first
launched the App Store just a texas
hold'em game I'm munchies it's a
ridiculous popcorn game i'll show you
what it looks like here not even a game
actually he gets the updated a little
bit so you get some tutorials here let's
write up coughs popcorn it looks like
real popcorn we should smell like real
popcorn go for some popcorn fact I might
make some of this video's over so when
it does you tap the screen and you can
show your friends you're digging your
finger around in there pull some out
dump it all out I had it on an angle and
that's it just kind of a simple trick
with your iphone can impress your
friends with your popcorn app until I
showed my friends they were not that
impressed so I've got the kindle app
that is a i consider companion to the
kindle e-book reader i can keep up where
I am on some of my newspapers and books
on here although reading locks amount of
text on the iphone little screening on
the eyes it's a small screen i don't
recommend it but it is definitely nice
compared
to the kindle monkey ball was one of the
first games it really came out for the
iphone to when it was launched was one
of the ones that Apple highlighted when
they were demonstrating the App Store
and you got a little ball with a monkey
in it and you steered around and he get
two goals net chair was an app that was
released in the app store for probably
three minutes almost a year ago lets you
essentially tethered this as a modem
which is very handy now playing gives
you movie times sodoku sodoku this is
ocarina by smule i demoed that in a
previous video lets you blow into the
microphone and play instrument it's
actually really cool those guys that
small have a lot of really neat apps
