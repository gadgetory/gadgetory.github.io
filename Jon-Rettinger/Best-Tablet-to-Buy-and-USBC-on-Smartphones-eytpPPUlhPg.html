episode of ask the Buffalo well not
physically a buffalo it's my spirit
animal I'm Yours John Ranchers the show
where I answer any question you've got a
little technology whether it's what
phone to get what tablet to get don't
know what's coming next or sometimes you
know I'm grossly not qualified
you're disgusting medical questions
first question comes from Matt hit 27
who asks at the John Ford Lakers what
tablets you recommend I use an s6 edge
and surface pro 3 OS doesn't matter
around 8 inches preferred hashtag asked
a buffalo surface is always one of my
go-to tablets you get super great combo
media consumption and media creation I'm
currently using a nexus 9 as my go-to
tablet I'll be using it for probably
about four months now and I love it I
like even get it at discounted price I
say go Nexus 9 I think you will really
really enjoy it some light screen
bleeding the corners be aware of that I
love the front-facing speakers battery
life not overly awesome but is better
now that 5.1.1 is hit and it's finally
hit I just got it last week so go for
the Nexus 9 and go for and either silver
or gold our next question comes from
either Conor Godot or Conor goddess
depending on on where you live so I'll
be sensitive and I'll just pronounced in
both ways what do you think we could
expect USBC as a new standard for
charging on Android we're already
starting to see it on some sort of
Fringe smaller phones and the choice
manufacturer doing it I would expect
that us to see it start to filter out in
the next generation flagships so the
phones that are gonna come out in 2016
galaxy s7 for example HTC One m9 like I
wouldn't be surprised also with maybe BC
Apple do the same thing it appears like
Apple was moving away from Thunderbolt
as a standard in favor of USB C so I
would put this in like a remote category
but perhaps lightning also might go away
and replace with USB C but I know Apple
makes between like a butt ton and an
asked ton of money licensing lightning
cables lightning cable accessories so
it's unlikely but certainly be awesome
but long-winded answer probably next
year
and speaking of USB C and I picked this
question because I really love your
handle at Lakers 5 9 7 4 ass at John 4
Lakers will we see USB see the new iPad
pro iPad pro is sort of the made-up name
that work
following a larger screen type a
presumably about 12 inches the mock-ups
that we see in some leek shops are
probably just made in someone's computer
in Photoshop you show both lightning and
USB seaports one on the bottom one on
the side it makes sense for a larger
perhaps dockable device so I will say
yes we'll see it on the iPad pro but at
this point it's like saying hey will the
unicorn be purple I mean I haven't seen
unicorns far that doesn't exist but yeah
it exists it could be purple so yeah it
could have a USB C port it could have a
USB CQ port that Apple just makes up I
don't know for sure but if I was a
betting man and I've been known to place
a wager - yes the larger iPad will have
USB see thank you guys for watching hope
you enjoy we love making this video so
please keep asking questions I'll please
give video a thumbs up to us appreciate
it it's a big subscribe button if you
don't mind seeing more of my shiny face
on your YouTube subscription box so next
time John rende here from TechnoBuffalo
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
