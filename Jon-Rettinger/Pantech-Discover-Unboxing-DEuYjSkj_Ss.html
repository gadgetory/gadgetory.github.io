device in while we were in Las Vegas
it's unboxing time friends yeah it's a
quick and dirty video but we just got
back from Las Vegas how's it going guys
I'm Aaron Baker from TechnoBuffalo and
this is the pantech discover so the
pantech discovers 4999 packing some
pretty killer specifications all around
it's got a dual-core processor a four
point eight inch HD display a 12 point 6
megapixel camera let's unbox this sucker
and see what comes inside 12.6
megapixels what's really killer here
though is the price point this thing is
4999 to its 150 bucks cheaper then
things like the galaxy s3 the HTC One X
plus it's a point that pantex really
going to drive home with this device all
around you can see out of the box
forgive my voice here I'm losing it from
CES you got a USB cable you get an AC
adapter module you got pantech here 12.6
megapixels on the back 4G LTE
capabilities stereo speakers let's power
this sucker on and see what we can get
in terms of connectivity to pantech
powering up right now let's get that
down there and it's starting up and
we'll see how the starts to animation
looks so here we go fast and easy phone
setup one cancel out of that and we'll
see what comes out of ops Ice Cream
Sandwich your android 4.0 is when it's
powered by San Pantex user interface as
well welcome to pantech phone point
english and will run through all this
stuff standard experience skip skip
finish that so we can take a look at the
device itself a four point eight inch HD
display here 12.6 megapixel camera
suspects wise this is a pretty decent
device all around a great bang for the
buck for 50 bucks now some people you
know what they're going to prefer that
galaxy s3 that one x+ but for people
that are coming in like hey I want a
decent smartphone with some great specs
at a reasonable price the pantech
discover is going to be a good options
that stereo speakers like I said on both
sides and you got your camera on the
back of the flash you got nothing over
here on this side you've got a volume
rocker micro USB charging port at the
bottom and then you've got your power
button and 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
top so you can really see the
customization to go to carrier
customizations right here quick settings
vibrate Wi-Fi GPS all those ones are
much like kind of a samsung
configuration you can swipe back and
forth to access more books so settings
here we'll go ahead into this
and take a look again android 4.8 you
can really see the pantech user
experience here you can change the
experience as well and go from pantech
easy to pantech standard so if this is
for somebody that's perhaps a first-time
smartphone buyer i'd recommend the
pantech easy experience if it's somebody
that's used to a smartphone take a look
at the standard experience but otherwise
back home recent applications all these
are on-screen buttons so they are taking
away from that four point eight inch HD
display that's it here's what comes out
of the gate pardon me on the AT&amp;amp;T device
you've got code scanner drive mode
family map locker navigator ready to go
smart Wi-Fi all kinds of AT&amp;amp;T stuff live
TV my AT&amp;amp;T emoji music and then you've
got a social gallery YP mobile and wants
to get quite a bit out of the box here
on the AT&amp;amp;T side since we don't have a
sim card we can't really test the
network connectivity take a look at the
web page for example we can see here is
the messages area and see what the
pantech keyboard looks like so you get
this option out of the gate swiftkey for
pantech you get android keyboard and
google voice typing as well so typical
google keyboard here don't go back so
you can see android keyboard this is
four point oh so an Android 4.2 board
and I can say hey there TB and you can
see right up there hey there TV big four
point eight inch display it's an HD
display 720p it's got a lot of different
features to like including the stereo
speakers and a pretty decent build
quality as well so keeping in mind again
50 bucks for this device yeah you know
what the build quality may not be the
best in the market suspects it's got a
great 12.6 megapixel camera but you know
what the specs may or may not be exactly
which one but for 50 bucks it's really a
good bang for the buck and this is
something I think a lot of people are
gonna like an AT&amp;amp;T what remains to be
seen as if AT&amp;amp;T retail reps push this
device over something else I hope they
do wait and see what happens keep it
lock on TechnoBuffalo for continuing
coverage follow me on twitter aaron c

sick after CES 2013 but don't worry
