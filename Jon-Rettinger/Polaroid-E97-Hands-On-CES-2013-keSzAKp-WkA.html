keyboards I am NOT a huge fan tablet but
in this case I can see a real use case
oh and i say i'm not a big fan of
tablets actually like tablets a lot i
just from my personal life I prefer my
laptop but you know what something like
this could really get me over not that
this hasn't existed for a while but I'm
imagining Polaroid's price point is
really going to make this thing
attractive how's it going guys a mirror
and baker from TechnoBuffalo I'm here at
CES 2013 in Las Vegas Nevada hanging out
at the Polaroid booth where they've got
a lot of different tablets now what do
you think of tablets you may not think a
poured you probably think of Apple and
Samsung you don't really think of polar
of what I like about these these are
competitively spect and they're priced
well I just took a look at one over
there for 229 this is the Polaroid inai
known as it says here is a 9.7 inch
capacitive screen tablet and I'm just
going to read off of this because
honestly there's to meet specifications
going on at CES is hard to keep track
1.6 gigahertz dual-core processor you
got android 4.1 on this device there's
google nail integration out of the box
we got dual cameras you got a point
three megapixel front-facing camera I
love hot pointed out it didn't actually
hold the camera up that was really
smooth they're smooth very run 2
megapixel rear facing camera 8 gigabytes
of internal memory access of course to
Google Google Play facebook youtube
things like that msn i love how they
have msn on here like people actually
use msn anymore 4 x 3 formats super slim
though at nine point eight millimeters
night as you can see it detaches from
the keyboard itself you got your volume
rocker over here power button you got
camera on the back and i'm trying to
hold this without setting the security
alarm off which i have done a couple of
times this morning doesn't show the MSRP
on this one but really nice tablet i'm
actually can fold it up and just pop it
right down when you're done and you can
but again i'm not going to try it
because i will set the security alarm
off pretty stock build here of android
4.1 like we've seen on all the polaroid
tablet little bit of lag there though i
don't know if you saw that you see stock
android 4.1 configuration no real
difference is here menu button up in the
right-hand corner and then of course
preinstalled applications out of the box
much different stuff flashlight fruit
ninja hand come viewer don't know how
much of this is actually pre installed
before CES and how much of this comes
out of the gate on this device but one
thing's for sure you know what probably
gonna be pretty cheap it's got a
keyboard until next week 9.7 inch
display and it can probably compete
without the tablets on the market Nino
honestly CES the name of the game is
chief kappa let's keep it locked in
technical Buffalo for continuing
coverage of CES 2013 we'll be here all
week covering the latest and greatest in
technology and even though the mobile
side is pretty slow near few tablets
hopefully we can make a good week with
some exciting coverage just for you so
stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo i'm on
twitter darren see baker the company has
a technobuffalo on twitter and we're on
facebook as well at facebook.com slash
TechnoBuffalo even locked right here for
