TechnoBuffalo comm and this is the
Motorola expert for sprint Sprint's
first Android world phone let's check it
out alright it is the ultimate business
tool but it's also part casual and all
smartphone
it's the expert you can see this guy
right here he looks part casual it's
some hunter Ola expert from Sprint and
Motorola Motorola who is now Motorola
Mobility owned by Google or I should say
pending the deal announced today Monday
morning August what is it August what
15th something like that yes August 15th
Google buying Motorola Mobility the deal
is not nice to be approved but probably
an antitrust you know inquiry just to
make sure whatever but um I didn't mean
to sound cynical there but you know I
don't know really if they would block
something like that but anyway yeah
Motorola Mobility purchased by Google
pending you know the deal being approved
but nonetheless here it is we'll see
what that all means the expert for
sprint from Motorola 99 $99 $99 $99.99
on contract to your contract through
Sprint although phone's been out for a
few days now a little while and already
being discounted other places around the
web but in the box you get a USB cable
within a rubberband probably yours will
not have a Rove and micro USB to USB
cable and then your power adapter it's
modular that way it's eco mode oh there
you go
also in the Box you get your getting
started pack your manuals all your stuff
your recycling bag please recycle your
old phones electronics I you know give
the old phone to somebody you can use it
or if not recycle it don't just throw it
in the landfill please here's the phone
itself it runs Android running Android
2.2 Froyo it's got a one gigahertz
processor on the inside it's a 3.1 inch
display 320 by 480 it is touch sensitive
obviously capacitive they're all
capacitors these days I've got a
physical keypad you got your 4
capacitive touch buttons down
on the bottom on the back five megapixel
camera with LED flash on the right spine
here you've got a single lonely button
it's a shortcut button so we need that
same research my calendars what happened
go back to the home screen here yep let
me straight to my calendar all business
all casual there you go on the other
side you've got two buttons for volume
up/down and your micro USB port on the
top three and a familiar headphone jack
and your power lock switch on the bottom
on your microphone sensor and then on
the back you've got this thing which I
believe will undo the back cover to get
to your battery but I'm not going to do
that so that's those things two gigs of
internal memory and there's a two
gigabyte SD card preloaded expandable to
32 gigs its flash 10 enabled it supports
Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync server
data encryption AES 256-bit AES data
encryption all that stuff you've got
flashed and you've got all the Android
widgets all the Android apps all that
stuff and then you know the last vestige
is here of motoblur as well and it is a
world phone like I said in the outset
and the intro Sprint's first Android
world phone so there's some card slot
you can travel around the globe with it
also functions as a 3G hotspot you can
see I've got the app right there for 3G
hotspot service this will significantly
impact battery life not to mention cost
you extra
your monthly service planning but that's
alright so this is just a review unit so
you know doesn't really matter go go go
go go go go accelerometer on the inside
with advice like this so you know mostly
it's kind of add a couple friends who
have corporate jobs who have switched
recently from blackberries to Android
devices and really happy about them most
of them and actually the Front's of
clean I'm all happy when I said most
menacing unit of our own John render who
is switched recently from an iPhone to a
black great advice but that's another
story and for them you know they love
the access to touch screen and the
access to apps and
or web browsing and that kind of stuff
but the keyboard still a big deal for
many especially you know heavy business
users so let's take a look
well fire but pretend text message here
I almost see how the keyboard is
so you know pretty good made a couple
mistakes there my first time typing out
but you've got this kind of dual beveled
surface here if the key is kind of fan
out from the center and then you've got
kind of a double slant here a little bit
kind of a little weird to type on it
first but I think you know they're
they're kind of just big enough I wish
the space key was a little bit bigger
that's just me I'm just big enough that
most people can probably adapt pretty
well you know I wouldn't say this is um
you know the device is a little bit
narrower then it's been a while since
he's a BlackBerry but then BlackBerry's
as I recall so a little bit more cramped
you got the voice search button down
there which is nice
except it's not working uh cancel let's
try it again check though huh connection
problem there it's because I have the UH
the hot spot on let's turn that off or
maybe it's just faulty techno buffalo
there we go
because I have the hot spot on I guess
the phone has Wi-Fi Bluetooth all that
good stuff you can use it with VPN you
know it's a business-class device here
back to school giveaways it's like I
plan that I didn't but we are doing we
kicked off a bunch of back-to-school
content this week doing a whole bunch of
giveaways there might even be a Motorola
phone in there so stay tuned coming up
later this week running all month check
that out all throughout the month at the
end of the month the rest of the month
of August into the first week of
September at least to check that out
we're pretty excited about we got some
some great sponsors AT&amp;amp;T Nvidia sono
Sony so check that out but there you go
first look at the expert it's light
weight feels pretty good in the hand you
know when the Droid Pro first came out I
gave Motorola some grief for this being
their blackberry killer but it's proven
relatively popular like I said I know
some people in the corporate world who
use Android
devices now instead of their
blackberries and a few of them used the
drug Pro really liked it this is kind of
the next generation of the joy Pro and
obviously it's on Sprint the expert
again 9999 with a two-year contract from
Sprint available now seen it for a
little bit cheaper already other places
online so comparison shop 3.1 inch
display three train by 480 Android 2.2
one gigahertz processor five megapixel
camera but the big story here you've got
your touchscreen you get your full
QWERTY board and it's a world phone it's
not 4G its 3G with 3G mobile hotspot and
then you've got a sim card slot for
global roaming much much more on the
expert all the new phones there's gonna
be a lot of them coming out usually late
August things start to heat up a lot of
new stuff coming up between now and you
know now I'm Black Friday basically
Thanksgiving for the holiday back to
school and then holiday season in the US
and then of course the whole story
developing story with Google buying
Motorola Mobility interesting
interesting indeed kind of a defensive
offensive play from Google don't know
what I mean go to TechnoBuffalo read the
analysis you'll understand so next time
my name is Noah thanks for watching
thanks to the folks at sprint for
lending us this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
