tablets is important to have the best
USBC accessories around but you don't
necessarily want to break the bank to do
it I've got five really useful USB
accessories and none are more expensive
than 40 bucks before I jump into you
guys about all the awesome USB see
accessories we have for you I want to
thank our friend sponsors videoblocks
for your YouTube content creator you
constantly find yourself looking for
After Effects or motion graphics and
backgrounds the folks at videoblocks
have you covered they over two million
stock videos and effects that are ready
for your downloading pleasure you'll get
a free 7-day trial where you can
download 140 pieces of content you can
also sign up for their annual plan which
is just 150 bucks for a limited access
to pretty much everything be sure to go
to videoblocks comm slash youtube or hit
the link down below to get started on
the offer it's summer maybe you want to
take a road trip and the appropriately
named Nomad road trip car charger might
be something you want to consider for
just under 40 bucks this guy's got a 12
volt USB charger built right in so plug
it into your cigarette lighter or power
adapter but beyond that dull scan
feature USB see traditional USB a and
you can pull it out the car when you're
done and use its built-in 3009 power
battery to keep your stuff juiced on the
road for just around eight bucks tech
mates USB C micro USB adapters convert a
regular micro USB cable to USB C cables
on you to sync and charge data so don't
throw away those old cables just don't
adapter on it and you get to go for
around four to ten bucks mono prices
pallet series USB C cables are a staple
in our office they've got a braided
tangle free design that comes in a ton
of different lengths and colors
reasonable recommending them though is
they come with a lifetime warranty and
all the cable so if your rough on your
cables like I am it's really good option
let's stick with monoprice for a minute
and for fifteen bucks you can get a dual
mode USB C micro SD reader allowing you
to plug a micro SD card into any USB C
device so that means if you have a phone
doesn't have expandable storage like say
a 6p for example and going on a road
trip
load up micro SD card with movies pop
this sucker into your 6p and watch your
movies your heart content and last if
you are on a computer for example for
laptop that maybe just has one USB C
port you find yourself looking for more
i/o the folks at ankor have you covered
with the USB c2 3.0 hub the name
give it away you plug it into the USB C
port on your computer laptop whatever
you're going to get three USB 3.0 ports
if you want to see us do an update on
this and give you guys more options to
get video a thumbs up to let us know I
thought to pick up any of these options
