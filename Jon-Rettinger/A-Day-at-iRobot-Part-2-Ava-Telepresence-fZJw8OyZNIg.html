robots
yeah that's a good idea
all right so we're gonna talk to you
guys a little bit this morning about Ava
Ava is a prototype platform that we put
together over the last couple of years
essentially a robotic concept car - so
what ava is all about is autonomous
mobility and navigation right so she is
able to go into a space map that space
understand where she is within that
space and then get from point A to point
B within that space without wanting
anything at people or things first kita
Ava is
her mobility so she has what's called
holonomic mobility between she can
rotate in place and straight side to
side she's moving forward and backward
I'm shooting diagonally basically and
you any direction while maintaining any
orientation so very human-like yeah
contact bumper so if she brushes against
something or something or she's hurting
your way we have some cliff sensors
underneath those are so that you know
those immune off the top of staircases
recently moving up we've got several
sensors here so these two windows in the
front for a laser scanner and a sonar
scanning sensor so basically those are
the two sensors that are the primary
mapping sensor so we bring Ava into a
space and we want to make a map of that
space these are the two sensors that are
used to do that moving up we've got this
vertical articulation on the platform so
this is one of the things we thought
about that you know you might want to
have interactions with someone standing
or the someone seated in addition we
like to be able to get our nice and glow
when we're driving so that we can get a
nice low center of gravity and maintain
the human walking speeds a great quick
catch that's running bookie you very
similar to the tap somebody on the
shoulder the attendant look if you do a
longer push and hold it's kind of Lee
get out of my personal space then in
addition you can the up and down buttons
if you pinch them together so kind of do
this rotate towards Center feature and
if you do that right in front she'll
kind of come along we've got some some
audio stuff here microphones and
speakers and then The Reluctant sensor
for our ability to detect and avoid
obstacles is this sensor right here and
there's another one underneath this
piece which we call the shoulder those
are through the sensors that are made by
plumbing called primeSense so very
similar to what's in the Xbox Kinect so
this is the cad map of the area that
we're in that we got from our building
facilities folks but i want to send a
robot somewhere it's as simple as
touching that spot on the map saying
send robot so she does a couple of
things
we've got this visible camera in that
crime sensor that's on the chin if you
will of the robot and the icon updating
on the map properly this is a an Android
tablet so I'm showing again that we're
tablet OS agnostic there's nothing
particular to iOS or Android about what
we're doing here I'm gonna connect this
application and you'll see immediately I
get a 3d model of the robot put in a
coordinate space on the on the tablet
the robot is taking the pictures with
the prime sensor right now and it'll
stitch those together so that I get 180
degrees of depth information you know
this is an early look at what this could
be you know you notice some issues there
are shadows behind things you know
because the camera can't see behind
things but using this I cannot control
the robot in that interface just by
dragging it you know where I want it to
go very similar to a lot of video game
interfaces how much our goal at first is
for the sort of price points that could
be W markets the you know retail and
security and office telepresence type of
markets we have not announced launch
dates right now our first application
will be in the healthcare space in with
a one
we have not announced logically the
thing that will sell the most of these
robots is probably something we haven't
bought in but you know we can get them
up there and quantity and yet get them
in developers hands somebody who come up
with something amazing that will sell
tons of to throw bottles right same way
Angry Birds if you want to take a quick
look at the way you might be working in
the future be sure to keep your eye on
Ava and sod Rihanna and like from
TechnoBuffalo calm and we'll see you in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
