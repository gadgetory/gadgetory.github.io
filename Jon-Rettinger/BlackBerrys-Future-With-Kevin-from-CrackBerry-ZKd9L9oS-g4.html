from technobuffalo i'm here at
blackberry DEFCON America's 2011 in San
Francisco big blackberry developer
conference this morning at the keynote
they introduced bbx the next generation
of blackberry smartphone platform coming
later they preview blackberry playbook
OS to the developers beta is out today
which includes the runtime environment
for android apps and i know a lot of
blackberry stuff a lot of uninteresting
the mood here trying to get a handle on
what is the future of blackberry rim
seem dummy eat it upbeat about it some
of the developers I talk to you were
some work so I'm going to go to the
master himself mr. crackberry and and
get the scoop on from the media
perspective what is going on with rim
the new bling for the show this is the
talk of def con 2011 it's actually only
fourteen dollars from L&amp;amp;T this is good
this is the playbook MC Hammer it is how
you represent right when you have one
year in blackberry fans oh yeah see I
was gonna say I was going to say Flavor
Flav obviously but but we're in the bay
area so I went through the roots with MC
Hammer who would it be from the Canadian
hip hop your room I don't think we have
Bob and Doug McKenzie adibi baby let's
go drink a beer how'd you know is this a
this is a custom fabrication sis custom
I walked into home depot shortly before
boarding the flight to fly to San
Francisco found some gold chain that is
all over measured it I said credit and
we walked over to the hardware and put
some screws through and they let you
into the country with it and they did
yeah I checked it though I didn't take
that and carry on your smart man there's
smart man so so Kevin mr. cracker if I
may call you that what do you think
about today's today's proceedings yeah
you have to go there first question
right no let me step back tell us about
your your chains no wait tell us about
your t-shirt t-shirt homemade so this is
you know twenty dollars like you can
download the
if you want from crap free make your own
t-shirt but requires got a strike back
they're obviously not in the best place
in the mobile space there's other more
infamous positions to be in can we use
that as a segue or do I need to throw
another softball before we are ok now
let's go that's right let's go so so
what do you mean by they're not in the
best position and how does today's news
you know okay let's talk about the
keynote your folks question all right
it's to media guys dodging questions so
I've been to every blackberry events
since since I got into this game in year
7 and I would say you know this one
potentially is the most important of
them all right because every every month
that goes by you know we're still
growing it out growing as fast as a
smartphone market as the tablet market
right so so things don't look good for
them right from the media perspective of
the Uniform financial perspective it's
not as good as it should be proud so I
think high expectations were what
everybody had hoped for we all set for
ourselves yeah we're going for big
announcements in last year we saw the
playbook it was a huge last year the
excitement level gear was ridiculous and
today there I have given out playbooks
today give it up miss and today was
probably the least exciting about
blackberry presentations I get to and a
little confusing I mean I gotta say like
they announced a new name for a platform
but you can't really visualize it I mean
when you say dbx platform is coming as
the future right I get it but I you know
I saw three letter logo I didn't see I
don't know what that looks like right
you know it's just the PlayBook poetic
unix OS it's going to be on phones
that's what bbx I mean I get that it's
the new platform and everything but
right for the consumer message on it is
a little muddled I think there may be
and we saw a lot of games today but ya
know so we've heard about a lot of stuff
but I think it's what we did hear about
that I'm more curious you know where's
my native email on this obviously the
playbook OS is
what's coming to the phone so as this
develops it's a future with phones will
look like two and we still have a lot of
questions there you know it's
interesting too because it puts so much
so much talk on bbx today and it being
the future you know it makes you wonder
about the state of blackberry OS which
they didn't really talk about that's
where the 70 million subscribers
currently are right so to go back for a
second stops we're talking about you
know how their years been in their
growing but not as much stock market on
moba to recap my best understanding is
that they've lost significant market
share in u.s. yeah the stock price is
way down yeah but according to them
subscriber base is actually up 40
some-odd forty-four percent something
like that so where's that coming from
international for sure so I think us
definitely down right i mean there's
there's always going to be a loyal you
know and as you said before right rim
kills keyboards and there's you are good
for keyboards that I'll always be there
any blackberrys of communication to it
think is I don't think you'd argue with
it being sort of the ultimate
communications I I in the week over time
with us before in the week racing that
I've spent using one of my primary
device I spent way less time on the web
and way more time communicating back
yeah and there's up there's always a
market there right rain doesn't going to
lose that yeah but the future they got
to get to is this all-in-one device and
I think internationally they're still
growing in the u.s. there you know
carriers carriers push it to write you
don't see carriers pushing blackberry
therefore you're not seeing a whole lot
of blackberry sales outside of the core
the corporation bears right so the
question is you know is there still
declined to be had in the US right and I
would argue I think it's a lot of people
who are going to leave blackberry or not
by that's their right so it's really
brings game tompa to win now in the next
year in the US and I think keep growing
internationally you know advise them
time but how much time right they need
to move fast and I think that's the big
thing today we want to see stuff get
delivered we didn't you get deliver
today right I'm enc devices we didn't
actually see bbx we did
ray V playing playbook two point oh
that's right actually so so playbook two
point oh that they're they're giving out
a beta version of developers and
basically my understanding is it's
basically the same as playbook one but
it has the Android runtime environment
at run time it got some home screen UI
changes you know some some stuff so God
it doesn't have native email this
developer version yet right by the time
it launches its going to be quite
different yeah Sylvia so what about the
intra Android environment i'm not a
surprise that they launched it but you
know is that is that as big of a deal is
it you know what i really got the
impression sit sit today that you know
when we made that decision back when was
that prior to the launch of i think they
made the announcement prior to the
playbook actually being really right you
know right March last year very early
April a traitor I almost got the
impression that since then rims
commitment to that is maybe not what it
once was I think I think maybe that was
like a really great idea at the time
there's been a lot of personnel changes
of that company yeah they almost got the
feeling that's really just because they
announce today had to do it yeah but I
have a feeling if they could they would
just make them they talked a lot about
cascades they talked a lot about made
the native SDK wants to make it on their
own yeah they want to build up really
kick butt developer tools all right so
I'm gonna here's where I put on the spot
for a second you can we can go back to
dodging but yeah like Dutch or they are
they on the right is that the right path
for them
at this I don't know at this stage of
the game it's interesting you know if
you went back two years I would say look
look what Amazon just did with the
kindle fire rim could yeah and they
could have built they could have put in
their own security layer they could have
put in BBM and made such a
differentiated Android Play that it
would crash you nobody would buy a
samsung or HTC device we could have
bought the blackboard which was had so
many more value-added features right
they didn't do that so now is it I don't
think it makes sense to do it now going
going all the way back there so now
there are there options that fight for
it on their goal at least for a while I
try to make it and so some up today and
I don't know you can choose one word
five words letter from ten words still
optimistic hoping for more still got
great convoy number 10 Louis yeah you
didn't know you did here's 10 10 awesome
Kevin thank you they set the site it's
crackberry crackberry com the rim fire
will strike that yeah I don't hey wait
we're gonna let me pull this estimate
you got to see this app so this is you
know passionate developers on the
platform building apps here and they
build crackberry right into the app but
anyone ask them for this and now I can
really wants ice it's not Wow indeed oh
yeah let's get the full equity I like to
introduce more team with us here we got
Adams I Steve enter the blackberry x10
very nice you know what that is now you
use the bold 9900 fresh for one that I
use jumpers so you do it right okay so
check this out turns out it comes with a
built-in kickstand
oh maybe not on this box is became the
music because I invented it hey there
