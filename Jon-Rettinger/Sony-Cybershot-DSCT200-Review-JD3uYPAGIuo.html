of the camera unbox last week the sony
cybershot DSC t 200 those you didn't see
the unboxing it's a very thin
point-and-shoot camera took at the back
notice there are no buttons everything's
all touchscreen I'll show you that in a
minute
today we go over the specs for you here
it's got a 3.5 inch wide screen a 5
times optical zoom
it's got face detection meaning when you
take a picture in the back of you find
you actually tap with person's faces and
all the focus on that area for you it
also has something called Smile Shutter
which means you can set it to when you
tap on somebody's face they'll detect
when that face smiles and take the
picture kind of gimmicky it's a little
annoying I turned it off I found no use
for it so anyway this camera side shot
on the top of it you've got the zoom
rocker the shutter button the look at
pictures and there's a power button the
way to turn the camera on if you don't
use the power button just to slide it
down turn the camera on and there we go
so everything is is all touchscreen the
menus are very similar to the old Sony
cameras with the dial they almost
exactly the same just now that's used
with the touchscreen so I mean if you
hit the auto button right there
you know pulls up a string of menus
across the bottom I don't you guys can
see that but it just pulls up the menus
very simple very easy to use found that
took 10 minutes learn everything the
camera could do without really looking
at the manual it's like a typical dude
so you know overall picture quality was
excellent I was able to zoom in really
far on put the pictures on my computer
at that seeing pixels and the quality
was really solved to you know I didn't
wanna I can't like show you guys
pictures but pictures what they look
like here because YouTube would distort
it so to kind of work for it the
pictures do look great
I'm a very amateur photographer I don't
know much about ISO or any of that
but I guess you can change I as those
ISO settings to be pretty high so you
might want to check the specs out for
that if you're interested
other than that though it's really a
great camera it's extremely thin as I
showed you to fit in your pocket
nice and easy you can do guys a
comparison here compare here at the
iPhone for example you can see the
thickness pretty close
I'm not much different so anyway this is
the camera sony cybershot DSC t 200 I
highly highly recommend that you think
the best way to do this is you guys ask
me questions and I'll answer them for
you in regards to the video as well like
I said it takes video at full 1080 the
video was great there were some
questions about whether or not there was
audio with it and there was certainly
audio with it it was synced up with the
people's faces so really no trouble
there and it came in actually looking
really solid I even put it up on my mic
TV yet but when I do what you guys know
overall highly recommend the camera I
give it a 5 stars out of 5 stars
if you need a small slim point.you
camera that's pretty easy on the eyes
too so anyway guys this is anyway guys
thanks for watching thanks for
subscribing and I'll beginning to all
your questions on this video and all the
other ones today in the next couple days
so wherever you're at have yourself a
good afternoon morning or evening
alright so I see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
