technobuffalo here apple's keynote where
they unleashed a ton of new products
including you laptops desktops and
tablets just wrapped up let me go ahead
and give you a recap of everything you
missed when you can get your hands on
apple's hot new gear so we've got a ton
of stuff to cover let's jump right in so
the event began with updates from Tim
Cook's first start talking about iphones
they sold nine million of them a launch
weekend making it the biggest launch
ever that is just a ton of phones five
days after iOS 7 launched over 200
million devices were running it today
sixty-four percent of Apple devices are
running iOS 7 which is crazy it jumped
on over to iTunes radio over 20 million
listeners of iTunes radio listening to
over a billion songs in the US alone
which is just a lot of songs Apple loves
to bring out the app developer number
they've paid app developers now over 13
billion dollars with a B which is a lot
of money of course they talked a little
smack on the competition saying that the
competitions confused netbooks turning
to tablets and tablets trying to laptops
and they showed symbols and so that's
really taking some digs at what
Microsoft was doing with the surface and
then they finally got to what's new when
they started with OS 10 Mavericks talked
a lot about power efficiency of
Mavericks said if you take the 13-inch
macbook air that was just updated
install Mavericks on it you'll get an
extra hour of battery life which is a
lot they recapped all the new features
there's a ton of them but the best part
of Mavericks is it's going to be free
which is kinda awesome no matter what OS
version you are on Apple has a single
step upgrade for you any iMac or
computer purchased from 2007 and on will
work and it's available today which is
kind of awesome then they moved on to
the macbook pros began at the 13-inch
guy got on a diet it is now point 71
inches thin and weighs a little bit less
at 3.5 pounds of course the update of
the chips it's not surprisingly running
intel's haswell it's a 4th gen dual-core
chip I including integrated graphics
which should be at least according Apple
ninety percent faster which is
extraordinary of true
battery life has always been awesome
these computers that continues to be the
case I was 9 hours of battery life they
added the stuff you'd expect no.2 11ac
Thunderbolt 2 and all kinds of other
goodness previous generation 13-inch
MacBook Pro start at 14 99 apples given
it a discount it is now starting at 12
99 using my keen math skills that is a
two hundred dollar savings so that's
always good and shipping today if you
want to get a new macbook pro for
yourself then on to the big boy the
15-inch powered by Intel crystal well
4th gen quad-core processor it's got the
iris pro graphics but if you want the
geforce gt750m that is going to be
available i 9 hours of battery life the
same stuff as the 13-inch Thunderbolt 2
802 11 AC and that kind of stuff but it
also got a discounts previous gen was
2199 new one starts at 99 guy that
includes I quarter terabyte drive 256
and of course at a solid-state drive
which is a lot of space also shipping
today then they got to the weird capsule
looking thing which is a pretty awesome
thing we saw wdc and that is the mac pro
we know more about it now it's this of a
mystery to me running intel's next-gen
xenon chip the e5 coming in 6 8 or 12
cores up to 64 gigs of ddr3 ram dual
workstation graphics you can get the AMD
FirePro graphics in there up to one
terabyte a flash storage which is
ridiculous I'll probably have to like
sell a leg in order to afford ever
that's going to cost hdmi 1.4 is on
boards going to support 4k tvs and they
went through and set out it's the best
for kate editing machine you can't lie
4k content and edit it as it's going
which is supposedly a pretty big deal
introductory price guess waiting at
directory price is going to be for the
base if you guessed under 3,000 by a
dollar you'd be correct two thousand
nine hundred ninety nine dollars be
available sometime in december and they
also want to remind people that is not
only designed by apple in the USA it is
also assembled in the USA I met wrapped
it up for Mac hardware we went on to
apps we talked about new ilife apps now
64-bit to take advantage of Mavericks
and iOS and the best part though they
are now
free with any purchase of iOS or Mac
device is kind of awesome you'll see
that trend start to continue here as we
move on to I work which is also free the
purpose of any new Mac or iOS device
which is pretty exciting and then we
finally got all into the piece de
resistance but everybody was there for
anyway the new iPads early this month in
October Apple soul it's 170 million ipad
if you look back the original iPad I
didn't think it was gonna be that
popular 170 million is just a ridiculous
amount of iPads obion more euless over
475,000 new ipad apps let me get some
new stuff the new ipad is called not the
ipad 5 not the new ipad it is the ipad
air which kind of creates a brand new
line of iPads that's got the same 9.7
inch Retina display but it's super thin
bezel as you'd expect forty-three
percent less in fact in a previous
version of course that's called air it's
got to be thinner 7.5 millimeters thin
or if you do the math twenty percent
thinner than the outgoing ipad for brief
generation ipad for Wade 1.4 pounds the
new iPad air weighs one pound which
point four pounds less according to
Apple it's the lightest full-size tabal
in the world and it looks like I fin
down ipad mini from the back it's got
the same a7 chip in the iPad 5s which
makes it 64-bit also has the m7 motion
coprocessor it's got twice the cpu
performance as a previous ipad it's all
the specs we saw from a7 chip 72 times
graphics performance over the original
ipad MIMO Wi-Fi expanded LTE support
5-megapixel isight camera on the back of
HD video the improved isight camera in
the front do a mic same 10 hour battery
life just pretty awesome going to come
in silver and Space Gray no gold and no
touch ID so if you're holding out for a
gold version with touch ID you sir or
madam are going to be disappointed the
price it's not cheap 499 for a 16 gig
Wi-Fi version or six hundred and
twenty-nine dollars for LTE which is the
same as before I'll be available
November first oddly enough the ipad 2
was sticking around its going to be 399
so for 100 bucks less you can get a
couple years old technology or spending
a hundred dollars more to get the ipad
air seems like it only exists to
convince you to spell more to spend more
money I can go to the movie theater
you're like I'll take a small a drink
and they're like well for only a quarter
more you can get a trough of coke and
they're like well I didn't want to drop
off a quarter mark seems like a good
deal and then we moved on to the iPad
Mini which now comes with a reddit
displayed you can tell I'm excited
because my hands are moving like this
and it's going to be called officially
the ipad mini with a Retina Display spec
for spec it's pretty close to the ipad
air it's now powered by the a7 chip
pretty awesome 10 hours battery life 5
megapixel iSight camera a new FaceTime
HD camera same colors silver and Space
Gray no gold and still no touch ID but
the price went up a bit 399 bucks the 16
gig Wi-Fi and 529 for the cellular one
which is kind of unfortunate the old
iPad Mini used to be 329 which is also
sticking around and is going to drop to
two hundred ninety-nine bucks there's
actually a hundred all difference
between the iPad Mini with Retina
display and the ipad air will be
available the same time you just said
available later in november and then we
got to accessories crazy crazy over
priced accessories new coverage for 39
bucks new cases for a whopping 80
dollars which seemed like a lot of money
spending for a case so Apple introduced
a ton of new stuff we saw a new software
ton of new hardware new tablets and you
can sort of start to feel the passion
Apple has their products came back they
seemed super proud about the new iPads
I'm kind of excited to see them they
also seemed really jazzed about the new
ilife and iwork which I have never
really used that much but I will give it
a shot I'm excited to gamble in
Mavericks which is available today so
you should start that download process
now and the best part is it is free so
what do you guys think you excited not
excited this is what you expected for me
the iPad Mini with Retina splay was
really what I was most excited for it
was there something you're most jazzed
about I know some folks in the office
we're looking forward to the ipad air
some the ipad mini I want to hear your
