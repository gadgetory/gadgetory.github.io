brought to you by domain.com what's up
everyone jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo here I'm sitting on this
couch which means I am either trying to
hide napping from the office or it's an
episode of ask the Buffalo which which
it is on this episode we got a ton of
stuff to talk about to go ahead and jump
right in the first question comes from
at Johan Janning or johani anning who
asks at John for liquors you think
Samsung will continue its glass and
aluminum design language on the note 5
yes I think that aluminum and glass is
going to be permeate through all of
their lineup especially all of their
high-end lineup including the rumored
might be announced galaxy s6 plus which
could be coming very soon so that galaxy
s6 you just bought that was like pretty
much brand new it's busted next question
comes from at Dan legs one who asks at
the John for lakers that that's me do
you think we will see an update to Syria
at WWDC to rival Google now let's go
just beyond with each other series not
so good it's good at telling you the
weather sports scores meet with 10
movies are playing beyond that it's not
as useful as what we see on the Google
side with Google now especially with
google now scarred integration but
supposedly apples like on daddy ain't
going to stand fool and they're going to
make Siri much better we're getting
rumors that there will be at Google now
competitor launched by Apple I would
sure give probably not card interface
with some sort of integration with the
OS be able to see your flights down that
stuff will show up inside of one app
certainly you can do a passbook now
that's more manual process you have to
open an email or text and add that the
passbook and then start using it
hopefully we'll get sort of one place to
view everything so I would expect long
answer yes just I should have said yes
hmm you've got an idea for next great
website domain com has you covered they
woke you up with a great offer save
twenty percent on domain names and web
hosting when you use coupon code
TechnoBuffalo that's all capital letters
one word at domain coms check out I
think domain names think domain.com and
last but not least mr. cam Covington ass
at John for lakers
still like in the Apple watch I'm
wearing it still but my opinions now a
month later after the view are still
exactly the same if like here's
ambivalent this is like me I'm like I
can step step above ambivalent I'm
wearing it mostly because it reminds me
to stand up and I sit way too much the
health and fitness stuff aspect of it is
nice everything else I still don't see a
reason to pick up an apple lot
especially at that really high price
point I may be genteel be something
better my thought is a watch and a
wearable has to do something that a
phone can't and right now this is really
just doing alerts and the whole idea
behind it is you don't take out your
phone but also have a hard time saying
why would you spend so much money on the
phone with rock can't take it out and
use it the app experience is still
really bad they're still loading off the
phone and then getting pushed over to
the watch trivia bluetooth so it's slow
experience Alex lived up to the promise
I'm sure apples selling a billion of
them and supposedly the fastest product
launch ever i think the real litmus test
i was going to be gentoo again to can do
something new and unique and really be a
product at Apple initially wanted then
yeah I think it'll be a big success if
not then I maybe would go down in the
annals of history next to the cube yes I
said annals whip it up it's a real word
don't be dirty and I think you guys
watch the episode of ask to Buffalo I
enjoyed these shows ask questions tend
to be a twitter at jump or lakers red
TechnoBuffalo just use hashtag ask the
be so I seize it with my peepers and
then I put the question myself and I'll
pick them and I'll put them up you can
see your name be like whoo I'm internet
famous anyway I'm babbling i'll see you
guys next video goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
