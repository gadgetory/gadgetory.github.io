TechnoBuffalo that I'm boxing for you of
the Apple watch you're probably saying
to yourself self didn't we already see
that we did an unboxing of the Apple
watch sport but I want to take a look at
what the actual Apple watch is gonna
look like and you get anything extra for
that around 200 to 250 dollar difference
functionally there are exactly the same
but you are getting stainless steel as
opposed to aluminum on the sport as well
as a sapphire crystal display available
a ton of different options this one we
have the classic buckle it's black
leather and of course you can swap those
bands with another option if you'd like
Apple's happy to sell you one of their
Apple watch bands for around 150 dollars
if you want some variety let's go ahead
and take this thing off peel off the
plastic here this is the 42 millimeter
as well it fits my wrist I'm just a
little bit better so push all that
plastic off to the side and a little bit
of Apple watch emboss on top this is a
obviously more of a square as opposed to
sort of the long rectangle we had with
the Apple watch sport we will slowly and
seductively slide that off you see how I
said seductively and we'll pull it out
and it's sitting a supposedly inside of
that and this is just hard plastic the
same plastic that we saw with the Apple
watch sport box just in a different size
pull this out designed by Apple in
California for Apple watch stuff how to
pair how to get set up all that kind of
stuff no Apple watch stickers though in
the Apple watch box unfortunately we
didn't have them either in the sport box
so bear that in mind also inside we've
got a charging cable this is metal as
opposed to plastic for the Apple watch
supposed to the sport and then we just
have a wall work which we've all seen
many many times but that stuff is not
why you're here this is why you guys are
checking the video out we'll go ahead
and pull off this plastic well green tab
is gone and Veil the plastic box that
holds in the Apple watch Apple logo on
top of this hard plastic
and open us up and sitting pretty nicely
in there is the Apple watch it's that
same material that we also saw at the
Apple watch sport that protects it and
use it for storage or travel or just
make it look pretty if you want go ahead
and pull this off and you've got sitting
actually in an actual watch ring pull
that stuff off to the side nothing else
inside and here is the Apple watch
functionally AG and exactly the same as
the Apple watch sport so you gotta
decide whether or not you really want
the aesthetics presumably though you're
gonna get better durability with the
sapphire crystal but you might come with
a price
supposedly the sport has better
visibility outdoors as opposed to the
sapphire display the tempered glass is a
little bit better in that environment
but I'll test it now elect you guys know
let's pull this off and take a look at
the black leather it's black and it's
made of leather you can still change
bands exactly the same way you could
with the other Apple watches I'll show
you how to do that in a second you can
see on the back the difference between
the stainless steel and the aluminum now
we'll do a vs. between these two also to
show sort of the more nuance differences
I believe just at first glance that's
what the differences are other than that
things are exactly the same same digital
crown same physical button microphone
speaker the exact same play sensors in
the exact same place you can use the
charger from the sport to charge this
one this one just little fancier in
metal but than that it is exactly the
same if you want to see our full review
of the Apple watch to this live we'll
put a link to it down below until next
time I'm John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo
video a thumbs up guys appreciate it and
of course check us out at TechnoBuffalo

subscribe button for all the videos as
they hit your sub box and we'll see you
guys the next one go bye
