Hazleton with TechnoBuffalo we have the
brand new Samsung Galaxy s5 here in the
office and with it comes a brand new
heart rate monitor that works on the
back with the camera and the flash we'll
show you how that works how it measures
your heart rate and it's B per minute in
this video okay so here we are with the
galaxy s5 powered on and one of the new
features inside of it is called it's an
app called s health and s health has
been updated on the galaxy s5 to SL 3.0
and right here on the homescreen is a
widget for it and I'll tap that and
inside the widgets a default setting for
the pedometer it shows how many steps
I've walked today and the calories I've
burned but now inside I can also click
another option heart rate now with the
heart rate sensor I can actually keep
track of my beats per minute and I
simply just turn over the phone like
it's telling us to do and place my
finger over the light here the LED light
and you'll see it's turning red if you
look closely and on the other side it's
actually keeping track of my beats per
minute will show you a different view of
that working with a different angle here
so now on the back I have my finger
there and it's measuring my beats per
minute while I'm sitting here okay so
it's 76 if we have any doctors out there
you can let me know how healthy I am but
one of the unique things about this or
say it's not so unique is that you can
actually do this on a lot of phones the
iPhone 5s a lot of Android phones and
even the iPhone 4 or 4s because all it
does is take advantage of the camera and
the LED or the rather the LED flash
below the camera so there's a
third-party application you can find in
any of the app stores under health and
fitness it'll do the same thing and I
tested this today and they actually do
have the almost the exact same beats per
minute rating depending on the phone so
it's kind of cool that I can check my
beats per minute here on the Samsung
Galaxy s5 there's actually a lot of
third-party options available for other
platforms including iOS and all other
Android handsets because it just takes
advantage as this shows us of the LED
light below the camera typically uses
the flash and it works really well so on
the galaxy s5 it's or
just a gimmick because it's not a unique
feature to this phone okay that was a
quick look at the heart rate sensor on
the galaxy s5 if you really liked the
video give us a thumbs up we really
appreciate it and let us know if you
have any comments what's up everyone
