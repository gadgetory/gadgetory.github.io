you by audible and my unnecessarily deep
DJ voice up next on the quads door
welcome everyone to another episode of
ask the buffalo i'm your host jon
rettinger this is the show where you can
ask anything you want from the wide
world of technology up this week we've
got samsung nexus prime or presumably
it's going to be called the nexus prime
we've got the iphone 4s we've got some
upgrade questions and we're finally
going to answer how we came up with the
name technobuffalo stay tuned so if you
want to submit a question to ask the
Buffalo you can do it one of two ways
every Tuesday we put up a post on the
site technobuffalo calm where are we ask
you to submit your questions you can
leave them in the comment box and you're
good in the hood otherwise if Tuesday
doesn't work on your schedule because we
want to be friendly and consider it to
you and go ahead and send a question
using hashtag ask the b2 at
TechnoBuffalo and I will check it out
you've got a chance to get your question
featured in ask the Buffalo so that
further ado let's go ahead and jump into
question number uno first questions
comes from Gerardo Esposito who asked
John would you recommend the iphone 4s
are the specs enough that's a really
subjective question if you're coming
from an iphone 4 it's a tough one to
justify Suri is a nice feature but it's
not killer for me the iphone 4 ran fast
enough I don't necessarily think that
the increased specs are important right
now perhaps developers get a chance to
put some of that extra core to use then
maybe it's worth an upgrade if you take
a lot of pictures with your phone
however if you rely on your phone as
your video camera and you're still
camera then yeah it might be a
worthwhile upgrade the change in lenses
is more than just 3 megapixel difference
from five to eight you add an extra lens
there's all kinds of rear side exposure
lighting new aperture settings
of technical camera stuff which results
in much much better pictures so it's up
to you they're coming from a 3gs then
yes you know it's going to be a personal
decision for me from an iphone 4 i am
going to make the upgrade all right and
keeping up with the iphone 4s theme our
next question comes from user Sam Presti
who asked well iphone 4 owners get the
Siri update in iOS 5 or is it only for
the iphone 4s it's actually a question
I've been getting quite a bit and that's
when it's really easy to answer Sri the
voice assistant is only going to be for
the iphone 4s it's not an iOS 5 update
its iphone 4s exclusive and if you had
an iphone 4s you can push the on button
see Suri well are you Lee for the iphone
4s and it would say shut the heck up
stop asking me questions or you could
ask it whatever you want I made a joke
that's someone on twitter posted you
hold down sri and say hey Suri when the
nexus prime coming out then it really
might yell at you so bad joke let's go
ahead and jump up to the next question
comes from user Greg Walden who asks
John I'm ready for an upgrade soon while
I love the specs of an Android superfone
I feel like the android marketplace is
lacking in apps and comparison to the
App Store should I switch to the iphone
for the App Store do you think android
marketplace is going to improve android
marketplace is improving by leaps and
bounds on a daily basis you now have
videos that you can download from there
not just games and it's almost on parody
from 1 to 14 you can get in the App
Store force android marketplace so every
app I've ever needed that I've had an
iOS there's been an equivalent android
marketplace so the idea that the android
marketplace isn't up to par definitely
isn't true anymore there's a lot more
let's say crack we're floating around
android marketplace to not say in the
iphone app store but if you can sort
through some of that there are some
wonderful application so don't let the
app stores deter you if you're looking
for an android super phone though i
definitely look at one of the samsung
galaxy mega xes tues or the upcoming
nexus prime also if you're on verizon
droid bionic
super hot phone all right so speaking of
talking to your phone let's talk about
books talking to you and I want to take
a minute thank our friends and sponsors
at audible if you're busy you don't have
a lot of time to read as much you like
to let the books read themselves to you
I just finished reading this is herman
cain my journey to the White House
really interesting read go ahead and
check out that book or a ton of other
ones over at audible.com so if you've
got an iphone and android device you can
listen to your audible books right from
there plug a CD right into your car
stereo plug your iphone or ipod touch or
android device right into your car and
listen to your books while you're
driving that's what i did it makes for
an awesome way to get books read to you
and you can kill two birds with one
stone you gotta drive anyway you might
as well listen to some books also i do
listen to a decent amount while i'm at
the gym so if I'm getting my pump on
pourra I can have the books read
themselves to me if you'd like to go
ahead and get a free book enter your
support for the site go to audible
podcast.com slash techno and get your
free book that is audible podcast
technote to get your free book alright
let's go ahead and jump back to ask the
Buffalo questions our next question
comes from user naoko who asks where did
you come up with a name technobuffalo
well listen it's just us do you want the
honest answer or do you want the answer
that I tell people the answer that I
tell people because I went to college
and upstate New York it's right near
Buffalo and I thought it sounded good
the honest answer though is when I
started technobuffalo I needed an
available URL and TechnoBuffalo was
available I was a marketing guy before I
started getting to tech and the Buffalo
name was something iconic that I could
Brandt and I thought I could make a very
strong representation of what i want the
TechnoBuffalo did be at the time so it
was a strong graphic image and it was an
available URL so that is the honest to
goodness answer for how we came up with
technobuffalo alright so our last and
final question comes from user
matthew edwards who asked a question
that I get quite a bit John I'm
currently on an iphone 4 and I'm due for
an upgrade which is a following should I
upgrade to the iphone 4s samsung galaxy
s2 or blackberry bold 9900 well I'm
going to assume that you are on 18 d
since always phones listed our AT&amp;amp;T
devices so that's a tough question if
you're happy with the iphone 4 and you
want a little bit faster speed you want
a better camera go the 4s however the
galaxy s2 is an awesome phone got that
beautiful 4.3 inch Super AMOLED screen
which really jumps out of you it's got
that screaming fast dual-core processor
in there it's a tough one to turn down
if however you love a physical keyboard
try the blackberry bold 9900 that
keyboard is hands down the best option
out there so if you're a heavy texts or
emails what's important to you that's
the way to go if you need a bigger
screen go to the galaxy s2 if you're
happy living in iOS world then upgrade
to the 4s but switch colors you've got a
black one go white if you've got white
go black mix up so it feels a little bit
like a different phone so I'm look at
the 10x each other they're like this is
the same thing alright guys thank you

Buffalo i'm your host jon rettinger you
