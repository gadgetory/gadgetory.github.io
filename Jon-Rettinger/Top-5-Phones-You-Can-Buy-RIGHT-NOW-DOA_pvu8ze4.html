picking your kid's name it's hard to do

kid's name I'm gonna add another opinion
to that mix my own and you the top five
phones you can buy it right now coming
in at number five the blackberry prive

under four hundred dollars right now and
you're gonna get an almost stock Android
experience just got updated to
marshmallow you're getting an incredible

trackpad coming in at number four
