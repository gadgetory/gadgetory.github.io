had in your pocket the past ten years
they've been some iteration of a
rectangle
ever since physical keyboards
essentially went away on smartphones the
design hasn't changed but starting now
that rectangle is changing its morphing
and it's folding and I don't think the
smartphone landscape is ever gonna be
the same I was trying to scribe to my
wife who doesn't follow technology very
closely what the Galaxy fold looks like
and the best analogy I can come up with
was it's like a book got a cover on the
outside you open it up and there's your
content and it's pretty much the same
thing here you have to change a little
bit the way you use a smartphone but the
looks of it are much more impressive
than I thought they were going to be
this was announced you know now almost
two months ago I admittedly didn't have
the highest expectations for it it
seemed a little bit gimmicky and it
looked a little bit silly but I've
actually got one in my hands the look is
growing on me and it feels like a
premium device did you expect for the
2,000 dollar price point I really like
the way the fold looks so when the fold
got announced I like you probably had a
ton of questions one of the chief among
them though was the hinge it looks big
in video and pictures but how's it gonna
perform so when you open the phone up
actually really neat the hinge
completely disappears you get kind of
satisfying click and you don't get you
know floppy hinge syndrome when the
phone is open it's locked in that
position it's not going to sort of
accidentally fold safe so I did a really
nice job engineering that hinge I also
kinda had the reverse question too when
it's closed it gonna sort of
accidentally open up in my pocket or
maybe open a little bit and turn the
screen on and kill the battery I think
it's close you get an equally satisfying
what clicky noise to let you know this
is closed and it's not going to open the
fact you got to put some effort to
actually open the phone up the other
question I had was a 4.6 inch screen a
couple years ago you know
seemed like a normal-size screen but
it's small by today's standards and
you've got a very tall sort of amount of
real estate here so the 4.6 and screens
got gigantic bezels on the top and
bottom you could look at anything we'd
say okay I know what changes are gonna
come for Gen 2 that would probably the
first thing that I would call out but
having said that it's still very usable
and it's still a four point six inch
screen even if the aspect ratio might be
a little bit weird and you can use a
closed like you would use any Samsung
phone with one UI there's no sort of
degraded experience it's not like a half
phone with the spring clothes you can do
anything you want and when you talk
about the Galaxy fold the biggest
question and maybe the elephant in the
room was the inside screen itself is
there going to be a crease and as a
crease going to sort of impact what
you're doing so the crease is here and
it's definitely visible you can see it
you can feel it even when you run your
finger across it I don't mind it I'm
trying to give you some perspective it's
a foldable display there's got to be
some sort of give here you can't have a
glass screen that can bend it's sort of
a plasticy polymer blend on top of it I
don't mind it assuming it's not gonna
get worse over time it's pretty good as
is but it is definitely there but I
don't think it's a grades at all from
using the Galaxy fold so I think one of
the biggest compliments that I can give
the two screens on the fold is that they
look like Samsung screens and I've said
it for several generations of Samsung
devices they make the best screens in
the market and these two displays are no
exception the outer screen it looks
beautiful when you open it up you're
still getting that OLED technology and
it looks really good and so you might
think 7.3 inches is gonna be a bit weird
to hold because of the almost 4 by 3
aspect ratio it actually sits really
nicely in one hand lens itself even
better if when you want to use things
with two hands so typing is really
natural and because the screen is kind
of split you're almost getting like two
galaxy s 10 real estate one on each
that you can work with so you got a ton
of space here I tell all of that stuff
is fine the screens like the hardware
feels good software experience samsung
has got a lot riding on this not being a
degraded or weirdly strange software
experience if you've used samsung 1u i
recently this is actually going to feel
very familiar so it's got something
called app continuity and I thought that
was only that Samsung did themselves but
turns out they've worked very closely
with Google it's actually baked into
Android pious what you're doing on one
screen will show up on the other screen
when you open it up and most apps are
supported and developers have access or
to make all of their apps be supported
so I've had no lag issues at all and
I've had eight apps open at one time on
this thing and everything works
it is a multitasking powerhouse and in
fact you could have one device that can
do multiple things and one device that
can take over multiple form factors
really awesome
so there's a lot of stuff you can do
with it but the most interesting use
case I think is with the cameras so this
camera suite is pretty much taken
exactly from the galaxy s 10 plus when
you open this thing up and you use this
giant 7.3 inch screen as a viewfinder it
is incredible
selfies looked terrifying I'm not used
to seeing myself on that giant of a
screen but you think it has a viewfinder
being able to see that wide-angle lens
is a really really unique experience so
if you take a lot of pictures and you
want a viewfinder you're not gonna look
as ridiculous as holding a giant tablet
up you know taking taking a photo this
is a really cool way to do it so if you
couldn't tell on a whole I really like
the galaxy fold in fact I'm surprised by
how much I like the galaxy fold but it's
not perfect and it's certainly a Gen 1
device there's a huge notch in the upper
right hand corner you can kind of hide
it in software but it is there I don't
mind that the fingerprint reader is
built into the side what is weird though
it's not built into the power button
that's built into the big speed button
so anytime you push that in you're going
to
bixby know you can remap it or maybe a
double tap lip in Bixby but it is not
the power but that's located right above
fingerprint reader that seems a little
bit strange to me there's a lot of open
real estate obviously on the front
screen I talked about that factoring in
those few things least initially the
aren't that many things that I don't
like about the Galaxy fold Samsung did a
really nice job here when the first note
came out it's singing him ridiculous and
out of every phone that I've ever tested
in my time reviewing them I have never
had more people stop me in public than
when I was using the very first Galaxy
Note it was so jarring and so different
from what the mobile status quo was that
peoples didn't know what to think of it
it seems silly it seems ridiculous and
you can't figure out why somebody would
want that or want to spend the money for
it but retrospectively you look back on
five ten years from now I think we look
back on the old is the same way as a
note how could we imagine our lives
without foldable screens how could we
unfold into a tablet how could we change
our screens to replace the laptops the
fold is a really big paradigm shift for
how we use phones I think more
importantly what our phones are capable
of doing and I give Samsung a ton of
credit for that so in my 10 plus years
of current technology I haven't seen
that many firsts I've had a chance to be
a part of a few momentous tech paradigm
changes but I feel like the galaxy fold
is one of those it's really the first
foldable phone that's coming out to the
mass market it's one of the first
devices that's doing something new it's
changing literally and think it's
figuratively the shape of smartphones
and I'm excited for it the galaxy fold
Gen 1 might not be for everybody it's
very expensive with its own quirks if
you look at what it represents how it's
going to change the industry in five six
seven years I think we'll look back the
folds launched as a
something new</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
