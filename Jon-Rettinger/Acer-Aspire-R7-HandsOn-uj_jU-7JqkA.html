checking out the Acer Aspire r7 so this
is a very special laptop it's actually
convertible so I want to show you
something really cool
so this is Windows 8 64-bit this is the
core i5 here at the show but they will
have core i7 as well 4th Gen Intel
everything that you would want out of a
high-end laptop
it's a 15.6 inch screen full HD display
IPS tech in there TFT LCD it's very very
nice looks great and it is in fact it is
a touchscreen which is fantastic it's
got a nvidia geforce GT 750 m GPU in
there 8 gigs of ddr3 RAM so a pretty
beastly little machine but here's the
cool part about the aspire r7
interestingly enough you can see the
trackpad is actually up here which
honestly with a touchscreen laptop
something that you have multi-touch
available it actually makes a lot of
sense because your hands are gonna be
here and here a lot so you don't
actually have to go back down and back
up
which I really like this is a really
interesting sort of design feature but
here's where it gets cool so if you
don't want to use the touchpad you can
actually just go ahead and bring that
down like that if you want to show
somebody something you flip it this way
and it will actually flip the screen
just like you would see on an iPad or
anything like that so if you want to
show off what's on your screen while you
are typing there's no way of course to
see what is happening on your screen
while you're typing but you can do that
and then also of course if you want to
close it up you just push it back like
this and there you go it's just a plain
old laptop it is a little hefty I'll
give it that but a really nice design
this is a really interesting sort of
thing and I think that we're gonna be
seeing a lot more of this as time goes
on is we start seeing desktop OS is
really integrate touch screens it'll be
very interesting to see how the market
responds this I want to see if consumers
really love devices like this I would
imagine to be a pretty popular item for
anybody who really loves having that
touch screen experience it is very
smooth which is really nice I mean I've
been enjoying using this for the last
ten minutes or so and I really love the
convertible aspect I actually really do
like the fact that if you're using it as
a regular laptop you have your touchpad
here that is the Acer Aspire r7 you can
check out all of our content on
TechnoBuffalo comm for any information
