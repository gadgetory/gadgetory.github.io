esta Shalom Bonjour Bonjour no aah
konichiwa what is up I'm going from
technobuffalo I am heading out the door
in just a minute going to take off this
jacket put on my official TechnoBuffalo
professional blogging sweatshirt and I'm
going to San Francisco meet John over at
fort mason for the big HP event you know
I don't even know if we're going to see
this word on a gadget anymore palm well
we do know is we're going to see new
stuff from them the new version of webos
running on I'm pretty sure we're going
to see both smartphone and tablet form
factors possibly hopefully more than one
of each also a bunch of talk about some
educational stuff which would be really
cool I think that's a place where HP
could really make some inroads actually
with webos education traditionally you
know when an apple stronghold then we do
it a lot with education lately and I
used to work in schools you might not
know this i used to be a teacher on a
school IT guy and windows is tough to
administer in a school environment
anyway you didn't want to hear about
that what you want to hear is what's
going on the event I'm saying there may
be some educational stuff but you know
smartphones tablets whatever it is
Johnny are going to be there we're going
to be live-blogging it starting we're
going to you know probably start up
around quarter of 10 this is pacific
time today wednesday remember a knife
the event starts at ten a.m. pacific
that's 11 12 1 p.m. on the east coast of
the US and we're hoping to be in there
get the lab all go on a couple mins
before hand so tune in to TechnoBuffalo
calm 9 45 a.m. pacific 1245 p.m. east
coast time and the event starts at ten
usually these things start you know
pretty close to on time we'll live blog
it and then amelie afterwards we'll
fight all the other bloggers but we'll
have the benefit of our technical
buffalo blogging sweatshirts to help
protect us and we'll fight all the other
bloggers to get hands-on we'll get you a
video get your photos will get your
hands on impressions with whatever it is
they announced whatever we can get our
paws on we will tell you what we think
get you some video so they're young time
what do you think they're gonna announce
