to you by 23andme what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rumor
roundup I'm realest jon rettinger this
the title should give it away we take
all the tech rumors from the week that
you might not have seen or don't get a
chance to keep up with and we give them
to you in one video so you know
everything that is happening in this
geeky world so up this week we got
rumors of the Nexus 5 coming in october
with key lime pie in tow nikon getting
into the smartphone business slo-mo
video might be coming to the iphone 5s
and samsung pretty much just confirms
what we all know that the note 3 is
coming this rumor roundup i'm jon
rettinger let's start rounding things up
so with all the recent hype surrounding
the Moto X smartphone if you forget
about the long river Nexus 5 but a new
report from the Korean site and I love
saying this name damn that's right
Korean site is called damn damn the site
claims the nexus 4 successor will hit
the market in October 2013 article also
notes that the handset will run android
5.0 rumor to be called the very
delicious flavored key lime pie and is
being developed by LG alongside the
incoming optimus g2 although we take
those rumors with more than a few grains
of salt we won't know really anything
about the nexus 5 for sure until Google
makes its announcement on its own but
the report does make sense considering
LG develop the previous Nexus 4 and
dropped a few hints dad's working on the
handset successor of course is all super
speculation it's always fun to think
about what Google has in store for us
nikon is looking again into smartphones
don't nikon come here i let me reason
with you let me tell you a secret stay
away from smartphones you don't make
phones it's not gonna work garmin try to
be for you and everybody remembers the
smashing success the nuvi phone was you
make a really good camera stick with
that if you want to do something maybe
license your lens technology to sony to
nokia to motorola samsung somewhere this
you can put your name on a smartphone
but don't go that road so bloomberg is
reporting that nikon is trying to find a
way to grab a slice the smartphone
market after night
president makato Kimura noted its
point-and-shoot sales dropped around
twenty five percent from April and May
of last year while smartphone shipments
ballooned by forty six percent almost
725 million units the markets were
pointing to cameras is declining
steadily as more and more smartphone
makers include high-end lenses and
software into making compact cameras
obsolete Kimura said we want to create a
product that would change the concept of
cameras it could be an on-camera
consumer product so whether that means
light comes in the mark to specifically
design its own smartphone make an add-on
lens for flagship devices like the
iPhone and HTC One record something
entirely different remains to be seen
any way you slice it though I'm kind of
intrigued just to see the potential
train wreck or huge success that it
could be slo-mo video might be going to
the iphone 5s what's that I think it's a
collective yawn of every android fanboy
out there yay slo-mo vo we've had apps
that do that according to code found
hidden too deep in the bowels of iOS 7
new feature referred to as mogul what a
cool name users record video at 120
frames per second it's unclear
resolution the mode would record video
in I'm thinking just like jumping off
the diving board slow motion hmmm Jean
Apple include big features in s
smartphones least in the past Apple's
iPhone 4s Scott Siri on a megapixel
camera for example of the iphone 5s
might also prove its camera while
getting mogul as a flagship software
feature folks at 9to5 mac attended to
activate mogul on an iphone 5 and
excellent shooter in its own right but
it wouldn't work however the code exists
inside the iOS 7 beta suggest the
feature is incoming so Samsung appears
to have inadvertently confirmed the
galaxy note 3 referring to the rumored
phablet on two separate user agent
profiles as the sm n 9 t.t and the SMN
908 both models come equipped with a
1080 x 1920 pixel and arm 11 processor I
can't wait to see 1080 on that gorgeous
giant screen the appearance of multiple
galaxy note 3 model numbers support
recent rumors that Samsung's upcoming
phablet will launch in several different
versions which is no surprise but
according to report from eTnews the note
3 will come in four different variants
they all feature the same process for
different when it comes to display
camera and other hardware so similar to
the galaxy s4 family it's possible at
Samsung could release a waterproof note
3 active right note 3 zoom with and over
werd camera galaxy note 3 is expected to
launch this September in Berlin is part
of 2003 IFA expo which we will be at
however it's unclear stance unveil a
device part of the event or nearby and
special press conference I'm betting a
little bit before a special conference
I'm super jazz for a note 3 mostly at
1080p display i think the note 2 i was a
pretty powerful phone so taking that
platform already works really well and
make it more powerful or i think it's
gonna be a real winning combination love

lot of rumors let me stop and thank our
