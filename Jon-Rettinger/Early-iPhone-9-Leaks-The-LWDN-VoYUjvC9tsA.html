Rosenfeld and welcome back to the
lowdown if you missed episode number one
on Tuesday let me welcome me to our
newest show I am here to break down the
three biggest stories making headlines
in the tech world and give you the
information that you really need to know
let's get you all cut up to speed with
today's tech news here's the lowdown
i upon rumor season is in full effect
we're learning that at least one new
iphone may be getting a splash of color
analyst Ming Chico who's got a pretty
credible track record is reporting that
one of the new iPhone models launching
this fall will have a 6.1 inch LCD
display costs less than $700 and come in
a variety of different color options
including red white grey orange and blue
the reports are clear that these color
options would be limited to the
second-tier iPhone with the flagship
model coming in the standard space gray
and silver but also the possibility of a
gold color option which you may remember
the iPhone 10 was supposed to have back
when it launched but allegedly those
plans were scrapped due to manufacturing
issues were you guys a fan of that
iPhone 5c with all the different color
options back in the day and also do you
think the Apple should offer more color
options on their flagship phones and not
just limited to their second-tier
iPhones let us know your favorite source
of binge worthy content may be getting a
little bit more expensive
after some users online started posting
about updated Netflix pricing the
streaming giant confirmed they are in
fact testing an ultra tear to a small
number of European customers that would
be $3.00 more expensive than the current
top tier right now the new plan would
essentially offer all the same benefits
as the current high-end premium tier but
it would retain support for HDR content
streaming while the current premium tier
would lose it there are also various
reports from some users saying the
premium tier would change from allowing
for simultaneous video streams to only
allowing two essentially pushing
streaming heavy families or friends who
also a Netflix bill over to the higher
end $17 a month plan well we haven't
heard anything official on that from
Netflix in fact the company is
emphasizing that we may not ever see
these plans they may not offer these
specific plans with the features and
pricing they're talking about right now
but they're just trying to get a better
understanding of how consumers of value
the Netflix service interesting a new
rumor suggests that Microsoft is
planning to release a cheaper surface
tablet to directly take aim at Apple's
cheapest iPad we've learned from FCC
filings that Microsoft is working on a
line of surface tablets with 10 inch
screens rounded corners in a lighter
smaller form factor the new line would
not be running Intel's Core i5 or i7 the
most likely cheaper and less powerful
processors the
silver and 5000 also made by Intel the
entry-level model is expected to serve
$400 and looks to be geared towards
students kind of the exact same market
apples going forward their new iPad that
costs three hundred and thirty dollars

iPhones Netflix pricing and these new
rumored surface devices leave a comment
