incredible I'm probably dating myself
here I probably not because you probably
have no idea what I'm talking about it
was so long ago but I don't know for
some reason when I when I got the email
from Verizon they were gonna send over
the drug incredible - all I could think
about was Fran Tarkenton being on that
show but now it's not a TV show it's the
Droid Incredible - is it incredible or
is it just kind of mediocre because
there's enough for G let's find out
all right so the original droid
incredible oh wait sorry hey what's up
everybody i'm known from TechnoBuffalo
the original Droid Incredible was
honestly one of my favorite Android
phones of its generation I guess of last
year it was the phone that I always told
friends of mine it was always the answer
to the question hey I'm on Verizon but I
really want an iPhone what should I do
and my answer was always get a droid
incredible or you know switch to AT&amp;amp;T
nice phone now of course the answer to
that question is get an iPhone can
you're on Verizon but still did run
incredible one of I think the old time I
don't know one of my favorite Android
phones like I said from the that
original slew of Android phones so
here's the successor I it will be
available on April 28th from Verizon for
199.99 with a two-year agreement
obviously made by HTC Android phone with
with Android 2.2 HTC Sense it's got a 1
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
in there and it's not a 4G phone it's
it's 3g only so I'm not taking advantage
of the new LTE network also in the Box
you get the HTC AC charger port number
80 r6 32 5vw and the HTC micro HD micro
USB cable part number oh there's a lot
of parts there I don't think there's
really part number so if you notice me
something else and then you also get
your manuals Master your device all that
stuff and these nice little cornstarch
bags that are so you go friendly so like
the original incredible Android HTC
Sense all that it's got a similar back
with the texture to the Concorde
Concorde the contoured back panel with
you know the little levels kind of
topographical and kind of a soft grip
plastic back
you've got two full two phones two
cameras on this device though there's a
front-facing camera now for video chat
and self-portraits and all that good
stuff and then of course the main camera
on the back the main camera is an 8
megapixel deal with dual LED flash the
front 1.3 megapixels and then you can do
720p HD video cab
and the device supports DLNA so you can
wirelessly share your fabulous home
movies to DLNA equipped TVs and other
stuff like all that Smart TV stuff we've
been doing a lot of those things have
DLNA or some some form of DLNA different
companies different names for it anyway
you've also got the 3G mobile hotspot
service that can support up to 5 enabled
devices and again 200 bucks on contracts
so the the thunderbolt which is HTC's 4G
phone and now the Droid Charge both
there's both of those have a premium
both those are I'm trying to say is
Verizon LTE devices and both of those
you're paying a little bit more for the
four TV at the Droid Charge to $99.99 on
contract of course it does come with a
32 gigabyte SD card as does the
Thunderbolt for that matter anyway
here's the phone itself and it seems to
be pretty zippy from the get-go nice and
responsive it's it's you know pretty
thin its lightweight this the
topographical back panel here the
contoured thing kind of makes it feel
thinner around the edges which is nice
and when you're holding it you know it
gives that feeling of being being
thinner than it actually is in the
bottom but even still not all that thick
of a phone really you've got a four inch
Super LCD display and on first glance it
looks very nice it's going to the
usually they ship with some sample
photos no sample photos here all right
well I'm gonna have to have to go onto
the interwebs so loading Google right up
a nice to see Verizon's and network
gives me back an order after the LTE
outage yesterday I actually I was trying
to get online in San Francisco has at
the app nation conference and I was
trying to get online using the my
Verizon LTE modem and let's go Kate
Beckinsale and I could not get on even
on 3G I could see the 3G network which
just could not connect so lots of
problems all over the country yesterday
but anything seems to be back in order
today so uh you know using using
my photos to try to show off the
capability to display not really good
idea but there are any photos in here so
we'll see if they have any any videos it
is interesting usually you see usually
they ship with some some sample stuff
not on this one apparently we're gonna
need for speed shift maybe that'll
that'll show off the display oh I have
to download exit alright nevermind
welcome back welcome back with a full
review and that's when we're really
really check out the the screen
capabilities this is just supposed to be
an unboxing anyway but I you know you
get an idea four inch Super LCD display
definitely looks good uh you know going
head to head with those new Samsung's
though that I just taped today is good
to go episode with with James Kendrick
and he's got the Droid Charge our Droid
Charge is on its way or perhaps already
in John Rhett injure his hands and James
is telling me the screen on the Droid
Charge is just incredible this Super
AMOLED plus 4.3 inch and I saw some of
the Samsung stuff at the conference I
was that yesterday they had a they had a
stand and I was checking out um
the galaxy the galaxy 5 and galaxy 4
players and then they also had the
galaxy s2 which is a beast of a phone
and the displays on those very very
sharp as well so I have to see how the
Super LCD holds up but uh so far it
definitely looks good again it make it
make it eight megapixels on the back I'm
having trouble speaking today 1.3
megapixel on the front you've got Adobe
Flash support you've got that is a one
heck of a funnel cloud coming down the
street there you've got a flash support
you've got SRS Wow HD surround sound
face detection technology and the camera
in grid noise cancellation technology
I'm just reading the features off and
the plans start at 39.99 a month for
voice and $29.99 for unlimited
smartphone data so you're looking at you
know 70 bucks and up for a voice and
data plan and then of course the
optional 3G hotspot capability as well
so there you go unboxing quick
with the droid incredible - it feels
really nice it feels a little more just
a tiny bit more sophisticated or a
rugged or something in its design than
the original incredible I really like I
said I really like the original
incredible so even though this one is
not f/4g it may well still be worthy of
the incredible name and you know not
everybody needs to forge you just yet
because it's not ruled out everywhere
yet much much more on the incredible -
and all the other phones here's the
Thunderbolt give you a quick size
comparison there's the 4.3 inch
Thunderbolt and there's the 4 inch
dredge incredible - next to it so is
there a battery power in this one I
don't think this one no I was going to
show you the screen there's no battery
power in it
there you go the incredible - the Droid
Charge is coming like I said down Jon's
way a slew of tablets that came in last
week all kinds of stuff the t-mobile g2
acts you know it's on and on and on
again and then and recently just some
plans some stuff looked at about the
next generation of Snapdragon and 1.5
gigahertz dual course now welcomes
uplink conference is down in San Diego
in oh I think in less than a month
so should see some news coming out of
there but we'll have more on the
incredible - for sure over on
TechnoBuffalo calm so next time my name
is Noah and y'all know John I think's
gonna hit you up with the charge pretty
soon we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
