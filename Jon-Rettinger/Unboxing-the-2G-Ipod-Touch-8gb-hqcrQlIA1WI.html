unboxing for you of an 8 gigabyte ipod
touch this just a review unit so let's
go ahead and dig in and get started
anticipate the experience using this for
the few weeks that i have it will just
be like an iphone - the phone clears the
box itself it's got a picture of the
unit on the front and the ipod is kind
of right behind that picture really thin
packaging it says ipod touch little
apple logo on the back ipod on the side
it's very hard plastic you really think
will definitely protect it for shipping
let's open it up right here on top it's
got a little tab if I pull that makes of
pulling off plastic farting noise and we
can open this thing
the plastic just come to it open it's
hinged on the back there's the iPod
inside like it's secured in a little bit
with another piece of tape then pull up
tape off again and it actually takes the
cover and the picture right off with it
there that goes that looks like an iPod
sticker on my desk I just pull this
whole thing right out here it goes ad it
comes last thing is very thin I'm
actually pretty surprised go ahead and
keep pulling this out it's kind of
sitting on a piece of hard plastic right
there see what else comes in the box
designed by Apple in California of
course it is
iPod Touch little booklet nothing
terribly exciting there sinking in
charging cable Universal dock classic
piece and your iPod headphones nothing
terribly exciting and there but is nice
to see what Apple included it's actually
very impressive how they included all
this in such a small package also the
appears to be a little cleaning cloth
right in the middle let's go ahead and
take a look at
the device itself so here it is very
very very thin and probably the one time
you'll see it on the back without any
fingerprints you can see the flip minnow
and me right there the reflection hey
guys
giving you a smile
there's the antenna for the Wi-Fi and
just a kind of a metal ish mirror finish
to the back the one button on the front
let's go ahead and give this a necessary
comparison to the iPhone look at them
from right on the top you really can't
tell a difference other than the iPhones
got that speaker piece right there that
the iPod Touch it doesn't let's go ahead
and do the thickness test the iPod is
much thinner so it's ridiculously thin
very impressive but it's not so thin
that it feels like you're going to snap
in half if you definitely feel secure so
we've got your main button on the side
volume rocker up and down on the left
side the bottom is your dock connector
and your 3.5 millimeter headset jack
port nothing on the right side of the
device and the power button on the top
let's see if this has any sort of charge
in it it's like it's got enough look
just like the iPhone I'm going to turn
it on nice Apple boot screen here it's
cool with the sticker let's say I've got
a iPod stuck to my desk
so it's telling me that I gotta plug in
and sync it with iTunes I'll go ahead
and do that a little bit later I just
want you guys to see this and let you
know what I thought so hope you enjoyed
the unboxing I'll use it for a couple
weeks like I said and do a review before
I gotta send it back hope you enjoyed
