two of the best single shooter
smartphones you can get on the market
right now both share a lot of
similarities and differences with their
larger siblings the 10s max in the three
XL but these phones come in a smaller
form factor and a lower price at or
around that $800 price point and yes
there are many differences between the
iPhone 10 R and the pixel 3 and if you
guys are interested in an all versus
video between these two phones leave a
comment down below and let us know but
for the purposes of this video I'm
sticking to one subject and one subject
only and that's all about the camera
these two phones have many differences
when it comes to both hardware and
software but their camera systems are
strikingly similar they both feature 12
megapixel rear shooters with an F 1.8
aperture support HDR and rely heavily on
onboard software to do all of their
image processing from photos all the way
to portrait mode photos without any help
from a secondary lens somebody to start
off by saying this in most scenarios and
in most environments you're gonna get
great-looking photos from both of these
phones and in most cases the photos are
gonna take are gonna look nearly
identical you're not really gonna notice
a difference unless you're looking at a
side-by-side comparison like this video
you're gonna get great-looking photos
from both of these phones though there
are some differences here you're gonna
want to pay attention to and we covered
many of them when we compared the pixel
3 to the iPhone 10s and those
differences that we talked about in that
video still pertain here as well the
pixel tends to shoot cooler while the
10r shoots warmer the pixel threes
photos have more contrasts and shadows
while the 10r attempts to brighten up
all the darker parts of the image with
smart HDR and to my eye the pixel threes
photos seemed a little over sharpened in
a little over process in some instances
when compared to the 10 hour portrait
mode is a big feature on both of these
phones and both the pixel 3 and the 10
are are relying heavily on onboard
software to do all of this processing
and achieve this effect there is no
secondary lens to work with on either of
these phones the 10-hour software
processing is currently only optimized
to work with faces so there is no option
to take a portrait photo of your food or
your pet or anything else the pixel 3 on
the other hand it doesn't have this
limitation you can take a portrait shot
of just about anything both phones can
sometimes struggle to accurately cut
you're subject from the background but
generally the effect is gonna work
pretty well on both of these phones and
the same differences in processing the
warmer and cooler tones and the
sharpness and all that stuff we
mentioned earlier are gonna apply here
as well also if you were admiring that
carbon fiber skin on the tennis max then
you're definitely gonna want to check
out dbrand I got a bunch of different
skins and a bunch of different ways you
can customize your device and make you
kind of stand out add a little bit of
your own Flair and make it look
different kind of like adding a marbled
skin on to that blue iPhone ten are they
offer customizable skins for a bunch of
different phones and gadgets and
different devices and if you're kind of
looking to change things up turn your
old phone new again click that link down
below to learn more and see all of
they've got to offer another big
difference between these two phones is
the front-facing camera system on the
iPhone 10 are you've got a seven
megapixel sensor same as on the 10s and
10's max but on the pixel three you've
got that same setup as on the three XL
which is dual eight megapixel sensors
it's gonna allow you to take standard
and wide-angle selfies and it's a little
bit cooler than you may think even if
you're just by yourself that wide-angle
something kind of give your photo a
unique and different looking kind of
just changes things up a bit
have the option to switch between these
different focal lengths on the pixel is
very nice and photos on these
front-facing sensors are going to be
processed in the same way as on the rear
so with the pixel it's either good or
bad depending on how you look at it to
me it's just a little bit over sharpen
though that can be adjusted though it
lacks that wider angle lens the 10r
stole takes great-looking selfies and
with the recent release of iOS 12.1 that
heavy noise reduction turns skin
smoothing seems to be a little bit more
improved a little bit more subdued and
not as bad as what we were saying before
both the iPhone 10 are and pixel 3 have
their own slew of special software
features but I do want to mention two
here that I think are really important
and that super resume and nitesite in
this super zoomed in photo both phones
are doing a 100% digital zoom it doesn't
look pretty on either of them though the
pixels super resume feature temps to
kind of put the pieces back together in
software and gets you a little bit more
closer to your subject and also gives
you just a bit more detail than what
you're gonna find on the iPhone 10 are
though sometimes it can come off a
little bit cartoony in a way and the
pixel 3 is at nights 8 feature is also
getting a ton of praise and notice
unofficially out the photos we're seeing
it from its silo 2 apk
look extremely impressive and I think we
all thought Google was kind of
exaggerating a bit during their keynote
but if the final version of this feature
looks anything like this it's gonna be
very impressive and a pretty big deal if
you take a lot of low-light photos
before we wrap things up here's a quick
look at video on both phones the iPhone
10 R has a slightly upper hand too being
able to shoot 4k video at 60 frames per
second versus 4k 30 from the pixel 3
both phones have stabilization both are
gonna take really good looking video
though personally I prefer the iPhones
video over the pixel just because I find
the colors and disable ization a bit
better on the 10r then on the pixel 3
alright so in the end there's no denying
that both these phones are daily driver
worthy they have great camera systems
that are powerful versatile and can take
some pretty great looking shots and the
differences here really come down to
software more than they do Hardware
there is just a clear difference between
how the iPhone and iOS process photos
over how pixel and Android does it and
what you prefer is gonna come down to
how you prefer your photos to look I
said this in the last video I personally
prefer the way the pixel processes
photos over how the iPhone does it
I think the pixel shoots great-looking
photos that I can share immediately and
required a little to no tweaking on my
part
well the iPhone can take a great-looking
photo as well but it just takes a bit
more tweaking to get it looking just
right alright so now that you guys have
seen the photo samples for yourself
which one do you choose and why do you
like the way the iPhone 10 are handles
photo processing do you like that super
wide angle camera on the pixel 3 &amp;amp; 3 XL
which one would you choose and why leave
a comment down below and let us know
when thumbs this video up if you like
and want to see more videos like this I
am Robert Rosenthal from TechnoBuffalo
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
