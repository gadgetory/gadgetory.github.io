brought to you by go daddy wallow down
John Q here from TechnoBuffalo and
welcome to what see apps in the last
fantastic episode suffices sire the suf
see this user asked me if I can check
out some iOS applications for University
or College of course you can just go to
the App Store and find whatever
miscellaneous application that might be
related to your academic study but I
feel like it's more important to find
something that everyone can use so for
this episode of WT a I'm a list one two
three applications that'll do just that
personally I feel like organization you
know staying on top of your tasks
sending writing highlighting those
setting reminders for social events due
date study dates labs projects heck even
setting an alarm or reminder to wake you
up at 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. in the morning
for your morning class all of this is
really really important and nowadays
with all of our fancy gizmos and gadgets
all of these organizational tools aka
applications are right at our fingertips
granted these app steps and procedures
won't necessarily make you any smarter
academically they'll help you stay
prepared and help you stay organized to
make sure you get done whatever it is
you need to get done I just mmm like
that with this face right here mmm get
things done with this face like this I'm
a huge fan of all the New Age
cloud-based auto synching services wall
of your devices gadgets and and even
your Android powered Wi-Fi enabled
microwave they're all synched up all
ready to go and they're all on the same
page it's wonderful it's glorious that's
what it is it's glorious the first app
on the list is Remember The Milk RTM is
the ultimate to-do list task management
service that doubles as reminders the
iOS apps are absolutely fantastic
RTM is really basic and really simple
but that's a good thing just entering
your tasks maybe creating some
categories tag it a few tags and you're
done you can even set priorities due
dates and reminders and I love the RTM
reminder system I have my RTM account
send me an email every day at 9 a.m.
listing everything I need to do for that
day it helps me stay organized and most
importantly it makes me feel really
good about myself makes you feel
important you know no all business like
whatever that means a downside for this
application would be that the desk top
aka the web version isn't really as
polished as the iPhone or iPad apps just
just my opinion and although the service
and the apps are technically free I
highly recommend upgrading your account
to pro as it has push notifications for
your application and it has unlimited
Auto syncing a totally free alternative
is something called wonder list I
actually found out about this
application today and it looks fantastic
I haven't used it enough to give it a
full review but I thought I'd mention it
next up is Evernote I was a long time
awesome note user because it synced up
wonderfully with my gmail account I
started using Evernote after it was
recommended to me from a friend and I
never went back like RTM is wonderfully
simple and syncs seamlessly it just
works let's say you're in class and you
don't have your awesome laptop with you
that's fine but you conveniently have
your iPad with you because goodness
knows you can't let go of that plants
vs. zombie game so you always have this
thing with you all you got to do is pull
that iPad out of your backpack knapsack
or whatever you want to call it smack it
on your desk and everyone around you be
like whoa this guy is awesome you just
smacked his iPad on his desk
open up Evernote's and start taking
notes like that be a baller be a baller
like that this scenario most likely is a
university or college thing because I
don't think your high school teachers
will appreciate you whipping out your
iPhone or iPad to take notes although
they might they might nowadays I don't
know I'm old school like that so I don't
know man I'm no idea in fact I use
Evernote for every single video project
that I have to work on whether it's my
entire script thought to write down time
codes or just random video notes it just
worked beautifully and you know what
it's free it's wonderful it's awesome
can't find another adjective right now
then super tastic this unlike RTM which
doesn't actually have an official
desktop version the Evernote desktop app
is epic and speaking of epic imma take
some time to thank our sponsors at
GoDaddy with go daddy you get reliable
and secure web hosting with no long term
contract Go Daddy's hosting plans are
now bigger and better than ever with
99.99
uptime free 24/7 support with no annual
commitment and check this out you can
also download Go Daddy's free iPhone
Android or Blackberry application so you
can order and manage domain names right
from your phone and more check out
revision three.com slash go daddy for a
list of all of the amazing go daddy
deals and if you enter in the coupon
code Buffalo one that's be uff alo one
you get 10% off any order which is
amazing and with that back to the review
and last but not least would be Doc's to
go you don't really need this
application if you have Evernote but if
you have a lot of essays that were
written with something like Microsoft
Word this application will come in handy
as you can open edit and save docx files
I wouldn't necessarily recommend writing
your entire 20 page thesis or analysis
of why fast food is bad for you or why
I'm so fantastic but you can jot down
some notes and finish it off later on
with your laptop or desktop computer
I originally got this app to open
spreadsheets it does a decent job
meaning that it can open it but barely
do anything else you can edit the Excel
document sure but not by much and forget
about copying and pasting multiple cells
cuz you just can't
and although this application isn't free
$9.99 will get you both the iPhone and
iPad versions which is pretty neat you
know it's like a two-in-one deal well
their YouTube username I can't pronounce
and all your other fine folks out there
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
if you want me to check out any other
applications feel free to leave a
comment below thank you very much for
tuning in this was john to you from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys next
time it is
with Joe daddy with Go Daddy with with
Joe today I don't think I don't think
I'm allowed to do that with Joe today
with crap I can't do the real one now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
