to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone walk back the episode of ask
the Buffaloes to show you could ask me
jon rettinger any question you've got
from the world of technology gatsby a
personal question ask me anything about
techno Buffalo asking why it burns when
you pee whatever it might be I can try
and make up an answer up this week we're
talk about iOS 8 surface pro 3 vs ipad
OS 10 Yosemite dump round say yo smite
and the next gen samsung phones ask the
buffalo start asking me questions first
question comes from twitter at DC camper
at 21 ass hey at john for lakers do you
think apple is going to start to allow
more customization in iOS along with the
keyboard options in iOS 8 if they do
exactly for another year so we just saw
iOS 8 and they did get a little more
customized the apples been super locked
down third-party keyboards super nice
third-party widgets is now kind of
awesome that's about as third parties
going to get outside of apps but for
Apple those are sort of giant steps for
android that's sort of like a pad that
forever but they are opening up a little
bit more I think we're going to sort of
see that open up maybe gradually each
iteration of the OS first thing I'm
happy just out there party keyboards and
widgets now but why don't they fully
open up the OS I doubt we'll ever ever
see that but like most things baby steps
our next question comes from a tme 632
ass at jump for lakers you choose the
microsoft surface pro 3 over the ipad
air so on first blush that sounds like
asking somebody hey ja was better this
orange or this goldfish the to just very
different things the surface pro 3 kind
of tries to be everything to everyone
tries to be a tablet and a full-fledged
computer we saw our review the surface
pro 3 which ruling kind of right down
below and annotate on the screen right
now I loved the surface pro 3 on the
surface pro 3 starting in about a
hundred bucks only a few hundred hours
more you know then serving decently
spect ipad air so if you're not fully
ensconced in the Apple world I could
hold hard
recommend surface pro 3 if you're doing
a lot of media creation you may be doing
a lot of word editing or you need
something to take notes on or you want
to do something like gaming or video
editing slippers both reason awesome
tablet if all you do is media
consumption all you do is watch netflix
or go on the web the ipad air is an
awesome tablet or even sore the ipad
mini fun to check that out it's a really
depend on what you're going to use it
for but if you want a computer in a
tablet in my mind there is nothing
better out there than the surface pro 3
next question comes from any OS 42s at
junk for lakers what are you most
excited about Mac os10 Yosemite that is
super easy for me I am so happy be able
to answer phone calls from a phone and I
know Google Talk kind of do that for a
while but I keep my headphones on all
the time they got inline mic on it I all
times take my headphones off answer the
phone bill just do it on the computer
will make life so so so so much easier
i'm also excited for the handoff that's
kind of a cool thing to have a be able
to answer phone calls super awesome
video to send actual SMS and not ims of
users all super cool being able to
answer the phone that is the killer
feature for me what do you guys think
what's your killer feature your thoughts
on it down here I will read them we
could have conversations which chat
about it we stopped the questions just
real fast I think our friends at Dollar
Shave Club listen if you're dude you
know that buying razors just kind of
sucks you got to go to the store get the
key of the Placid razor fortress thing
you then she'll out just a stupid amount
of money for some razor tech you
probably don't need my razor works fine
before vibrating handles and laser
pointers I'm a cat does love it but
fortunately there's a company that's
doing away with all of that similis
stupid ridiculousness it is called
Dollar Shave Club they made it just
stupid simple for a few bucks a month
Dollar Shave Club ships amazing razors
and other bathrooms sundries right to
your door but don't worry their planes
of just good as any other companies out
there at a fraction of the price take
the same quality in your saving money
I've also got dr. Carver's easy shea
butter to make a shave even more buttery
smooth shave time shave money join now
at Dollar Shave Club calm /
technobuffalo not back to the questions
our next question comes from our old
friend yeah me 613 who asked at john for
lakers think companies like Samsung put
so many specs in a phone card too
up for next release what do you think I
think that's not true things get better
and better even if you keep the specs
the same you know hardware wise things
get better processors get faster you can
always add more RAM anyway that field
always up the resolution the screen or
increase the battery size is that kind
of thing but you can always add more
megapixels you can always put in more
power and that sort of makes phones
better you know operating systems need
more power android especially as
relatively power-hungry smelted provide
all of that sort of gigahertz
awesomeness I think is really important
especially as operates to get more more
advanced things go more cores I don't
think it's really going to be an issue
at all things are always getting better
way they've been a really cool times
just roof appreciate that that like
phones are getting better think about
what your computer was if you had a
laptop or a desktop like four years ago
chances are the specs are pretty even to
what the phone in your pocket has now
that's only going to become more
pronounced over the next few years it
just I know it's kind of cool so thank

Buffalo if you want to get a question
