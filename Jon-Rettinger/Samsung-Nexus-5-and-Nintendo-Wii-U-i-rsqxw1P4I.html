to you by godaddy hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the shower you can ask me
Ashley it's gather any question you
might have for the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo calm
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise send them to me
anytime on twitter at TechnoBuffalo or
at ashley escada just use the hashtag
ask the be so i see it and usually i
answer around four questions every
episode so let's get going this is asked
above at techmaster 4898 says why is
samsung the most popular Android
smartphone maker and not someone else
well my friend this is actually a really
easy answer money Samsung went all out
with the marketing of their galaxy line
of phones so when the first galaxy s
came out people knew about it as much as
any other Android phone but what Samsung
did was they threw a lot of money into a
really strong marketing campaign and
then of course we had the commercials
that made fun of people who waited in
line at the apple store for the next
iPhone and they've done a lot of things
that have really sort of gotten the
galaxy brand into the public eye you'll
probably notice that you see a lot of
Samsung sponsorships for things like the
Olympics and other things and events
that happen so a lot of it has to do
with marketing money and budgets that
they have so HTC actually spends quite a
bit less in marketing because they
actually just don't have the capital do
so so Samsung's kind of in a position
where they have this really huge global
corporation with a lot of marketing
money and a lot of clout everywhere on
Earth so it really works out obviously
very well for them at Mike ha asks so if
you need your glasses to see is
everything blurry when you film an
episode without them no teleprompter so
I actually have my glasses the
prescription glasses that I have our
distance glasses I cannot see far away
so when I drive in a car I can't read
exit sighs anything farther away than i
would say about 30 feet 40 feet is
it's a light prescription but it's
definitely enough for me to sort of need
them when I Drive I definitely wear them
every day in the car I have contacts but
they're kind of you know neither here
nor there i have dry eyes because I
stare at screens all day long and then
when i get home i play video games and
and use my computer and hang out on my
ipad and dry my eyes out even more i
don't know what's wrong with me um we do
have a teleprompter here but fortunately
it's only about four feet away from me
so it's not too bad and it's easy to
read x droid box asks hey Ashley how
long do you think the Nexus 5 will be
worth it for that's a pretty easy
question droid box i would say until the
Nexus 6 is launched that's that's
literally the easiest answer I can give
you heard some rumors that there might
be some colorful options which is pretty
cool and actually don't know because of
philip k dick i don't know if they're
gonna be able to get the nexus 6 name
but if they do that would be kind of
amazing josh asks hey ashley what does
nintendo need to do to turn their losses
on wii u and get more people to buy it
the 3ds is selling well so why isn't the
wii u will mario kart 8 and super smash
brothers get more people to buy the
console i could spend all day answering
this question Josh the first thing is
branding a name so anybody who is a
quote-unquote civilian who is not super
familiar with video games might look at
the wii u box and say well this is the
same thing as i bought my kid like six
years ago why do i need this just
because i was a you on it so i think
that while they were trying to go with
something like xbox 360 to xbox one we
two wii u uh I kind of think that the
problem is is that they really haven't
made it a point that it's a brand new
console and I think it's hard for a lot
of people who bought the first we and
the original Wii to sort of justify that
purchase without actually understanding
what it is so I think that's the first
problem that they have and honestly I
would love to see them just change the
name to weed two or something like that
but it probably won't happen because
that's really really expensive the
second thing is is lack of first-party
titles so if we look at this point in
the original waste product cycle so
about a year and a half in we had games
like Mario where we sports legend of
zelda twilight princess metroid prime 3
mario party eight super mario galaxy
super paper mario wii fit and we
we're also on the verge of getting mario
kart wii so those are only first party
titles I mean there was a huge list of
games and right now super mario 3d world
in Pikmin 3 and games like that are
incredible but we're still missing those
mega console selling games like mario
kart a new zelda game a metroid title
and so on so forth I'm it feels like
Nintendo put a lot more pre-launch
thought and development time into the
games before the we launched as opposed
to the Wii U but I'm hoping that with
smash brother super smash brothers and
Mario Kart and all this other good stuff
that Nintendo has planned coming out
soon we'll see an uptick in sales but I
don't know if it's gonna be enough to
really offset that huge seventy percent
us forecast that they slashed they just
cut off seventy percent said yeah we're
just not gonna sell that many consoles
hopefully they'll be able to bring it
back I gotta take a minute to thank our
friend and sponsor godaddy onto his show
the first time I built the website as a
teenager it blew my mind the
possibilities seemed endless of course I
was building in an HTML and I was kind
of a noob website maker so i guess the
possibilities are actually kind of
finite for me but the point is making a
website of your own is kind of awesome

to start promoting you want to launch a
site for yourself as a digital resume or
