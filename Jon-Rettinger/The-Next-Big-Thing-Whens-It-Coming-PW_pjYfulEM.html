to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of Retton
Jers rants I'm here with John renders
the show where I get super mad and yell
about sometimes it illogical things that
are going on in my mind too after with
the world of technology of this week
what the industry as a whole and how I'm
becoming desensitized to phones and you
specs and I'm hoping that there's
something fancy and new that's gonna
jazz me up again
there's rector's rants go ahead get
started we get the really unique
opportunity here at TechnoBuffalo to
play with every piece of technology that
comes out or at least the awesome ones
it is something that I love and I enjoy
and I cannot believe you do it as a job
I I still every day I'm like it is
absolutely incredible I've seen the
phones evolve over the past few years
I'm really not realizing that nothing is
really changing you know specs are
getting a little bit better phones are
getting a little bit faster batteries
getting moderately bigger megapixels
getting a little bit higher so I'm
getting kinda sensitized look at phones
that came out three years ago to now
they look relatively the same phones are
a little bit bigger but nothing has
really changed I'm wondering what's the
next big jump what's the next big thing
to get me excited about consumer
electronics is it going to be something
like you know near field communications
finally NFC is gonna be used for
something crazy cool that I never
thought about is it going to be
something like the light show camera
with the light field pictures you can
focus after the fact that'll be
absolutely incredible
but these races and the Wars to cram one
two or three or four megapixels and
release another phone that does exactly
the same thing same amount of processing
core but it has a 4 megapixel better
camera it's getting a little bit silly
really cycle on phone seems to be like
two and a half months of even that
before
whatever the galaxy s5 comes out or the
next generation something there really
isn't anything brand new in the
marketplace right now and I'm itching
for something new
someone asked me John what are you
looking forward to most in the next six
months the tech world I was like alright
well the next iPhone we pretty much know
what that's gonna be you know the Galaxy
Note 3 we already know what that adds
print the same as the Galaxy Note 2 with
a couple more S Pen features and I'm
probably not going to use anyway and
probably puts a antigen on next
excess can have a bigger screen and
KitKat but gonna be pretty much the same
there's nothing giant they're just
little incremental updates every now and
then every four or five years got to be
something big that galvanized the whole
tech world and I want that to come I
want to know what it is you know I
thought maybe wireless charging might be
that and then really no one adopted the
Chiefs and at least very few it was an
afterthought for most he had to put on a
new backplate added by a fancy case yeah
that would work with wireless charging I
think it might be something to do with
the cameras maybe it's gonna be 4k I
don't know but something new it's hard
to get excited about a phone that's got
just two more cores when I came out
before were door excited about a phone
that has three megapixels more than the
one that came out last year something
Giants gotta happen it needs to happen
soon some jonesing to be excited in jazz
and frothing at the mouth to open
something new again I've got that
passion I hope I get the product that I
get it directed to and my off base here

many devices that I don't the heck I'm
talking about I want to hear from you

my pants region I don't know if you've
