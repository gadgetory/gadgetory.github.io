technobuffalo here back with one of my
mini vlog style tech business we got a
couple cool new things up that I wanted
to share with you guys first the
incredibly awesome John Q is back with
another TechnoBuffalo infographic this
one is talking about the just-announced
4.5 inch Samsung Infuse 4G for AT&amp;amp;T 4.5
inches is crazy big for a phone our
review unit should be in tomorrow the 60
I'm looking forward to getting some
giant hands on it this thing to see if
it fit in your pocket or how it works
and just everything in general I can
take a look at the infographic this is a
new style that we're using we saw it a
couple days ago first announced and used
with the new imac updates so you can see
the introduction on the infuse you can
get that cool look over the features
it'll work on your smartphones and
tablets and everything as well give some
specs 4.5 inches eight point nine
millimeter super amoled plus 1.2 Geerts
a megapixel camera and Android 2.2 you
can go ahead and check out all the cool
stuff about the phone even a video in
here if you want to play it then you can
leave comments saying how much you like
it or don't like it or whatever else
curiously you guys think about the phone
in general if you want to see some hands
on videos again stay tuned tomorrow we
also have something cool up here on site
you might remember a few days ago
actually almost two months ago on march
first i did a rant about iOS on how I
thought the notification system was
absolutely atrocious and I'm an iphone
user in general and I think it's missing
a lot of things it's an elegant
interface certainly but it hasn't really
caught up in a lot of ways that android
and webos have so there was a video that
got put out on vimeo I believe cnet was
one of the first to publish it showing a
really cool new notification system on
how iOS 5 notifications should be
handled really really impressive it's
just done
an amazing job with it so I think you
guys should check out the video it's
really cool you can sort of see some
pictures here how it looks the videos up
on technobuffalo it's under the title
iphone 5 how notifications should be
handled really kind of cool definitely
those things you gotta check out and do
you think that would be a good thing to
use I mean would you like it I'd like
the fact the apparel notifications into
one application it really makes it seem
organic with the OS without or
reinventing the wheel just curious what
your general thoughts are anyway guys
these are George these short videos
where I talk about some stuffs that's
going on i'm jon rettinger new
TechnoBuffalo and i shall see you where
you shall see me in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
