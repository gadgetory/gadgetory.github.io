from TechnoBuffalo here with a full
review for u of rims latest flagship
this is the bold 9900 let's go ahead and
see if it's the Canadian company Saviour
alright so let me remind you of the
specs here of the bold 9900 first it's
got a larger the largest on a blackberry
with a keyboard
the non-sliding form-factor 2.8 inch
diagonal screen at the resolution of 640
by 480 1.2 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor 768 megabytes of RAM 5
megapixel camera live it on the back
with LED flash but no autofocus talk
about that in a minute
it's got a 1230 milliamp hour battery
and NFC technology which stands for near
field communications it's a way to
transmit data alright so as with all my
phone reviews I always start by talking
about how the thing does as a phone no
matter what it can do for email or
browser or pictures doesn't make good
phone calls not much used to you this
thing makes absolutely tremendous phone
calls and probably as one of the
strongest antennas out of any AT&amp;amp;T phone
I've tested generally I'm pretty
blanketed in HSPA+ where I am in
Southern California on the bold 9900 I
had five strong Barger service where
generally I've got maybe three to four
I've been using this phone as my daily
driver since I got and actually have not
had a single dropped call and this is an
unlocked unit unlocked from the Canadian
carrier Rogers but will be identical to
what we seen launched for AT&amp;amp;T and
there'll be some band difference when we
see it on t-mobile and when we have it
on Verizon which we do have now in the
9930
and for Sprint in the 9930 so antenna
wise this thing is absolutely
outstanding the speaker quality is very
loud on previous blackberries I was
using the 97-80 I too had the speaker up
at 100 here and had it up at a hundred I
was almost deaf I had to turn down just
about 80 so speaker quality is very loud
everything on this phone has to do that
has to do with phone calls is absolutely
out standing alright let's go ahead and
talk about this big old keyboard here
is gigantic and the biggest keyboard
that RIM has ever used and I gotta say
my previous favorite keyboard was
surprisingly HTC status before this guy
takes the crown the keyboard on this
phone is absolutely wonderful here I can
go ahead and type things really fast
it just works very well this is one of
those keyboards they need to try in your
hands first to see what it feels like
there's a lot of tap to response
everything you loved about the original
bold feel of the 9000 is here just a
bigger form factor if you type a lot of
email text messages or Iams this
keyboard cannot be beat it is hands-down
the best thing I have ever typed on in
fact I look forward to replying to
emails now in text because it means I
get to use this keyboard that translates
a fewer mistakes and quicker actually
much quicker typing the keyboard is
outstanding I can't say enough for how
good this keyboard actually is a rim
completely nailed it alright let's go
ahead and talk about speed I was using a
97 80 before this and that thing was not
a speed demon I can't tell you how many
times that see little hourglass or that
little sort of black box with the ticker
going around it used to see that all the
time I was installing an application it
would pretty much lock the BlackBerry
not a problem here at all speed this
thing is really fast
rims included graphics acceleration
which they're calling liquid graphics
which makes for a just a very fast
browsing experience everything just
works applications load very quickly
when you're downloading applications
thing just things just open and just
work very well then go ahead and launch
them stuff that I've got here it's go
ahead and check out Google Maps go ahead
and launch this very quickly even if it
was stored in the background on stuff
that wasn't stored just launches very
very fast so go ahead and launch this
for the first time actually
Flixter with Rotten Tomatoes and there
it goes up and running you can actually
use the phone and out when you're
downloading an application which is even
better that's not the only kind of speed
that you guys want to see let's check
out some of the browser speed so go
ahead and take a look here here's the
mobile version ESPN on a blackberry of
this form factor check this out boom
pinch to zoom I'm pretty fast pinch to
zoom I might say as well
scrolling is
very very smooth here on the back end
and OS seven there's some JavaScript
improvement and some better rendering of
HTML stuff but all that translates to is
are really surprisingly Pleasant black
browsing experience it just works very
very well something I've really enjoyed
using let's go ahead and check out one
of the sites I've been looking at quite
a bit on regards to this phone let's go
and check out CrackBerry crackberry.com
there we go
and let's see what a website looks like
I've turned off the mobile network here
it just pa+ cuz I am using this as my
phone and I didn't want the phone to
ring as I was using it so it loads you
know very quickly I've been really
surprised of what room is done with this
browser you actually have a browser that
you can use as opposed to what we had
with previous Blackberry phones this is
a very competitive browsing experience
to what we see on Android iOS and web OS
I know that sounds very weird to hear
and it sounds even weirder to say but
you've got a full functioning browser
here which is surprisingly nice rim you
can tell did quite a job trying to get
this thing to work so hats off to them
let's talk a bit about the design
because this is sort of a new design
here you've got a brushed aluminum band
all the way across the device on the
bottom here where there's some inductive
charging ports this is actually plastic
so they don't have sort of an antenna
gate issue all the antennas here live at
the bottom so you have to worry about
them being surrounded by the metal they
never be able to tell it's plastic
actually had to give it a good feel to
tell that aluminum goes all the way
around on the top of the device where we
used to have the mute and lock button
you now just have a lock button which
can be a bit hard to press really got to
get in there and get it and a mute
button now lives in between the volume
controls now I shouldn't be complaining
too much one of the knocks I had on the
original design was that I'd push the
unlock button too easily so now it's a
little bit harder to push I got to be
careful what you wish for I will say
that having the mute button in the
middle is a bit confusing sometimes that
I'm trying to adjust a volume I figure
top and bottom that's what I use and I
end up doing volume up and a mute
something to keep in mind it is a very
nice looking phone it's nothing a little
bit wider than previous generation
blackberries
but not too bad so I bring in for
example the 97-80 the phone it replaced
you can really see the thickness
difference there so it's not the
necessarily the smallest phones but it's
definitely one of the thinnest go ahead
and see that right there if we bring in
something like let's say an iPhone 4
forth in this comparison you can see how
thin this device really is but that
thinness did come with some compromises
here they did remove on the back the
autofocus camera with thinness in mind
these that's what RIM said either
removed it so they could keep the device
with this form factor so no autofocus
camera here guys the back it looks like
carbon fiber is actually woven glass
you've got some sort of soft touch band
all the way around it NFC antenna
actually lives right behind this door
kind of interesting go ahead and exit
out of here
go ahead Adam my Twitter application
alright let's go ahead and talk about
some OS 7 business since this is running
BlackBerry's OS 7 you got a few things
here you've got to go ahead and tap that
you've got voice search which is great
but I can't see a reason to possibly
want to use voice search we've got this
ridiculously awesome keyboard in fact
I've never even used to play search on
here at all in fact let's try using
voice search for the first time I'll try
searching for TechnoBuffalo so go and
hit it I got accepted first you can tell
if never use it TechnoBuffalo
TechnoBuffalo there it is kind of neat
so it works I would never use it because
the keyboards awesome and a pleasure to
type on but it is there one thing that's
kind of weird is that the default search
here is actually Bing so let me try
typing a search term I like candy which
is true I do and boom Bing is the
default search engine on here I actually
download a Google search application so
I could go ahead and hit that kind of
odd but you can definitely get yourself
around it a quick note and speaking of
Google search if you do want to sync
your calendar you need to download
Google's mobile sync application you can
also download Google
apps which isn't going to come
downloaded on here you got to go to em
kugel comm to get all of that
information OS seven works very well
you've got the icons that look a little
bit different the liquid graphics the
improved web browsing you've got some
integration with bbm and some of the
applications here nothing that's worth
going to that much detail spice it to
say that it does work very well and it's
very quick a few things that I didn't
want to show on the device that I didn't
even know existed and are necessarily
part of this review but just very cool
little tweaks I see up there I've got my
battery indicator it says 80% that has a
cool application go ahead right there
called six tools that I downloaded I was
also a cool application or taking
screenshots appropriately called
capturing which let you take screenshots
of anything anywhere in the device so go
ahead and exit out of that case you want
to do either of those that's how you
would accomplish it all rights go ahead
and take a look at some pictures because
there's all kinds of fun stuff to talk
about here especially in regards to
t-touch we'll go ahead and open up that
we'll go ahead and take a look at some
of the wallpapers here how about that
one pinch-to-zoom it is very smooth if
you've ever seen pinch to zoom on the
torch one or on the storm one or the
storm two it's not been a pleasant
experience here really just nicely done
Rin did an excellent job
the pinch to zoom in here and images is
just as good as a pinch to zoom on the
browser and on other devices so really
just did a very very nice job here let's
go ahead and jump into blackberry app
world this is where I don't have the
network turned on app world not many
apps in there unfortunately that's
really one of the knocks on blackberry
you don't have the same app support you
get on Android or iOS you have to have
to live in a limited experience for apps
and figure out what's important to you
it will ship with Twitter and Facebook
applications which will integrate very
nicely into the OS and notification bar
right across the top but definitely give
a search you can go to your web browser
and search for blackberry app world and
see what apps are there one of the ones
that I really love this application
right there called whatsapp sort of a
bbm esque replacement it lets you
essentially text message folks across
platforms across
country that having to use really any
data-intensive stuff or e-tec messaging
plans so I have friends in Canada where
would cost mine a text message or
friends abroad whatsapp is awesome if
you try to download it though from
blackberry app world it's gonna tell you
it's not available for this device you
have to actually go to the whatsapp
website and download it that's true with
a lot of things on here you got to sort
of do workarounds find the applications
that you like let's go ahead and talk
about battery this thing is being
powered by a 1230 milliamp hour battery
which is a step down from them they're
just just about 1,500 milliamp hour
battery that we had in the 97 80 and boy
do you know it so I am about 80 percent
right now with heavy usage towards end
of the day with two accounts being set
up about an hour to two hours of phone
calls some text messaging in here and
searching for updates on Twitter and
Facebook I am generally down to about
10% coming into the day around midnight
so I wish we had a bigger battery I
would have maybe gone for a tad thicker
device so I could get through a full day
you're going to look for an external
battery or have a cord close by if
you're going to want to use this device
that is a really solid knock on it here
the camera you saw a video that I did
link will be down below showing the
camera footage it looks pretty good for
720p unsurprisingly the audio fidelity
was awesome the built-in microphones
here on the bold 9900 are really very
nice so this is a test of the BlackBerry
Bold 9900 and presumably the same thing
as the 99 30 as well the CDMA variant
coming out soon
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you the next video overall I've
been thrilled with the bold 9900 from a
build quality standpoint to a usability
standpoint it's a phone that I like to
use the phone that I actually enjoy
using and that's any Testament this is
the phone that's going to live in my
pocket not this phone and not any phone
running this operating system which is
Android this is what I'm going to be
carrying with me I know people say oh
rim rim is dead why use rim blackberry
forever or iPhone forever or Android the
way to go a phone os at least for me is
a representative of my personality or
Who I am I use what's best from
at the time I don't have any knock on
iOS and I don't have any knock on
Android for me and for the email
intensive life that I kind of live this
thing is actually outstanding and is
very very hard to beat I'm from and
fantastic keyboard so now a full capable
web browser and they gradually I'll be
in very slowly growing app catalog I'm
encouraged by what rim is done and I'm
encouraged by the future that RIM might
have they continue this sort of
incremental upgrades future might not be
so bright but they continue to release
phones like the 9900 and hopefully some
qnx based phones in your future I think
we're a might have a few few legs left
in this race so you guys agree disagree
this is a phone that you definitely have
to look at if you're on any carrier it's
coming to every single carrier some are
already out really just an outstanding
device and this is going to be my daily
driver I am John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
