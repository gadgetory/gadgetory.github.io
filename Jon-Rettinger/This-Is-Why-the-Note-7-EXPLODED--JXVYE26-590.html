puns 2 to 3 or less so hold me to that
earlier this week Samsung finally
announced the findings of what caused
Galaxy Note 7 to explode not only in the
first case with the internship in units
but also in the second after to the
recall so a few things to bear in mind
before I get to that Samsung did say
that the Galaxy Note 8 it's probably
going to be delayed a little bit they
were planning on announcing it at Mobile
World Congress which is coming up in
February so expect that to come out a
few months later but also that the note
line will live on it's not going to be
changed into a si Pro or anything we'll
have follow-ups to the Galaxy Note line
so it did not go out and I blaze one of
glory here's a short version of what
happened if you didn't know the Galaxy
Note 7s incredible phone probably the
best phone that I'd ever tested in fact
I went out and bought one the thing
started smoking in some cases caught
fire
Samsung issued a recall of the phones
and then serve a mandatory recall had
about a two to three weeks in between
and start shipping units they said were
fixed those two were plagued with
similar issues so here's what happened
with the first batch of phones the
Samsung was trying to cram a lot of
components into the note 7 in fact it
was rumored that the retina scanning
wasn't supposed to be in the notes of
them at all it's was to be debuted in
the galaxy s 8 in order to make the note
7 a huge success they pushed in which
push component to get smaller and
smaller and smaller and viously in
samsung's efforts try making batteries
larger they put in a larger battery than
perhaps they should first batch of
batteries had a bit of a design flaw
they made their electrodes prone to
bending and in some cases led to a
breakdown in separation to the positive
and negatives tabs so that caused a
short circuit in some cases these things
just exploded so that's the story with
the note 7 it's kind of the end of that
chapter I was anything that we didn't
expect it was sort of everything that we
anticipated too much in too little space
cause the batteries to Ben's lithium-ion
cells tend to swell anyway and it wasn't
even good to do any of that so a lot of
things led to these batteries trying to
smoke and explode hopefully Samsung has
learned a lesson to claim they have and
the Galaxy s8 will come a little bit
later but will come free of problems and
will be a smoke and success as only two
for Samsung so you guys think that ends
the story of the note 7 the note 7 was
my favorite phone I was ready
use that for her very long time at coral
blue is hot and I enjoyed it and I'm
done with puns thank you guys for
watching I hope you enjoyed leave a
comment down below so next time I'm dry
