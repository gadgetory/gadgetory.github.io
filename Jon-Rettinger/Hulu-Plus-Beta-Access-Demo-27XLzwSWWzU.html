technobuffalo here a few days ago who
took the wraps off their new 999
subscription service dubbed Hulu Plus
and also able to walk you through the
application and show you how it
functions but I didn't have beta access
they sort of been getting out very
limited access I now have full beta
access to Hulu Plus on the ipad i want
to show you what it looks like how many
commercials you're going to have to see
what the quality of the video actually
looks like alright we're going to go
ahead and open it up gonna look very
similar on the iphone just a bit smaller
so we'll go ahead and launch the hulu
plus it always rotates whenever i launch
the application so you can view the full
season of current show so the most
recent season that shows have some shows
have full back catalogs you take a show
like 24 for example and you get a lot of
previous seasons you are still going to
have to watch commercials when you get
much more than the five episodes that
you had before so I'm give you a
demonstration of how this works and of
course is all flash free since the ipad
doesn't support flash so here's lie to
me scoundrels the office UK let's go
ahead and pick episode of scrubs for
example another big question was glad to
watch commercials and it's so how many
purses my gonna have to watch well right
off the bat you can see each one of
those doc represent a commercial and you
are going to have to watch three
commercials generally they range in time
from 10 to 15 seconds so not the longest
in the world but you are still going to
have to watch commercials probably about
a minute to 3 minutes honey on how long
we are integrating to here so let's
actually we can play it you can see the
quality the video of the show up very
quickly so commercial when it launches
as well and now the quality does look to
be HD it's coming in very clear the
audios clear things are sunk and I seem
to go ahead and pause this I don't want
to get into any copyright issues but you
can't see that the video quality does
look very good that is coming in in
widescreen and that your controls are
pretty limited you can scrub through
right here and you get the title of the
episode and that is about it let's go
ahead and scrub right through to boy the
core so let's start and you can see that
sort of buffers for a minute and then
keeps going relatively quickly
and then he goes right into the juicy
juice commercial even the commercials
themselves actually look to be at HQ
something that we really haven't seen
with the ABC player on the iPad let's go
ahead and go back so we know how many
commercials are you can sort of go right
to that website if you like and look
more about the ad so we'll go ahead and
eggs out here hit done let's go ahead
and look at some of the bat Callum's
what they have so here's the main
content of Hulu sort of what the
promoting most TV you can sort of jump
through and see what the promoting and
of course you can do a search they also
have movies here as well you can watch
um I'm not sure how we seen these movies
are but I'm never heard of half of these
Saints and soldiers I speak soccer black
ball the Bobby Duke story I me on there
her to have these movies but they are
here and you can set a queue as well so
you can sort of watch them as you go and
this will play over 3g in a minute i'm
actually going to turn off Wi-Fi we're
gonna see how 3g is going to look and
without the quality is even watchable or
not on the ipad certainly the same as
the iphone as well so let's go back to
TV that's the most people use who before
and let's search for a popular show and
see what we get let's take a look for
family life so family guy who popped up
so first off the back you notice there's
a lot of family guy facility r stuff
from season 8 seats and 8 season 8 so I
great pretty much all of season 8 here
and you go ahead and play whatever you'd
like go ahead and cancel out of that
let's take a look at something like 24
so here's the entire season the last
season that you can watch what about a
show that's maybe been off the air for a
while let's take a look at X Files so
you've got season 3 season 9 I mean
there's a lot of content here now is
going to be worth nine ninety-nine a
month I don't know they're gonna depends
on your viewing habits if you want to
catch up on a full season a certain
anything able to pay ten bucks and watch
what you've missed is going to be a
great opportunity if you are going to
buy gems dividual e from Apple TV or
amazon unbox over might be you're going
to pay much more than that it does sort
of sit a little weird that you still
have to watch commercials when you're
paying ten dollars a month but that is
the way that who does that structure
this some kind of curious if this is
something you guys are you dressed in or
not so I'm going to turn this off now
I'm going to turn off Wi-Fi and see how
this looks over 3g so I do have a pretty
full bars of 3g service here so go ahead
and turn it on I'll make sure that kicks
up and generally it's four to five bar
so or be representative of a pretty fast
3g connection so there we go full bars
let's go ahead and go back to hulu plus
of course it still rotates into portrait
take some time to go back to landscape
mountains so we're at the vet and load
times are much slower over 3g
does not appear to be working over 3g oh
there it goes tips a very long time to
load we'll go ahead and cancel this
let's see if we can rotate it again
there we go so that took a decent amount
of time for dello I kept tapping the
screen I thought that it froze on me
let's see how sudden looks will go to my
tummy see what that looks like and see
how long it takes load something over a
pretty strong ATT 3g connection and I'll
leave this up in real time we can check
how the fidelity it's actually the
content loaded pretty quickly actually
that NBC app looks very nice so right
here for sure like quantum leap where's
before in scrubs we only had a three
commercials now we're looking at one two
three four five six commercials I don't
think that's representative of the
connection I think the anome remember
commercials we depend on the content
that you're watching so that is a lot of
commercials to have to watch for one
episode of Scott Bakula so you got a
yahoo commercial tells you when the
stuff kind of country gonna play and
honestly the content actually the pony
looks really good the fidelity is
surprisingly strong so you will be able
to watch this here over a 3g and
actually want to watch it pretty well so
curious what you guys think are you
interested in the hulu plus or you have
no interest in paying 10 bucks a month I
think it's very interesting proposition
especially for travelers if you spend a
lot of time in the airport of the train
you cannot get caught up on all your
stuff while you're on the go oh you may
have to walk your data usage if you're
over 3g anyway i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
