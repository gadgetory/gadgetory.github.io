from TechnoBuffalo here and today we're
taking a look at the latest smartphone
and Verizon's lineup to rock the awesome
combination of dual-core and LTE this is
the HTC built resound with Beats Audio
living in there let's go ahead and see
if it's resounding as the specs would
have you think alright so we are looking
at a black box this does look like the
shipping packaging that you're probably
gonna get when you walk into your
verizon store or order it but there
might be a little colorful sheath over
it as well this was sent to us courtesy
of the PR folks at Verizon and HTC well
go ahead and take off your jacket
cuz it's warm in here and we agreed it
with another black box and got a Verizon
embossed on top HTC logo on the bottom
Verizon 4G certified with their
blazingly fast LTE network go ahead open
this up and there is the resound with a
pair of eye Beats headphones take a look
at those in just a minute go and get
this guy out of the box or at least try
to turn it over come near phone boom and
here is the HTC Rezound
it certainly does not feel like the
finished phone on the market push it off
to the side for just a moment see what
else we're gonna have in the box so
we've got damn eye beats go ahead and
pull these out there we go
take a look at these again in a sec
we're going to have a little magnetic
monster package with eye beats logo all
over which is going to have inside I'm
guessing ear tips huh different size
your tips for different sized ears and a
clip to clip it to things push that off
4G LTE SIM card and this is for will the
LTE network SIM cards already installed
in the phone pushes that off got some
books and manuals got a cable micro USB
for syncing and we've got see if it's
got one USB port or two I was check that
now one USB port that goes in
to the wall all right so let's take a
look at the phone power this guy on and
we'll talk about all of its specs and
the stuff that it can do Steve it's got
a charge in it
power on there we go awesome all right
so let's go ahead and get a bit more
into me here it's bring the camera on in
as this guy boots up all right so here
is the HTC Rezound this is going to be
available for $2.99 on a two-year
contract on November 14th it's running
Android 2.3.4 we haven't heard anything
about Ice Cream Sandwich coming into it
but it is a just-released phone so
presumably Ice Cream Sandwich will
eventually make its way on here from
dimension standpoint it's 5.08 inches by
two point five eighths by pretty hefty
point five four inches so over half an
inch thick and it weighs five point
seven eight ounces it's got a 4.3 inch
and that's always measured diagonal s
LCD screen the resolution of 1280 by 720
and if you're keeping track at home
that's a 720p resolution so go ahead and
and pull us up here take a look at HTC
Sense in all its glory the battery is a
1620 milliamp hour affair it's being
powered by a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm built processor with one gig of
ram 16 gigs of storage expandable
microSD on the back it's going to take a
look at the hump of this guy it's got a
camera with dual LED flash that's an
eight megapixel shooter that can shoot
1080p video and it's got a two megapixel
shooter on the front we've seen a 1.3
megapixel has become pretty standard HTC
stepped it up here with the surprisingly
good 2 megapixel camera of course you've
got Verizon's LTE speeds which are
awesome and blazingly fast if you have
LTE in your area and of course you've
got that B logo on the bottom which
means Beats Audio technology so you're
also gonna get this here pair of IVs
headphones let's go ahead and take a
look at the phone itself
you've got your typical HTC Sense
buttons here in bright red
they are backlit as well you've got home
you've got menu back and search let's go
ahead and see we got in the apps
Department gets there anything new and
exciting living in here God lets golf
heart pursuit and backup assistant some
Verizon stuff mobile hotspot god I love
that you've got a scanning application
Polaris Office Verizon Navigator why'd
you use that when you get the awesome
navigation rolled into the Android
operating system on the left hand side
of the device you've got a microphone
and the grand reveal of the sink and
charging port on the left hand side the
volume rocker up and down almost flush
the device a little bit hard to feel
without looking at it so if you have it
up your head and you're trying to feel
where it is definitely you're gonna want
to get used to it bottom you've got
microphones and the battery door that
gets removed on the top you've got a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and your power
and lock button and the back is made of
this soft touch almost rubber feel it's
got a almost different raises sides of
it
you've got that texture
HDC part this is not a film that's gonna
fall out of your hand it's not a phone
it's gonna slide all along the desk go
ahead and hit English it's really going
to sit nicely from where you want it to
be I'll go ahead and run through a
little setup process here skip set up I
don't want to say anything up so
definitely not the finished phone on the
apartment but you are getting some some
pretty solid specs I'd almost say next
gen specs but at the rate of dual core
phones its LT coming out it's definitely
a current gen alright so let's take a
look at these eye beats and it's hard to
sort of show you or let you hear it over
over YouTube but these are the I beat
headphones and you can plug in any
headphones you want but when you use a
pair of Beats headphones which does have
control for play forward back and an
inline mic warning next next so much
setup finish there we go
you are going to get some improved audio
fidelity so I'm gonna go and plug these
guys in and we saw this Beats Audio
technology with the HTC built Sensation
XL so I'll go ahead and jump into music
and hopefully there's some music on here
no artist found well I can't even show
you it's gonna look like
no music found that's disappointing
generally when you plug it in you get
music and I'll show you guys this in the
full review you'll get a little red V
icon it's gonna show up there at the top
when you listen to non beats headphones
versus Beats headphones the idea is that
you can certainly hear improve the audio
with these guys so something to keep in
mind if audio is important for you this
is probably going to be a pretty solid
choice for phones so I'm going to
continue to look through and see what
else we got let's go ahead and jump into
settings and we'll take a look at the
about this phone let's go down to the
bottom see what kind of software
information we're rocking here so HTC
Sense 3.5 as mentioned Android 2.3.4 is
remember if you can count to three four
I can see the baseband PRL and all that
PRI versions and the rest of that
software stuff let's go ahead and jump
home so as I mentioned this is not the
only dual core LTE device there's
another phone on
that rocks us actually there are two
other ones here it's bring in the just
release one this is the Droid Razr
similarly SPECT but you notice a big
difference if you look at these two
side-by-side the Droid Razr is just
incredibly thin hump or no hump it's
still a much thinner than the HTC
Rezound the presumably the idea fidelity
is not gonna be as good on the razor but
we'll put these two head-to-head and
we'll do a decision but in case you
wanted to see what these guys look like
that you'd get a kick out of it so push
this guy off this is the HTC Rezound are
you excited you're not excited is this
going to be your next phone I want to
hear from you be sure to check this out
at TechnoBuffalo comm for all your tech
news including hands-on reviews
impressions and awful jokes I am John
Rhett injure and I will talk to you in
the next video bye bye
