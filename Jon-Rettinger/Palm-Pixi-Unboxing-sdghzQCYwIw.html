TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the new palm pixi for sprint this
is the second webos device what I'm
really excited to get my hands on when I
reviewed the first web OS device the
palm pre one on the record is saying it
was probably one of the best smartphones
I've ever tested so I'm curious how the
pixi holds up to the competition of its
big brother let's go ahead and get to
the unboxing here of course we use the
big ol knife hack through the FedEx pack
they're open and see what we got inside
here well looks like the folks at sprint
sent a lot of stuff we've got a wireless
touchstone charger we'll take a look at
all that in a minute we've got a back
for it a touchstone pretty cool that off
to the side and we've got the phone
itself in addition to some press release
material so here is the box to the palm
pixi looks very similar to what we saw
for the palm pre and what sprint did for
the HTC hero we got a picture the device
on the front some the Sprint logo on the
side some specs on the back which we
will go over but without further ado
let's go ahead and dig into this thing
and I'll go over all the specs as we're
showing you the device go ahead open it
up does look like been open you've got
your typical palm package with that
orange it's a little cardboard up at the
top here is a device well that feels
very thin and small in the hand push it
off to the side for just a minute and
we'll see what else we get in the box
we've got getting started guide
introduction
and your full bevy of accessories which
include a sinking cable which is micro
USB and that little circular charging
but we've got the touchstones we're not
going to need that fortunately
touchstone is wireless conductive
charging which is actually pretty cool I
did a demonstration of that with the
palm pre a few months back let's take a
look at the device itself let's go over
a little bit about it and i'll tell you
what the specs of it are so this thing
is really small and during a size
comparison you'll see how small it is
the screen resolution you're getting 400
pixels down by 3 20 across so here it's
only about 80 pixels shorter than the
pre but it's not bad dimension wise it's
2.2 inches by four point four inches by
only point four inches which is uh
inches in which is pretty small it's a
very thin device let me compare it to
some other phones that you might be
familiar with so here is the iphone 3gs
which looks like an absolute monster
compared to the pre the pre screen size
is 2.6 three inches so it's a little bit
small and of course it is a full
capacitive screen down below here is
where the gesture area is to access the
card features and to pull up palms quick
launcher and i'll show you all that
during a software overview but if you
look at it you think there's a big gap
right there just know that that gap is
actually being used for something let's
put these side by side you can see
really the thinness of the pixi make the
iphone starting to look just fat you can
see also how small it is let's take a
look at another phone in Sprint's lineup
perhaps when you're comparing if you're
a sprint customer the HTC hero they look
to be almost exactly the same dimensions
wise if you stack them on top of each
other the pixi is definitely a little
bit thinner and the last phone you guys
maybe want to see as compared to is the
blackberry storm 2 this one's for a
verizon wireless it's a little bit on
the chunky side to storm 2 and you can
definitely tell how
all the pixie is when you see this thing
so enough of the other phones let's take
a look at the pixie itself so you've got
your full qwerty keyboard right here
simply has a small and sort of Centro s
keys but it does look to be okay I think
it's something you'll get used to but i
will try it for you and let you know if
it's something that you can become
accustomed to whether or not it's
difficult to type on on the left hand
side device we've got nothing on the
right hand side you've got your volume
rocker you have your profile switch from
ring to vibrate and you probably have
your micro USB charging port which you
do have right under that flap which I'm
trying to get up micro USB charging port
on the top of the device you've got your
lock and power button and a 3.5
millimeter headset jack on the back this
is the non touchstone back you've got
sort of a matte finish on it you've got
your camera you've got your LED flash
and you've got a two speaker grill got a
microphone port on the side which
interesting that it's on the side and
not down below I wonder how that's going
to work so let's take a look at some of
the other accessories that the folks
from sprint when I slept to send over
we've got the back for the touchstone
now the way this works it's a full
conductive charging so what that means
is you put the phone on top of the
touchstone and it charges no wires
needed only wire that is required is
from the wall to the touchstone charger
itself go ahead and cut the sim opener
let's see what the touchstone wall
charger looks like and if you're
interested in a palm pre it'll run you
99 or palm pixi rather it'll run you
ninety nine dollars after rebates and a
two-year contract so here is the back
for the touchstone it's got a little bit
of a dimple look to it still that's soft
touch rubber but it's nice looking on
the back you can see those sensors which
will connect to take advantage of the
touchstone charter so we'll take off the
back and I'll show you what it looks
like underneath there the battery is of
size 1150 milliamp hours the same one
that's found on the palm pre so anyway
guys stick around to the channel for a
ton of reviews on the pixie software
overview a web browsing demonstration
I'll even show you again how the
touchstone charger works in case you are
curious I'm really excited to see palms
second foray into the web OS devices and
really see how it translates to
real-world use so any questions or
comments or things that you guys want to
see leave a video response or text
comment down below and I will see you in
the next palm pixi video jon rettinger
