taylor and if you guys recognize me it's
probably because i was the CES winner a
few months ago I got to go to CES with
techno Buffalo because I entered the
contest and I ended up winning that and
John mr. jon rettinger was actually nice
enough to ask me to continue making
videos for them on their channel on
technobuffalo and i'm going to be doing
top five things so i'm going to be doing
in this video top 5 iOS apps and in the
next video we'll probably do android
apps and then jailbreak tweaks and all
that kind of stuff so leave comments
down below with what you guys want me to
do suggestions that you want to see my
top 5 videos and stuff like that so this
one I'm going to be doing top 5 iOS apps
so let's go ahead and get started so I
don't know about you guys but I watch
YouTube mainly on my phone but this is
Jasmine this is a YouTube client for the
ipad and the iphone as well and i love
it i love it a lot more than the google
youtube app that they came out with on
the main page right here you got your
search browse favourites playlist
subscriptions my videos in recently
played so if i go into my videos i can
see every video that I posted on my
youtube channel right here robo 13 and
these are just all my stuff so i'm going
to go and just play one of these right
here my latest video that's the little
animation if i turn it sideways you guys
can see it's full screen right there and
it plays over LTE the youtube app that i
didn't like about that from google is
that it didn't really let you stream HD
video over LTE or 3g connection but with
the Jasmine app they do they let you do
that and they did update the YouTube
have to let you do that now I think but
I haven't liked it very much but just
because the connection issues jasmine
has given me full 1080p support for that
when i do like about this actually is
that you can see the featured in the
trending you can't see that on the
current google youtube app either you
can see top rated top favorited most
viewed and most discussed I don't
believe you can see those as well but
it's really nice if you just want to see
some kind of new video that's been
popular you can click on trending and
you see the latest videos the people of
them watching it's really nice runs
great this is on the iphone 5 as well as
full i phone 5 support as you guys can
tell any cat much videos in the full
screen HD so that's jasmine and it's
free on the App Store
so my next favorite app is actually
called scribblenauts and I'm sure you
guys have heard of the severe into pc
gaming or even i think it's on the xbox
as well but this is also on iOS and i
love this game just because the amount
of creativity you can have with it so
you start off as this little character
down here and basically you can make
your own game so if you want to type in
anything you you basically can just
spawn anything and so i'm going to type
in t-rex actually want to type it in
purple t-rex and hit done and now a
purple t-rex should spawn in if you
click on that you can have them run
around and he will actually attack your
guy I don't think your guy can die I
don't think he has any health points or
anything like that there's Zeus I'm
gonna have them attack actually I don't
think he attacks a dinosaur yeah it does
right there you guys can see him
attacking the dinosaur or the t-rex
that's pretty cool anything you guys can
think of it pretty much has it in this
game which is really cool let me see if
I can jump on that you can't jump on
this there we go so you can jump on it
that's pretty cool literally anything
you guys can think of you can bring into
the game there we go read your f let's
see what happens when I attack it so I
start hitting with the golf club anyway
this is scribbled notes on the app store
it's 99 cents go check it out so another
app that i absolutely love is called
mailbox i'm sure you guys have heard of
this as well this is the most popular
mailbox app that's ever been released
other than the stock iphone app so right
here you guys can see that this looks
like just a regular mail box if you
scroll left you can choose to either to
send it to a different category to buy
to read or to watch you can also create
a new one but if you also slide slowly
to the left right there and let go at
yellow you can tell it to remind you
that you have that email at at specific
times if you don't want to read it right
away you can read it later and that way
you'll be reminded that you actually had
it and you won't forget about it so
another one that's pretty cool is if you
scroll to the right it'll make that
little green check right there and you
let go and that'll save it to your
archived folder if you scroll all the
way to the right really quick like that
with the red X you guys can see it right
see if i can get it again right there
and you let go that'll actually delete
the email totally so that you guys don't
have to worry about it and then if you
want to see your later date so say I
want to get reminded of this one I
didn't want to do that later today there
we go added to my later today calendar
and there you go right there that will
actually remind you later in the day
that you have in
says to let see deferred until 852 so it
looks like it does three hours ahead of
time currently for me it's 552 and it
will remind me in three hours that I had
that email so that's a very cool feature
and if I want to get rid of that there I
can just do that and send it back to the
regular email the check box right over
there are archived folder if I want to
delete it totally I can just do that and
it's gone so say I wanted to send this
to somebody I'll just put the recipient
up there the subject and the actual
message and you go ahead and hit Send
just like any other mailbox app but I
really like this just because the way
that it's set up i like the UI and the
intuitive stuff that you can do with it
especially the remind me later stuff i
love that because they always seem to
forget to reply to emails and right
there as you guys can see that will just
send it back to your regular inbox if
you have it in your archived so if you
just do this and bring it over to the
blue let go it sends it right back to
your regular inbox exit out of there go
back to here it's right back there in my
regular inbox so you guys can see it and
you can read it right there this is a
very cool feature it's a very cool web
go check it out there might be a wait
time I remember I to wait about two
weeks or so to get this i signed up
pretty quickly though so go check it out
it's in the app store it's a hundred
percent free but you might have to wait
a few weeks or so to actually get it
because of the fact that how many people
want to download this to go check it out
it's called mailbox and it's free my
next step is called kick starter and I
love Kickstarter just because i love
seen all the new projects that people
are coming out with and this is a brand
new app actually they released it a few
weeks ago i've been using it ever since
and you can see basically because of
every used kickstarter you can see every
single category that you can think of as
well as searching for things if you want
to search for a specific kind of project
i can go up there and hit that you click
on here you can see the video you click
on down here you guys can see more
information about specific projects you
see how much money they've raised how
many comments they have about people
talking about it this one doesn't have
any currently you can see all the
updates that the people post about it as
well as what you will get if you pledge
a certain dollar amount it's right here
if you pledge 25 you'll get the standard
DVD basically stuff like that this is
very cool i love this app i've been
using it ever since it came out it's one
hundred percent free it's called kick
starter and it's on the app store all
right am i next in favorite app of
all-time is called steam and i love this
app just because i love playing pc games
if you guys have ever heard of steam
you're probably pc gamer as well you
guys can see your friends your groups
your friend activity of the catalogue of
how many games there are you can add a
wish list you can even buy stuff on here
which I really like if I'm ever out and
I'm away from my computer and I want to
buy a game really quick I can just open
up the steam app and buy it right away
so you guys can see all the new stuff
you can see featured new popular and
specials so if you ever to special as
you can see all the deals that steam has
and they seem to have a ton of deals all
the time that's why i love steam so much
you can get great games really cheap so
say i want to buy antechamber which
actually joey davidson on technobuffalo
review to go check that out and if i
want to click on that and by it i just
click on this go over down here add to
cart it then adds a right to my cart and
i get x for myself or i can even buy it
as a gift for a friend and set it to
them so i really like this app just
because of how easy it is to use and
this one is called steam again it's free
and it's on the App Store so post a
comment down below of what you think of
my top 5 iOS apps go check out
technobuffalo calm for the latest and
greatest and tech news my name is david
taylor and i'll see you all in the next
one thanks guys
