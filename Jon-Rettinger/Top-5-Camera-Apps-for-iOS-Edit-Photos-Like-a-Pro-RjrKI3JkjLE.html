to you by domain.com what's going on
guys the markings hanging from
TechnoBuffalo and we showed you guys our
top 5 photos and videos after android
and today we're going to be showing you
guys our top picks for iOS so let's go
ahead and get started now the first one
on our list is manual now for a dollar
99 cents manual offers full manual
controls for the iPhones camera now
you'll be able to control settings like
shutter speed ISO focus and white
balance but there are other cool
features as well that you won't really
find on the iPhone stock camera app like
an exit Viewer a fill flash mode in case
you don't want to use the flash and
you'll also see live monitor for
automatic exposure values which in this
case if you've ever used the DSLR before
that'll help you figure out whether your
shot is properly exposed or not now if
you want something more complex and a
camera app that will let you take
greater advantage of the iPhones camera
manual is a great choice the second one
our list is after light it's $0.99 from
the App Store and what's awesome about F
the light are the plethora of editing
effects and filters that you can add
onto your pictures you'll also be able
to add borders and frames to make your
photos look even more unique you can mix
and match filters and make your own
presets which I think makes afterlight
stand out from the rest of the editing
apps found on iOS now there are in-app
purchases to get your new filters and
overlays and frames and I think they're
worth it especially if you're a big
Instagrammer you have your basic editing
tools to crop rotate or add vignette to
your photos there's also a built-in
camera app which is pretty similar to
manual you'll get manual controls for
your ISO your focus and shutter speed
but the UI isn't as detailed nor as
good-looking as manual I personally use
a free light so I can make my images
look better for Instagram like I would
use their borders and I can square copy
it so my sixteen by nine pictures would
fit in Instagram better moving on to
number three we have vsco cam now what's
awesome about vsco cam
unlike afterlight is the ability to link
my visco account on their server so any
in-app purchases I made on my Android
device or my iOS device will be linked
under one account I don't have to buy
the same filter twice which is pretty
neat it saves me the headache and the
time and the money but how is an app in
general it offers a variety of filters
and you can actually buy a few more
within the viscose store I bought mostly
every filter packed the app has for sale
and I absolutely think they're worth it
some filters are subtle and some change
the overall look but I found that the
visco filters are better than
Safa views on iOS I use vsco cam and
after light together whenever I post
something on Instagram I use vsco to
color my photos and I actually use after
light like I just said earlier to add
square borders and add a bit of a
texture overlay to my photos vsco cam is
free from the App Store give it a try
and let me know yes thing
number four is hyperlapse now with
addition of time-lapse in iOS 8 a lot of
my friends and family started using
time-lapse feature on their stock camera
app and they actually started posting
their videos online now what's also
about hyperlapse is you have control on
how fast or normal your time lapse will
look and then automatically stabilize
your shot for you so it isn't jittery
now over Thanksgiving I actually gave
hyperlapse a try and found it to be
super stable I was going around downtown
San Francisco I was holding the phone
for about 20 minutes which was quite a
while and but it was totally worth it
though there were moments where my hands
were shaking and the roads were bumpy
but when I exported the video it was
really stable I was using the 6 plus so
I'm sure oh is had a part in that too
but seeing that the video was really
stable won me over hyperlapse is free
from the app store give it a try and
start shooting epic time lapse let me
stop this video for just a quick second

check out last but not least let's talk
about chromic chromic is yet another
free app from the app store with in-app
purchases but just to give you guys a
brief summary of what the app is it's
like visco for videos now I say that
because of the filters you can add to
your videos it gives my videos very
film-like effects that you wouldn't be
able to achieve unless the footage is
color graded on a computer now I bought
all the filters that were available for
$4.99 when I first downloaded the app
and chromic actually recently added new
features like the ability to change
contrast saturation highlights and
exposure which has more fine-tuning than
ever before the overall UI is super
simplistic the
tuning for each category is all
swipe-based so it's really easy to
navigate through the filters and
settings so if you're looking for a
great video app companion to color grade
your footage on your iPhone chromic is
the way to go it's free so give it a try
and let us know what you think of the
app anyways that's it for this video
