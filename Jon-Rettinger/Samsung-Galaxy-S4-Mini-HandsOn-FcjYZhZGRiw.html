TechnoBuffalo checking out the samsung
galaxy s4 mini yes this is the small
version of this guy the samsung galaxy
s4 it it doesn't it doesn't look very
small compared to this but that's
because this is a 5-inch phone and this
is a 4.3 inch phone so still bigger to
them the iphone which i'll show you in a
second but we want to do a little
comparison video and show you what you'd
be getting if you picked up a galaxy s4
mini versus the full-size galaxy s4 so
let's check it out well first of all
obviously we've got different processors
happening in both of these phones so as
opposed to both going with a quad-core
processor the full-size galaxy s4 has a
quad-core 1.9 gigahertz processor while
the samsung galaxy s4 mini only has a
1.7 gigahertz dual-core processor and
you can actually see the results of that
in the quadrant testing so here we have
7161 compared to the galaxy s4s 12,000
287 so almost double the quadrant score
which is quite a bit for a device but
then again quad core dual core so about
half but the galaxy as many still runs
okay i would i would say that in the
Samsung Apps section it is a little bit
slow in terms of loading compared to you
can see there's a little bit of
choppiness there when you're kind of
scrolling through things it's not as
smooth as we're used to seeing in the
galaxy s4 the full-sized galaxy s4 and
that's a little bit of a bummer I think
that's something that a lot of people
were hoping that maybe we would see a
4.3 inch samsung galaxy s4 with the same
specs as the full-sized galaxy s4 um
this wants to update so I'm going to go
ahead and let this update while I tell
you guys about the screens because the
screens to me are kind of an important
thing so on the samsung galaxy s4 you
have a full 1080p am
LED screen it is gorgeous it is one of
the most beautiful screens out there in
terms of smartphones unfortunately
Samsung decided not to go even HD with
the galaxy s4 mini it's actually got a
960 x 540 resolution so not even 720
which is unfortunate all things
considered if you're used to looking at
Samsung's beautiful 1080p screen this
can be a little bit disappointing I'll
say that much it's it's not quite there
you can see even on our site the load is
a little bit slow in terms of choppiness
and see I know that it renders a lot
faster on the get full-size galaxy s4 I
keep wanting to say the galaxy s4 but
these are both a galaxy s4 device so
sorry about that let's go to
technobuffalo and see the difference
here okay so now we have TechnoBuffalo
calm loaded on both devices now you can
see when we start scrolling this
actually renders a lot quicker this one
on the other hand a lot of choppiness
this one definitely kind of takes the
cake in terms of speed but if you wanted
to pick up a smaller device this isn't a
bad way to go I am really disappointed
in the screen resolution that is a bit
of a bummer especially considering
Samsung makes such beautiful screens I
mean just sitting here looking at both
devices in hand you can really see the
difference between the 1080p and
obviously the 960 x 540 AMOLED but it
still looks sharp enough if you have
anybody in your life who is a kind of
mid-range phone user and wouldn't notice
the difference they will be perfectly
happy with a phone like the s4 mini if
we wanted to compare it to say the
iphone let's bring an iphone in and just
check out what is going on with the
screen size you can see here is my
iphone it's again a little bit smaller
still and which is kind of amazing
considering this is considered the mini
version of the galaxy s4 iphone still
has a 4-inch screen but they still look
you know very similar in terms of
colorful app icons things like that
but generally speaking the s4 mini is
missing a couple of things compared to
the galaxy s4 the full-sized some of the
stuff that it's missing is if we go into
the camera app you can see we are
actually not going to be able to find
the dual camera feature which is
something that a lot of people like on
the galaxy s4 so if we go here we can
see we have our our dual feature hi guys
and my pigtails on today and there's
John to recording our video so I'm going
to take his picture and and yeah so we
can do that but unfortunately that
option is not available on the s4 mini
so you can see I'm going to put this
down for a second and you can see we
actually don't have that option up here
there are some other options that are
not available on the galaxy s4 mini we
don't have things like air gestures air
view smart stay and scroll there are
some features missing obviously because
of the processing speed needed to use
those abilities so that's an unfortunate
loss but for anybody who doesn't know
the difference or for anybody who is not
stepping down from a galaxy s 4 5 inch
phone it's not that big of a deal I
would imagine because those are features
that while very very nice are not
necessary to your enjoyment of the phone
but that's that's pretty much it for
today that's our little mini comparison
of the mini I wanted to do something
that wasn't you know 10 minutes long and
wanted to make sure you guys knew that
there were while some features were
missing there were some things to like
about the galaxy s4 mini no word yet on
US carriers no word yet on how much it
might be it wouldn't be a stretch to see
this phone come down for less than
ninety nine dollars or even free on
subsidies so very interesting device the
build quality is still that Samsung
build quality that some of you know and
love and some of you know and hate so
however you feel about that you will
still feel the exact same way with the
galaxy s4 mini as always removable back
you're allowed to swap out your
batteries which I know is a really big
deal for some of you android users out
there
this one has a 1900 milliamp battery
that's compared to the galaxy s4 is 2600
milliamp battery and also it's got a
little bit of a camera downgrade in that
this is an eight megapixel shooter while
the full-sized 5-inch galaxy s4 is
rocking a 13 megapixel shooter so that's
it for our little mini comparison of the
galaxy s4 mini compared to the
full-sized samsung galaxy s4 see you
next video guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
