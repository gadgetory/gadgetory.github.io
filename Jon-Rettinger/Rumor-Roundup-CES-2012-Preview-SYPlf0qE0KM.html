to you by domain.com I've got all my new
techno Buffalo t-shirts my polo shirt my
other t-shirt my hoodie that means it
must be time for CES it's the CES
preview rumor roundup rub them up what
is going on everybody and welcome to
rumor roundup happy 2012 on behalf of
everybody at technobuffalo revision3 and
if I may speak so broadly the whole
interweb I want to wish you and yours a
peaceful and prosperous 2012 nothing but
the best for you and and everyone you
know in 2012 am beyond it's going to be
a great year it's already off to a great
start and it's going to be an awesome
awesome year I can just tell this is
also our 100th episode on rev 3 which is
awesome so thank you to all you for
making it possible thanks to the folks
at rev 3 for making it possible alright
it's a special CES preview episode like
I said in the teaser I got my gear I got
my uniform for the show my hoodie we've
got a gear store up now with all these
really cool technobuffalo t-shirts we've
got a couple different logos and all
kinds of colors and all that stuff but
the really cool thing about this is the
profits from sales of all the gear
shirts sweatshirts hats all that stuff
they go to charity which is awesome and
we're thrilled to be able to do it so
you know check out the gear store and
pick something up you know if you're a
fan and you need a new t-shirt or
something so let's get right to it we're
going to start with everybody's favorite
topic these days or if not favorite the
one we seem to talk about the most
mobile what can we expect what are the
rumors CES 2012 in the world of mobile
smart phones and tablets first off LTE
superphones Ice Cream Sandwich and mango
little mango flavor ice cream so now
they're going to be separate you can get
ice cream sandwich you're getting at
your mango we're looking for a whole
bunch of LTE phones particular we're
looking for AT&amp;amp;T in the US they just lit
up LTE
out here in San Francisco as well as
down in Orange County where the Irvine
office of technobuffalo is we're looking
for a bunch of lte stuff from AT&amp;amp;T
windows phone and Android alike we're
looking for a big push on Windows Phone
particularly from Nokia the rumored
Lumia 900 ace said to be coming to AT&amp;amp;T
also looking for some other devices the
HTC the code name is radiant it looks a
lot like the HTC Titan Samsung LTE
equipped device some stuff from pantech
actually kind of a smaller name in the
in the cell phone industry with David
cranking out phones for a long time
looking for an LTE equipped phone and
possibly an LTE equipped tablet coming
from pantech we're looking to Nvidia
last year they rock CES with the Tegra 2
quad core system on a chip this year
it's going to be all about Tegra 3 and
the rise of the super phone quad core
enabled we've seen the asuste epad
transformer prime we're looking for now
the first wave of phones quad core
phones believe it or not also looking
for a bunch of new devices whether these
are going to be dual core quad core I
don't know but kind of keeping on the
whole Android superfone theme LG
revolution to motorola droid for their
up to the four already that be a slider
qwerty phone for verizon possibly more
additions to the razor lineup as well if
you can believe it there's already so
many razors that have come out since
they revive the name sony ericsson maybe
drop in a couple of big time phones at
CES the Xperia Arc HD and also rumors of
an unnamed device that would be even
bigger and badder and more powerful and
I think we had a rumor about that one on
the site a little while ago that that
may be headed to AT&amp;amp;T and the tablet
space ice cream sandwich ice cream
sandwich ice cream sandwich nvidia again
the nvidia power Tegra 3 quad-core
system and ship i expect to see that and
a bunch of tablets probably will see a
bunch of tablets running honeycomb just
so the companies can show off the
tablets now but you know upgradable to
ice cream sandwich later and a bunch of
different sizes you know in addition to
the 10.1 inch we've seen 7-inch 8-inch
the galaxy note the 5-inch sort of phone
tablet hybrid sprint will we see at
least teasers of the first LTE phones
from sprint the Sprint has to go out to
eat
wimax just not cutting it especially not
up against the likes of I mean not so
much even against t-mobile's hspa+
although that's not going to be a
long-term solution with verizon AT&amp;amp;T now
just blazing fast LTE where it's
available you know Sprint's wimax not
really cutting it anymore so maybe
Windows 8 you know not coming out till
mid 2012 with the earliest but will we
see any previews nokia has talked about
launching a Windows 8 tablet nokia said
to be just rolling out a multi-million
dollar 1 million dollar ad campaign for
the project rolling thunder bringing the
Windows Phone experience on nokia to the
US we'll have to see but look for a big
showing from Nokia as relates to windows
mobile windows phone aside windows
mobile windows phone I'm stuck in the
past what your is it another big trend
we're looking for at CES is the
Ultrabook ultrabook is a marketing term
that intel made up basically to to push
their processors that are running in
this it's sort of almost like a stopgap
niche if you will that's kind of better
than a netbook but kind of holding down
the fort until the full fledged
ultra-thin ultralight intel-powered
notebooks the full on laptops running
the forthcoming ivy bridge architecture
are available later this year so you're
going to get a lot of these devices some
of them have already come out now like
the ax susan book if that's actually
shipping and the samsung series 9 but
you know in a lot of ways they sort of
model Apple's MacBook Air so expect at
least 30 some reports saying 50 or more
which is crazies and my big question is
how cheap do they have to become for
people to pick up on them well people
pay 999 or more for a windows powered
device you know with these specs when
they can get a powerful windows powered
laptop for much less or is the price
point have to come down to something
like 8 99 or 799 or even 699 for these
things to really catch on I want to take

fastest way to just get through not even
all of it but just some of the other
stuff we're expecting cameras 20
megapixels 1080p video thin and powerful
point and shoot models what can we
expect from new dsl DSLRs cars we're
going to have outtie cadillac Chrysler
mercedes-benz Tesla and more companies
at CES talking about Auto Tech TVs is
this going to be the big coming-out
party for the newly revised version of
Google TV Sony's planning a wedding
they've got this great website up and LG
is going to be showing off apparently
they're 55 inch super duper thin Oh LED
TV which led to ease our sweet giving up
cable for watching TV over the internet
all that kind of stuff stay tuned and I
don't know man let me know when they
come up with a headband that can grow
hair now I like my smooth head anyway
wearable tech also another big thing at
the show last but not least one more
thing will Apple pull an apple and steal
the thunder from CES without even being
there in years past Apple has you know
they used to participate in Macworld and
they would announce stuff and then also
in years past they just made very
carefully timed announcements that come
in the middle CS will Apple do anything
this year I don't know there are rumors
that they may announce a media event in
New York City set for mid to late
january and the rumors say that this
wouldn't be a hardware event but instead
would focus on the education industry
publishing the future of electronic
textbooks online learning
of course the rumors persist about an
ipad 3 stay tuned by the way I have to
pay up to Shawn at CES I will be
recording a special video in payment
because I lost the bet about ipad 3
coming out last year anyway there you go
everything I could think of including my
notes talking about CES 2012 I can't
wait we're going to be there starting on
Sunday all the coverage on rev 3 on the
website of course on social media so

not to get sued that's all I'm going to
say about that and in the meantime
