Noah Kravitz from technobuffalo and I'm
up here in Seattle for the intel appup
elements conference but last night i
escaped the conference went out to
dinner with some of the folks from HTC
as well as Miriam from engadget mobile
always fun to hang out with her and HTC
you know what can I say they're tasting
food definitely pretty good but they
knew what to bring that brought some
gadgets for us to play with one of them
was the amaze 4g this is one of the
phones that t mobile launched earlier in
the week at the mobilized conference in
san francisco our own emily price was
there and she got some hands-on time and
with the amaze 4g at the cocktail party
after the event but wasn't able to get
any video so i got some video last night
the lighting conditions weren't the best
in the you know the dimly lit hip sushi
place but hopefully this is coming
through all candy the amaze 4g goes on
sale october 10th online October twelfth
in stores to 59 99 after rebate with two
year contracts it's certainly not cheap
but it's pretty high spec stuff you got
of course Android Gingerbread comes
pre-loaded on the phone dual-core 1.5
gigahertz snapdragon s 3 processor under
the hood the camera is one of the big
selling points 8 megapixel camera with
dual-led flash on the back side and full
1080p HD video recording and then of
course a front facing camera for video
chat as well you've got a qHD display
540 x 960 NFC radio on the inside for
mobile payments all that stuff that
should be taken flight in the US next
year starting to now but i think really
next year's winner will see it ramped up
and of course this is one of t mobile's
first hspa+ 42 capable phones so in
real-world conditions you're not going
to be getting you know 42 megabits per
second on the regular using this thing
but I tmobile you know talking about
eight or so on regular basis with bursts
up to 20 with
impressive and if you have the coverage
t-mobile's high-speed network definitely
works very well works well for me in the
San Francisco Bay Area for sure but
anyway there you go first hands-on video
to go with Emily's hands on impressions
and photos from earlier in the week the
amaze 4g look much much more on this
phone on TechnoBuffalo calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
