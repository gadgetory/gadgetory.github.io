capabilities of the HTC One we are
outside it's a little bit overcast out
but we are using of course natural light
it is around 1 p.m. pacific time and in
california so you can see what this
looks like outside and also test the
audio go ahead and take a look at things
this is on normal settings nothing has
been tweaked here at all this is the
out-of-the-box settings for video it is
recording in full 1080p you can see how
things look can say hi to lucy as we get
close and see how things look when you
get up nice and close trying to follow
right so we are testing video indoors
now on the HTC One is just normal office
lighting you can see how it looks when
it focuses on a person I'll do a quick
tap to focus on Brandon I'll take five
steps back and do another tap to focus
your quickly adjusts of course also
we're testing the audio capabilities
here how the internal mic works
Brandon's hard at work on the post
you're probably going to read that's
going to talk about the camera you can
see how everything else looks here as
well putting pictures still images in a
video that gets uploaded to YouTube
won't do the images justice so if you
want to see how still images look both
outside inside HDR and regular and an
image or two versus an iphone links
going to be down below to go to the full
article on TechnoBuffalo calm it should
give you a much better sense of how
things are going to look if you like
