TechnoBuffalo here at they for review
for you of the HTC Desire Z which is
essentially the unlocked version of the
t-mobile g2 here in the US we're gonna
try some a little bit different I'm
gonna see if I can get through a full
phone review and under five minutes
giving you just the facts let's get
started I always start out my phone
reviews with phone quality this guy
pulls in a very strong signal although
through in the US and you're on ATT like
I was you're only going to get edge
service but it did pull down a very
strong edge service 20 call test I only
have one dropped call reception was a
very strong speakerphone quality very
very very loud and the fidelity of voice
calls was really solid the voice quality
is gonna be fantastic respects quick
recap 3.7 inch coarse capacitive screen
480 by 800 running Android 2.2 with
HTC's custom sets on top 1.5 gigabytes
of internal storage I feel like the
micro machine guy which has a microSD
expansion card thirteen hundred million
power battery battery life not fantastic
you are going to have to recharges
definitely on a daily basis on the rump
you've got a five megapixel camera that
can shoot HD video it's average didn't
get service standard photo and video
quality from the phone don't throw away
your DSLR I really do like the metal
feel of the back it's got a really
industrial feel to it let's go ahead and
power this guy on no SIM card installed
right now slide this down son lock and
you can see the new version of HTC Sense
which lets you fully customize the look
of Android again the Android 2.2 you've
got a lot of customization options that
live right here you can go ahead and
check out some of these customizations
in the unboxings but you in the unboxing
video which I'll put down below
you've got seeing the wallpaper and
skins at this point I should mention
that the folks at cloak coat UK hooked
me up with this review device links to
them are also going to be down below you
can customize the way this phone looks
one of the big point
this phone which one of things that I
love the most about it is it's full
slide-out QWERTY keyboard which you go
ahead and slide out it's probably one of
the best keyboards that I have used it's
spacious there's a lot of room yes of
customisable keys spacebar is really
nice and big one of the things that I
didn't like which I thought I was going
to is a slide-out mechanism which is
kind of neat but it wasn't as Springwood
as I would have liked so often times I
found it sort of getting stuck right in
the middle right there so you have to
really make sure you push it all the way
out if you don't mind this is going to
work really well and then you've got the
landscape orientation of the phone this
is again Android 2.2 so it's gonna be
able to handle all of your flash
contents and web browsing with flash
10.1 web browsing on this guy is a
fantastic experience it's got an 800
megahertz processor but don't get caught
up in the megahertz this phone is fast
it is a screamer and has really been
optimized for the software that it's
running probably one of the fastest
phone that I have tested thus far you
can see even with Flash content running
pinch-to-zoom and everything just works
really really really well
you've got four-way navigation across
the bottom with an optical trackpad
which I don't think I used once on this
guy I know a lot of people are wondering
hey John how fast is this really are you
lying to me well I'm going to show you
if I'm lying to you or not you can see
it for yourself this is a little bit on
the subjective side but I am going to
run a quadrant benchmark test I'm gonna
go and skip to the results but if you
want to watch the whole test being run
after the whooshing Buffalo at the end
credits you can actually watch the test
being run so let's go ahead and launch
quadrants alright so here are the
results of the benchmarking you can see
this phone is actually at the top above
the Motorola what is I can't read it
outright actually above the Nexus 1 the
Motorola Droid the HTC EVO the Droid X
Samsung Galaxy S and pretty much every
other Android device out there
this guy actually came out top on the
quadrant test and that really does
translate very nicely to real-world
speed from a science standpoint despite
having a full QWERTY keyboard you're not
dealing with that much bulk here we've
got an Xperia x10 to go and look at this
side
sigh there's not a giant difference so
what's the moral here with this phone I
would you happily happily happily use
this as my everyday phone if I were you
however I cannot because my primary
carrier is AT&amp;amp;T and I'd like to be able
to get 3G speeds however if I could get
3G speeds or if there was a variant that
let me do so I would definitely use this
phone so if you are a t-mobile customer
this is going to be one you have to look
at and our guys if I got to give it a 1
to 5 stars this thing earns a really
really really solid four point nine five
stars really the only small deduction
being for that keyboard sliding
mechanism which I just didn't like this
phone is a great choice for the Android
lover and you I'll see in the next video
bye bye
run the full benchmark test
ooh 3d flashing red planet plus moon
DNA deoxyribonucleic acid we want to
proceed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
