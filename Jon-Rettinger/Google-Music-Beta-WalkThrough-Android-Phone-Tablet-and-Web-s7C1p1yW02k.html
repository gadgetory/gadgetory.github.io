knowing from technobuffalo calm and this
is a walk through hands-on early look at
music beta by Google this is Google's
new music service they rolled out at
Google i/o earlier this week it's
invite-only right now and unlike other
early Google products there are no
invites to share it was just rolled out
to people who attended the i/o
conference which I did so I've got it up
and running we're going through a
screenshot here of kind of a motion
screengrab if you will of the service
running in a browser window on a Mac but
on a computer it's browser based so
we'll go through this real quick and
then after that we'll get a little more
in depth with looking at it on a couple
of Android devices a phone and the
tablet so basically the way it works is
once you sign in you link this to your
google account and then you upload your
own music to the cloud to google servers
as of right now there is no store for
renting or buying music from google
there are some links that let you shop
for music I will take a look at that
later when we look at the service
running on an Android smartphone but
those just take you to a google shopping
search results page not to any sort of
Google store lots of talk about how
Google wanted to have the record labels
on board and they're still trying to do
that so we'll see what happens and it'll
be especially interesting to see once
this rolls out and what if anything
Google's going to charge people to use
the service you know if you're going to
use this as opposed to something like
rhapsody or Napster or rd io or mog or
any of the services where you know you
pay a monthly subscription fee but you
basically just rent all the music you
want let alone something like itunes or
amazon mp3 where you buy music anyway I
here's the web interface and it you know
it works well it's it's easy to use its
functioning you know quite well you can
sort through your library on the
different ways on the left there by
songs artists albums genres you can set
up auto playlists based on a pandora
style thumbs-up thumbs-down kind of
thing or you can create instant mixes
which is kind of akin to apples genius
mix
in this case you pick a song and then
you hit the instant mix button and it
creates a mix based off of that song I
haven't really gone in depth and
analyzing how it chooses which songs the
b.o.b mix that I made there on the left
based on outkast song that one stuff
pretty well to hip-hop R&amp;amp;B kind of stuff
so that made sense I made another one
off of a spy mix song which is this
random band that I was in and that was
all over the place so go figure you can
also create playlists you saw me earlier
you can drag and drop songs into
playlists which is very easy to manage
very nice and then here's the music
manager piece of it which is an app that
you download and run in your computer
that lets you upload your music from
your computer up to Google's cloud based
servers so i'm downloading it now for
the mac it's a disk image it's about 18
megabytes and it basically runs in the
background and you access it via the mac
system preferences once it's running
now obviously there are versions of the
app that work on on Windows machines as
well so et cetera but here it is you
just drag and drop it and then when you
open it up like I said it first the
first time you load it up it pops up
isn't as a nap but once it's up and
running you access it like I sent via
the system preferences and really all
you're doing is you're telling it you're
linking to your google account and then
you're telling the app what music you
want to upload this can be a little
tricky if you want certain of your music
but not all of it you have to go through
and put it into folders and select which
folders to upload and which ones you
don't want to upload in my case all of
my music is in my music folder my music
directory inside of different sub
directors inside of that and I said you
know what let's just upload it all so I
choose a music folder I hit continue and
it starts uploading in the background
now the first thing that has to do is
scan and the scam process takes a little
while and the upload process actually
it's a little bit slower once I actually
you know win it and thought about how
many megabytes are being moved and how
long it's taking and compared at-bat to
something like uploading a you know 200
men YouTube file it's actually kind of
been slow in the upload process at any
rate that all happens in the backgrounds
you can leave that running and so one of
the things that's really cool about the
android market now is that you can
install an app from your from the
webview and shoot it out over the air to
a device so i'll go send it to another
device guys are i've already installed
the music app on one actually more than
one device so here's a list of all the
devices that have been registered to my
account now you know a review a lot of
stuff so what kind of what can I tell
you so it's on my nexus s 4g so I'm the
Samsung device I'm going to go ahead
excuse me and install it on just want to
get this in the window here so you can
see how it works the ADR 6350 which is
more commonly known as the incredible 2
from HTC for verizon so there is the ADR
6350 which is a device that already has
my google account on
you can see I've got you know gmail
notification everything so going to go
ahead and hit select that and then hit
install and processing the install
requests and look at that there is I got
the notification instantly very IM
you're instantly you know pretty much
instantly you're very very cool and you
can see now oh it's done we're installed
and so if i go now to successfully
installed music there you see it at the
top so to show you now how it runs we
can just leave this on the background
and so actually in the background here i
should still have yeah music major so
more than 8,000 songs found and we're
going to go ahead and just say think
this previously from a different machine
that had a much smaller music library on
it so now it's going to go ahead and
just upload all these songs in the
background and just continue to add them
to my library so in the meantime i will
just leave this running in the
background and we can go ahead and we
can hide so i go ahead and hide
everything else that's running in the
background there's part of my music
folder you know more than 8,000 tracks
got a ton of stuff in there and that'll
just upload in the background and as
those songs are upload they'll be
available to me via google music or
music beta by google and there's that
there's my little and installed a
notifier a little menu up in the menu
bar so 121 of about 8,200 installed or
uploaded so far 122 now so you just go
into the background so leave that
running come back to the phone here and
we'll run music
and so what it needs to do is start
sinking so it's going to take it a
second the first time see if I hit learn
morons can save me the web page where i
can learn more ok and so there we go
invited a music player by google cetera
et cetera select the account to link to
this so select the account to link to
music beta so we'll go ahead and do that
and I've now been added to my its and
I'm going to add to my google account
and so basically I'm just adding a new
device and now the songs that I have in
there which are still uploading in the
background you know more and more what
are we up to now from Troy 6 those that
just keep running and so here's the
interface for music beta on android
phone it'll rotate so you can use it in
either landscape or portrait and this is
connected over Wi-Fi right now it'll
work over Wi-Fi or cellular so let's go
to a bit outcast
and you can see the song view go back
so now it's streaming so it takes it a
little second to start buffering and
streaming and then this will play in the
background to leave it playing go back I
could stop if I want to I can make an
instant mix I can make a playlist you
know similar to the desktop interface or
the web interface i should say i could
hit Outkast go see all the outcasts that
I have I'll put something else on will
Bob Dylan
and so again it's streaming it's not
local so it does take you know depending
on your network connection but I mean
that was Wi-Fi that was very fast then
it went ahead and started streaming and
so you can hit the music icon up there
in the corner to go back if I go to
settings so okay so one thing down here
in the menu make available offline so
this is what google calls pinning and it
basically means mobile caching so now I
hit the make available offline I've got
just about 15 gigs free of my device so
I go ahead and choose what I want to be
pinned to be cached locally for me to
listen to when I don't have connectivity
so blood on the tracks made the whole
album will make I don't even know what's
on here Matt I have some weird old music
and some weird new music and some good
music and some lame music oh it doesn't
matter let's gooo the church unknown
album by the church so okay we'll leave
those available for pinning and now
let's go keep the phone running but
let's go to settings and go to wireless
and networks and disable all wireless
connections and now you can see the
icons changed so unable to download
songs at this time okay right so it
can't it can't put it can't download
those songs that I had set to pin
because around the connection anymore
I'm an airplane mode it's continuing to
play Bob Dylan title button below I'll
hit pause for a second and now let's
show only the music that's available
offline and site so now you can see that
the music that I set to pin so that
outcast and the Bob Dylan is available
some of the other stuff is not just
because it hadn't had a chance to
download all of it yet
and so basically that's how it works so
it's kind of nicely you can set the
mobile caching or the local caching I
should say you know the pinning is they
call it to pin whichever tracks you want
you can do that right here on the device
and kind of manually manage it you know
pretty easily the interface is pretty
nice it's clean I'll show you the
interface on a tablet as well this is
the galaxy tab 10-1 limited edition the
google i/o edition which i should point
out this is not the final software for
this device but it's been working pretty
well so in general so I here's here's
music i already had music open earlier
so we'll go back a little bit and on the
Tabata looks really nice you've got all
the album the album art and then you can
use the menu the contextual menu to drop
down and look at how you want to search
your menu search your library I should
say so I'll go to songs I can search
through all the songs instead and also
David Bowie you get the nice full view
you can rotate kind of hard to get this
little thing interview here the camera
to push this back
can go
for number by her lips turned on by a
little bit and actually I should be able
I think I haven't actually tried this
yet but i think i should be able will
turn airplane mode off here and get
Wi-Fi back and Wi-Fi is back now so i
should be able to stream different music
two different devices I would think
library options all music and so so
you're gonna play Al Green
and there you go i'm streaming two
different songs from my same Google
Music account to two different devices
that a problem should i could get a
third one going here on the laptop yep
so there you go i can be signed in
multiple places on my same account
playing multiple songs streaming from
the cloud via google music or music beta
by google a couple things i'll mention
or one thing i'll mention i tested this
out kind of more extensively what is
like which ones playing i tested this
out a little more extensively the other
day on a nexus s 4g on sprint walking
from my house to the bart train taking
bart from oakland bart as the commuter
train here in the bay area taking bart
from oakland into san francisco to go go
to google i/o getting off the train
walking to the conference etc and the
one thing I found is that when i hit
network issues with the network you know
obviously that's going to affect the
playback and what was interesting and
you know little not surprising but but a
little disappointing i guess was that
when i went to hand offs from 4g areas
to 3g areas the music streamwood hiccup
and so you know they're going to be
depending on you know that's going to
help it if you hit a cell phone dead
zone but with the new 4g phones that
handoff area is a problem in terms of
you know certain data applications and
certainly it's been a problem for me on
the sprint phone i haven't tried a
verizon 4g phone yet with google music
or music beta i want to call it that but
google music but with the sprint phone
it was an issue just the handoff from 4g
2 3g i definitely you know felt it or i
should say heard it when they hiccup in
the music which is to back to bad aside
from that the service it works really
low for what it does like i said at the
top you know this is a by all accounts
not what google wanted to launch they
wanted to launch something with a bunch
of the music studios on board
I had one way or another but they
weren't able to do that hopefully you
know for Google's sake for the sake of
people want to use the service they will
be able to get something worked out and
whether that's you know a music store
you can buy tracks directly through
google music or a subscription service
to rival something like you know our di
o or mog or rhapsody or Napster or
whatever who knows what it'll be but as
it is now you can't buy anything through
google but you can upload your music and
then stream it and so far it works quite
well and the ability to cache stuff
locally for playback when you know
you're an airplane mode and don't have
service that kind of thing also very
nice so so far so good for you know what
the service is there are a few things
that I just competitive you know
landscape wise I wish it had the ability
to you know buy or rent music through it
but for what it is it works really well
thumbs up so far in general from me for
the music beta by Google there you go
little a little lengthy walk through if
you have questions you want to know more
no I don't have any invites there are no
invites to share and I'm not just saying
that so you want to ask it's the truth
there are no invites to share at this
point but if you want to know more about
it definitely hit me up on Twitter over
on TechnoBuffalo calm and I will try to
answer questions to keep you updated as
the service you know expands and grows
and everything i'll show you the tab
with you one more time but in the
meantime here's a first look at music
beta by google for the various android
devices and if I go home here you can
see there's a widget I've installed
already so I can control the music from
the home screen
and then just tap through to launch the
app so very cool works very well there
you go much much more a music beta by
Google and everything else going on an
Android land musicland technology land
over on techno Buffalo calm till next
time my name is Noah thanks for watching
see ya
