rebate what's going on everybody I'm
Noah from TechnoBuffalo calm and this is
the new BlackBerry Bold 9900 for
t-mobile it's available for pre-order
now it'll be in stores on October 31st
to $99.99 on contract after a $50 rebate
so 350 upfront closer to your contract
$300 you're the net cost for the bold
9900 lots going on with this device
you've seen coverage already on the site
of the new bold for some of the other
carriers we'll get this one out of the
box
you've got blackberry 7 new BlackBerry
operating system capacitive touchscreen
2.8 inch with your full keyboard and
trackpad down there get this thing fired
up is there battery life is there better
relief Oh sadness falls across the land
it's better I just I didn't know let's
find out also in the box maybe the
batteries just not installed you get yes
indeed the batteries on the stalls
fantastic all that'll teach me also in
the Box you get a whole bunch of stuff
or no it's not
that wasn't the battery that was the
cleaning cloth man get me excited and
unexcited and everything else in the box
all your manuals yep but Snapdragon
processor 1.2 gigahertz Snapdragon all
your manuals your your case what would a
blackberry be without a holster case
really the explain micro USB charger I
only know that's what's called because
it's sticking together and it is your
micro USB charger there's your
blackberry polishing cloth which I
mistakenly thought was the battery for a
second there three-and-a-half millimeter
stereo headset and your USB two micro
USB connector now the phone itself
it's been a while since I've used a
blackberry and this thing's pretty thin
I can understand on first glance why
everybody so many people are so excited
about it although I can also understand
why there's some people who aren't that
makes a lot of sense right anyway so
batteries inside I guess there's no
juice in it I'll have to get that I
charged up and fired up so we can do a
little hands-on with the phone but on
the device itself obviously a full
QWERTY keyboard on the front capacitive
touch screen like we said 2.8 inch you
got your buttons down there and your
optical thumb pad you've also got 5
megapixel camera on the back with LED
flash and 720p HD video recording
alright so I've got a plugged in now
I've got some power happening on so you
can get this blew it up or the battery
might just be so dead we're gonna have
to wait a little while in the meantime
you've got on the left spine your micro
USB port and your 300 millimeter
headphone jack on the right spot and
you've got four buttons three of them
arranged in a rocker switch select
configuration and then your shortcut key
full QWERTY keyboard optical thumb pad
your for BlackBerry menu buttons and
then a capacitive touchscreen again 2.8
inch phone also has a 12 1230 milliamp
hour hour battery
Wi-Fi 802 F and BGN t-mobile 4G what
they call 4G HSPA+ data speeds eight
gigs of internal storage the display by
the way 480 by 640 forgot to mention
that quad-band GSM what else stereo
Bluetooth GPS all that stuff kind of
used to full HTML browser Instant
Message pre-loaded instant messaging
supports bbm of course but also AOL I am
Google Talk Windows Live and Yahoo
Messenger and you know the phone feels
nice in the hand it's it's felt it's
pretty thin especially for a blackberry
nice styling and of course the keyboard
I was recently using the the Sprint X
the motorola expert kind of the the
Android alternative for BlackBerry users
one of them if you will a similar styled
phone and it was very narrow and the
keyboard was just it's just been too
narrow for me to comfortably type on so
I'll be psyched to check this one out
we'll have to come back soon with a full
look at this because I you know it's an
unboxing gotta unbox usually there's
enough juice in the battery you at least
turn the phone on but not right now but
that's right cuz you've seen it already
blackberry 7 on John's coverage of the
new devices so we'll come back with more
on the bold 9900 for t-mobile what's
this thing's fired up but again t-mobile
bold 9900 300 bucks after rebate on
contract 350 up front but should you get
dual core processor the new BlackBerry 7
OS just as I was going to end the video
now it's powering up so we'll give it a
second again it's up for pre-sale for
t-mobile business customers now and
expected availability in stores August
31st via t-mobile John's big fan he
switched to the bold he's convinced at
least one other person an iPhone user
that we both know to switch said iPhone
user is not so happy yet but I hear he's
signed on for a month in blackberry
world to uh to see what he thinks
so I'm very interested myself to give
this a try I don't know if I could live
without the front-facing camera I'm used
to not for video chatting we're just for
looking at myself all day but we'll see
booting booting booting
here we go don't forget we're giving
away a ton of stuff if you're watching
this during the month of August or early
to mid-september doing a bunch of
back-to-school giveaways on the site so
check that out for sure let's just dive
you know what let's just cancel buncha
giveaways over on the website
TechnoBuffalo calm a lot of sponsors
involved we appreciate their support
definitely check that out in the
meantime I have a new voicemail that's
terrific touch screen weird to have a
touchscreen on a blackberry
but indeed some 4G support right now so
let's go to TechnoBuffalo yeah see
keyboard that's what it's all about and
it might be nice to have a physical
keyboard I'm so not used to it see if
this loads up in mobile vo if this is
mobile view this is not particularly
fast this is the full website still a
little pokey but um well yeah now we're
getting into pokey pokey do the pokey
pokey and you turn yourself around
someday the site will load alright so
there's the site responsive though the
pension zooms pretty responsive
DoubleTap zoom in crazy to be doing this
on a blackberry I mean I know I know the
torch and the storm and everything but
still I'm just just I don't know I've
been covering mobile phones for too long
and the idea of doing this on a
blackberry just wacky to me so there you
go first look uh yes that is not the
time but whatever that's fine I'll fix
it later first look at the bold 9900 I'm
actually kind of excited to play with
this even if it's just to decide well
whatever's to decide but I'm excited to
play with it John again so high on it
and I've been hearing a lot of good good
reviews good things about the keyboard
and it'll be fun to have a phone that
with real buttons that I want to type on
which on first type just typing
TechnoBuffalo there it seemed seem good

message that's fine whatever
