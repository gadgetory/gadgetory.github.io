TechnoBuffalo here one of my favorite
features for Android is finally made its
way to I oh s Google now is for lack of
a better word here now go ahead get
downloading let me show you what you can
expect when you do so Google now is an
ingenious little application found in
modern Android devices it gives you a
card interface showing you some basic
information that you're gonna need
throughout your day how longs it take
you to get home for example how long can
take you to get work what plane trips
you have coming with train trips you
have coming sports scores stocks scores
a ton of other awesome as surf predicts
what you're going to need to see when
you want to see it I use it all the time
on Android I'm really excited to see it
finally make its way to iOS so first we
could needs a free Google search app
it's not a separate Google now
application go ahead and download that
sucker and open it up and here's what
you're going to be greeted with apps
videos and goggles sup that was there
before but now cards appear when you
need them it's kind of cool so your
regular Google search here you've got
Google Voice if you want to do search
that way now if you swipe up you're
going to have all kinds of card
awesomeness so swipe cards away you
don't need them you can just swipe up
it'll show you cards so how long will
take me to get home for example you can
get directions right from there you
could swipe that right off I saw my
angels lost a heartbreaker to the
Mariners yesterday actually watch that
game was a bad game I can see even more
heartbreaking the Lakers and the
frustrating season got swept out by the
Spurs I definitely want to swipe that
one off I can see what some stocks are
doing what the weather is here in Irvine
you could show a ton of more cards if
you want to a new place you can go into
settings you can see what you can set
cards for Gmail travel public transport
if you take a train every day I'll tell
you if the Train is running on time
it'll tell you whether movie stock
scores and a ton of Awesome things here
and it works just as it does on Android
with one big exception no notifications
so if you do this pull down tray you're
not gonna have any sort of Google now
stuff there at least not yet but
hopefully that will be coming soon it's
integrated seamlessly with Google
experience so I give Google a credit for
bringing us io s and iOS users should be
really excited it's one of the flagship
features of Android at least for me and
now you've got the option to get it
right here
on iOS so what'd you guys think you
excited not excited is Google now
something you are going to be
downloading and using I know that I will
I love to hear your thoughts please give
the video a thumbs up we must definitely
appreciate it I am John rhett endure
from TechnoBuffalo I'll see you the next
one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
