technobuffalo here live from IFA with
one of the stars of the show this is the
samsung galaxy note the just-announced
tablet phone hybrid 5.3 into the
whopping 1280 x 800 resolution here play
the screen let's actually gorgeous being
powered by samsung's new jewel or 1.4
digger processor this thing is
absolutely gargantuan but feel
surprisingly good in the hand is
extremely thin let's take a real quick
tour of the device so go ahead and
launch some applications here so we got
the home screen looks very typical touch
with front facing camera on the left
hand side of advice you've got your
volume rocker up and down on the right
got your power and lock button on the
bottom though some interesting lemon
there is a stylist here so go ahead and
pop it over you can see the rear facing
camera and the plastic back go ahead and
pop this out and try it one handed we
have a stylist the same magnetic stylist
different than the capacity of a
resistive that was seen as you go ahead
and navigate through and actually use
this to doodle or write some notes but
open up the S Memo application here go
ahead and draw on this dog looks like
he's asking for it and you go ahead and
just write serious bows whatever you
would like to write up so you have to
have the notes part enable here let's go
ahead and add a new one all right now I
can go ahead and this right is pretty
accurate take a look at the one to one
here so I go as I it's a pipe it look
like it's falling it pretty closely
that's a quick look at that to go ahead
and go home hit that giant home but the
big question here is how does it feel in
the hand and could use as a phone and
the answer seems to be yes it's
certainly not going to be small in your
pocket but you definitely could use this
it's a big form factor really
you need to hold it in person we
appreciate it so many pull out of bones
to give you guys another confession
bears been here there's a blackberry
bold 9900 now you can see the size
difference here was how big the note is
but really appreciate how thin it is
especially if you hold its side by side
so this has been a very quick first look
at the samsung galaxy note it is HSP
across enabled suspension will be a
phone go ahead and make some phone calls
here and call whoever big home button
here it's a lot of them things just work
very well very smooth the resolution of
the screen is absolutely amazing 1280 by
800 a mobile device is awesome and the
video here is not going to express as it
looks as good as you'd expect which is
pretty pretty awesome so for all your
