to give you an overview of the new
twitterrific twitter client for the
iphone and ipod touch just updated this
week by the icon factory so let's go
ahead and get started here is the icon
it's that little bird we'll go ahead and
click it and it really is a complete
makeover of the old client dole client
needed a lot of work this one actually
seems relatively refined so the first
you'll notice is you get a twitter
counter with how many new tweets have
shown up since you last load of the
application which is very cool so you
can scroll up in view your tweets just
in the list from all the friends that
you have any personal messages that you
have will show up in a color or any at
replies let's see we can find the final
owner so there's a knack reply you can
see that it's different than makes it
easy to follow now on any of these let's
say there's a tweet from Andrea it can
double click it and it pulls a pretty
decent amount of information about hope
there's mattson Toboso pretty these
different disease and matter information
about him so let me show you something
first here so we'll click this just once
you'll notice that i have a few rows of
icons across the bottom I've got a back
I can reply back to him a new star icon
or that little kind of twirly guy I'll
show you what both all those do but
first let's hit the star and this pulls
up a very new menu items so we can view
threaded messages so if I've been having
a threaded conversation that replies
with this person for a while I can hit
that and it'll just show up in one
window which is actually quite nice I've
got an author it'll show me about the
author it's a little dad I'll shoot me
all about andreia tunes and worries from
how many followers updates in the last
eight seconds where he is you can choose
to follow unfollow or block everything
that he has replied to people you can
start it or you can even leave a little
message I'll just show up on your phone
about this person so you can say aundrea
lives in Italy is a law student and it
won't show up anywhere else but your
phone case you need to remember a little
about the person actually is kind of
handy and kind of cool and if you want
to reply or send a note to let me just
hit the bubble on the bottom so we'll go
back let me show you some other things
that show up when you hit the star so
now you also have the at author so if
that will just plop message that will
let you add reply and i'll show you all
the out replies that have been sent to
the author which is kind of neat we also
have retweet so makes retweeting very
easy so if you want to retweet that
message that you selected get retweet
and it's nice and easy if you want to
add a link you can hit a link right
there if you want to start as a favorite
or if you watch put a check mark next to
it or if you want to even send them a
message to that person a personal email
or a direct message let's go ahead and
hit cancel they also have that little
weird icon go ahead and hit that now
that does it shows you first if you have
any mark tweets it shows you your @
replies it'll show you your direct
messages and you start messages you have
show you all the messages that you sent
any check messages that you have so if
that was even enough it still would have
been great those are fantastic updates
and really things that the last client
didn't have but there's also some new
things that we have in here you will at
the top left corner you have a thing
called sources and the top right you can
now change your font so to go ahead and
select font you can make it giant tiny
what I consider to be a normal size font
so go back to sources and I'll show you
what you can view here you give you a
public timeline of all Twitter tweets
you can view all of your tweets you can
do a quick search now you can view
people twittering nearby i'll use the
gps if you're using an iphone you can
learn about twitterrific you can also
check recent trends that are being
tweeted about right at this moment
really is a very cool full feature
client and this one actually is free it
is are some ads that show up in there
and there is one that you can pay that
will remove the ads but for me out of
mind looking at a door to I think it's
fantastic iphone Twitter client and
definitely worth checking out if you
guys haven't already just wanted to give
you guys an overview of twitterrific let
me know what you think about it if you
you like it if you're using another
Twitter client for your iphone or ipod
touch what you think is better or worse
about it and you guys hope you enjoyed
