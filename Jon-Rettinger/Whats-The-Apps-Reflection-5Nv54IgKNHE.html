to you by fresh books hello there folks
is John Q here from TechnoBuffalo hope
you guys are doing peachy welcome to
another episode of what's the app today
we're gonna shake things up a little bit
and check out a desktop app that let me
finish involves your iOS devices and you
know I didn't mention shake things up a
little bit not a lot that's not how I
roll you know sometimes here and there
sprinkle like this Tim in reflection is
a simple elegant and seamless app that
allows you to mirror your iOS device on
to your Mac OS computer it's based on
Apple's AirPlay and it works absolutely
beautifully all it takes is for your
computer and your iOS device to be on
the same internet connection and you're
all set at first you might be thinking
well why do I really need to do this my
device is right there in front of my
face 99.99% of the time and in most
situations you probably won't need to
but in certain cases where you would
need to do this reflection handles it
perfectly if you're a mobile app or
mobile web designer or developer and you
want to showcase your latest work to
your team or to your clients in a
conference call or conference room kind
of setting then BAM just use reflection
the response time is an instant but it's
pretty gosh darn close there's almost no
lag and the on screen display even
rotates when you rotate your device very
very handy or if you like me have to
record your devices screens for app
reviews video projects commercials and
everything in between
reflection works great stepping out of
work mode reflection is also great for
mobile gaming you will be able to use
your Mac OS to display to supersize your
iOS games this should work for all games
but it's only really practical for games
that don't really require you to look at
what you're pressing like doodle jump
tiny wings and so on and because it's
all powered by airplay if you have the
reflections app running on your computer
you can stream music from your iOS
devices as well the quality isn't as
great compared to the songs being played
from your computer but it's a nifty
option to have
at first when I found out about this app
I was crazy excited because I thought
you'd be able to not only mirror your
iOS devices onto your desktop but to
control it as well but alas you can't
control your die oh s devices from your
Desktop no matter though the app works
beautifully and speaking of beautifully
it may take some time to thank our
friends at fresh books I know a lot of
you folks out there including myself
either works for small business runs a
small business or know somebody who
works or runs a small business and a
great example is TechnoBuffalo we're
small business and part of doing
business is to do invoicing for example
a guy named Jimmy asks me to just shout
out on camera so how's it going Jimmy
hope you're doing swell and after doing
that I'm my invoicing for it and my
invoices and shutteth don't come cheap
which is why I'm super excited to talk
about our brand new sponsor fresh books
as the design and UI guy I got to tell
you that fresh books has all that
business and everything else down to a
science
their services their control panel their
invoices everything just so minimalistic
clean elegant easy to use and their
invoices just look super pro you can set
up clients set up online payments add
taxes add terms and notes and you can
send it via email when you're all done
plus fresh books tracks the history of
the invoices and payments so there won't
be any discrepancies when it comes down
to the money's right Jimmy turn
something that's rather boring and you
kind of dread doing like invoicing into
something that's fresh exciting and fine
and the best thing about fresh books is
that you can try for free with no
limitations all the clients staff
invoices and features are completely
free just go to FreshBooks comm and sign
up for the free trial in fact don't just
sign up be sure to send a few invoices
right away once you do it you'll never
want to go back and when you do sign up
be sure to tell them that you heard
about them from TechnoBuffalo overall
reflection is fantastic the app
definitely isn't for everyone especially
with you rather steep and rather
standard desktop app price tag they do
provide a trial but the trial session
expires within around 10 minutes and if
you're like me and you're really into
this sort of stuff ten minutes is all it
took to convince me to pick it up
reflection for Mac OS four out of five
well I hope you guys enjoyed my review
of reflection this is John Q from
TechnoBuffalo thank you very much for
tuning in and I'll see you guys next
time
