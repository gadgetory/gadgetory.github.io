TechnoBuffalo here at the unboxing and
overview of a product so crappy that i
cannot wait to show it with you and you
can all bask in its knockoff awesomeness
please meet the epad let's go ahead and
dig in alright so before we look at all
the fake knockoff mists of this device
let's go ahead check out the box because
the box itself is super entertaining
first I think this is running Android
2.1 yet it's got the internet explorer
logo right there as part of the e that's
kind of funny in its own right so the
box itself is just a ton of jokes sort
of built into it so first there's a
Windows logo in the upper right hand
corner which is awesome with a minimize
and the close button the battery they're
showing is almost drained with just a
little bar of battery life it's got the
Windows Explorer or in Explorer rather
icons across the top at the home in the
back I mean it's tough you really
haven't seen 6 X since XP the icons are
on the front are clearly a mash-up of
some iOS some windows and what other
other weird things they could come up
with I had a family friend that went to
China brought this back for me thought
it was too funny not to share I can't
really tell you what this thing costs
cuz they didn't really know was that it
was a gift from someone who knew in
China but Amazon's got something similar
listed for $249 this thing is probably
not worth the cost of the box that it's
put in so don't even consider buying one
of these things let me just show it to
you and show you why
alright so the box itself super funny
filled with very weird contradictions go
ahead and open it up got a power adapter
and a little sort of a proprietary port
might be microUSB here for a Ethernet
we'll talk about that in a minute
let's go ahead and pull out the iPad and
fast in its awesomeness for just a few
minutes alright so clearly it supposed
to look like the
pad right hence the pad name and it
looked similar you know I'll give it
that black bezel on has a screen and a
home button let's go ahead and take a
look around the device so you've got
supposedly stereo speakers super crappy
don't work we'll talk about those a
little bit on the top we've got nothing
supposed to be a microphone doesn't
really work it suppose we also an
ambient light sensor doesn't work either
there's another microphone input here so
here we've got sort of a proprietary
port doesn't really do much there's your
power button that's where you're
supposed to be able to plug in that
Ethernet port doesn't work either volume
up and down
you've got DC in you've got a strange
mini USB port you've got an actual USB
port audio in and out there's a hard
reset button and then there's yet
another microphone in the back it
doesn't even have a fake Apple logo
alright so let's go ahead and turn this
guy on so those you that are familiar
with Android supposedly running Android
2.1 which obviously is based on the open
source Linux operating system we don't
necessarily see linux when you boot into
typical Android so check this out and go
ahead and turn the power on go ahead and
boot up you get the e pad logo you can
see me in there check it out the tux
penguin that's kind of find out some you
see a very strange sort of an old
Android look I'm not sure if they just
copied Android and sort of made their
own operating system that looked like
Android which would be weird because
androids open-source anyway but as I
sort of go through and show you you'll
see so you get that's really android
logo not many people are familiar with
this is not just a stock Android I think
you get you get a blue indicator light
also letting me know that it's powered
on I can't wait to the sync boots up so
I can show you the crabby awesomeness of
this thing so it is a resistive
touchscreen as easy and you're looking
at this thing okay it looks kind of
Android II maybe John doesn't know what
he's talking about so let's go ahead and
take a look first at this menu so it's
Android but you don't have a home button
a back button or search button
they put those buttons at the top so
let's say I want to jump into settings
which will go back to in a minute and
then you're like hey
I don't want to be in settings oh look
at settings is even opening up their
yard let's say hey I don't want to be in
settings well there's no home button to
go back to it's actually hit it on the
screen to go back and it'll sort of work
sometimes not always
all right so speaking of setting let's
go ahead and jump in and see if we can
learn anything about this guy so we'll
go ahead and scroll to the bottom and
there is about device let's go ahead and
check out so there's a model number box
box box box box some Chinese symbol and
you've got firmware version 2.1 so it is
running android 2.1 which sort of gives
devices that are not running Android 2.1
you know excuse to not be at least
running with the sort of modern version
of android and get any more information
on that not going to get much baseband
version unknown legal information what
could a legal information they can say
about this thing open source licenses
okay that's the legal information so so
many Android stuff does work you can get
the services thing
speaking of services let me go ahead and
go back and I'll use that button at the
top to go back let's go ahead and go
back one more let's see go back again
all right so let's take a look at some
of the wireless up here which is kind of
kind of neat first there's Ethernet
configuration you really see that much
in Android let's go to wireless and
network here
3G EVDO turn on the 3G EVDO network okay
let's go ahead and turn that on doesn't
work there's no sort of a video radio
here and it China uses a similar EVDO
radio and networks and even if they used
a different video bands which are based
on a CDMA network we still get some sort
of notification battery's gonna die on
this thing hopefully we can get enough
time to show you which is kind of weird
so they've got that in there but the
feature doesn't work so I'm gonna go
ahead and jump in and show you the
browser because hey I'm sure you want to
see that and check out all of its
Android 2.1 multi-touch browsing glory
yeah don't get your hopes up alright so
let's go to try to go to pull the plane
through the keyboard
all right
so there's the keyboard it's long and
stretched okay to go ahead and try and
rotate it stick it look what the
keyboard is gonna look like in portrait
looks stock Android so let's try going
to TechnoBuffalo you can see that
there's a Sara Lee register as quickly
as I'm typing all right I'll go and go
back to landscape mode and see what this
looks like and she would get some Flash
content on here and just trying to show
you the awesome crappiness of this all
right so it's loading you've got some
content there you can see it it's a web
page you're thinking pretty great news
right you can scroll down I'll be it
very slowly but you can read the text if
you want to do some pinch-to-zoom does
not support multi-touch there's you're
out of luck you got to use the old
tournament g1 stock Android way of
zooming in and out but it does doesn't
work sort of go ahead and go back home
but the Flash content wasn't showing up
there yet the big flash logo let's go
ahead and look at what sort of
applications are going to come here so
you get out of a browser realplayer IO
reader let's go and take a look at that
so cannot open SD card okay so nothing
really to do there in the eye reader
let's go ahead and go back to
applications but I'm open up here the
other thing called hi MSN it's going to
see what that looks like here's the
knockoff of MSN and that just sort of
crashed it so that one's not gonna work
benchmark that one sounds fun so go
ahead and see we can benchmark this guy
everything has a big question mark next
to it let's go ahead and benchmark
graphic see if they'll even let us do
this so let's run benchmark take a long
time do not turn this device off for any
benchmark all right so I'll run the
benchmark in a minute and I'll come back
to hasn't have to watch it and show what
it looks like you can see it doing
something here so you need to watch the
whole tests we can see how great and
fantastic this is testing for my Windows
Live ID and password I can tell you I
would not trust this thing with any sort
of passwords as far as I can throw it
and I probably can't throw it very far
because it's crappy build will probably
break as I'm throwing it let's go back
go to home there you go and go see if
it'll rotate back all right let's go see
what else is going to come on here so
setting with you already sure took a
look at let's go ahead and jump on over
just try to go to the other page you've
got task killer spare parts and this guy
someone I definitely can't read that but
perhaps some Mandarin speakers out there
kenderson what that says and you've
asked for nothing really that I would
trust I want to give it I don't know
what's good that one all right so that
got us back home and put an icon on the
home screen so we can go back let's go
ahead and take a look at let's say Maps
let's see if the GPS is going to
function on here so it is loading sort
of pulling up actually here you are I'm
at so I will give the maps credit it
took away the Chinese part and
brightening let's still give it credit
there we'll go back to this back to the
home button
let's go back and check a look at some
of the other stuff here so RSS reader
that looks like Android Market Place
which surprisingly is nowhere to be
found on here let's go ahead and see
what else and that is going to be it
let's take a look at gallery see what
sir the picture viewing it's going to
look like on here whether or not it's
stock Android or not SD card unmounted
that's unfortunate force clothes
applications stopped unexpectedly if I
you're gonna get that quite a bit
with the e pad the II should maybe stand
for error I'm going to try and hit the
home button that will take me more force
close buttons anyway I want to give you
guys a sort of a fun overview here
you've had turned to a lot longer video
expected to me it just says some fun and
show us the incredibly bad knockoffs
that are available out there do not buy
the e pad don't even consider buying the
e pad unless you need a knee pad coaster
it is just not worth it and I guys I am
John Breton your TechnoBuffalo I'll run
those benchmarks and put the results end
in this video in case you're curious
check out TechnoBuffalo for all your
tech news and
see you in the next video alright so as
promised here are the benchmarking
scores took about four minutes to run go
ahead and look at those graphic CPU free
Android fans out there and those that
are interested in what this might be
capable of go ahead and see everything
right in there and bask in the power of
the e pad to see you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
