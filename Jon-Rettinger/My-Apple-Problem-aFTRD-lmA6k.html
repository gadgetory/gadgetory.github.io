that I've given to Apple over the years
between every generation of iPhone iPads
MacBooks IMAX for me I am extra the
staff computers that I've bought for
friends and family and the computers and
phones that I have helped the audience
by the number was god of a gut punch and
it came in over $100,000 that is an
insane amount of money for anything let
alone to give to one company so we
talked a lot about Apple on the channel
they're an interesting company that's
doing a lot of interesting things but I
don't always agree with everything that
they're doing and I tend to be pretty
vocal when I tend to disagree I'm not
sure what camp you're in but one thing
you can't deny about Apple is that
company knows how to sell things but we
think we've got something that is and
we'd like to show it to you today for
the first time and we call it the iPad
apples ability to sell tends to always
go back to when these products were
announced these keynotes
that they put on are unlike anything
else in the tech industry from the
presentation to the simplistic style to
live demonstrations Apple has pioneered
the single company keynote sir before
Apple started doing this you would see
phones after phones after phones get
announced at things like CES or Mobile
World Congress now companies want the
spotlight for themselves they sort of
follow that Apple model of one company
one keynote one or multiple
products announced inside of it and
there's a lot of wonder that you see
inside of these keynotes and the hype is
is crazy I'd like to let Macintosh speak
for itself
hello Americans are the true it's great
to get out of that bad if you look back
at this or the heyday of Apple the Steve
Jobs keynotes when sort of these new
products were announced you know you've
got sort of big lines that stick out and
big actions the MacBook Air being pulled
out of a manila envelope the iPod a
thousand songs in your pocket
these are memorable events in the tech
space and memorable events that really
changed technology and sort of pushed
other companies sort of reevaluate what
they were doing I mean I would imagine
you could write a psychology thesis on
Apple's keynotes and the brainwashing
you could say that Apple goes through
with these and as you see a presenter
worked through an iPhone the mind tends
to go too well that could be my phone
you know that could be me doing that and
you can interpret this as sort of rabid
fanboy ism but if you look at it
objectively from a psychological
standpoint what they're doing does make
sense if their end goal is to get people
to buy their products I mean so Apple's
sort of single company event sort of
changed keynotes how with this you never
would have had a Samsung unpacked if you
didn't have Apple keynotes
with Apple being Apple I think sometimes
they get caught up in their own hype and
it is kind of funny to watch when that
backfires recently when they announced
that thousand dollars stand they very
easily could have spun that differently
and not announced to stand for a
thousand dollars but say hey we have a
monitor and if you would like a stand we
have the option to add one on I've been
done with it
but they thought people are gonna be
super excited that the sand could be
turned their orientation could be
changed and it backfire you could hear
the audible groan as much fun as I like
to have watching Apple keynotes it's
also really funny to see them kind of
brought back down
it's earth when these big faux pas
happen and inevitably you know they
happen you know every couple years
because people don't just want to buy
personal computers anymore they want to
know what they can do with them and
we're gonna show people exactly that
Apple's retail strategy now is so
ingrained with the company but if you
look back when the Apple stores first
opened it seems stupid ridiculous
there's a video actually of Steve Jobs
giving a tour of that very first Apple
store at Tysons Corner you know
traditional electronic stores was like
the best buy and racks and racks of
stuff some were sort of behind gates you
couldn't always hold everything the idea
here was that you could experience the
products you could see them you can hold
them you weren't gonna be coming up
trying to sort of I asked you to buy
stuff there was no aggressive Commission
that sort of sales associates were going
to be given it was more experiential
with the hope that either you buy
something in store or you go home and
buy it Apple really didn't care they
just wanted you to see their products
and now that makes total sense and a big
special thank you to our urban spectrum
apple store for dealing with my mom
we've gone in like a lot of time
questions on her stuff so shout out to
you for troubleshooting that so I didn't
have to make you seem like a bad son but
I appreciate it and there are a lot of
moms out there grandparents and fathers
and kids who've gone to the Apple Store
to learn how to use their products but
also at least it used to be the Genius
Bar a physical Genius Bar where you
could take your product hand it to
somebody and they could fix it for you
on the spot or you could come back and
pick it up or something that was really
nice you know you wouldn't have the
Samsung experience the Google pop-ups I
don't even have these sort of standalone
Amazon stores if it wasn't for what
Apple did and I think for consumers
again it come back to support it changed
they expect a level of support for their
products your Galaxy S 10 breaks Jin's
are you don't want
you send that back to to Korea to
wherever that has to go to get fixed
wait for it be without a phone and then
get the phone back you want to walk into
a location hand them your phone and
leave with that problem fixed and for
the most part that's where Apple has
been really successful and that change
the expectations of support for the
consumer hello I'm a Mac hold up here I
come Oh PC yeah it's all this trial
software they pack my hard drive full of
it all these programs that don't do very
much unless you buy the whole thing so
no matter how good a product is I mean
today if you can't market that product
chances are you're not going to be able
to sell it that well and Apple's
marketing has been really good I mean
those Mac versus PC commercials were
amazing at the time and they've created
a perception of what a Mac user was and
what a PC user was there's been some
times I wish that Apple would come out
swinging in marketing or very least
block some of the punches that are
thrown you know their direction Samsung
has done an amazing job countering
Apple's marketing you know companies
have been survey hitting Apple I would
love to see Apple hit back and perhaps
or taking the stand of like we're better
than that
but still they could answer those
complaints I would personally love to
see an aggressive Apple ad campaign
they're kind of like Tesla in the way
that their users have become marketers
for the product you become evangelists
for the company iPhone even attend to
one other people to use the iPhone for
better or worse than you saw that with
Tesla - they don't run any marketing
you're out guys didn't get their users
are out there offering test drives and
evangelizing for the company and it's
rare that you see people really give two
craps about what phone somebody's using
but iPhone users tend to be vocal and
passionate bunch as Apple tends to go
and I mentioned this throughout the
video it's a theme other companies tend
to go to and that's not always great
there tends to be sort of replication of
really kind of
the crappy moves that Apple makes too
and some of those movies tend to almost
feel punitive to the customer so things
like removal of the headphone jack
notches airpot so this was the
prevalence now of wireless headphones
you could see as Apple goes industry
goes as well and if you think about
trends that have changed the space
aren't that many that started with other
companies I tend to start with apple and
percolate out again all of it's kind of
blowing hot air at apples direction
could be interpreted as rabid fanboy ism
but psychologically and from a business
standpoint it's really interesting to
look at success that Apple has had such
a success considering some of the
products have not been the best in
market and still are not the best in
market but people still go to buy them
so there's a lot to learn for other
companies from what Apple is done
successfully I think Samsung is
realizing that and you're seeing it the
Samsung experiences you're seeing it
with Samsung unpacked these big events
where they control the message is
something that I think has been learned
from Apple but a lot of companies are
taking it one step further where Apple
tends to generally ignore CES you see
companies that are sort of bringing
their products to the masses well you
can experience it and see them hold them
in your hands and get a sense of what
these products can do a lot of that came
from Apple and whether or not the Apple
retail experience never happened if we
get there eventually I can't answer but
anywhere you look in the electronics
world you'll see apples influence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
