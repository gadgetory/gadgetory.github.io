lenovo facebook unveils paper Nintendo's
board takes a pay cut Microsoft's new
Xbox one promotion and why your cell
phone might be giving you a hangover in
the morning it's Buffalo bullets in time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap stories
from our site technobuffalo calm every
tuesday and friday if you're interested
in reading more about any story on the
show check the description below for
links or click on the graphics if you
have annotations available and toggled
on i'm ashley sceva here your top
stories if anyone thought it was going
to be a slow news week well think again
late yesterday afternoon google
announced they'd reached an agreement to
sell motorola mobility to lenovo the
sale price a bargain at 2.9 1 billion
dollars that's 9.5 billion less than the
price google purchased motorola for in
2011 they didn't lose that full nine and
a half billion though since Google
actually will keep many valuable patents
and also sold Motorola set-top box
business to eros a while back you'll
still be able to buy moto phones for now
but time will tell if this was a wise
move for every company involved Facebook
back in the news this week officially
unveiling paper a new app from their
creative labs at first glance it looks
to be a competitor software like
footboard blinkfeed and samsung's new
magazine s UX the app is very immediate
heavy and at the moment doesn't feature
any ads which is super nice but probably
won't last very long Facebook hopes that
paper will give users a new way to share
will keep them on the aging platform
paper is only available right now on iOS
but we will likely see an android
version very very soon over in gaming
Nintendo again in the news after
slashing wii u sales forecast by seventy
percent president Satoru Iwata announced
a fifty percent pay cut for the next
five months to quote atone for the
downturn end quote of the Wii U in
addition Nintendo's board will also see
their salaries cut from twenty to thirty
percent for that same five month period
we'll also see if there are newly
announced marketing app for mobile major
first party titles launching this year
or DS games on the wii u virtual console
will make
any difference in their profits but
right now it's just plain tough for
Nintendo's newest console also in gaming
Microsoft offering a new deal hoping to
convert ps3 owners into Xbox one owners
this morning Microsoft passed around a
new ad campaign image highlighting a
trade and offer offering one hundred
dollars in microsoft store credit
towards an Xbox one if you bring a
PlayStation 3 in for recycling actually
it's not just the PlayStation 3 the fine
print also includes the Xbox 360s or
xbox 360 e if you got a last gen console
just kind of laying around it's an
option although I guess I would argue if
your console is working and you have a
few good games you can probably get more
bang for your buck by selling it
yourself and our wild card story for
today comes from a michigan state
university report finding smartphone
owners who use their device for work
before going to bed wake up in the
morning with a kind of hangover surveys
went out across a variety of occupations
and anyone on their phone cramming and
work after 9pm were notably more tired
and less productive the next day
compared to unplugged workers we already
know the blue light from phones
interferes with our melatonin levels
which promotes sleep so maybe shut down
your phone a little earlier at night if
you've been feeling extra groggy in the
morning that is the Buffalo bulletin for
today if you enjoyed the show a thumbs
up would be super awesome of you and if
