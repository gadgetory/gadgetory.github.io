really popular LG v10 and if the note
seven debacle didn't happen it would
have been a ton interest in this phone
anyway but now that the note 7 has gone
up in flames so to speak there's renewed
interest in what LG has with the V 20 so
I want to do an is and isn't this is
going to be the ease of it l you all the
great things about to be 20 if you want
the flip side of the coin hit the link
up above and check out the LG V 20 isn't
so first of all the LG v 20 is a
flagship LG has two flagship lines they
have their G line the g5 with the
modular design and now the V line with
the dual screen is a flagship in every
sense of the word it is an incredibly
looking fo most incredible feeling phone
and overall the phone screams premium
and the hardware inside and reflects
that for the kind of person who likes an
extra battery like to carry one in your
bag for peace of mind with a lot of
traveling the LG v 20 is going to be the
phone for you not only does it have a
really beastly 30 to 20 milliamp hour
battery you can also pop it out and put
in another one something that we don't
see that often anymore in flagship
phones if you aren't movable battery the
LG be 20 is definitely going to be your
best option
aside from that if you want expandable
storage it is here as well via micro sd
I always say flagship should take at
least one two three or four of the boxes
I expect from flagship phones it should
have wireless charging it should be
water-resistant neither of which the V
20 has the LG v 20 is also really nice
to look at the screen is absolutely
beautiful one of the most impressive
things about the phone and my almost
weekend half of testing it this is their
18 t unit but we've had it unlock
international unit for quite a while it
works really well in outdoors sound
lights okay I don't see all that often
with phones if you're constantly
outdoors you're going to want to look at
the V 20 I don't think this screen is
quite the same quality the Super AMOLED
panels that we have on the Samsung
devices but it's on par with what we see
from Google and HTC with the pixel line
of phone so it's definitely among the
best displays out there but not the only
display on this phone it's got a cool
feature it's a 2.5 inch screen on top of
the screen it's got dual displays and
that sounds kind of novel but the more
you use it the more you can appreciate
it
its first of all it's always on displays
you can always see the time there but
you're downloading applications you can
see the status layer you can put app
shortcuts up there you can customize
that can display and do almost
anything you want and it's really
helpful to have no way does it save
screen real estate on your main display
but also it's another way to launch
applications now the only downside
though a 5.7 inch screen they've pretty
big hands it's tough to reach your
finger all way up to the top to tap
those applications but at that point
you're really just nitpicking well they
use it or don't use it it's nice to have
and certainly just to see the time it
adds a lot of value I think to the b20
so keeping with the theme of this phone
having to things like the displays it
also has two cameras on the back as
seems to be the trend one is a 16
megapixel sensor with steady record oh
is and it does do a really nice job
setting a very shaky hand if you're
running or my case chasing a toddler and
the other sensor is a crazy why 8
megapixel 135 degree wide angle lens so
you can capture pretty much everybody in
there and these sensors are working they
work to create really good pictures the
pictures came out really nice especially
in low-light which was nice to see in
normal light or highlight the picture
gonna look great I could be very
confident using this probably my only
camera only anybody I'd be able to tell
the difference one of the complaints
that I get in our phone reviews I don't
talk that much about audio music cuz
it's not that much to talk about the b20
is for audio files this thing has 32-bit
- quad DAC audio sounds really good
coming out it's not necessarily not
necessarily the speakers which do sound
loud but a slight bit tinny we plugged
in a good pair of headphones the audio
is going to sound incredible one of the
better Audax beings I do experiences
that I've had
I say plug in headphones and also
headphone jack on the bottom I think one
of the best things in b20 has going for
is right out of the box no software
update needed you're getting Android 7.0
mingotts you're getting all the great
things that come with that in a phone
that's not made directly from Google
it's not a nexus or a pixel phone really
nice to see LG get this out of the door
it's not that they rushed it a software
experience it's been fluid it works well
I'll talk a lot about the skin and LG is
UX 5.0 in the isn't video but it does
work and I haven't had any crashes
there's no stability issues so that
should hopefully put your mind at ease
so that's what the V 20 is it's a
beautiful display it's got great cameras
that display is a really novel feature
to actually add some utility removable
battery expandable storage all those
things make the v20 an awesome phone but
not everything is coming up roses for
the LG v 20
want to see the flip side of this know
what's the LGV 20 isn't at the link up
above and check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
