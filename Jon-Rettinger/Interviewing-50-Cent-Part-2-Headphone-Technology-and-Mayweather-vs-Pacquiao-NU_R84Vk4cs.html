audience we have tech audience oh I'm
sure there's a lot of potential SMS
customers out there right they want to
know there's the headphone market is a
very competitive market right what edge
does SMS have and how would you oh man
I've all over like a monster or my eats
or bows or some I think the edges being
willing to implement new technologies
and ideas fast and you know when you got
beats with Apple it gets difficult to
kind of beat them but you know I figure
out ways so I partner with intel to
create bio sports headsets it's a wired
in here that allows you to just two
record your heart rate ok real time and
and you're able to your page that you
ran the distance and how many calories
you burn with no additional battery
source and just it allows the technology
allows you to power it to the jack very
cool no so it's cool i know that
question because I'm always constantly
talking to people about it like I know
the question is why by SMS audio of
everything else you gotta keep things
that everyone else doesn't actually have
at the present moment right trying to
find your niche market yeah awesome okay
cool um very informative I have one last
question for you and it is not headphone
related there may be a potential fight
coming up as a boxing fan my other
Pacquio I got to know and she's not
gonna test night it happened you don't
think gonna happen it's not gonna have
you want it to happen let me say don't
film it's not gonna happen to look this
is the things that that that you have to
do what you want to fight back man for
under no circumstances when you could
pick anybody you want to because we want
to see see the toughest fight possible
boxing history as we want we do you're
doing and I would run that but you know
what it don't happen if they don't have
to like when you just look at the sport
itself I think later even if people
resent fluent for not for making
safer decisions right then boxing would
usually allow you to write I think later
and when they look at the the window his
actual record and look at what he's done
they still gonna have to look and say
who do you think could have beat him if
it would have happened this way like you
know like you know like imaginary games
like what what would it be like Kobe
joico be and we're all at one time so
you know would be better right and it'll
be one of those conversations but you
know I think um I think I think people
won the toughest fight possible you know
I mean like to come out I do it support
to see that other than that I naina is
dropping those dropping infusion well we
talked a lot about tech and a lot not
about tithing so thank you guys so much
