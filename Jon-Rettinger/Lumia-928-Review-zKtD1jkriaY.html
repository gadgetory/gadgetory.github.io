are checking out the official this is it
the official review for the Nokia Lumia
928 so here it is the Nokia or Nakia
depending on where you live in the world
928 this is the Verizon variant of the
Lumia 920 let's talk with the hardware
first this is a pretty long review that
I have posted so I'll try to get through
this quickly you can see the edges have
been kind of cropped off they're a
little bit sharper than the 920 s which
were a lot more rounded it's still a
little bit curved on the bottom you can
see there's sort of a a curve there
which is nice but generally speaking
still feels good in the hand it's not
it's not any more difficult to hold than
the 920 is which is a nice thing but it
does deviate a little bit from Nokia's
design standard that we're used to
seeing so the other thing is we have the
white polycarbonate body here but
unfortunately for you Verizon users you
will not be seeing this in any of the
colorful variants like the cyan or red
anything like that it only comes in
black and white on Verizon so
unfortunately for you guys if you are
looking to add a little style to your
Lumia 928 you are a little bit out of
luck you'll notice they now have a xenon
flash here there is not just a dual LED
flash it is a xenon very powerful very
cool they've also moved the speaker to
the bottom here it used to be on on the
bottom of the device on the 920 they've
now moved it to the back of the device
and it's kind of nice because there's a
little curve right here so when you put
the phone down on a table face up it
doesn't sit flush so when you get a call
and want to put it on speaker you don't
actually have to worry about it sounding
muffled it's it's a really nice feature
and I think it's a really good idea the
buttons on the side have been rounded
quite a bit they're really subtle and I
still kind of find myself missing the
power button to wake it from its sleep I
know that that's a little bit weird but
the tactile response is not quite
as I guess prominent as I would like it
to be and my very last thing about the
928 that I just can't stand and this is
a personal preference for people is that
this microUSB cable is on the top of the
device now I am I guess a phone purist
and I like to have my micro USB plug on
the bottom because when you're sitting
at your desk and you have it plugged in
it's plugged in upside down which is
really frustrating and kind of annoying
so unless you have a permanent cable
coming up from the back of your desk
this that might annoy you just like it
annoyed me so I'm not a fan of that but
let's turn it on let's check it out
we have Verizon red as our theme of
course because it is a Verizon device
which is super awesome for Verizon users
who were hoping to get a flagship
Windows Phone 8 device so the specs on
this phone are actually pretty good
they're almost identical to the 920 so
it has a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor 1 gig of ram and 8.7 megapixel
rear camera a four and a half inch
screen and a two thousand milliamp
battery the screen however has been
replaced instead of an IPS LCD there is
now an AMOLED screen and it is
absolutely gorgeous I love it there's
almost no separation when you are
looking at the phone at an angle the
viewing angles are very very good I
don't know why you would be you know
using your phone at 178 degrees but
generally speaking it is a very nice
phone to look at I am a big fan of it
and you would be too if you saw it in
person I mean it's just absolutely
gorgeous as for the software there's not
much here that's a lot different than
Windows Phone 8 on the 920 but there is
of course your standard Verizon apps
that are available here is VZ Navigator
the cool thing about Verizon's kind of
bloatware on windows 8 devices or
Windows Phone 8 devices is that you
could actually uninstall them so if you
are not a fan of easy navigator you can
uninstall that which is super nice and
definitely something that I
really enjoy as a detail because often
times I don't need things like NFL
mobile and you might which is great but
it's not for me
you also have Nokia suite of apps you
have here city lens here maps and they
also have Nokia drive plus beta which is
very very good it's a great substitute
for Google Maps of course Google Maps
always the number one if I had to choose
but this will definitely do a good job
if you need to get somewhere and of
course in Windows Phone eight we now
have resizable live tiles and you can
actually make them three different sizes
so if we want to make them very small we
can do that we can go the width of the
screen and we can also go back to the
square sort of medium sized tile which
is cool I always love the Xbox
integration it's great I still smile
every time I see my little tiny Xbox
avatar on there and of course being able
to have live tiles is just it's really
fancy and I think that a lot of people
it's John and I have talked about
Windows Phone 8 as being the greatest OS
that most people aren't using and so I
definitely think that that carries
through to the Lumia 928 as for
performance it definitely doesn't give
us much lag i mean the the response is
very very good i am a big fan of the
gaming on this I have jetpack joyride
which is super awesome so I'm going to
to play that I'm going to turn it down
just a little bit but we are going to
play let's play some jetpack joyride
shall we so you can see it's a it's
really responsive obviously this is not
the most graphics intensive game but
they do have nova 3 and other games and
also the halo game spartan assault will
be out next month so i'm really curious
to see how that performs on a device
like the Lumia 928 I now have my hog
very exciting I'm gonna jump and run
over scientists and shoot them and pick
up coins and do all the things and I'm
really good at jetpack joyride so I'm
not gonna keep playing I'm just gonna
die on purpose let's go back to our home
screen but hopefully halo Spartan
assault the exclusivity for Windows 8
Windows Phone 8 will bring more people
to the platform because I definitely
think that is a thing that Microsoft
could absolutely leverage in bringing
more people to the platform the camera
is really really good I mean obviously
PureView is the technology that they use
and again just like the Lumia 920 it's
very good in low light I have some
pictures of Luci I've got some video
here it shoots in 1080 or 720 you can
actually pick that natively which is
something that not a lot of apps do I
know - for example the iPhone 5 you have
to use a third-party app for that so it
is nice to have that option available
this is one of my robots now I'm gonna
show you something that the flash does
which is a little bit strange now you
would expect with a xenon flash that you
would have a better image in the dark
now I shot this underneath my desk and
there was no light this is without flash
now if I go to the image with flash you
can see it's really bright and it almost
over corrects and over saturates an
image with the flash and I'm not sure if
that's a white balancing issue it does
seem to kind of be a combination of a
strange white balancing that's happening
when you use the xenon flash in a low
light situation and also an
oversaturation issue
now hopefully Nokia will put out some
sort of software update for the 928 to
sort of correct this because it is a
little bit obnoxious in terms of
software so you can see again this is
without flash and then we have this
really kind of oversaturated color
that's happening with the desk so it's a
little bit more true to color if you're
if you're looking at it without flash
again this is with flash and without so
you can definitely see there are some
big differences in the color saturation
for each picture so I'm not sure what's
happening there but generally speaking
it does take very nice pictures I do
love the way that it takes low-light
pictures it's fantastic another thing
that they offer is you can actually go
into your apps you have photo apps so we
have creative studio available to us
where you're able to pick some different
filters just like you would in an
Instagram app or the like and you can
also do other things to your photos so
if you
wanted to if you wanted to edit it you
could actually do shift tilting you can
do focus one object where you pick the
actual outline you can do a color pop
you can do a collage there's adjustments
standard adjustments and also fixing so
cropping and rotating and redeye so it's
a very nice feature set that's available
to you the other thing that I really
like about the camera is that while
you're taking pictures is that while
you're taking pictures you can actually
go into your photo and video settings
and and choose a few different things
you can actually choose continuous focus
on or off which is really helpful as
opposed to the iPhone where you have to
sort of double tap with your fingers and
sort of manipulate the camera app a
little bit more than you would normally
have to which is a little bit silly
so our photo settings we can also pick
scenes you can pick different scenes but
a very good job by Nokia in their camera
app I definitely think that they are at
the front if not the leader of the pack
in terms of native and default photo
apps but overall like I said the Nokia
nine to the Lumia 928 camera is really
really good and anybody with a
smartphone a flagship smartphone would
find that this definitely is up there
with the iPhone 5s and the HTC ones of
the world as for a call quality and data
data transfer the call quality on the
phone is really clear when you make a
phone call it sounds really good I'm
sure it doesn't hurt that I am on
Verizon's LTE network which is extremely
fast when we were using this and we did
our speed test you can see we had these
are our speeds that were happening
earlier today after it locates my
closest server let's go see where our
results were so you can see here on the
19th we had 15 down and 10 up which is
really respectable super fast and I am a
huge fan of Verizon's LTE network it's
extremely broad there's a lot of
coverage out there which is great so if
you're looking at that coverage speed
and you haven't upgraded to an LTE
device now you know what you're going to
get if you are in an area
LTE coverage and we have about four bars
of LTE here at any given time we can see
now right now we have two because we're
in the conference room but generally
speaking we have about four now as for
your battery life it has a two thousand
milliamp battery which compared to other
phones of its size might not seem like a
lot but because of the optimization in
Windows Phone eight you're gonna get a
really full day's worth out of your
battery life so you don't have to worry
about using this phone and having it die
in the middle of your day however I will
note that if you are a very heavy media
user you will actually have issues with
battery life around six hours so if you
are let's say at Disneyland let's say
maybe you have spotty coverage this is
definitely a phone that will get you
through a lot of the day when compared
to something like an Android device with
the same battery capacity but generally
speaking if you are a heavy media user
as always you're gonna have a lot
shorter battery life just keep that in
mind but that is pretty much the Nokia
Lumia 928 it's very similar to the Lumia
920 in some ways but then in other ways
it's a little bit different and it's
honestly really really exciting for
Verizon users this phone is only $49 on
contract right now which is pretty much
an insane deal so if you're interested
at all in Windows Phone 8 I highly
suggest that you get yourself down to
your verizon brick-and-mortar
and you test this phone out because it
is honestly a great device and I really
enjoyed using it I loved it thought it
was fantastic this is office you can see
we've got some really great apps if you
are a Windows user you will find
yourself right at home in Windows Phone
8 and you will really like the way their
apps are design their native apps are
beautiful however if you are mired in
the iOS or Apple ecosystem you will have
a very difficult time with this phone
the same goes for Google you can still
set up everything through CalDAV however
and in car dev but the problem is is
that you you aren't getting those native
apps from Google so you won't be seeing
Google Maps on here unless you use it
through the browser and we all know it's
not as good of an experience so overall
I think obviously Windows
is still experiencing some growing pains
some very serious growing pains however
I think that being said this is a great
device it's very solid it is very quick
its responsive and I think anybody who
is a Windows fan or a Microsoft fan
would be happy to use this on the
Verizon LTE network I really enjoyed it
there is a lack of apps for certain
things but on that same note there are
things like instance where you can use
that to substitute for Instagram so
there are third-party apps that will
help you out and help fill those gaps so
we're gonna go to TechnoBuffalo so we
can show you how how it renders we'll
use Bing we're gonna Bing it that's our
new favorite search term so here's our
beautiful web results and you can see
we're on Wi-Fi right now I'm not on
Verizon LTE but you can see everything
renders quite nicely it's not terrible
at all and that is the Lumia 928 so we
will see you for the next review and
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
