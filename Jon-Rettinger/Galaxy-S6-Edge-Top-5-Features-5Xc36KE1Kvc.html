from TechnoBuffalo and Samsung's
unpacked event last week showcased two
new devices the Galaxy Note 5 and the
curvaceous galaxy s6 edge+ now we
already talked about some cool note 5
features so we thought we'd give the new
s6 edge+ the same treatment first one is
the beautiful design samsung has been on
a winning streak recently when it comes
to designing gorgeous new devices and
the galaxy s6 edge+ is no exception
it features an awesome all-metal design
that not only feels great but looks even
better the big difference between the
regular s6 edge and the s6 edge+ is that
bigger display it's now at 5.7 inches
though it still features the same curved
AMOLED display we all know and love the
mix of sloping curves and sharp edges
makes for one stunning device it's crazy
to think how far Samsung has progressed
with its Hardware design in less than a
year the galaxy s6 edge+ is easily one
of the best-looking devices around right
now number two are the new edge
capabilities now Samsung has already
come up with some pretty clever ideas
for that extra bit of curved screen
space but the s6 edge+ takes the concept
of stuff further with the s6 edge+ you
can pin a specific app to the edge of
the device
then jump back and forth between your
favorite apps with just a quick swipe
and tap of course you can still do
everything with the edge display that
you could do on a regular s6 edge that
includes Samsung's clever bedside mode
and news ticker Twitter updates and easy
access to your favorite contacts number
three is a faster wireless charging now
to be fair this isn't exactly a new
feature Samsung included wireless
charging with the regular galaxy s6 and
galaxy s6 edge still were pretty
thrilled that support for both Qi and
PMA standards is sticking around
Samsung also talked about faster
wireless charging with the galaxy s6
edge+ and note 5 which gives you more
juice in less time number 4 is live
streaming to YouTube the name pretty
much says it all Samsung has come up
with an extremely clever take on the new
live streaming craze just open up the
camera app choose live stream to YouTube
and you'll now be able to live stream
straight to YouTube with just a tap of a
button that means all of your friends
and followers can follow along without
downloading some weird new app it also
makes it easy to embed and share your
stream across the internet it's a smart
move from Samsung considering the
growing popularity of services like
periscope and meerkat maybe we'll start
seeing more in
more people live streaming on YouTube
more often than not number five is
better performance now inside the galaxy
s6 edge+ is samsung's latest octa-core
exynos 7420 processor and it also
features four gigabytes of RAM which is
insane but should keep the device
running smooth also pairing that with a
very minimalistic version of TouchWiz
you can expect nothing but a great
performing smartphone so far we haven't
experienced any issues but we'll see how
it holds up in the long run we're still
putting this guy through its paces so if
there's anything in particular you guys
want to test or anything that you'd like
to know about that six edge plus let us
know in the comments down below
and if you guys enjoyed this video make
sure to give it a thumbs up and we will
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
