with TechnoBuffalo the HTC One m8 is
here and with it we also have the new
HTC dot view case for the One m8 let's
want to walk you through one of the
first accessories for the device so you
can see on the back it's going to launch
in this blackish color kind of a gray
we'll go over that in a bit orange green
a maroon and a blue and what this does
is it's a dot-matrix device and it'll
let you see alerts without having to
turn on your phone so let's unbox it
real quick and then I'll show you a
demonstration of how it works it's a
peel it out of the box here got the doc
view case itself you can see it covers
both sides and then I get started guide
I'll show you how it works now basically
it's used for basic notifications so
you'll be able to handle phone call so
you can swipe up or down but we're told
is going to require sort of a bit of a
push but also you can see alarms
messages the time temperature incoming
messages that have hit you so email and
both text messages and missed phone
calls and stuff like that in on the
weather as you can see there so let's
just show you how it fits on the phone
here's the device itself just open it up
and clips right in so real steady and
then right here do we have any
notification a degree Xand it's cloudy
outside and then the time here in New
York City you can see still get the
whole there for the camera so you can
take a front picture or a front-facing
video and it looks like on this video
you can see the sensors actually turning
purple but in real life I can't see that
that's funny on the back not a nice
smooth cover of course you're kind of
covering that awesome aluminum design
but that's okay you're protecting it too
and you've got access to both cameras
here this is the one for depth
information so if you want to do the
after blurring and then you've got of
course the ultrapixel camera and then
the dual LED flash there so let's just
I'll grab another phone and place some
phone calls and text messages and we'll
show you how it works all right now
let's just take a quick look
how it works now I'm gonna just hold the
phone up here so I can block my own
personal number from showing up because
what you don't find is that the number
pops up here but we'll give it a quick
call and we'll show you what the
notification looks like all right so
we've got this incoming call and like I
said the numbers showing up top but I'm
kind of hiding a little bit well I'll
show you part of it and then we can
choose to answer it just by swiping up
like that and then it shows you the
length of the phone call as its ongoing
and you can of course hang up by swiping
down so let's just do I'll show you real
quick text message and some other things
like actually here by adjust the volume
actually during a call if I adjust the
volume it shows those controls let's
hear i'll send a text message to myself
real quick now i don't think it's going
to show the contents of the message but
it should say hey you've got a new one
sounded like it came through right so
let's see if maybe it just doesn't pop
up until there we go okay so it doesn't
just pop up on its own but it shows you
right here hey you've got a text message
you you might want to open your phone
when in case that's a quick look here at
the HTC dot view cover from HTC it's
available now for 4999 just this color
right now it's great but other colors
will be available soon and a pretty
unique seems like it's going to be
protective too nice rubbery feel and we
like that it saves a energy right there
