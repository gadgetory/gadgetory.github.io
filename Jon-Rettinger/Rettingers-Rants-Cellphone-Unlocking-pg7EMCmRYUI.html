to you by netflix welcome back to the
episode of rettinger schrantz I'm your
host Jon wrenchers to show a rant and
rave on anything for all the technology
and sometimes outside of it up this week
I want to talk about cell phone
unlocking it's been causing quite the
kerfuffle in the news recently I want to
talk about what's legal what's not legal
to find a lot of things that hopefully
help answer all the questions you've got
with cell phone unlocking so first let
me define what cell phone unlucky is in
case you're not familiar with the term
and all this stuff is the context of
here in the US you buy a phone from a
carrier and it comes locked to that
carrier meeting you can't take that
phone you bought from AT&amp;amp;T go to tmobile
pop at a tmobile sim card have it work
right out of the box so an unlocking
essentially means it gives you the
ability to take your phone from one
carrier to another traditionally you've
been able to get an unlock code or a
phone you bought from a carrier meeting
you pop in another carrier sim card you
enter a four or five digit code into the
phone and boom your phone is unlocked
you take it to another carrier you take
out of the country pop in a sim card and
presumably be able to use it just like
you would on your own carrier seems
pretty simple right carriers were
unlocking phones if you ask them after
two-year contract was up sometimes they
would do it a little bit earlier and it
wasn't that big a deal you could buy
phones unlocked from third parties and
take them to any carrier that you wanted
to use but now unlocking phones is kind
of a legal and it seems like everyone
the country is throwing up their
collective hands in a WTF so what are
your rights as a consumer laws of this
January it was a crime to unlock your
phone let me say it again it was a crime
to unlock your phone even after your
contract ends without the consent of the
wireless provider you could still buy an
unlocked phone from the carrier a third
party vendor you have to pay the full
retail price for its you're not gonna
get a subsidy it's number two don't
carriers already unlock your phone the
answer is yeah when you complete a
two-year contract most mobile carriers
will agree to unlock your phone so you
can switch to another carrier if you
want and travel abroad the catch is
though there aren't legally required to
do so so you can call them beg pretty
pretty please what they do not have to
do that for you which is quite
unfortunate based on public statements
by the White House they
you too want to lift the unlocking man
for consumers only after finishing a
contract period so if the goal is that
people unlock the phones at any moment
at any time then yeah you can probably
expect to see mobile carriers raise the
price of all their handsets even if you
would agree to a two-year deal so what
happened here and what we do spell to
call asked unlock your phone really
anytime you could pay to get an unlock
code through a ton of websites and
services you could pay ten twelve twenty
thirty bucks get an unlock code for your
phone even during your contract and be
good to go a lot of folks were thinking
that this is a presidential decree
actually the White House agrees with us
that you should be able to unlock your
phone there's a petition to actually
make phone unlocking legal again it's
made its way to the White House and
appears the president pretty much agrees
with us on the White House website
official response the administration
says and I quote they stand with the
114,000 of you who believe consumers
about unlock their cell phone without
risking criminal or other penalties
bricking criminal penalties for
unlocking your phone assuming you've
paid for the contract you've gone
through the full to you shield unlock it
anytime you want without any worry like
we have Congress who we owe the pleasure
for this kerfuffle earlier this week
mentioned that they are only authorized
to establish or eliminate exceptions
based on a request submitted to
librarian of Congress they eliminate
this exception from the original digital
millennium copyright act based on the
request so the Library of Congress say
that they are bound to these protocols
which appears to be asking for more
definitive legislation action on a part
of Congress to pass laws stating one way
or another which is a huge mouthful the
Obama administration agrees that
legislative action should take place
along with the FCC and carrier
involvement the FCC under julius
genachowski announced that they are
going to urge Congress to overturn the
ruling last year by the copyright office
of the library of congress that made it
illegal for tumors to unlock their cell
phones opening the software that
restricts most phones from working on
another carrier's network so that's a
huge mouthful essentially the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act screwed for all
of us here in my opinion if you own a
phone you paid for this up to be on the
contract you should be able to unlock it
when you buy a phone for discounted
price from a carrier they are
essentially taking a loss on that
they'll make up to the two year duration
your contract so I understand not
unlocking it mid contract now the
exception that I take
bit of umbrage with if you want to
terminate your contract early you can
pay an early termination fee essentially
repay that subsidy and should be able to
unlock your phone at any time I also
think that if you buy a phone from a
carrier and you agreed to pay the terms
that contract throughout the total two
years of it you should also be able to
unlock it if I bought a new phone from
AT&amp;amp;T next month I unlocked it and i
moved to t-mobile for example I would
still be paying that money to eighteen t
at all so we pay a contract with
t-mobile's everybody wins this is
mind-boggling it makes no sense I know I
just got all kind of legal and mumbo
jumbo on you but essentially it got
written in from the Library of Congress
that this is a new thing and I can't
really take it out overly easily
hopefully we're looking at either
presidential decree or some sort of
legislative action it's going to remove
that line from the law that was enacted
in January at least I'm hoping so so we
