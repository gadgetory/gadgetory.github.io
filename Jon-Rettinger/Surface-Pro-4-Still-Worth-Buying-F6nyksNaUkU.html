surface to do things that exist I'm
getting a ton of questions about this
guy the surface pro 4 that didn't get
any update attention from Microsoft so
is the surface pro 4 like I'm like mr.
Rogers leaning forward come on in
neighbor in the surface pro 4 still
worthwhile well too long didn't watch
inches yes absolutely still worthwhile
in fact this what I've been using at
home as pretty much my only computer for
the better part of three months and
always liked surface pro floor you can
go back and watch our review and our
nine months later follow-up that we did
to product it's only gotten better and
it's gotten better while the price has
gotten less other huge discounts going
on now for the surface book the last gen
and the surface pro 4 you try to know
the Apple laptop and get discounts mic
job taking up 250 bucks off the price
just for walking in the store you're
getting a still really full-featured
computer you can opt it up with an i7
and it's been really fast for me now
admittedly I haven't done any gaming on
here at Keo place in StarCraft but
nothing really GPU intensive you're
still getting a 6 Gen Intel Core Series
chips which is the same series of chips
that the surface book has the updated
one and the studio has well you're not
getting a loss there you get up to 16
gigs of ram full terabyte of storage
it's a really full-featured computer now
the caveats if you need to do 3d
rendering do some hardcore gaming then
definitely don't do this but if you're
looking to do word processing sit back
relax watch some YouTube videos
watch movies you need to take notes in
class general computing stuff this has a
lot of horsepower I've had no issues at
all with slowdown oh she's a heat
battery life has only gotten better as
Microsoft pushes new driver updates it's
worked out pretty well on my lap this I
still think that the type cover should
be included but tech cover 4 is really
good there's a bit of a flex and it's
still when high picks it's relatively
thin but first thin as it is really
solid buy few things I still don't like
about I still wish it had USB C but not
to be had you got to remote the charging
port I work similar to Mac they you pull
it out you're not going to take your
computer with you
Microsoft still doesn't fix that I still
really like to hinge I've travel to
computer it's perfect for sitting on a
train
to you on an airplane I just really like
this in fact started cooking with me to
the office using as my computer at work
haven't given Windows 10 shot give it a
shot it's changed a lot Mason's last
time you used it if you haven't in the
surface pro for a shot I think you
should it's one of the better computers
out there it's been it's light and still
pretty powerful but I wish they'd update
some of the i/o here with some USB see
action maybe even HDMI but those are my
my ramblings on the surface pro 4 just
getting a ton of questions on social
media about it so yes it's still
worthwhile still a great biased computer
that I still really enjoy using I think
you guys will too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
