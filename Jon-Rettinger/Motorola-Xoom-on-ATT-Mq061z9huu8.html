technobuffalo here in the past if you
wanted to get your motorola xoom on you
had to pick up a verizon model or a
Wi-Fi only model but what if you're on
another carrier for example AT&amp;amp;T and you
want to take your tablet with you and
you want to have cellular data well you
were up the metaphorical creek without a
tablet cattle our friends at negri
electronics have a solution they sent us
over a motorola xoom with AT&amp;amp;T 3g bands
on board so let's go ahead not slice off
a finger and dig in alright so this guy
is new in the box and it is a bit of a
different box you can see some of the
specs on the back telling about the zoom
we know the zoom we know what it's got
we know it's got the 10.1 inch screen
with 1280 x 800 resolution same device
pretty much that I've done the review on
however what we haven't seen is how it
performs with a gsm network so if you
are in the US on 80 or if you're in
canada on Roger of any other compatible
network with the 850 band you're going
to be able to get yo with 3g on so let's
take a look see we're going to get in
the box maybe they'll be some surprises
maybe it'll be a samsung galaxy tab in
here lift up the box this thing is taped
shut so we will have our tape killer
come on in and kill it tape is dead so
my condolences to the tapes family and
friends it is no longer with us so here
we've got the motorola xoom with my
overhead fan in the reflection it Wow
looks totally different on the back
actually on the verizon model that we
reviewed in the past it was all the same
color black now we're looking at black
and silver button location that was
still in the same spot on the rear at
the front of the device so looks just
identical what's the kelso i powered it
on so push it off to the side for just a
moment motorola xoom got all your zoom
cables and accessories got your thing
this is the sinking cable we've got
a European power cord and then we've got
the charging brick that goes with it
yeah yeah accessories fun time but let's
take a look at the zoom I just threw
that box on the floor because that's how
I roll I hate boxes I know you guys also
really love screen protectors so I'm
going to go ahead and pull it off before
I get screamed at in the comments so
I'll set this guy up I'll come right
back and we'll see how it works with
AT&amp;amp;T alright so we are good to go very
easy to get this guy up and running
there's a sim card located in the upper
left-hand corner same spot on the
verizon model where the LTE sim card
will go go ahead and drop it in this
will work on tmobile as well if you
don't mind just having some edge service
you're going to have to at this point
restart the device if you haven't done
this yet which is very easy going to
want to go into settings go ahead and
open that up here and then tell your no
internet connection you go to about
tablet or wireless networks and device
to check out all your information go to
mobile networks and then you're going to
want to select your mobile operators
going to do a search it will pull up
either AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile select your
network and you're going to be good to
go and normal zoom experience some
interesting things that about this
tablet that's different than the other
zoom models that I've seen this back now
is actually aluminum it's not that same
soft touch sort of rubber material that
we've seen on previous versions it
actually feels really nice and gives it
a higher quality fuel I think holding
the aluminum model if you're considering
the motorola xoom like looking at some
other Android tablets as well it's not
to be interested in bringing a
comparison here very quickly here is the
just released Galaxy Tab 10.1 they both
share those same internals of nvidia
tegra two little ones upside down and go
ahead and keep that back around you can
see there's certainly a pretty decent
size difference here although this one
is going to give you 3g on 18 to your
t-mobile something to keep in mind if
you want to get your 3g zoom on and go
ahead and get zooming these guys are
available now from our friends at negri
electronics links going to be down below
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
