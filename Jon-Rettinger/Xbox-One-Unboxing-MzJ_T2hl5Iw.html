TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing it's
been about eight years in the making
this is Microsoft's latest console the
Xbox one trying to be the one box you
need for everything in your house this
guy's much more than a game console also
includes the brand new Kinect go ahead
open it up take a first look so here is
the big green box for the Xbox one this
includes the console the 500 gig hard
drive it's got a controller connect and
some HDMI cables and headphones in there
around the box you got some stuff what
it can do showing the UI which looks
very Windows 8 ish Windows 8.1 inch
let's go ahead and jump right in I'm
really excited take a look at this this
needs a giant knife for a giant box sent
to us courtesy of our friends at
Microsoft's we're gonna open that up
that one was already cut and we'll see
what we've got inside so go ahead and I
guess put this flat and open it up the
first thing we see is the new Kinect
sitting right there on top all Xbox
models shipped with Kinect effect
there's only one SKU available to go
ahead and pull this out and there is the
new Kinect looking much smaller than
when it first debuted a few years back
so Kinect and speaker right there push
that off to the side you can also see
what the connector looks like for the
Kinect looks like that like a big fat
USB port but it does not need any more
power it gets powered directly from the
console if we peel back that cardboard
we've got a headphone for getting yo
chat on and getting yelled at by all the
12 year olds that are beating you on
Xbox Live nice to see this being
included in the box next we've got the
awesome controller I always loved the
xbox 360's controller
I thought they'd had some of the best
ones out there this one really just
improved on that overall feel the big
battery hump is now gone it's flush with
the back and so they included two
double-a batteries to go in there
everything here has been reworked away
the buttons feel there's now sort of a
rim around both those analog sticks to
help with texture and feel everything
here has been redone
troller feels very very nice in the
hands they'll push that off the side for
a quick second will do full coverage two
of the controller so you can see what it
looks like how it compares to last
generations we've got some literature
Quick Start Guide getting equipped and
some Xbox one stuff and get Xbox Live
Gold I was on the card as well we are
also going to have HDMI cable bundle in
the box it's nice to see the console
manufacturers doing that looks like a
relatively long HDMI cord it gets looks
like it's about you know four or five
feet next we've got a connection cable
looks like that's going to connect to
this power brick and this does come with
a pretty significant power brick not
integrate into the console so you're
gonna have to find room for this guy
push all that off to the side I'm
guessing somewhere underneath here where
we are going to see the main attraction
there it is at the very bottom of the
box the Xbox one console itself will
hold that out push all that styrofoam
off to the side slide the box out let's
take a look at the Xbox one I've never
had a chance actually holding these guys
they had just seen it protectively
shielded behind glass and plastic at
Microsoft stores or various trade shows
and it is a relatively big console but
it's got a nice look to it it's
combination of gloss and texture you've
got a capacitive power button right
there you've got your capacitive eject
button for the blu-ray player and doing
the tour around the side that's where
your USB ports going to be on the back
we've got ports glower
this guy is meant to be hooked up to
your cable box but before we get there
there's power HDMI out TV optical audio
HDMI in two USBs
that's where Tech's going to plug in
I've got I are out and then if you want
to have a wired connection and then a
lock port but of course this also
supports Wi-Fi on the bottom you've got
just a little bit of feet nub so it's
not gonna go sliding around live in a
very quick unboxing of the brand new
Xbox what I'm really excited to put the
console through its paces well a ton of
