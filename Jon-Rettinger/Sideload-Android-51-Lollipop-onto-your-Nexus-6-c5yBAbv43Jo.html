to you by citrix hey what's going on
guys the mark and Sangan from
TechnoBuffalo and today we're going to
install android 5.1 lollipop on the
Nexus 6 if you're getting impatient
waiting for the latest Android update to
show up on your Nexus device and just
can't wait any longer
hopefully this quick how-to video will
help you out now of course this will
work with any supported Nexus device
including the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 9
just download the appropriate file for
your device and you'll be good to go all
the files you need will be down below
that like button so make sure to check
those out also just a heads up the Nexus
5 seems to be experiencing memory
problems so just be aware before
updating to android 5.1 now before we
get started I just wanted to mention
that you'll still be able to receive OTA
updates from Google even if you manually
sideload android 5.1 on your device as
long as you're not rooted or if you
haven't flash anything custom as long as
you're running complete stock android
you should be all set so step one make
sure you've installed the adb drivers
for your Mac or Windows machine just
download the file which you can find in
the video description extract the zip
file and place the Android folder on
your desktop now open up terminal and
type CD space desktop slash Android just
like how you're seeing it on-screen
next up is to install the ADB and
fastboot files so type in your command
prompt or terminal dot forward slash adb
- install - mac sh now of course this
will be different if you're using a
Windows machine now press enter and let
the script run and you should be all set
after a few minutes now if you're using
Windows we have the proper article for
you guys to read over at XDA forums with
the proper steps step 2 is to download
the OTA files and the ADB and fastboot
files extract the adb folder on your
desktop and change the name to next is
just to make things a bit easier move
the OTA update zip file within the nexus
folder and also change the name to
update dot zips you just make things and
make typing easier step three is to make
sure your nexus folders have these three
files inside which you can see in a
video now open up command prompt or
terminal and navigate to that nexus
folder on your desktop type in CD space
desktop slash nexus and you should be
inside that folder now minimize the
terminal window for now and let's move
on to step 4
step four is to make sure you have USB
debugging enabled on your device now to
turn that feature on go to about phone
tap the build number seven times and you
should now get to developer options you
turn USB debugging on step five is to
turn off your device and boot it back up
into fastboot mode hold down the volume
down and power button and once it's in
fastboot mode select recovery and press
the power to confirm step 6
once it reboots into stock Android
recovery you'll be greeted with an
Android logo and an exclamation mark
don't panic and think your device's
break it's not hold down the power
button and volume up button once until
the recovery window pops up scroll up or
down until you see apply update from ADB
and press the power button now plug in
your device and go back to your computer
let me stop the video for just a quick
second and thank our friends over at
Citrix we go through a system of support
you can provide live or unattended
support to any computer or mobile device
sign up today for a 30-day free trial no
contract no credit card needed visit go
to assist calming click to try a free
button now and since everybody loves
free stuff if you buy the annual plan
before March 31st you'll get a Samsung
Galaxy Tab 4 as well so that's step 7 go
back to that terminal window you
minimize in step 3 type in dot forward
slash ADB side load space update dot zip
press enter and you should start seeing
on your terminal window and on your
phone that a scrip is running it'll take
a few to install everything and once
installation is complete select reboot
system now to manually reboot your Nexus
6 and after that it'll take its time to
update its apps and everything inside
Android it'll take about five to ten
minutes max but everything should be all
good so that's pretty much it after it
updates everything you should be all set
and you should have android 5.1
installed on your Nexus device anyway is
