jetlag exhausted and stressed out that
my luggage hadn't arrived to uh hanging
out literally all night so I crawled
home about five a.m. it's got some sleep

tomorrow the bags haven't come yet and
got a sandwich a lovely chat with a bar
Simonian woman who lived in San
Francisco for a little while so we had
some stuff to talk Roger spoke English
and then came down here to the Hilton
because I knew they had Wi-Fi and an
insane amount of money later he was 27
euro for 24 hours of Wi-Fi service which
is uh that's like over 30 bucks about 30
bucks it's crazy but what are you gonna
do Here I am so yeah excited for the
show headed to Samsung's event tonight
Samsung always does crazy events the
production values and their events are
insane and this one promises to be a
trip it sits at a palace an old building
in a park and who knows what it's going
to be like but we're expecting to see
the 10 inch Galaxy Tab and then a
next-generation galaxy s phone as well
tomorrow also at the same time tonight
there will be a sony ericsson press
conference expecting to see the xperia
play which i don't know why they'd
interests named it the playstation phone
well i dunno why its lights
stuff with sony ericsson so but anyway
they should have and there's also a
nokia press conference tonight so I
TechnoBuffalo will be covering all three
of them i will try to get hands-on with
the different devices as quickly as
possible if I don't get it tonight i'll
get it tomorrow at the show it's one out

small plates it's a local cuisines
tradition here in spain and he told me

trying to know it Adams just so you know
check out mobile history review it's an
interesting site you one's got a strong
perspective on things you read this

I'm also doing blogging for the nvidia
blog they sponsored my trip over because
I'm helping them out with their blog a
little bit I'm covering for technical
Buffalo just tell from the metal of some
stuff so if you're interested you can
check out my stuff on the nvidia blog
and i will try to get video from the
apartment where I'm staying because it
is a ridiculous way nicer than where I
live at home and that was just lucky
because nvidia the hotel rooms they'd
booked they didn't have any labs and
they had me and a couple of other people
who kind of last minute we're going to
make the trim so they had to find us
somewhere to stay and they built this
apartment it's it's one of the kids say
it's off the hook all right anyway stay
tuned for a coverage from the Samsung
event tonight 6pm barcelona time which
is nine hours ahead of california at six
hours ahead of the east coast of the US
i think i'd still saying eight hours
perform in section nine so you know
that'll be kind of middle today in the
afternoon in the US so stay tuned for
coverage from all the press conferences

will get an upload as soon as I can
