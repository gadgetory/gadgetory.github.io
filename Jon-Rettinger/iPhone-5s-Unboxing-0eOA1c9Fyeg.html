TechnoBuffalo here is that time of year
it's time to unbox a new iPhone I've got
a 32 gig Space Gray iPhone 5s in my hot
little hands ready to get some iOS 7 on
and use my finger to unlock a phone
let's go and get started so here is the
box for the iPhone 5s they are all going
to come in white no matter what color
you have we've got the Space Gray here
you can also get the silver which used
to be called white and a brand new fancy
gold color we've got a 32 gigabyte model
here also available in 16 or 64
depending how much storage you want
let's go ahead and use it
sing your stabby the unnecessary
ridiculously large unboxing knife to cut
the plastic and hopefully not sever any
limbs so I'll get that plastic off a
little bit on this side and we'll do
some on this side we should be able to
take this phone out of its case so this
is the first phone that has touch ID the
fingerprint scanning technology that
will unlock your phone and let you buy
stuff for my tunes and hopefully someday
a lot more go and pull this off come on
out phone get into my hand
show off all the plastic trying to be
fancy and leave the top on it and there
is the iPhone 5s looking and feeling a
very familiar and similar to the iPhone
5 I will gingerly push it off to the
side for just a moment and see what else
we're going to have in the box
we've got designed by Apple in
California so now it's not in a little
open up package it's now in a sleeve
iPhone 5s and some Apple stickers
there's no longer says fingertips though
we have the ear pod headphones a wall
works be the same size last gen and a
lightning cable all nicely packaged away
let's go ahead and take the phone out
here it is here is the Space Gray model
so a little bit different than the
outgoing black that we saw for the
iPhone 5 will peel off all the plastic
if that whooshing noise a little bit of
plastic on the back only time this will
never have fingerprints on
now it's already sullied the great does
look very nice so the big difference is
here the home button now has touch ID
you don't have that little square in the
middle anymore
the button does feel the same this goes
for that same tactile feel to it
volume up and down still on the
left-hand side and your profile switch
also still lives there on the right-hand
side depending on what model you've got
that is where your SIM tray is going to
live it's a nano SIM tray I think all
phones actually will come with a SIM
tray
I've got your power and lock button on
top on the bottom this is where you've
got your speaker's your lightning
connector 3.5 millimeter headset jack so
this is a four inch screen it's same
pixel read density we've seen on the
iPhone 5 with Retina display
so it's 1136 by 640 being powered by the
brand new a7 64-bit chip coupled with
the new m7 chip is on board here as well
we've got a main camera on the back
still 8 megapixel but it's got bigger
pixels now we've got a little better
flash there it's a dual LED flash it's
an Amber coloring to make images
supposedly pop a little bit more we've
got a new FaceTime camera it's a 1.2
megapixel sensor up front phone ways
feels very light 3.95 ounces or 112
grams depending on where in the world
you live we're going to do a full
battery of tests will put touch ID
through its paces compare it to all
kinds of other devices test the cameras
and everything else so be sure to stay
