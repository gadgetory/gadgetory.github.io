lakers calm here and i'm gonna give you
a demonstration of the new blackberry
9530 also known as a blackberry storm
the first touchscreen blackberry coming
soon to verizon wireless for those of
you a verizon folks that have been
eyeing the iphone but not wanting to
switch carriers this is probably a very
attractive option for you so let's get
cracking with the emulator here so
you'll first notice that it's all touch
screen and they'll be four buttons along
the bottom there'll be a green call
button they'll be your old favorite
blackberry button that you see on all
the BlackBerry devices there'll be a
back button familiar again for
blackberry phones and I'll be a hang-up
and button which also take you back to
the home screen so as you guys saw a
very quickly gear the green button pulls
up your dial pad very easy dial pad hit
your numbers just like anything else and
go ahead and get send so let's go back
to the home screen here you'll notice
that you're greeted by a 8 icon array
across to the bottom and the background
here will be completely configurable and
if you click the background your 8 icons
suddenly become order the 16 icons so
let's go back to the mainland and I'll
walk you through each of these eight
will get to everything else and more
detail messages pulls up your list of
messages I don't have any in here but if
you wanted to create a message you can
see how you can compose it blackberry
messenger sim or pin and just like a
regular back for black bear you can type
it in and you have a shirt type keyboard
now what this emulator can't show is it
has an accelerometer if you turn the
phone sideways much like the iPhone
you'll have a full keyboard interesting
thing to note about the blackberry storm
is that it uses a click button type
press on the screen to actually you have
to push in to make contact with what it
is you want to push so it simulates the
actual push of a button so that should
be interesting to see how that fares in
a real world environment when we have
the actual device so SMS again same
thing you can compose an SMS look just
like the other menu and you can scroll
through
by these buttons or go to flick your
finger up and down contacts no contact
here but the same you can search and
available just to flick scroll through a
very similar to how it works on the
iphone calendar it'll be your typical /
sorry your typical abbr sorry phone rang
their typical blackberry calendar can
add a new appointments um go back you
can change how you're going to view it
by month you can see today is Sunday
October twelfth view it by day and you
can really just you know go through bye
week any way you want just like a
typical blackberry nothing terribly
revolutionary there other than the fact
that it's a touchscreen the browser will
see if the browser works your I know
it's gonna work on the emulator but
let's try John for lakers calm that's
EPL tell us what the browser will he'll
it'll work here I doubt that'll work on
the emulator but we'll see and it does
seem to be functioning which is nice and
still get a sense of how the browser
works and again this does have a
built-in accelerometer so we turn the
device sideways it'll change to
landscape mode and this is simulating a
connection over a video which will be
verizon's 3g network so as you can see
how fast will take for a page like John
for lakers calm to load so it's still
requesting usually the first time a
blackberry load to pay just a little bit
slow next time you load it it's capped
in there and is a little bit quicker but
wants you guys to see what a full fresh
low to look like i'll give you just
another minute so you guys can check it
out still requesting not the fastest
simulated 3g network I've ever seen but
it's like it's getting close to
finishing up here though I'm not so sure
if it's even going to even going to work
ok so the browser is not fully
functional ambulator here sorry guess
we've wasted that but you can see how it
will work when it is functional media
very slick media interface here you have
your music or your videos would be
here's where your ringtones would show
up pre-loaded ringtones my ringtones
you're all the preloaded ones see what
it looks like get your play and your
pause or stop buttons here shuffle
volume and your time right there we'll
go back again you're all your pictures
would show up which I got some sample
pictures here and you can see you can
set it as your home screen say what
everyone is set it for go to main menu
well go back again voice notes this has
the ability to record voice notes
something very cool that blackberry is
decided to add on the storm so if it's
just a quick overview of the media
sections clock nothing really to see
here clock you can send an alarm see
what time it is make a stopwatch nothing
terribly fancy that came up just by
clicking the blackberry button and we'll
go back again to the main menu camera
will show you the camera button I want
to take a picture through the webcam but
we're not going to let that but right
here is where obviously what you're
taking a picture of would show up I
don't want cool thing if you hold down
the blackberry but you get a quick four
shot list of most viewed icons there's
the home screen to take you back now if
you click with your finger just up here
you're eight somebody becomes 16 now you
have other options so these we've seen
here's got a built-in instant messaging
client just blackberry right now you're
tell--you're applications maps it should
have built-in GPS it's got a memo pad or
taking memos tasks obviously just for
tasks calculator video camera this will
record video voice notes like we saw
does have a built-in voice dialing
feature a password if you want a locked
advice and you can save messages there
go back games comes with two built-in
games brickbreaker in a word mole
downloads wherever you download shows up
in that file here can select your
profile go back here is your connection
so you can turn on and off your
different connections this will open up
all your options and this is very
similar to what you're used to in
regular BlackBerry's nothing terribly
fancy here and you can just scroll right
through last one here it will lock the
device press the lock button to unlock
so we'll hit that it is locked see how
are you I'm walking here alright so the
screen is still locked we'll see how we
can find a way to unlock this screen is
locked press the lock button to unlock
okay phone is unlocked to here we are
back on the screen where we just work
and if we keep scrolling down here you
can see there are other options let's go
back there actually um set up you can
set up your device help pulls up help
search concert your device that music
just launches your set music go back to
the home screen here you can't see it
but there are several buttons on the
side of device which will show up will
you actually have it right here they'll
be a convenience key which will launch
voice command over here will be another
convenience key which right now doesn't
do anything but that will launch the
camera and you have the device and
you'll have a volume rocker up and down
and a button up top here for power if
you want to change your profile so very
quickly when you have the device you can
just click that little speaker button
and you can change it very easily get
your battery info up here and your
network connection right there so guys
it's just a very quick demonstration of
the first touchscreen blackberry 9530
which will be available only for cdma
carriers right now there's no launch
plan to launch a gsm version so if
you're on AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile you are out
of luck this does look to be a very hot
device though so
you're with verizon or anywhere else in
the world where this is going to launch
definitely worth checking out it's
gotten very good pre-release reviews and
of course the blackberry so you'll have
excellent email and messaging
capabilities so guys hope you enjoyed
this be sure to check out the website
wwg on for lakers calm you like to
follow me on twitter and get some
exclusive comment it's an exclusive new
news and notes it's ww twitter.com /
john for lakers and if you're curious
about what i have to say about things
other than technology check out my new
channel at inside John's mine will be
links all these up in the sidebar and
right guys thanks for watching jon
rettinger with jhad for lakers and i
will talk to you guys soon bye i wanted
to show you was the accelerometer and
how it pulls up a full qwerty keyboard
anywhere in the blackberry storms menu
device so here i am in just a simple
compose an email and I'm greeted with a
shirt type qwerty keyboard wallet phone
is upright and the suretype works very
well if exactly the same is found on the
blackberry pearl I'll show you how that
works right now just type I you can go
right down em get that the wrong letter
I am typing te blog you can see that
recognizes what you are typing and you
hit spacebar twice pulls up the period
and one thing that was hidden inside of
this emulator here is you can simulate a
tilt so we'll tilt it now left side up
and you'll see that you now have a full
qwerty keyboard that you can type emails
from something that's very handy and
something the iphone is currently
missing and now this works just like any
other keyboard pull up your numbers
anything else shows up there nice
meeting and again this accelerometer
full qwerty keyboard will show up in any
menu throughout the blackberry storm
just another real cool feature that you
guys would want to see anyway guys jon
