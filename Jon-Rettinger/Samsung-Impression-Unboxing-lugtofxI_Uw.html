unboxing for you of the just-released
samsung impression for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless
this phone will run you 199 after fifty
dollar rebate and a new two-year
contract from AT&amp;amp;T so let's go ahead and
open it up this phone was just announced
actually a few weeks ago and ATT had a
really quick release with it actually
very excited season looks like so will
hack of that open plot the box here sure
standard 18t fare box with the orange
and white picture device on the front
let me know it can do text IM email it's
got bluetooth built-in but what doesn't
have bluetooth built-in now it is
listing some more the features on the
box on the front here same stuff that i
just mentioned on the back look just
like the front just a picture of the
device let's go ahead and open it up see
what we got so it's again the same
standard 18 tee box with the tray and
nothing much inside so we've got a CD
samsung impression interactive tutorial
english user manual in spanish user
manual and pc studio manager your
required reading materials quick start
guide although i don't know who reads
those so here is the phone itself i'll
go over the specs in a minute let's see
what's in the box here is the battery on
see we can see what the milliamp hour
battery is life is on it it is 1000
milliamp hour battery which is actually
pretty good for a non smartphone device
got a USB charger with that samsung
proprietary port right there in that
flattened USB wall charger and the
device itself let's take a look at the
phone will do a little quick walk
through the phone and then we'll do some
size comparisons and go over the specs
login stay connected instant messenger
so the front of the device the reason
that this
really pretty high height is because
it's got an amo LED screen I don't have
brown SAT AMOLED and essentially what
that is you may hear it kind of talked
about a lot it just describes a specific
type of kind of ultra-thin ultra-bright
technology it doesn't require a
backlight and that's really it just the
amo LED just refers technology behind
that and the dressing of the pixels that
go with it so this phone right here has
a 240 x 400 pixels and it can show 262
colors just know that it looks really
nice so there's the screen on the side
of the device we've got a volume up and
down looks like a dedicated camera key
on the right side of device we've got a
soft key or hard key rather and we have
a lock key on the side and if you slide
it open behind the touchscreen is a full
four row qwerty keyboard and this uses
the same TouchWiz interface that you see
another samsung devices such as the
eternity and behold so some of the other
specs on the device that's 18t puts on
the box and things that I've done some
research on it is a quad-band phone so
it'll work anywhere in the world it is
of course 3g weighs five point three
ounces and four point four inches by two
point two eight times point 61 inches
and it's kind of hard to see something
give you some size comparisons here with
some other phones that you guys may be
familiar with first one the iphone you
can see that the screen on the
impression really does look nice and big
compared to the iphone a thickness wise
the impression is definitely thicker
because it does have that slide out
qwerty keyboard but not by much it's
definitely one of the thinner slide out
keyboards that I've seen left like kudos
to Samsung for that the next phone will
compare with you guys may be familiar
with is the AT&amp;amp;T fuze this is a windows
mobile smartphone and i should say again
that this is not a smartphone as you
guys would consider it it's more of a
feature phone it does have email
capabilities but it's java-based
it does have an HTML browser but it's
not going to have the same calendar
built-in functionality that you get from
a full-blown smartphone OS so size
comparison here this also has a
slide-out QWERTY keyboard so it's a
little more of a fair comparison
definitely a little bit smaller but it's
certainly much thicker so another full
keyboard device the samsung epix this is
another windows mobile phone and this
has the keyboard on the front actually
thick this wise aren't exactly the same
so it really goes to show how thin
samsung was able to make this I got to
say just on initial impression build
quality and the slide-out does feel very
nice it's got a good feel in the hand
I'll spring assisted keyboard does
really launch until you get almost up to
the top but it does have a very nice
feel to it it's got that hard plastic
base you feel like it will be protected
or on the back of the bites by the way
does have a three-point Oh megapixel
camera with a speaker grill on the back
so back to the size the last advise them
you guys might be familiar with is the
treo pro and there is a size comparison
as well and there really is not much of
a thickness difference and on this you
get the full landscape qwerty so really
is very nice let's go ahead and power
this thing on let's see what it looks
like alright so I did pop in the battery
and put in a sim card and take off the
screen protector here and I will power
it up and while it's powering on I'll
tell you a little bit more about the
device at the end button right there
turn it on you'll see it just has three
buttons on the front send and then key
and a menu button so the 1000 million
power battery is it will last up to
three hours the top time and 250 hours
of standby time which is actually not
bad so let's sing keep booting up here
this also has eighteen t calls their CV
so you can actually watch television on
it you get your news sports weather
entertainment and a few more you have
some news on there as well so it is
booting up at least I think it is there
we go so it has already put up screen is
locked press and hold the lock key to
unlock so we'll do that
alright tap the center this is sort of
similar to windows mobile here tap the
center to target and repeat it so we'll
do that and there's no stylus on a
device this is meant to be used with
your finger and it is a resistive
touchscreen and there we are it's a very
familiar samsung touchwiz interface move
that you've got a whole bunch of widgets
looks like they added some more widgets
here when I do review I'll kind of walk
you through what all the choices are and
I am getting haptic feedback as I'm
going through and using this let's see
the screen rotation speed as I slide
this out not bad rotated relatively
quickly those menus down the side rotate
let's see that again very quick watch em
chain it's very subtle actually almost
instantaneous actually this is always
nice so it goes to show this not an
underpowered device when you have a slow
processor generally I'll take quite a
bit to render hey guys just a quick
unboxing or the samsung impression hope
you enjoyed as I usually do with phones
i will use it for a few days and post
the reviews make sure you stay tuned for
that and for exclusive content be sure
