smartphone users who put your photos
online you may be posting a lot more
than just images early show consumer
correspondent Susan Koeppen is here with
a serious morning it seems everybody's
using their phone to post pictures
nowadays it's happening all the time so
with the touch of a button you can show
the world your photos but you can also
be revealing information you may not
want to share like the exact location of
where you live work play and go on
vacation there are more than 100 billion
photos currently posted online with
thousands being uploaded every minute
from kids to pets vacations and
graduations you and Jennifer minor of a
mom and a blogger who puts up photos all
the time you're posting pictures of your
kids your home vacation spots wherever I
am here's the vacation gals but what you
see online is only half the story most
smartphones have a GPS chip built into
them so when you're taking a picture it
actually takes your location stores it
on that photo jon rettinger is a
technology expert he says the same
technology that helps people see
real-time traffic updates and find
directions on their phones also leads to
GPS coordinates being attached to
pictures and not only can you know
exactly where was taking you know
exactly the time that the picture was
shot and all it takes to find someone's
location based solely on a picture is
the right computer program in just a
couple of minutes so how easy is it to
do this extremely easy if you know where
to look it's one button to hit download
and you are done we decided to see just
how easy it really is a producer took
pictures of just my face at locations
around Los Angeles we posted them to my
Twitter account and asked rettinger to
figure out where I was oh you were
shopping on Rodeo Drive haha right
outside of the Louis Vuitton store
enjoying the beautiful Southern
California weddin wow that's where I was
right there I was right there just by
right clicking on all of the photos
rettinger was able to pinpoint my
locations and here we have your GPS
coordinates almost exactly where it was
taken here we are looks like you were a
great park I was
can tell that you were right at
grauman's chinese theater that's exactly
where i was so if you had somebody who
had bad intentions out there they could
easily track you absolutely with more
than 70 million Americans currently
using smart phones smart phone tracking
has become a hot-button issue just this
month executives from Apple and Google
were questioned about it on Capitol Hill
but the good news for smartphone users
jump right into your setting turning off
the location of your pictures flip that
off you're done is easy oftentimes years
go to settings and it says geolocation
and you switch it off and that is it
that's all you need to do what does she
have that's something Jennifer minor
plans to do on for blackberry it's a
good picture up until now she had no
idea her pictures could be tracked you
never know what somebody's thinking of
course so why take chances better safe
than sorry and it's interesting to note
that our expert had never tried to read
the location of a picture before but he
said it took him a total of ten minutes
to get the right program off the
internet and then learn how to do it and
once we posted our pictures it took him
less than 30 seconds per picture to find
my locations Erica it's just creepy to
use one word to describe it so we saw
briefly in your piece the expert was
showing us how to turn off these
settings so people can't figure out
where you are walk us through that if
you would okay so we used an iphone to
take our pictures so what you're going
to do is you're going to find settings
go to settings then you're going to go
to general then you're going to find
location services and where it says
camera you just want to have it turned
to off make sure it's on up i'll be
doing that as soon as we finish here
