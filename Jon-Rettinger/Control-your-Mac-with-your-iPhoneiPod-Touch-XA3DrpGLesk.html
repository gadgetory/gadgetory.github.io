TechnoBuffalo here I don't do that many
iPhone app reviews but the ones that I
do I try and make sure they're really
useful a very fun a better game and this
is an application that I've been using
for the better part but we could have
found it to be really helpful it's
called a remote tap and it lets you
remotely access your Mac from anywhere
over Wi-Fi or 3G this will definitely
work with an iPod touch as well it's a
$4.99 application that needs to buy it
from Apple's App Store let's go ahead
and watch it right here I'm going to
cover some information that shows up go
ahead and launch my desktop so right now
it's going to pull up my desktop do you
have got a Firefox window open it's a
little bit shrunk and hard to read so if
I rotate it I now have my full desktop
and I use multiple monitors supports
that so I can scroll over it I can see
my other monitor will focus on one for
right here and we'll look at this
Firefox window so you can zoom in using
the pinch and zoom function on it you're
probably familiar with now what if you
wanted to click on something that was
very small it was hard to see like that
little X if I hold my finger over it it
actually pulls up a little zoom bar can
see a better sense of what you want to
do however I will tell you the tapping
menus it's actually pretty easy so I go
to Firefox I wanted to quit Firefox to
be pretty easy to type just tap it and
it actually increases the size as you
select the menus to make it really
finger friendly the application does a
really nice job about making everything
very finger friendly so the big question
I had was how am I going to use an
application like this especially a one
that supports OS 10 that's very heavy on
keyboard strokes whereas a built-in
keyboard on the iPhone doesn't really
have a command shift control
well this application makes all that
really useful let me show you go ahead
and pull that up and launches your
typical iPhone keyboard but now that's
all of the keys that you might want to
use with it so shift control option
command all of them there right there at
your fingertips
so moving right along if you just want
to hit the keys pulls up the ledge the
rest of the for kind of most popular
shortcut keys if we keep moving along
this thing's pretty cool too it's sort
of you can see these circles show up and
this would want to control your music so
let's say you're in the other room
and your computer is controlling a party
and you're not on Wi-Fi forever reason
you can't use Apple's remote app this
lets you control absolutely everything
go ahead and pull it up you get your
full remote control button so you can
control wherever you want here if you're
let's say you're on the other side of
the world and someone at home is
listening to music you can just jump in
and correct with the listening to which
is kind of fun so we'll keep moving
along say what else we have here this
shows you what's open makes a lot easier
to manage your applications so it tells
me what's running what's in my dock all
my applications that I have and I can go
ahead and pick one right here and I'm
done I just go ahead hit done so if you
want to open something up it could be a
little bit hard to go into the dock and
zoom in and find the application that
you want whereas right here you can just
well just select it it's got another
button for for music also control spaces
too if you've got space is used on your
computer and lastly the controller music
as well it's a very useful application
I've been finding that when I when I'm
away if I want to send a quick email
I've gotten very quick and used to using
it it works very very well your computer
of course needs to be on and when you
download the application from the App
Store I'll promise you to go to a
website and download a little bit of
software that'll put itself in your
system preferences on your Mac but it
really just works incredibly well it's a
fun application to use and it is pretty
sweet to see your whole desktop right on
your phone I should warn you though it
can be a bit choppy over 3G but it's
definitely useful one thing that you
can't do is play video I tried to go to
YouTube for example and play a video on
here it becomes a very choppy but if
you're going to want to use this sort of
a sling box or mobile Hulu player it's
not going to work that way unfortunately
it's gonna be just for basic tests or
things you want to send yourself or file
if you want access to at least right now
it's not the best for echoing streaming
video just wants to give you a heads up
that was the first thing that I wanted
to see when I downloaded this
application any guys hope you enjoyed
this is a quick demonstration of remote
tap for the iPhone or iPod Touch foes
you that our PC users I'll be doing
another video showing you a great
application that does the same thing for
peace
I hope you guys enjoyed checking out a
Twitter twitter.com slash John for
Lakers and for all of your technique
needs of course TechnoBuffalo calm I'll
see you guys in the next video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
