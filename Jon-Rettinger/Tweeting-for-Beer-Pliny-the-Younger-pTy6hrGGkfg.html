downtown berkeley california you might
be wondering what does Peter have to do
with the technology website well here's
the thing this is the tapping of the
pliny the younger cake this is a
cochlear beyond cold beers not only here
in Northern California but in the world
it was rated the number one beer in the
world on a couple of web-sites cup
flowers came in number two's pain but
basically the deal is this I was away
San Francisco beer week right now is
wrapping up I was away at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona covering the
phones and all that stuff and this is
when rushing river brewery makes this
stuff they release it in the world they
have it out at their brew pub in santa

I'm kind of getting into being the craft
brunner I really like blended the elder
this is kind of the extra stout playing
the elder it's an imperial IPA I is
fantastic all honesty but uh I was
chatting with a bunch of my friends and
even Emily on TechnoBuffalo she's kind
of a craft beer nerd way more than I am
Emily this one's for you and so I was
bummed i was going to miss the tapping

are you gonna do it's rough life right I
got back in town she's let me part of my
jet leg off went on to twitter and saw
though he's happy to kick here at Bobby
Jews and 3pm that's what I'm saying
digital technology hooked me up with my
first ever tasted honestly what might be
able to be the best free beer in the
world and that if you don't trust me I
mean seriously look at the line it's a
cold rainy windy day in berkeley and
there are tons of happy people inside
and a bunch more outside waiting you
know thank heavens for twitter right
