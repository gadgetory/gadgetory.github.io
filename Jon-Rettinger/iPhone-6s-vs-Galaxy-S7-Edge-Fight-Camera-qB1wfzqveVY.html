TechnoBuffalo and this last weekend I
got the chance to go up to Lake
Arrowhead with three very cool gadgets
number one being the razor blade stealth
it's their brand new ultra book the
Chevy Volt which is a car so it's a bit
of a bigger gadget and a Samsung Galaxy
s7 edge which we reviewed last week this
time around I wanted to take a deeper
look at the camera on the samsung galaxy
s7 edge and better yet compared to what
is called one of the best cameras on the
market in terms of phones the iPhone 6s
right out the gate we're rocking very
similar specs 12 megapixel cameras on
the back for both and 5 megapixels on
the front however things are a little
bit different optically the iPhone has a
twenty nine millimeter F 2.2 lens
whereas the Samsung has a 26 millimeter
F one point seven so a little bit wider
focal length on the Samsung and a little
bit wider aperture as well we also see
this on the front where the iPhone was
rocking an F to point 231 millimeter
lens and the Samsung is rocking the F
1.7 22 millimeter lens and that 22
millimeters is a huge deal to me it's an
ultra wide selfie camera which Samsung
has now had for two generations with
phones and it's hands-down one of my
favorite features of their phones it
really changes the way you use snapchat
Instagram Twitter any of your selfie
taking needs I'm a huge huge huge fan of
this ultra wide camera hopping over the
back other than the three millimeter
focal difference which makes the Samsung
lens a little bit wider it's very hard
to tell these cameras apart optically
and the way the software runs through it
looks extremely similar photo to photos
you can see side-by-side
you really have to nitpick to find the
differences something I did notice
however is it the iPhone tends to dig a
little deeper in the shadows and pull
out a little more detail whereas the
Samsung might just crush those two black
but on the other side the Samsung does
tend to do a better job rolling off
highlights that have clipped into white
where's it's a little more jarring on
the iPhone now if we're going to
continue nitpicking on optical
differences I did notice that the
Samsung images were coming out a little
bit sharper than the iPhones this was
mainly because of the in-camera
sharpening that happens via software on
the Samsung so it's a bit of a catch-22
the images do look sharper on the phone
and on a bigger screen but if you were
to print those images or build them up
you would most likely begin to see some
artifacting the biggest differences you
can find here are the UI the shooting
mode and how
get to the camera with Samsung the
double top of the home button to getting
into camera is one of my favorite ways
to get to a camera of any phone it's
super super quick feels very natural
feels very intuitive in the camera pops
up extremely quickly in addition while
iOS is still stuck with their
tried-and-true simple as the way to go
camera app and I know you can get
third-party apps before people start
going crazy I do prefer Samsung's app
because it is simple but it does give
you a ton of shooting modes and best of
all is there pro mode now if anybody is
trying to replace a DSLR where the
portability is key they're going to love
that you get full manual control just
like you do on a really high-end
point-and-shoot or DSLR control ISO
white balance shutter speed and anything
and everything in between
one feature I do love is the selective
focus now you have to hold the camera
there for a bit and what it does is it
analyzes the background and the
foreground focusing on both while you're
taking picture and then it goes and adds
a little bit of extra software blur to
the background to create the illusion of
a super shallow depth of field the
technique works really really well
however it does bring me to one of my
gripes with the Samsung it is the
autofocus while it is fast it is a bit
schizophrenic where the iPhone auto
focus seems a little more Zen a little
more meditative it decides what it wants
to do and then does it well the Samsung
auto focus is kind of jarring it just
skips around a lot you really notice
this in video when you're moving from
foreground to background items panoramic
modes and both phones work well however
I did feel worked a little bit better on
the s7 edge purely because Samsung
allows you to do panoramic photos while
the phone is in landscape and portrait
Apple still has this really annoying
thing but the for state of the phone in
portrait to create a panorama I have no
clue why they haven't added a horizontal
panoramic feature it's beyond me but
kudos to Samsung for having in low-light
is always an interesting one when it
comes to mobile phones because the
sensors are so small they can only be so
good that being said with a new larger
pixel the s7 edge does much better than
the s6 and even seems to edge out the
iPhone 6s so that is pretty much it
those are really my thoughts on both
cameras and both phones now of course
there are a ton of other more in-depth
features on the s7 edge and the iPhone
that we didn't really cover of course
you can get third-party apps use a
camera on the iPhone optically I think
they're super super close that beings
that I do prefer the SMS because of all
the additional features that Samsung
packaged
with and how well they seem to work I
just like having that option there and
the fun little bonus feature is because
of the waterproofing on the s7 it's
practically a GoPro replacement but with
that being said click the link down
below to see the full res gallery of
both phones and give me your thoughts in
the comments below I'm very curious to
hear give us a thumbs up if you liked
