attacking a buffalo here back with a
round two of the smartphone Goliath
Apple's iPhone 3GS and HTC's droid
incredible one running on each ents
Network one running on verizon's and
round one we compared a ton of really
important features including web
browsing web speed keyboard text entry
and generally UI tweaks and that round
definitely went to HTC incredible I'll
put a link to it at the end in case you
want to check that out and we're back
with the promise around to on this round
we're going to cover media in particular
how the cameras work on each picture is
in video how they both handle video
playback and audio playback so let's go
ahead and get started and of course
we're going to start with some geeky
specs because it helps sort of
understand what we're going to discuss a
little bit so starting right now with
the droid incredible it has a screen
resolution of 480 x 800 on a 3.7 inch
screen the iphone 3gs has a little bit
smaller 3.5 inch screen and a lower
resolution 320 x 480 that comes into
play when watching video certainly if
you're going to watch media on your
device you got to watch it on the screen
so moving on to camera this is really
where we start to see a big spec
difference especially considering the
incredible as a brand new device in the
iphone 3gs you know now we're looking at
up just about your old hardware so the
incredible if you flip that sucker over
is highlighted by an eight megapixel
sensor with dual LED flash with touch to
zoom auto focus and on the iphone 3gs
we've got a 3 megapixel sensor with no
LED and does have auto focus now
generally in the camera world higher
megapixel does not always equal better
pictures you want a higher megapixel
edge if you're looking to blow up images
because you get a higher pixel density
however higher pixel ratios here do
actually translate to better picture
quality when it comes to these two
phones I'll put up the midges right now
you can sort of see the the difference
the incredible definitely has an edge
when it comes to photography and
low-light the dual LED flash really
makes things pop certainly you're not
going to want to blow them up to poster
size it's not gonna replace your DSLR
but it does take pretty significant
pictures and the picture quality does
look very nice so both of these also
feature video cameras so let's talk a
bit about specs on video well the iphone
3gs shoots video at VGA resolution which
is 640 by 480 witches you know not bad
the droid incredible however shoots
video at wvga resolution that extra
letter before this actually means
something the w means that it shoots at
800 x 480 so you're looking at a bit
higher resolution that does actually
translate as well to video quality i'll
put up some video now compare the two
that was shot at exactly the same time
exactly the same location so you can see
the difference in the video fidelity
so youtube doesn't always do justice to
the quality of video but suffice to say
the increased resolution of the droid
incredible does look better in
real-world environments than the iphone
3gs when i play a video shot on the
droid incredible back on my 24 inch
monitor it still looks relatively
rutting crisp when i blow up video from
the iphone 3gs tends to look a bit on a
pixelated side not to say the 3gs takes
bad video just enjoy incredible happens
to take better video so let's take a
look at another way to view video and if
you're watching this video on YouTube
chances are maybe you're watching it on
your phone I do a lot of video viewing
on my mobile device so I need a phone
that can accommodate so if i go ahead
and launch Safari Here I am at my
youtube page on for lakers and if i want
to watch video embedded on here i have
to launch the dedicated youtube player
which can be a bit annoying it works
well but it takes you away from the web
experience so if i want to look at a
video I gotta click it then I got to
find the mobile link that launched the
player and little plate inside of that
application a very little way to play
video a right in the browser we have
seen in browser playback on the iPad
that has not yet been implemented here
on the iphone however on the droid
incredible i go ahead and launch that
here i am on the same youtube page and
then there are some probably key
differences here on the droid incredible
we've got flash content in the place
that ad in the upper right hand corner
that is dynamic and moving not even
present here on the iphone 3gs now flash
is definitely a polarizing feature some
say they must have it have to have it
won't do anything without it some say
they don't care flash has been a bit of
a Jake implementation thus far sometimes
flash video will play back or right in
the browser sometimes it will not let me
go and try and refresh this page and see
we can get a playback and I love this
problem lies with the droid incredible
or its flash implementation or perhaps
the YouTube issue but sometimes video
play right in here and sometimes it will
not looks like it's loading then we get
a error occurred please try back later
so go ahead and try to hit that play
button so weak
get it something to play and we're still
getting that same error occurred now
we'll say that maybe three out of every
five times and it refresh the page is a
play but those two times if you saw
right here it just doesn't so flash wall
important to some and certainly
important on a desktop experience I get
to see a good implementation of it and
affluent implementation of it on a
mobile device however if that's a
feature that's important to you the
droid incredible and out of these two
devices is the only one that offers it
something to keep in mind let's take a
look at the audio playback of both these
teams they both offer a pretty decent
audio playback Apple certainly made the
big name for themselves with the ipod
and they've sort of implemented some of
those key features here over to the
iphone so here is the ipod functionality
you get your typical ipod or a playlist
artists songs videos scroll through some
of them and if you turn it off to the
side you get a kind of a cool cover flow
of you go ahead and push that back and
if you pick a song you can go ahead and
pause it right there you can pick either
a genius playlist which essentially will
take songs that are similar we're
listening to and make its own playlist
you can shuffle songs at random or just
do a simple shuffle or a loop play
playback buttons pretty simple menu
system does work well and you've got
your artwork right on the front of the
album artwork is available now if you
want to buy music from an Apple device
is it going to sound for your familiar
you're limited to apple's walled garden
you have to go through itunes in order
to get music onto the device certainly
you can buy any non drm songs that you
like from amazon or any other source
loaded into itunes sync it up and it'll
certainly play but you're limited to get
the information onto the device from
itunes there's a mobile store built
right in we can go ahead and download
all the songs and videos that you'd like
it doesn't work very well but they run
about 99 cents each per song definitely
can add up let's take a look at audio
playback here on the droid incredible so
go ahead and tap music and it got sort
of a colorful looking fuel to you've got
a some 3d animations right there and I
love seeing a 3d stuff on the droid
incredible lets me know they're putting
that Snapdragon processor
use let's pick a song here uh here's
youth explosion go in it play you get
the simple options that you would get on
on most audio playback devices you get
shuffle you get loop you go play next
song but since this is running HTC Sense
you do get some other options so i'm
going to show you what those are so here
you can view all your artists albums
playlist songs on Rose composers or
purchased you can buy music directly on
device from amazon's mp3 store or since
android is very open anywhere that you
want to get music from that's not drm
you can go ahead and play it right on
android you plug your device in
essentially just drag the music files
right over it is pretty easy video
playback on both devices something that
I think YouTube is not going to do
justice for video playback on each share
is relatively smooth Android when his
first launch was not known for its
multimedia prowess however that has
certainly been a dress i think in recent
software updates firmware updates and
the hardware updates serve coming to
what I'm saying to be the ultimate
Android device which would be the droid
incredible so video playback looks very
smooth on both showing you here really
wouldn't do it any justice so let's jump
backwards in time to talk about the
cameras we showed some pictures let me
show you the camera interfaces that's
something that is a big diff
differential factor so here's the very
simple camera interface on the iphone
3gs oh I want to take a picture here's a
expo marker for example and go ahead and
get in focus I can tap it a lot of focus
and I can go ahead and stand my picture
that is really the extent of it now for
example I launch the camera on the droid
incredible you have a few more options
and this is really HTC's Sense tweaks
that do quite a bit so go ahead and put
that same expo marker there and if I
wanted to I could just snap a picture I
can tap to zoom as well or tap to focus
rather and I can hit the optical joy but
joystick button tap it and it will snap
the picture however I've got a ton just
lock the device however have a ton of
other customization options show you as
well something I don't tap the lock
button the process
go and hit that arrow right there you
get really some pretty advanced options
for mobile device i'll show you what all
those are here so you can choose whether
you want to jump at the photo or video
you've got your brightness options you
can tweak it any way you like up or down
you've got a contrast saturation and
sharpness which some of you photo files
out there may like you've got a ton of
effects to it you're kind of neat and
got a quite a few of them grayscale
Sofia negative solarized posterize and
aqua so there's aqua turns things blue
these or take a look and see how it does
with things it's sort of neat let's go
back to negative I kind of like that one
so there's the marker you can see it's
all reversed but you want to show you
that you do get sort of some advanced
functionality and of course you have
flash options up here as well I take
advantage of that dual LED flash so I
can turn it on turn it off turn it auto
let's turn it on we slowed the negative
effect here and we'll take a picture see
the flashlight up and I hit the power
button I keep doing that me to take
pictures but you do see that you get
access to both of these flash models on
the bottom and you get a lot more
customization options when it comes to
the camera on each so at the end of the
day both phones offer I think very
unique experiences Apple's got a very
tightly integrated operating system they
make the hardware they make thee or the
outsourcer hardware but they control the
hardware and they control the operating
system should they create a seamless
experience however they're also very
closed if you want to get into a product
you want to use Apple products you're
very limited to what they call the
walled garden you have to stay within
sort of the everywhere and
all-encompassing itunes in order to
really use the device the android
operating system on the other hand and
particularly the joy incredible is very
open you can customize it you could
tweak it i can do a ton of really
anything that you like and you can get
music from a variety of sources and drag
and drop them right on so it's really
going to be personal preference but they
like that tightly integrated Apple
experience whether you want sort of a
more
a loose open experience with Android
definitely going to be a personal
preference if we have to declare winter
here and just based solely on camera
performance and specs and features again
it has to go to the droid incredible
although it is worthwhile to mention
that we're looking at probably just
about year old hardware here and the new
hardware here on the droid incredible
certainly when the iphone 4g launches
and we can put modern against modern
made different results but when we're
looking at these two which are the
current release models i think the droid
incredible represents just a fantastic
phone a great value and a really good
experience overall so guys if you missed
around one be sure to check it out i'll
put a link to it at the end so you can
watch it and i'm really curious what you
guys have to think too is the droid
incredible device for you or you waiting
for a gsm version of it are you going to
jump to verizon or a cube upgrade i'm
going to want to know what you guys
think leave comments or video responses
anyway i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
