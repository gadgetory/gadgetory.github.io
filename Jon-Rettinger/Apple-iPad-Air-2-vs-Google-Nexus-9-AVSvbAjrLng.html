to you by go daddy what's going on guys
a m√§rklin sanger from TechnoBuffalo and
today we'll be comparing these two
tablets the iPad air 2 and the Nexus 9
both which we reviewed recently and see
which tablet comes out on top so before
we get started with this comparison
video make sure to check out our full
review which we will link down below
this video to get more of an in-depth
look at both of these tablets now to get
hardware and specs out of the way real
quick the iPad air 2 features a nine
point seven inch display with a
resolution in 2048 by 1536 with the
pixel density of 264 PPI it's rocking
Apple's newest a8x chip with 2 gigabytes
of RAM touch ID it comes in either 16 64
or 128 gigabyte of non-expandable
storage a seven thousand three hundred
forty million battery an 8 megapixel
camera in the back that can film in
1080p and slow motion 720p a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera it's
running iOS 8 and it's going for 499 up
to 699 for the Wi-Fi only models while
the Wi-Fi + cellular model starts to
just 629 up to 829 it comes in space
grey gold and silver the Nexus 9 on the
other hand features an 8.9 inch display
with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 with a
pixel density of 281 PPI as HTC's famous
boomsound speakers on the front which
sounds amazing
it's equipped with in videos latest
Tegra k1 processor with 2 gigabytes of
RAM storage options of either 16 or 32
gigabytes a 6700 milliamp battery an 8
megapixel camera that's capable of
recording 1080p videos and a 1.6
megapixel and a front it's running
Google's latest Android operating system
Android lollipop and it's going for $399
for the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi only model and
$479 to the 32 gigabyte model the Wi-Fi
+ cellular is only available in 32
gigabyte option and is going for 599
dollars it comes in black white and gold
so talking a bit about the design and
build quality first Apple has always
done a great job designing majority of
their products with it's all aluminum
unibody products and HTC in the recent
years has
same with their flagship devices like
the HTC One and the One m8
however the Nexus 9 doesn't feel as
premium as we'd hope and although it
sports a metal frame and soft plastic
back it's not as nice as iPads all
aluminium body the iPad air two's design
is somewhat similar to last year's model
though it's noticeably thinner and
lighter than before
the sleek aluminum finish is beautiful
and is far more premium looking than the
Nexus 9 in terms of size and weight the
iPad air 2 is about 1.8 millimeters
thinner than the Nexus 9 while the Nexus
9 is about 12 grams lighter than iPad
air 2 feature wise they both have their
individual perks the iPad air 2 features
touch ID which can be used for added
security apps in-app purchases using
Apple pay while the Nexus 9 features the
boomsound front-facing speakers which
are amazing for watching movies choosing
between Android and iOS can really be
difficult and it really depends on how
you're going to use the tablet but
hopefully this section will help you
narrow down your decisions the Nexus 9
is one of the first devices to on
Android lollipop and I can't express on
video how awesome it is Google's new
design language material design looks
amazing and it's consistent throughout
the whole OS the animations and new
features like priority mode tap to wake
and the ability to add multiple users
yes and pin an app or something that I
OS doesn't really have and this is a
really handy feature especially if
you're constantly sharing tablet with
your family and just as a little example
your kid wants to play a game and you
don't really want to set up an account
you can simply pin an app down and he or
she won't be able to get out the app
unless you unpin the app little features
like these makes a user experience more
powerful than iOS though iOS 8 does
improve quite a bit as well over the
years and introduced new features like
continuity to help would productivity
work widgets in Notification Center is
and improve spotlight some we've already
seen on Android for years but features
like iMessage FaceTime and continuity or
something that I can't really let go of
yet but continuity I can answer a call
from my nagging or an iPad when my phone
is out of reach or I can start writing
an email on my Mac and finish it on my
iPad now both the Nexus 9 and the iPad
air tube features the same pixel
resolution at 2048 by 1536 though the
iPad air 2 features a bigger screen
coming at nine point seven inches and it
features an anti-reflective coating and
a fully laminated display which
according to Apple colors are richer
contrast is greater and images are
sharper and more vivid but putting all
the specs and feature stalks aside
all-in-all there aren't any major
difference in terms of detail with their
displays I did notice that the Nexus 9
is white point has a noticeable shift
towards the purple hues while the iPad
air 2 manages to hold on to a more
natural-looking white so just bear that
in mind let's take a quick break from
this video and thank our friends over at
GoDaddy

just a dollar ninety-nine cents
some limitations apply see website for
details when it comes to performance the
Nexus 9 like I mentioned in the
beginning is sporting in videos latest
64-bit dual core Tegra k1 processor
while the iPad air 2 is rocking Apple's
latest triple core a8x chip with 64-bit
architecture from day to day use when
watching videos playing games or
browsing the web the iPad air 2 fuels
like the more solid performer it doesn't
lag as much as the Nexus 9 not sure what
it is but the Nexus 9 tends to lag even
when lightly browsing the web which is a
bit weird that's not an intensive task
by any means and with these specs that
shouldn't really happen I also did want
to mention thin the Nexus 9 tends to get
hot when using it for more than a few
hours which is kind of ridiculous
because I've never really had that
problem with the iPad air 2 in terms of
battery life the iPad air promises up to
10 hours of battery life while the Nexus
9 promises around nine and a half hours
in our tests we got over 10 hours of
usage on both and in some cases we got
less that'll definitely vary on how
often and how have you used the iPad and
Nexus 9 the Nexus 9 with Android
lollipop sports a battery saving mode
which helps a ton when you want to
extend a battery life while the iPad air
2 uses the power efficiency of the a8x
chip so in terms of camera it's pretty
silly to take pictures or videos on your
tablet I mean come on take a look at
this yeah
that's pretty weird but with all jokes
aside I found the iPad air 2 which
sports an 8 megapixel camera takes some
pretty good photos colors are a bit
better exposure seems to be more
accurate though the Nexus 9 has an 8
megapixel shooter as well and it's not
all that bad either
it sports an LED flash in the back which
can be helpful if you're shooting in
low-light conditions but both also shoot
1080p videos though the iPad air 2 can
film in slow motion 120 frames per
second at 720p so to wrap things are for
you guys I'd have to give it to the iPad
air 2 on this one even though it's $100
more than the neck
9 I think that extra $100 is worth it
the addition of touch ID the bill
quality the performance it really adds
up in the long run and I'm not saying
that the Nexus 9 is a bad tablet it's a
good tablet and the stock Android
lollipop experience is the best version
we've ever seen the Nexus 9 is an
amazing tablet but the iPad air 2 is
ultimately the better option here
