technobuffalo here and welcome dear
friends so an episode of ask the Buffalo
have a seat right here oh I'll make some
room for you so it's not awkward you can
sit over here and we can chat and I came
to your quite with some world of
technology first one comes from abs
vihaan 1086 to ask at John for lakers
what would like to see from the iphone
6s at this point we are a mere matter of
weeks away from apple finally telling us
with the iphone success is going to be
foregone conclusion is going to look
same gonna have force touch to have a
little better camera probably a 12
megapixel sensor in the back I'm hoping
force touch conserve is almost a
tertiary button that lets you do
anything you want throughout different
applications menus for example hold it
in the camera to guess or more granular
camera options the bit di hoping for for
the success on the software side I've
already seen iOS 9 but I am like fingers
crossed toes crossed anything else I can
cross that there are some things in iOS
9 we haven't seen yet they're gonna be
specific to the success I'm still hoping
for widgets on the home screen I still
for the life me candor stand why can't
add a direct-dial icon about using a
weird hacks third-party app on my home
screen or jailbreaking just let me have
that I'm hoping that they are just
surprised at iOS 9 it's not gonna was
boring as a look next one comes from X
get Baker underscore 2000 at John for
lakers which new Nexus phone looking
forward to the most the next 26 the
Nexus 5 so the story goes we'll have two
new Nexus necks I coming one bill from
LG in the vein of the nexus 5 so similar
size I'll both of us bc the other being
a hallway built 5.7 inch phone and we
saw some pictures at today with the
droid x looking camera hump I'm not
talking like a tiny camera crap I'm
talking to them like the whole top of
the phone camera hump and it looks
atrocious it looks really ugly a
fingerprint sensor in the back hoping
that maybe it's a prototype and a look a
little bit difference in person browse
all jazzed up for some naked android
marshmallow after seeing what this phone
looks like i'm not so excited maybe the
new LG Nexus 5 might be the way to go
but what do you guys think of this you
care at the fingerprint sensors on the
back you care about the camera hump
maybe you guys use the droid x2 didn't
mind I'll key your thoughts on it let me
know tell me tell me I'm crazy and if I
am crazy
would you get the white or the black
burn next question comes from always a
champion with the one which Ron says
clever galaxy s6 edge or edge plus did a
video comparing the two and I've been
testing both we prepare for our review I
like to be a spoiler alert here I was
set on the edge plus i love the galaxy
s6 edge of three dash plus we're gonna
be exactly what I wanted but I found
myself preferring the note 5 I love the
curved back i love the extra weight in
it and i still can't find a good reason
for those curves so that's just me but
you'll see more detail about that in our
full review which want to see that
comparison will link to it right here
and down below last but not least Adam
levinstein asks at John for lakers you
ever growing your hair out before yes i
have i keep my hair usually not this
short but short because it is like super
curly and it goes just full fro my poor
son also has got the curls kind of
manifesting destiny at the back of his
head my wife got curly hair so the guys
got got no chance but i keep it short
cuz a I don't really want to comb it and
be not a fan of curl they're like girls
everywhere not not not for me and thank
you guys for watching hope you enjoy
please keep asking questions I'll of
engine Emma Stone my favorite shows I do
every week until next time John render
