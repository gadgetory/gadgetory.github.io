renter and I'm Ron prudent and we're
back not with audience questions or even
with rumors but we've got a much grander
more important topic to discuss got news
news and you're I'm actually talking to
you with your head on your left hand
your privacy on your phone
big news going on right now so here's
the Cliff Notes version of what's been
going on if you want to know more detail
you want to read CEO letters or
magistrates ruling hit the link down
below in early December 2015 there's a
horrible tragedy in San Bernardino
there's a terrorist attacks and there
was a shooting one of the shooters had
an iPhone 5c that the government has
since recovered and certainly wants to
get access to the information on their
phone to see who they work cohorting
with they were texting someone that had
assistance from the outside they were
calling somebody information that the
FBI needs to do their job so Magistrate
Sheri Pym quoting the 1789 all writs act
said it is reasonable for Apple to
create a backdoor way to unlock this
phone and we're talking earlier backdoor
it sounds like a really fancy way of
like you need nine terminals and six
monitors to get access to this phone but
essentially all they're asking Apple to
do is remove the restriction for how
many times you can try a password right
so I'm sure if you guys have friends who
you try to get in their phone and ruin
their lives you use the four pin code to
you know try different things and then
after a certain number of failed
attempts they'll be like wait five
minutes wait 15 minutes and I'll end up
just being like wait five years yeah and
the FBI is basically trying to have
Apple create a system that allows them
to bypass this so they can create a
computer or a bot that will just run an
algorithm or run a code that creates a
exponential number of permutation
combination that allows them to get into
the phone Magistrate Pym is saying
listen I get that it's tricky so we only
want Apple to create this for just one
song but that's in theory and that's
when so Tim Cook went ahead and Apple as
a whole released a public letter to to
us the consumers and customers yeah
saying that while they've supported that
way up until this point which is very
important to say that big distinction to
make yeah they've been extremely helpful
and they've done everything they can to
try to help the case along but Tim Cook
is saying that they're drawing
here in terms of ethics because if they
create this tool it sort of leads down
the rabbit hole of opening this tool up
to anybody and he quoted saying
criminals and yeah and this thing right
now this does not exist not anywhere in
Apple's deep dark skunkworks labs this
doesn't exist you create it once for one
phone the threat of that exploit getting
out and the threat of what it could mean
for security becomes very very
frightening and the big issue to keep in
mind is what presence isn't going to
send if Apple does say ok magistrate PIM
here's the exploit here you go what
about the next case and I understand the
FBI is trying to do their job and trying
to catch horrible human beings so I'm
not even sure what side of the fence I'm
on it'll also lead to other problems
potentially with their shareholders and
customers because it could be a conflict
of interest for shareholders saying that
they're making the product not quite as
good as it could be so they'll sell less
which could be conflict of interest for
them it could do a little drive into
Drive share place prices down exactly
Tim Cook staff do share responsibility
to the shareholders to keep that soft
price as high as you can go exactly and
then you also have lawsuits potential
lawsuits from customers saying that
their privacy is not being protected by
Apple intentionally so it's a very
complex multifaceted issue yeah and like
you said it's it's hard to gauge really
what the right side is the intentions
are all good it's just becoming a very
complex situation with legislation
trying to keep up with the insanely fast
progress of technology yeah and we're
quoting a writ from 1789 and we've been
a country for for 20 odd years at that
point obviously going far back was a
little bit different
magistrates PIMs job is to enforce the
letter of the law and that is currently
the letter of the law so as you think
about what side you're on if they decide
to even beyond take Apple out of the
equation take your feelings of Apple
admittedly a very polarizing company
poison could very easily be Google
easily be Microsoft it could be any
other company and very well probably
will be them next depending on how this
case lays out so you want to know what
you guys think if you're a looker in the
comments stopping a lurker leave a
comment and let us
let us know we genuinely want to have
this conversation with you guys we were
talking about in the office and no one
really sure what side they're on so we
thought maybe let the ask can be
audience and maybe educate the audience
if you don't really know what's going on
so my guys thank you for watching hope
you guys enjoy the sort of a really
fascinating topic that's dominating
these our news right now
fifty video thumbs up we always
appreciate it - next time I am NOT wrong
/ Rita I'm mom / - he's John Ranger see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
