become grown-up so you can you can
deviate this episode 2 of we said yes
you don't know the premise this is where
we say yes so all the emails that come
in for product requests from like
midnight to like 7 or 8 a.m. and then we
pick like the five or so weirdest
strangest products ralpherz over there
can't see them got to pick the products
I have not seen any of these or tested
them yet so figure who knows maybe some
products or merely we wouldn't look at
our good and deserve our attention maybe
some are asinine and silly we don't know
but we said yes we're gonna check them
out alright so let's start with product
number one Ralph
these not air pods are two hundred and
ninety-nine dollars so they are
expensive not air pods but they do a lot
of things that some other products maybe
don't do so it's got was it augmented
hearing your augmented hearing and
there's one thing I like it's things
that are augmented essentially that's
good too
it's gonna let you sort of isolate the
voice if you're like a crowded room and
or nearly you hear ambient noise you
just hear the person's voice so we've
got product safety social stuff and holy
earbuds um you've got pretty much every
size you're a whole that you can think
of here is your charging case open them
up they charge you close it alright so
let's see how they fit clearly labeled
Ellen R so I know which one goes in my
right year-old shouldn't charge them
alright what this shirt should come back
to thank you woods ok so most all right
so while we wait for IQ buds to to
charge or go under product number two
what we got pavlok to uses cravings
breaks bed habits and more integrates
with they have to slack and an Apple
watch what does it do how does do it
vibrates beeps
it shocks you it's a human shot-caller
insert the module into the wristband to
press on the lightning bolts to release
the zap I got everybody here to jump
yeah definitely to be sure okay so we're
I'm product number three we got here
this is mo Phu por la palaca charger
okay
it's a portable app how much is it
$36.99 aim at your app watch all right
it would be cool if this how to make a
battery pack build for this it's nice I
guess but under to change the other
charge a boy
there you go all right so it does
exactly what it says it would do what
you guess is better than a lot of other
products and it comes with little
carabiner so you can attach it to your
pants so it's kind of a nice little
compact way to do it I'm actually gonna
travel with this when I'm I'm using an
iPhone all right mo foo points for you
all right
I have backpacks at the ready what's
next
tap tech keyboard by VIN Epoque VIN Pok
so this is key cap backlit mechanical
switches bluetooth USB and built on
lithium battery so it is a wireless
mechanical keyboard made specifically
for Mac's is the command key well that's
cool user manual
it has are you don't know why we have it
we have razors different switches for
comparison the razor green switch it's
tactile and clicky the razor orang
switch tactile and silent and the razor
yellow switch linear and silent it's
kind of in the middle of the green
switch in the arts which it's not like
crazy Lao like or not you're gonna
slightly know the people next to you but
you're not gonna make them want to throw
you off a building so that was cool
Windows or Mac or Android doesn't have
to be like plugged in they're just
charging it it's wireless
look at the point in them so let's go
ahead you got a personal letter maybe
you two will get a personal letter we
got next
is that we got more boxes safe and sound
not you I trust this for the packaging
all right so we're gonna conduct some
bones product name this is just
information battery life 10 hours
talktime 10 hours charge time 2 hours
boot to the chipset lossless
transmission so bone conduction if you
don't know don't like job or cease to
use it's been around for a long time
then chily uses your your bone to trance
have I look Casey so I got a I got a
scrape off from the paint so the stem on
the left has smartphone controls and
touch bends you can access Siri or
Google assistant or take calls but this
is like the much better equivalent than
being like the Bluetooth headset but
dude who walked around with the you know
the thing in your ear you can't really
tell you'll probably look like a crazy
person actually if you're talking to
somebody and look like you just wearing
sunglasses so stay away from busy
streets where officer directing traffic
but we are gonna have to charge this so
the moral of we said yes number two is
charged everything well
seconds later so we let these charge for
hopefully enough time we're back to the
IQ buds ants get my shot that's touchpad
okay now I can hear you guys really I
can hear myself I like superhuman
hearing now I can totally hear you why
say good whisper something's making me
you so what we learned is I keep us
actually be super human hearing so I can
hear things really well and like ambient
noise I can't hear it kind of sounds
like you have I almost like an echo
music sounds good
obviously I need to pick different size
earbuds make them stay in my ear better
but they're not bad worth the price I
don't know but if you need to hear
people from far away like spy on people
pretty awesome they're good they work as
advertised so hats off to you here they
totally work and they work well so so
we're gonna go from IQ buds to as
matches called it sake sake uh so bad
luck
I don't know you might touch it a
hundred huh
so let's try it let's let's bring the
SAP down to the lowest is 10% now let's
try that don't fit up like a it's like
hey this milk is bad you want to smell
it
everybody hit everybody come trying you
ready where do you want it hep lock your
works the bank kind of sucks but it'll
probably stop you from doing so
all right glass is we're gonna conduct
some bones with boxes connected tie try
calling it sounds kind of distant it
doesn't sound like super clear but like
it's definitely coming through and it
can you can't hear anything mark all
right that's pretty cool I mean they
they 100% work as advertised a little
squirrelly to pair but they work they're
comfortable they're not very heavy I get
these a thumbs up boxes you get a that
this 100% works as advertised so here's
what we learned with we said yes Episode
two sometimes you should just stay
sleeping and not be replying yes emails
at 3:00 a.m. but it does make for a lot
of fun insert introduction to new
products some shocking and your products
ordinarily we wouldn't take a look at if
you liked this video give a thumbs up we
appreciate it
if you have suggestions probably could
do it differently let us know in the
comments down below I'll give you a bit
of a spoiler alert I've already said yes
to a lot more emails that are on their
way from mainland China that should be
in here pretty soon so hit the subscribe
button did a little bell so you get
notified on your phone whenever new
videos come up we got a lot of new stuff
