TechnoBuffalo here with a full review
for you of the google nexus one and
built by HTC you've seen how android 2.1
works you've seen head-to-head videos
with the iPhone you've seen how live
wallpapers function Mouser taking you
through everything about the phone but I
haven't given you a full review on how
it works as a phone how the features
sort of come together into a complete
package so before we get into all that
let's talk about some of these specs it
is a quad-band phone meeting it'll work
on an edge network really anywhere in
the world you are and they bring the US
little work on 18 T or t-mobile's edge
network however it's only going to
function on t-mobile's 3G so no 3G for
AT&amp;amp;T it weighs about four point five
nine ounces it's of course candy bar
form factor it's got a pretty
substantial 1400 milliamp hour battery
with very excessive web usage and
calling I was able to get very easily
add a day and a half out of it so if you
charge your phone every night you're
never gonna have battery issues with the
Nexus One I think the two big selling
points of the device first would
probably be its display its LED it's 3.7
inches and it just looks absolutely
gorgeous with its 480 by 800 resolution
screen and the other really big feature
of it is its processor it just running a
one ting gigahertz Snapdragon processor
by Qualcomm and you really see that
processor on a previous video I did a
network test with the Nexus One versus
the iPhone and we saw network speed wise
at least where I am 18 T's network speed
was almost twice as fast as t-mobile 3G
but the faster processor in the Nexus
One led to the Nexus One rendering pages
a few seconds faster than the iPhone 3GS
did so that processor really can make up
for a slower Network and helps for page
rendering and multitasking which we'll
talk about in a little bit so first this
is a phone it's got to make good phone
calls I tested this on t-mobile's
network and call quality this is
probably some of the best Christmas
calls I have ever used on a cell phone
and if you guys watch my videos you know
I test a lot of self
it was absolutely perfect call quality
it sounded like I was on a landline
people on the other end couldn't hear
any sort of white noise it was caught
qualia again I can't rave enough about
the call quality and that wasn't just
unique to t-mobile I thought maybe it
sounds so good because the t-mobile's
network so I popped in 18 t card and
just on edge the call quality was just
as good so it really is just the phone
and the radio of a combination of the
software works actually fantastically so
if you're worried about using this as a
phone don't is probably some of the best
call quality speaker phone wise it was
pretty average it was loud enough to
hear in a car but you know not let
enough you're gonna deejay a party based
just on the speaker so let's talk about
the operating system this is running a
sort of native build of Android 2.1 it's
the first time that we've even seen
Android 2.1 the previous most newest
version was on the Droid and that was
2.0 and 2.1 brought with it some new
features that I demonstrated in a 2.1
overview video I'll put links to all
those in the sidebar as well I brought
with it live wallpapers it brought with
it some 3d animations that you see here
there's scroll around it brought a new
gallery and a ton of other sort of cool
features but some of the things I find
most useful about 2.1 is the ability to
jump from home screen to home screen 2.1
also gives you the ability to have five
home screens and scrolling back and
forth can be quite a bit of a pants if
you hold down on these little buttons
you get a deck of card sort of
reminiscent of Palm webOS click on one
of them and you jump right to that home
screen
I've admittedly not an Android user I've
tested many Android phones the iPhone is
my daily driver but I have to say I'm
really enjoyed using Android 2.1 I first
tested Android on the original t-mobile
g1 and it felt very raw but you can see
the operating system had a lot of
potential and I think with 2.1 we're
starting to see that potential realized
and Android has become matured into make
fantastic operating system and one that
would be happy and proud to use on a
daily basis it really offers a of
fantastic features it's got a growing
app catalog
it's got some multitasking and stuff new
group right here next is one of gorgeous
screen
and you really choose from a variety of
form factors there's a ton of Android
devices out there however the Nexus One
is definitely the flagship and I think
everything comes together really nicely
on the device a few other things that
make the phone really easy to use and
navigate as this speech-to-text anywhere
that there's a text field and I
demonstrated this again in the previous
video there's a little microphone and
you go ahead and tap that and you can
start talking and it really goes ahead
and translates any text that you're
saying nice and easily and it works very
well
the on-screen keyboard also worked very
well auto corrects and features are just
fantastic and I found that to be just
easy to type on as any other on-screen
keyboard so if you're worried about the
Nexus One the lack of a physical
keyboard that's me people who's drawn
you to a droid don't worry this one is
really easy to get used to and the fact
that the screen is so large may turn the
same portrait mode and start typing it's
just absolutely fantastic I mean the
keyboard is huge while you're typing and
there's that little microphone I was
talking about not a problem at all when
it comes to comes with typing so one of
the problems that I've had with the
device and this is really one of the
well small problems I've had you guys
may have seen this happen in videos is
the responsiveness of these capacitive
buttons down below oftentimes I try and
tap them they don't always work see
right there took a few times yet to
sometimes hit it either with your thumb
right in the middle or really make sure
that you make a permanent press
sometimes it just doesn't work so right
here if I just sort of tap it it doesn't
work but I go ahead and hit it hard
you'll see right there that it popped up
so it's not always see right they're not
always the most responsive it's more of
an annoyance it's certainly nothing that
would prevent me from buying the phone
but it's doubly something to keep in
mind and speaking of buying the phone if
you want to get this unlocked to use on
the carrier of your choice so you can
use that ett with just edged or popping
a t-mobile card and you're off to go on
their 3G network get ready to a good
five hundred and fifty bucks if you're
new t-mobile customer you can sign up
for one and get subsidized down to 170
and there are some other pricing off
reserve in between for upgrades but
you're gonna run the gamut nearly as
high as 550 or as low as 170 now 550 is
a really high price point
I think that what the next is one you're
getting probably one of the best
smartphones out there on the market it
is absolutely fantastic now I mentioned
that I'm an iPhone user and I know
there's gonna be a lot of iPhone versus
Nexus One comments but I've gotten very
used to multi-touch I know a lot of you
out there may have gotten used to
multi-touch as well and that is one
feature that I really miss on the Nexus
One that's how you won't be touch in the
browser now if you're having an Android
user Europe really for the past few
years even for had multi-touch you're
not gonna be missing anything
however if you're thinking about moving
from an iPhone that's like gonna be a
feature that you're really going to wish
was there whether you're browsing the
web or using Google Maps that'd be
something that I personally miss would
it prevent me from buying this phone
absolutely not the rock processor and
processing speed and the beautiful
display are more than enough to make up
for the lack of multi-touch just
something to keep in mind this is
probably one of my favorite phones are
texts that I've really enjoyed using it
I'm like a definitely envision using
this on a daily basis everything on the
phone just works well Android has really
come together and come into its own as a
very very viable smartphone alternative
to say the iPhone to blackberry to
Windows Mobile if it's full exchange
support it can also be a very powerful
business device so can really run from
being a teenage device to being a
c-level executive it's gonna just really
sort anybody in there again this is
probably one of my favorite phones that
I've tested my three favorite phones
that I've got I've use got to be the
iPhone 3GS the Nexus One and the Palm
Pre are definitely my three favorite and
I'd be happy to use any of those and
that says quite a bit on a one to five
scale i give the nexus one a very very
very very strong 4.75 really taking off
just a little bit for lack of
multi-touch if I never been used to
multi-touch this would definitely would
have been a five star review
I couldn't be happier with the phone
size-wise it's a big screen but it's a
really thin package for the couch thin
it is I mean it makes the iPhone look
downright fat I mean just really thick
phone the camera I saw I did a video on
the
camera quality as well 5 megapixel
sensor takes great pictures the video
was really solid the LED flash works
quite well and sort of low light
situations by definitely not going to
want to blow this up and put it on your
wall but for a cell phone the camera and
video quality is definitely among the
best and build quality being an HTC
device is really strong it just doesn't
feel like it's gonna break it's got a
really nice feel in the hand I mean it
feels good in your pocket as well I've
never used the trackball here phone
could have very easily gone without it
I'm not necessarily sure why it was
included but if you like a trackball you
see I have the option for another way to
navigate through the my only complaints
again it would be the lack of
multi-touch which who knows why Google
did include that some other Android
devices have it and these capacitive
buttons but at this point that's really
just nitpicking on otherwise absolutely
fantastic device again I can't recommend
the Nexus One enough if you're in the
market for a new smartphone and you guys
hope you enjoyed I'm John Rhett enger'
