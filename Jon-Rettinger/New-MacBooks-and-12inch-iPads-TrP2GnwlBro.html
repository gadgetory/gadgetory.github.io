to you by harry's hello everybody
welcome at the preserve of rumor roundup
the title of the show should give it
away but it's the show we take all them
freaking tech rumors from the week and
then we're quite a few and I picked the
three to four I think are the most
interesting that you guys would want to
know about up this week we've got a
thinner macbook air a just stupid dry
Norma's iPad might be coming and the
Moto G to this is Miranda what's the
start rounding them cute rumors up and
paying them and loving them so according
to the folks at digit times which listen
I know we're about as reliable as me my
uncle who drinks too much but supposedly
apples gearing up to launch a thinner
macbook air either towards end of this
year which is quickly coming up early
2015 didn't specifically say the macbook
air by name but it's likely apples going
to use the thickness of that model
instead of the macbook pro which offers
way beefier set of hardware specs the
times didn't fried really any
information on the alleged macbook and
how thin it might be we've long expected
a macbook air with retina display to
launch sometime this year so maybe put
those two together and it'll launch the
better screen in thinner design
certainly would make sense though for
the macbook air to get thinner and
thinner we've seen pcs you'd have gotten
thinner and thinner guys like Lenovo are
making just laptops that are like you
can't even see them when they go
Saturday's like they're only 2d but
Apple lesser the macbook air was the
standard for thinness and now i don't
know maybe look at all on the chubby
side not actually a chubby maybe it
looks like it had like a really good
christmas dinner it's not fat by any
means but looks like it could probably
lose a few pounds that that that's
probably what the macbook air is like
now it just should lay off the chicken
he probably said a lot of things about
the ipad you probably said i like to
browse on it i like to check the
internet on and i watch youtube videos
on it have you ever said i wish it was
freaking gigantic cuz if you have maybe
you're gonna be in luck so giant ipads
might be coming very students one of
those familiar apple rumors that just
seem to not die bloomberg on tuesday
reported that apple is on the cusp of
releasing soon
only two larger inch iphone models but
also its fabled 12.9 inch ipad early
next year that just sink in for a second
yeah the same device we've heard about
again again again again that talked
about on the show again again again but
looks like it might actually be coming
so citing people with knowledge of the
matter Bloomberg says Apple suppliers
already prepping to manufacture the just
just iPad fat which will be larger than
any of apples existing mobile devices
Bloomberg makes no mention of how this
fatty fatty fat divide he'll differ from
apples current crop of tablets I heard
it could feature a 2k display Bloomberg
notes the larger iPad has been an apple
pie tins for at least a year as a
company looks to shake up a tablet
lineup it's still one of apple's
flagship products the ipad sales a
slipped a little bit probably dude and
cheaper Android competitors we're
expecting new ipad models sometime this
fall though and the rumor to kind of
only change in a marginal way so listen
before anybody jumps up my throat or
like John John John you suck you always
say more options equals more better I
know I know I say that but so tell me
who what's the use of essentially 13
inch iPad like gonna be like hey look at
this this video that's just just
gigantic I wanted to say though here's
where I think a big iPad could make
sense if if it runs a touch version of
OS tani probably say to yourself John
Apple didn't said they were going to
make in a touch version of OS 10 and we
have no indication that OS 10 is going
to many touch features and Qi say Apple
could be doing some stuff behind the
scenes remember when Apple switch from
powerpc to Intel Steve Jobs came up on
stage and said a West End live in a
double life it's also encoded for Intel
and their people are like what we didn't
know that so that could make sense
touchscreen OS 10 I'll be I totally get
that but just a gigantic iPad I don't
want to play Angry Birds having to hold
it like this just my thoughts on it
maybe I'm wrong if you think you could
use the iPad tell me but you would need
you to gigantic pants to put that in
your pocket where does a backpack this
week i may get noses in 13 inches but
let you know big bag they cook set to
thank our friends at harry's if you are
a basketball fan or like James Harden
you know the term fear the beard but I
say the beer just freaking fear you
because my friends at harrys they are
less than one year old they are already
disrupting the shaving industry and
knocking it from its feet on dudes but
offering a way better experience than
these shaving giants already out there
the company makes awesome amazing
quality german-engineered blades and
they're like hey you know what we like
the stuff so much we're going to freakin
by the factory just all the factory is
ours now Jeff one of their co-founders
is also one of the dudes behind Warby
Parker which does a pretty awesome job
with glasses Brandon breaking love them
emphasize design meticulous
craftsmanship amazing value and really
good customer service which is important
nowadays check out Harry's com use promo
code techno to say five bucks on your
first purchase 15 bucks is going to get
you a set that includes a handle three
blades shaving cream shipped right to
your door so they don't have to put on
pants to go out there even offer a
custom and grooving option to engrave
your nishal on your razor so make the
beard jump off your face run away scared
because Harry's is coming for it alright
let's jump from the gigantic to this
smaller the Moto G to Motorola I think
we define what a budget smartphone could
be with the Moto G now it looks like the
company is gearing up to announce a
follow-up to the appropriately named
moto g2 at a press event set for later
on next week one earlier leak offered us
a few details and tidbits surrounding
the budget-friendly handset along with
two photos boom of the alleged screen
but I knew leak reveals way more about
the g2 like spec see design so the leak
comes from hello moto HK a Facebook
account that's built up a pretty baller
reputation for leaking moto news so the
new report claims the g2 will offer a
thinner bezel and upgrade 8 megapixel
rear camera front facing speakers
microsd support for added storage booyaa
also backed up earlier claims the screen
could jump from 4.5 inches to 5 inches
by my keen math that's half an inch
bigger we still don't know what the
resolution is going to be upset larger
screen hopefully that Motorola can still
keep the moto g2 price down low despite
all these upgrades I'll be willing to
pay maybe a little bit more to
importance out to be true I'm expecting
to get a full run next week during
Motorola's press events but it's
possible the mid-range
phone could be overshadowed by the Moto
360 and the stillroom bird Moto X plus 1
which is going to be super awesome
either way that we're going to korean
outfit from chicago and we can't wait to
see what Moto's got up their sleeve and
we'll be there so stay tuned to
