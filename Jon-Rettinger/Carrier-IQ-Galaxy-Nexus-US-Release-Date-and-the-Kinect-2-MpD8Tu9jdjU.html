brought to you by carbonite what does a
company called Carrier IQ know about you
yeah you right there they're watching
you when is the Samsung Galaxy Nexus Ice
Cream Sandwich phone finally coming to
the United States in the form of a
verizon wireless version of the device
and will the next version of Microsoft
Kinect be able to read lips hopefully
better than my bad cut glue movie
impression round them up it's Tecna
Buffalo's room around them
hey what is going on everybody happy
friday and happy december to you it's
techno buffalos rumor roundup Ranma on
revision3 my name is Noah Kravitz
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo and
this episode of the rumor roundup for
the week ending today Friday December
second 2011 this brought to you by our
friends at Carbonite hey by the way
shameless self-promotion check out this
past tuesday's episode of tekzilla on
revision3 there's a very very handsome
and well-spoken special guest and after
his segment i was on there talking about
the 29er map with patrick norton at a
great time patrick was awesome and you
know watched the show for Patrick and
Veronica and the rest of the segment's
you already know about twenty dollar man
anyway good fun check out tekzilla it's
a great program now on to the roundup
who is carrier IQ and why should you
care because they might be watching you
I always feel like somebody's watching
that song anyway Carrie right Q you
probably never heard of them before this
week if at all and now they're all over
the blogosphere they're a company that
makes software that its stated function
is to gather performance data other
analytics data on smartphones and report
back to carriers so the carriers can
optimize the performance of their
network their devices etc etc they made
news this week because a developer named
Trevor Eckhart discovered that his
android phone was running this software
without his knowledge and may actually
have been capturing everything from the
phone numbers of the people he was
calling and texting to his keystrokes
web browsing history and other highly
personal stuff Eckhart posted a video to
the interwebs it got picked up all over
the place including by our own adriana
lee you can check out her article on the
story and since then everybody from the
tech blogs to barney frank has gotten
involved asking carrier IQ what exactly
are you guys up to now the deal seems to
be that the software has been installed
on some but not all smartphones recent
smartphones from hardware manufacturers
including nokia HTC and
other Android smartphone makers
blackberry and Apple the hardware
companies who've spoken have basically
categorically denied that they've ever
installed the software themselves that
leaves the carrier's in question looks
like carrier IQ you know you'd make
sense from the name looks like that
their software is installed by carriers
after they get the devices from the OEMs
but before they sell them to you and me
and that guy down the street so where
does this leave us we don't really know
and that's the rumor part of all this
carrier IQ hasn't said anything other
than to send a cease-and-desist letter
to Eckhart demanding that he pulled down
his video and all his blog postings on
the subject the eff came to Eckhart's
aid and very quickly got the cease and
sis later rescinded and again the media
coverage is blown up since then but
aside from that we haven't heard from
Carrier IQ we don't know what they're
really doing if anything we don't know
how sinister this is or isn't so the
rumor is that if you've got a modern
smartphone your every move might be
being tracked it's just a rumor from now
but it's one worth paying attention to
stay tuned TechnoBuffalo we will have
the latest on the story as it unfolds
speaking of smartphones the Galaxy Nexus
is the flagship device for the new
version of Google's Android operating
system android 4.0 ice cream sandwich
made by samsung the Nexus has already
launched over in Europe but it's yet to
be found in the United States why well
could be a number of reasons including a
bug related to the volume control that
was found on the european version of the
device after Lodge and Samsung is now
working on fixing whatever the case the
launch date for the phone in the US on
verizon wireless has been a moving
target first it was around Thanksgiving
then it was december 8th now the latest
is december 11th again this is just
rumor land there was never actually a
ship date or a pre-order date announced
by the carrier's but the latest rumor of
course comes from a screenshot that may
or may not be legit supposedly taken
from a Best Buy internal retail database
management system this screenshot which
isn't posted on the web of course that's
what we're doing we're a web show it's
about rooms on the web this screenshot
shows the galaxy nexus for verizon in
stores on december 11
there's a catch though and the catch is
that it also lists some specifications
including the physical dimensions of the
phone that don't quite line up with the
specs already published by Samsung so
what gives is the verizon version going
to be a little bit different or the
specs just off in the database or just a
total photoshop job that's just the
latest and a whole bunch of made-up
stuff by people who really just want the
darn phone because it's supposed to be
the greatest Android phone ever I don't
know December 11th Best Buy that's the
date we have now it's as good as
anything else until verizon or somebody
comes forward and says this is the
actual date this is the actual price
this is when you can actually get one
and use it on our LTE network in the
United States stay tuned fingers crossed
it'll be sooner than later you know
computer disasters eventually happen to
everybody if you've got a computer and
who doesn't these days disaster is going
to strike it might be in the form of a
virus infecting your system it might be
in the form of theft or if you like me
it might come in the form of mr.
butterfingers dropping your laptop onto
a concrete sidewalk yeah ouch not good
but if you get carbonite online backup
before disaster strikes there's no need
to worry because you're irreplaceable

off-site and the best part is it's easy

and last but not least is the next
version of Microsoft's Kinect going to
be able to do everything from read your
lips to sense your moods maybe according
to a report published earlier this week
tracked down by our own video game
editor joey davidson microsoft is hard
at work on connect to which might be a
standalone unit like the current connect
or it might be built in to the next
version of their Xbox gaming hardware
now all of the stuff this is said in the
rumor mill said to be on tap for release
next year and Microsoft is giving a
keynote address at CES in Las Vegas in
January which is like a month away we'll
be there by the way like I don't know 85
of us you're going to go cover the show
you need as many people as possible at
CES will be there a bunch of the other
rev3 folks would be there it's going to
be a blast we're going to have video
more video than you can keep up with a
promise because in Vegas it's like you
never sleep you just you know cover the
tech show anyway next version of Connect
is said to have a refined more precise
optical and auditory tracking system
that can do everything from read lips to
sense changes in pitch to somehow put
all that together to detect your moods
I'm just seeing now I'm gonna be playing
dance dance what's it called Dance
Central and it's going to be like your
mood is spastic your route is grumpy
your mood is spastic your mood is grumpy
you can't dance you can't dance you
can't dance you know I know that already
but it's more fun when a computer tells
you anyway we don't know much yet about
the system except that it's coming and
you know it's going to be bigger and
better than the current version because
that's how it always happens so stay
tuned for that whether you know whether
you're a PlayStation guy or an xbox gal
or Nintendo person doesn't matter it's
interesting stuff to follow so Joey has
got the latest news on all the goings on
in the video game world including the
latest connect rumors over on
technobuffalo so be sure to check that
out all right that's it for me from a
windy windy windy Oakland California
