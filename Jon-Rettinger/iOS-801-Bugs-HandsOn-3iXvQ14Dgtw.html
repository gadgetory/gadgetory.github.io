technobuffalo here eight-point Oh point
one is here to fix a lot of the bugs
that been playing iOS 8 but reports are
bringing a ton amour with it including
touch ID not working and getting rid of
that cell phone signal that we need to
make phone calls we've got eight point 0
and solve our Vice shirts go ahead and
test it and install you point 0 point 12
if you see any differences so the update
just finished we typed in the password
to enable touch ID and right off the bat
it says searching we don't see our
t-mobile service let's try to chide e we
haven't tried it yet that doesn't seem
like a good sign touch ID is not working
so go ahead and unlock the device there
are very secret password let's go ahead
and try and put a new thumb and maybe
that's the problem go to touch ID and
passcode so I add the fingerprints go
ahead and delete this delete fingerprint
let's go ahead and try and add a new one
maybe that was an issue unable to
complete touch ID set up please go back
and try again so here is confirmation
that iOS 8.1 is not only breaking touch
ID but also no cell service two very
important things that need to be tested
before an OS update is pushed out touch
ID maybe not a necessity to use your
phone but this is a phone without cell
service if you have tmobile another
carrier that abels Wi-Fi calling you can
still make Wi-Fi calls but you can nap
sign of a Wi-Fi network you are going to
be in a world of trouble wouldn't be
surprised to see iOS 8.1 to hit later
