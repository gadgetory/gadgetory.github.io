and every day it feels like there is
some new phone in our hands or some new
high-tech gadget trying to make our
lives smarter and it can be difficult to
keep up with all the tech news that
clogs your social feed on a daily basis
but we want to change that I'm gonna be
here every Tuesday and Thursday going
beyond the headlines and giving you the
information about the three biggest tech
stories that you really need to know
about keep an eye on the upper right
hand of the screen there'll be a number
up there that'll tell you which story
Ron and how much time is left in each
segment all right
let's do this I'm Robert isn't felled
and here's ballooning
Apple may not be teaching the lightning
port for USB see on the next generation
of iPhones but a new rumor suggests the
company is moving in the right direction
new photos claimed to show an
engineering prototype of the new power
adapter coming with the new fleet of
iPhones with a regular two prongs on the
front and on the back a USB C port
instead of the traditional USB a port
that we've seen for the past decade
suggesting the next iPhone will come
with a lightning to USB C cable in the
Box the swap to type C from Taipei
definitely makes sense even for Apple
the MacBook and MacBook Pros don't have
a single type a port on them and we're
seeing more and more laptop
manufacturers following in Apple's
footsteps so this new cable would
eliminate the need for a dongle just to
charge your new iPhone of course
swapping out the Lightning port in favor
of USB C altogether makes the most sense
for everybody but let's be honest this
is Apple we know it's probably not gonna
happen and that's just the way it is if
this new power adapter is the real deal
we'll see it launch alongside at least
one new iPhone this fall a glitch
affecting a small number of Samsung
phone owners is doing something odd and
creeping people out multiple reports
across Reddit and Samsung's own forums
claimed that a small number of users are
having photos from their media gallery
sent to random people on their contacts
list without their permission and even
without a trace of the message being
sent on the phone itself one Reddit user
said his s9 sent his entire photo
gallery to his girlfriend on its own
while he slept
the mysterious bug seems to mainly be
affecting customers with an S 9 or an S
sign plus for also hearing reports of
this happening on Note eights as well
many are speculating this manage you
with t-mobile's recent switch from SMS
over to the new mobile messaging
standard our CS p'tee mobile says hey
this is not our issue and you need to
talk to Samsung Samsung did release a
statement saying their tech teams are
looking into the issue and for a
temporary fix users should take
samsung's messaging app and revoke its
permissions to access local device
storage and the next generation of iPads
are coming sooner than you may think
and if the rumors are true I'll be
taking some major design cues from the
iPhone 10 some developers did some
sleuthing into iOS 12 and found that
avatar kits the software behind nmo G's
and emojis are optimized and ready for
the
but they're so requiring that treat up
the camera system to actually work this
follows recent rumors we've been hearing
that the new line of iPads will ditch
the touch ID fingerprint sensor
altogether and follow the iPhone 10 by
adding to treetop camera system and face
ID as its replacement whether or not
we'll see an iPad with a notch is still
unknown
we've seen some renders with one and
some without honestly both concepts look
really cool and it'll be interesting to
see what Apple actually does decide to
do and we haven't really seen any iPad
pro updates in a while so it's not out
of the question that we could see these
new iPads and launched alongside a new
iPhone and a September event but whether
or not that happens the fall seems like
the obvious time for a refresh so now
it's your turn we want you guys to be a
part of the lowdown do you have a
comment on a story mentioned today send
us a short video messages like 30
seconds or less with your thoughts on a
story over to us on Twitter or Instagram
for your chance to be featured on the
next episode the lowdown just like this
guy John for Lakers and ho but for named
Phyllis sounds familiar
what's going on Berto I'm Jon and there
are some pictures in my samsung phone
that I don't want sent I want to send my
pictures I want them to be sent on
purpose or perhaps late at night
accidentally but I don't want my phone
do it on its own
Samsung better make this right that's
what I got to say alright guys that's
all I've got today thank you so much for
watching this first episode the lowdown
I sincerely appreciate it I'll see you
guys back here on Thursday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
