technobuffalo here and i want to give
you a full recap of all the great things
that came on the Apple back to mac event
so without further ado let's go ahead
and get started so if you see me look
down so I got some notes in front of me
the conference just ended I will start
at the beginning when Steve Jobs came on
stage and talked about the state of the
mac thirty-three percent of revenue was
the actual Mac hardware the computers
which accounted for 22 billion dollars
quite a lot so the first product they
announced was I life 2011 it's gonna
have all the same apps so iphoto imovie
iWeb GarageBand and the like it's also
going to have a brand new iphoto
certainly all the apps are going to be
revamped they showed a ton of new iphoto
features that's gonna have a new full
screen mode it's gonna facebook
enhancements actually going to pull down
your facebook picture just kind of cool
it's gonna be able to email photos out
its gonna have better book creation and
printing so when you want to make albums
it's gonna have this new letterpress
cards this new way to send greeting
cards to friends and family especially
with the holidays coming up kind of neat
they showed imovie 11 you're going to
get better audio editing you're now
going to get audio effects which are
kind of neat all with the same sort of
one click easy editing that we've seen
with previous generations of imovie
you're also going to have a one-stop
effect which is kind of neat so some new
effects you're going to be built in
there it's also going to have new sports
teams you're also gonna be able to
easily create trailers for your movies
so family goes on vacation and you want
to show your grandma quick few minutes
what you're going to do you can create
sort of almost cinematical looking movie
trailers kind of neat little gimmicky
i'm sure it'll get over used on youtube
sure all over is it on you to make sure
garage band it's got a new flex time
feature it's got some new groove
maintaining stuff it's God's from the
guitar am since the new tutorials great
the next new thing they show they didn't
go through the rest of the ilife out but
they're all presumably updated it's also
going to be available on today by the
way it's going to be forty nine dollars
to upgrade is gonna come on all new macs
for free next thing they showed was
FaceTime finally face times coming as a
desktop
application for Mac so you can use your
mac in your webcam to talk to anyone
who's got a iphone 4 or a new ipod touch
to get your face time on which is really
cool and I wish I had when I was in high
school um but it's just a really nice
feature it probably should've been there
from day one it certainly augments and
adds to the ability to have facetime
actually now you're not tied to just
being a device advice you can now talk
to someone desktop to device which is
really cool for international folks you
a friend overseas or you're overseas
traveling you want to talk to your
parents your girlfriend your wife
whatever it might be this is now a
really cool way to do it without haven't
have a computer in front you're at least
both of you having to have a computer in
front of you kinda neat the next thing
they showed it was the reason there was
a lion on the back to mac invite it gave
a sneak preview of the next version of
OS 10 OS 10.7 which is going to be
called lion kicking up the same theme of
the cat naming so we've had Puma Jaguar
Panther tiger leopard snow leopard and
now lion who so they showed some of the
new features that are going to coming
out and lion not all of them but some of
them so we're gonna have sort of iOS
like features the whole reason behind
the back to the mac was that OS 10 gave
birth I suppose to web are to uh I OS
iOS sort of went on over to the ipad
which came or desktop like and it comes
full back around our iOS is going to be
influencing the desktop application so
how is good influence desktop
application perhaps you're asking I can
hear you asking well you are now I'm
going to have full multi-touch gestures
for built into the trackpad more than we
have in the past so multi-touch gestures
that worked on the iphone or ipad will
work on the mac but they're not going to
work in the way you'd expected the
multi-touch screen which Apple said they
tried and really didn't work they said
just didn't function quite properly in a
vertical orientation having to stretch
your arm el time said you got arm
fatigue who knows i think we also would
affect hinges on a laptop which we will
talk about a bit later so all the
multi-touch niss is going to be done on
the magic mouse on the magic trackpad
and on the multi-touch trackpad
on your laptop's they're also announcing
and this thing is going to just print
money is a new desktop app store so
you're not going to get just sort of the
game type things and the light
applications that maybe you get on the
iPhone or iPod touch if you're going to
get full application so you can download
pages or full desktop yuta apps right on
this app store which is kind of neat
they're going to be in full screen the
apps will sort of auto auto update like
they you on the iphone and ipod touch
I'll just kind of neat you're going to
have a one-click payment you're going to
have free and paid apps they're going to
give the bell for seventy percent
something within you are exactly they do
now at the current app store model all
apps you buy the license to all mac so
if you buy a nap in one spot and you
have a laptop as well on by on your
desktop you'll be able to use it there
as well and all these new apps and stuff
we're going to go into something new
called a launchpad not the silly pilot
from ducktales I just probably dated
myself so let's talk about launchpad and
what sort of goes into that there's a
new feature sort of built into that
called Mission Control bishop controls
glad you view everything on your Mac it
sort of integrates expose spaces and
sort of all those content viewing
applications on the map you're going to
get a full screen grid you can create
folders much like you can't on your iPad
I think of it as a way that you look at
your icons on your iPad or iPhone sort
of in rows gonna have that same option
to view your apps they can set them up
by category River you like on your
desktop you go ahead and create folders
as well I'll just kind of neat you can
view things by clusters like like
windows so you have a ton of Safari have
to open all the Safari have to be
clustered together to feel whole bunch
your Word documents open those will be
cluster together and such which is kind
of neat and it's going to be coming
summer 2011 so odds are gonna be the
very end of summer 2011 a kind of neat
but the App Store idea it's going to be
built into lion sounds so cool that
Apple said they're going to be bringing
it to snow upper and we will have it
within 90 days this thing is you Joe
going to make apple probably a bajillion
or at least a quarter of a bajillion
dollars all right and there was one more
thing to the surprise of no one but
still very high on the cool factor the
macbook air got a tremendous refresh and
this thing is now really kind of cool so
let me go ahead and run through the
specs and there was no manila envelope
that was pulled out of unfortunately all
right so let's go ahead and talk about
the macbook air at its thickest point
it's point six eight inches thick which
is super tiny at its thinnest point it's
point 11 inches thick weighs two point
nine pounds got a full-size keyboard
it's got a 13.3 inch screen backlit LED
with a display of 1440 x 900 so super
high resolution it's got a core two duo
chip in it so reasonably well powered
nvidia geforce 320m multi-touch trackpad
but similar to let's say the ipad for
example it's going to have instant on
it's also going to have no optical drive
and no hard drive it's going to use
flash storage sort of the first time
that we've really seen this use in the
mainstream so no more SSD sort of
container you have pure flash storage
built into a computer which should make
for increased speeds which is kind of
neat it's going to get seven hours of
battery life on web user just 27 hours
of actual usage it you're going to get
and you're going to get a whopping 30
days of standby time but the 13.3 inch
macbook air isn't the only macbook air
that was announced the rumors of a 11.6
macbook air the little brother to the
bigger guy are true and we've got an
11.6 macbook air it's gonna wait 2
points 3 pounds it's gonna have the same
core to do a family a bit lower powered
than what we have in the 13.3 macbook
air it's got the same nvidia graphics
that we saw in the bigger macbook air so
that's a geforce 320m up it's gonna have
pretty nice size storage too it's going
to start at let's talk about price is
actually the 11.6 is going to have a 64
gigabytes flash storage you can up that
to 128 and add two hundred dollars going
to have a one-point
4 gigahertz processor is going to start
at nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars
the 13.3 is gonna start 1299 1.86
gigahertz core 2 duo processor of 128
gig standard you can up at 256 for 1599
you're going to be available today so
what do you guys think are you excited
are you going to go out there and get
one or you're not going to go out there
and get one on the 999 sort of entry
price point puts it a few hundred
dollars above the highest SPECT iPad and
a few hundred dollars more than a higher
level netbook you're going to get a lot
more features I'm pretty excited to get
my hands on these and see what they look
like obviously gives you guys hands on
opinions I'm really curious to know what
you guys think about all of these new
products that were announced excited not
