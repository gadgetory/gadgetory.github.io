to you by Atlassian what's going on
everyone John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo
here they're a ton of awesome smartphone
to choose from and the two of my
favorites are the galaxy s7 edge and the
Nexus 6p so we had a lot of questions we
did ask the Buffalo to put these two
head-to-head and see which one I would
pick or which one could be right for you
let's jump right in
I'm not gonna focus is too much on specs
both are incredibly fast phones if
you're the kind of person though that
wants to have the absolute latest needs
the highest number on the processor you
go for the s7 s7 edge Snapdragon 820 is
gonna beat the 810 any day of the week
but in actual usage how a normal person
will use the phone both are incredibly
fast let's start with why you would want
to get the s7 edge over the 6p the first
big reason is the edge and the edge
means the phone's gonna look absolutely
gorgeous and some questionable utility
but it's curvy it's beautiful that's
gonna look nice sitting on your desk the
big one though for a lot of people is
going to be expandable storage Samsung
brought that back with the current gen
of s7 line of devices it's here the
expandable storage not gonna get that on
the 6p aside from expandable storage
ip68 I think is the biggest reason to
pick up the s7 or the s7 edge over the
6p if you're finding stuff out in the
rain don't even take your phone in the
pool or you secondly drop in the toilet
you'd be happy that it's there next a
5.5 inch screen what might share the
resolution for 6p is absolutely
incredible to see it is the best screen
I have ever tested on a phone when it
just looks absolutely gorgeous
that's sweet tender camera on the back
12 megapixel sensor takes incredible
pictures 4k video look absolutely
awesome if you want one of the best
cameras on the market look no farther
than at the s7 and s7 edge an oddly
sized despite only being point two
inches screen size smaller than the 5.7
screen online at the 6p it is a much
smaller phone so if you don't have giant
pockets or maybe you wear skinny jeans
or tight dude pants we can appreciate
how thin the s7 edge is going to feel
not only in a hand but also in your
pocket what about the 6p it's no slouch
there are plenty of reasons to love this
naked Android phone and that's the first
reason naked Android you're going to get
stock Android as Google intended which
is an incredible boon for some people
not to mention how a customization you
can do when you root your device say
what you will about Samsung how great
the camera is and how wonderful the
phone could feel it is not
gonna get the updates that the next line
of phones are going to have you on
Android and day it comes out you're
gonna need one of these guys might not
even get it on the Samsung devices so if
you want the latest updates go with the
Nexus what about IO that single port on
the bottom USB see is the future
Samson doesn't have it but it's right
here on the Nexus if you want to take
advantage of Google's incredible service
projects five you're going to need a
nexus phone 6p can do it not gonna cut
it
on the galaxy s7 a few things that don't
qualify into either more of a personal
preference finger from your location if
you like it on the back
6p if you want it on the front you're
gonna want the s7 s7 edge so to pick
which phone to get honestly it's gonna
come down to a coin flip if you want the
updates you want naked Android can't
beat the Nexus line if you want the
latest hardware in a beautiful package
and go for the s7 edge for me though
looks like the s7 edge is gonna be the
phone that would pick up today these are
arguably two of the most impressive
phones on the market you can't go wrong
with either of them but which one's
gonna be right for you are you in team
and need the immediate updates are you
in team I want the incredible camera and
the beauty of the s7 edge leave your
comments down below mash that thumbs up
button rose appreciate it to the next
time I'm John render for TechnoBuffalo
see you next video
so after I just compared two phones I
like to kick my feet back up do some
collaboration with JIRA and I always got
to go to it lassie and for that let's
say you need to collaborate like you got
people all over the country in the world
you can do that with Atlassian you can
assign track and manage tasks for any
project no matter how it complex you can
create and share content organize
results and bring team members up to
speed with confluence in semesters your
video chat with your team from any
device that's a freedom of HipChat
text review and manage code in real time
that's the power of bitbucket boot
Atlassian comm to learn more so you can
collaborate anywhere you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
