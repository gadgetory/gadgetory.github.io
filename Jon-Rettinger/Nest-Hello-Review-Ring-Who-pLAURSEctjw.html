decide which smart home platform I want
to invest in primarily choosing between
the two obvious ones Amazon Alexis
ecosystem in Google's home I tried to
straddle the line between being agnostic
but eventually I just had a pick one and
I settled on the Google home Mini
because 29 bucks sale was a killer deal
and give him the way at holiday season
for pretty much anything and also being
a Google or alphabet entity he was
pretty tightly integrated so in the
hello doorbell was announced I was
pretty pumped but I wasn't overly
interested since I already had a ring
Pro but the hello adds some new features
that I think made it stand far and above
the ring so I took the plunge saying
hello to the store Bell means saying
goodbye to 229 bucks it's not cheap I'm
not gonna cover insulation too much the
nest app does a really great job of
walking you through it took me about 30
ish minutes to do if you want a
step-by-step guide we'll link to one
down below it's pretty simple though
even if you aren't that handy after you
install it's gonna integrate to nest app
like any other nest product and as
someone with seven nest cams it's super
nice to have all my cameras heavily
integrated into one app from there you
get free access to the cams live feed
push alerts in three hours recorded
history but I would definitely factor in
the extra five bucks a month or $50 per
year for nests aware subscription it's a
bit annoying to have to pay more if you
had just shelled out 230 bucks on a
doorbell but it's well worth it and with
that you're gonna get 24/7 and video
recording saved clips ability to set
activity zones and five days of video
recording they're gonna give you a 30
day free trial though if you want to
give it a shot speaking of recording
when it record 's the fee it's not going
to record your voice for having a
two-way conversation with someone just
their voice it's a small annoyance but I
thought it was worth mentioning so
another nice thing is the ability for
the hello to say some pre-recorded
messages like we're not home please
leave the packages and a few more it's
really helpful if when I'm in meetings
and I can't talk directly what it
doesn't have those ability to pre-record
my own messages in my voice hopefully
that'll come with a future software
update the hello has a few neat tricks
up its sleeve but perhaps the most
useful its ability to recognize faces
and announce the names that come to the
door and I know that sounds a bit creepy
but it's not gonna like pick
out of the air you have to manually
input someone's name when the doorbell
sees a person let's you know and you can
select their face and put that name and
and in theory when they come to the door
to get an alert saying that person is at
your door I've had the hello installed
for just about two weeks now and it's
finally starting to alert me to people
despite me and putting their name during
the very first few days that I have the
hello doorbell I'd wager there's some
machine learning happening there but do
you know that recognition is not to be
instantaneous and it's not going to
always work it's that hard time telling
faces when someone's wearing a hat or
sunglasses on usually just telling me
it's somebody new
like any video doorbell push alerts are
super helpful especially when I'm not at
home the ring pro was really fast
excited them to me but the hell it looks
to be a bit slower gently taking
sometimes up to 20 seconds free to get
an alert which means that person has
already at my door it's not a deal
breaker but I do wish they were faster
but probably the biggest reason I went
with the hello is the ability to mute
the doorbell I got two kids usually go
to bed like around 7:30 ish and some
nights I'm tired my wife's tired and we
just ordered dinner and the bell rings
it's loud Lucy freaks out usually waking
up the kiddos with the hello I can mute
the Bell look at my push alerts or even
I can schedule quiet time to set the
doorbell to turn off every single day
it's a really simple feature that's been
incredibly convenient for us if you have
a Google home or home Mini in your house
the speaker can also serve as a chime
which is really handy for in a place
where you don't typically hear your
doorbell the quality is also pretty
solid it's a 3 megapixel sensor with its
1600 by 1200 resolution and for a
doorbell camera it looks really good so
obviously my doorbells outside and my
Wi-Fi doesn't work that well out there
generally I get 12 up or 12 down and
sometimes even half of that but I've had
no problem streaming on the highest
quality it is nice though doorbells
equipped with 802 11ac
so at the end of the day it doesn't
reinvent the smart doorbell but does get
really close to perfecting it
I wish the nest aware features were just
rolled into the price instead of being a
subscription or just ping once per year
but it gives you really nice options so
hope you guys enjoy be sure to subscribe
