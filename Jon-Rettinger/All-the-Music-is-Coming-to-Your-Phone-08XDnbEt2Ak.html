technobuffalo here and we are live from
CES 2015 joined by jennifer van buskirk
who is president of cricket wireless and
tyler goldman CEO of deezer thank you
guys for taking some time to sit and
chat and we got a lot of kind of
exciting things talk about so there's a
new partnership here that's happening
for for Cricket Wireless customers you
tell us a little bit about deezer I know
it's huge abroad it's kind of like the
soccer of streaming services big
everywhere else u.s. is starting to kind
of get into it and learn about it yeah
we're going to be like a way I so pretty
soon in the in the US so deezer is the
second largest streaming service in the
world we're in 180 countries we have 16
million subscribers so it's quite large
it's been around for seven years and
we've recently launched in the US and
with the cricket partnership will be
launching even further in the US
customers will get to enjoy the full
experience of deezer which is a full
music on-demand streaming service with
the largest catalogue in the world one
of the benefits of being in so many
countries is we've licensed the most
music in the world so users can now play
over 35 million songs three million
albums whenever they want on any device
when you say the largest catalogue in
the world how much bigger is deezer than
the competition people might be more
familiar with yeah most of the services
in the u.s. that users are familiar with
probably have around 20 15 to 20 million
tracks DS RS 35 million tracks so you're
really not going to have any music you
love that you're not going to find on
deezer so this is the music world is
nothing new to cricket it sort of it's a
new evolution the next step in the music
offering that crickets brought to their
customers tell us a little bit about why
current quick and customers and
potentially future customers could be
and should be excited about what's
coming so we've had the move music
service which is really popular with
customers we actually very successful
growing customers with the move music
service and as customers expectations
have improved in wireless and increased
with 4G LTE expectations they've also
increased around music and so we're
really excited to launch deezer and have
a really fully functional world-class
music service offered to cricket
customers so in the world of streaming
services obviously are a lot of options
if people are gonna start hearing about
deezer I think for the first time it
start to hear about it quite a bit
what's can differentiate and what
differentiates DS are now
from the competition yeah there are a
couple key things obviously we have the
largest catalogue which we talked about
another is the product feature it's
great to have lots and millions of
knowing the tracks but you can't find
what you love and what you enjoy it's
quite challenging Saudis are does it in
a couple key ways one is we allow you to
take all of your existing history and
create your own libraries very quickly
second of all we make great
recommendations to you in a couple of
different ways one is we have flow which
is a Leanback experience so you can just
click one button listen to all the music
that you're going to love to is we have
a discovery mode and you can discover
new tracks and then three years we have
great social sharing so you can follow
your friends and people that you really
care about and track what they listened
to and easily play that and again all
this is done very easily it's very
complicated obviously in the back end
but for the front end for the user it's
a very seamless easy to use experience
so if I want to get deezer how do I get
it well the way to get DS are will be
through cricket wireless we talked about
the price point it'll be about fifty
percent less than the market pricing but
yet the best product and that rare
combination is obviously hard to offer
to everyone so we've done an exclusive
deal with cricket for their customers I
think in a lot of ways when people are
first hearing about these are I think
they're also going to be reintroduced I
think to cricket as they look for the
best music for service available as
anything you want to tell our audience a
little bit more about quick I don't get
a chance to sit down with the president
you know very very often so what like we
can you tell our audience about cricket
oh yeah so it's you know what cricket is
an amazing story because we actually
joined AT&amp;amp;T in March as part of the
acquisition and so since then we have
launched as as the new cricket which
means that we've really changed
everything we have upgraded the network
we upgraded the device portfolio we
upgraded all the rate plans so now we
have all in pricing and it's really an
amazing value for customers now the
biggest game changer really being that
4G LTE network that covers three hundred
million pops I mean that is that's 40
million more pops than t-mobile and
Sprint so we cover more customers with
our 4G LTE network in the United States
then there are people that live in
Canada and Ireland combined right so
huge game changer for cricket and all of
our credit customers when you say all in
pricing what does that mean what do you
mean by pops yeah at cricket we wanted
everything to be very simple and easy
and transparent for customers so are all
in pricing it includes taxes and fees so
the price you see is the price you pay
so people size 40 in seinem fifty dollar
plan or four dollar plan that's what
their bills going to say that's it it's
very predictable very very transparent
and by pops that's just a number of the
population here in the United States so
as we sort of wrap up make sure the
consumers know what to expect from
deezer and cricket what messages I think
we can take away here so faster
streaming and just wave more songs yeah
it's just a this is a fully featured
music service so it's not just a
download service or you can do on-demand
streaming radio it's a full-featured
very robust music service that that I
think our customers are really going to
love and probably the big question a lot
of people's minds is priced what is it
going to be what's like what's going to
cost for the end user so it's a great
groundbreaking price point so move
customers today can transition over and
enjoy an extended free trial of this
premium service and then after that this
service will be a groundbreaking price
of just six dollars a month and that
includes taxes and fees just like all
our other cricket pricing it's all in
pricing which is a remarkable I'll
probably fifty percent less than what
you see with competitors I think you can
thank you both very much thank you guys
