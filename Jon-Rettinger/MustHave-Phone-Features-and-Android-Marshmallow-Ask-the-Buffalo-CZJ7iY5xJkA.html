from TechnoBuffalo here and welcome dear
friends back to the persona of ask the
Buffalo to where I've put my big fat
butt on this couch and I answer your
questions about things that that's
happening happening in tech let's go and
jump right into the questions first one
comes from math T Seagle two six six us
at John four Lakers Android M's name
there very few questions on the show
that I can just answer it like for sure
and no because earlier today which is
Monday Google unveiled the Android
marshmallow statue at their campus it's
just the and green android guy just
holding a marshmallow I was hoping for
like a marshmallow with antenna and the
legs but it's just an Android guy just
just get his love on a big marshmallow
so that's coming
it'll be Android marshmallow it's
official I think kind of everybody even
marshmallow but maybe milkshake
so maybe Google was where'd they put no
Jake out in their front yard
the BQ MIDI boys our next one comes from
AD Ezekiel who asked at John four Lakers
thoughts on the new Galaxy s6 edge+ and
note 5 I've been testing them since
Friday I'm filming this on Monday so
it's been about three days I'm gonna do
obviously a full review and more feature
breakdowns but I can't say the screens
are absolutely gorgeous fingerprint
sensor works great you don't have to
swipe your finger down you just push it
on it's worked almost every single time
the hardware feels incredible the phones
look and feel awesome battery lepto
seems to be another story but I am still
testing international units so I'm
hopeful that maybe that my horrible
battery life has been because constant
looking for a network someone get care
units in then it'll be a little more
battery test for you but it's a
preliminary for the mini baby review
Somani Alexander asks at John for Lakers
what did you expect years back after
starting TechnoBuffalo famous or just a
website I started TechnoBuffalo I was
got about 26 I was like just just
foolish enough to not know what it took
to start a business and naive enough to
think that I could do it starting a
business is daunting I'm not trying to
scourge anybody from doing it but
actually running a business business is
is hard man I mean in the seven years
we've been here I've had to fight two
lawsuits I've had to go through an audit
that took almost two years
it's all it's draining and it's hard and
if I knew what I know now what I still
go back and do it probably I think I
still would but I go in a little more
eyes open the answer question I think
was gonna be famous I had no idea I just
want to start a website that I would
want to read that put a lot of emphasis
on video and it's your rote dressing
articles that I found interesting
whatever was gonna be was what's going
to be last egg quility asks at John four
Lakers hi
what is must-have feature that will
influence your choice of phone and what
is your most wished for for me it's you
know if they're they're slabs
it's a gorgeous screen and battery life
I want a really nice screen doesn't
always have to be qHD but certainly nice
and I want me some battery life those
are the two things that are most
important to me every phone out doesn't
matter what process viewing is gonna be
fast enough it was matter if it's not
dragon 808 820 if it's got quad cores on
it at least and least to get to the RAM
it's going to be plenty fast I don't put
that much stock in processors camera
matters not that much time as long as
the pictures are decent I'm not blowing
them up or anything just long as I can
look at on my phone or share them and
maybe print one out of the five by seven
if I want that's really all that I care
about but screen and battery life those
are closing my two big ones but what are
you guys what are the two things that
you care about most of the phone maybe
you guys disagree maybe it's all about
processor or RAM I'll take your thoughts
on it leave it I think the comments like
here like my knee a little my socks I
think you guys for watching you episode
of ask the Buffalo if you guys enjoy
these I really love making them until
next time try render check the Buffalo
see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
