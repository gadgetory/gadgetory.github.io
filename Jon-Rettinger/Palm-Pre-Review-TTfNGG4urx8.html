here they review for you of the Palm Pre
by palm for sprint I've had a chance to
use the palm pre for quite a while now
I've had it since launch day and overall
I've been really impressed the phone but
we'll get to that in a minute since
first and foremost this is a phone let's
talk about phone quality on the palm pre
particularly sprints network well
network strength is going to vary by
region to region depending on where you
are where I am I've got a very strong
spread signal and I can't say that voice
quality is absolutely fantastic on the
pre people could not even tell i was on
a cell phone I couldn't tell they were
on a cell phone there was no no white
noise there was no buzzing it sounded
almost landline quality so overall
whether that's the pre or sprints
network or more likely a combination of
both very impressed if you're going to
use this as a primary phone you will not
be disappointed I filmed the previous
video talking about five things I love
and hate about the parade so I'm not
going to go into detail about the best
thing than the worst things i'm going to
give you an overview of the phone so no
real review of the pre would be complete
without a mention of web OS and that is
the operating system that Dupree is
running on I gotta say it is really
fantastic the card management system
meaning the way that you multitask and
manager different applications and
programs that are open really is a
fantastic implementation the
multitasking was quick it was seamless
and most importantly actually became fun
to use so if you're looking for a device
that you need to multitask on the pre
really is a good way to go and when I
first started playing with the prea kept
thinking why do I need to multitask you
know I've been using an iphone for the
past couple years and never really had a
need for it and the more I started to
play with the pre the more I started to
realize how important multitasking is
fleece for me I don't have that much
time to get done but I need to get done
on a mobile phone that don't involve
calling or that doesn't involve calling
if I need to send an email check a web
page or leave a comment or reply while
that page is loading or doing things I
like to you know be proactive so we're
ordinarily with an iphone another device
I would have to wait
for a page to load or wait for
application to load I can open up
something else and I can work on
something else while it's all page is
loading for example if I want to check
my email what if email to load I can
check my Twitter page while I'm doing
that a reply to a comment really makes
things nice and easy or fine looking at
a PDF document with the built-in PDF
viewer if I want to reference a web page
that's making the PDF I can minimize it
essentially go to the web look at the
page referencing and come right back the
ways you can use multi tasking Ruby are
endless and the pre handles them very
well I had 12 cards open at once which
was fairly memory intensive and the pre
handed it like a champ with no slowdown
I did experience slow down when I got to
15 cards open and really if you have 15
applications open you're probably going
to have some bigger issues one of the
knocks on the pre has been battery life
people are saying battery life is not
very strong on the pre and that's both
true and false and in my experience was
both true and false so battery life one
you don't leave cards open as actually
fantastic I was able to get through a
full day no problem with around forty
percent charge that's with browsing web
pages that's what making phone calls
even using spreads navigation but when
you leave cards open and you lock the
phone and put it back in your pocket or
purse wherever you keep it you're still
using system memory and system memory
uses battery and that's where you're
going to notice a significant battery
drain so if you leave even one card open
whereas the dead of the day I would have
forty percent I would now have maybe ten
or fifteen percent so if you use proper
battery management proper program
management you'll have no problem
getting a full day's use out of the pre
so the next thing that I want to talk
about is the integration the synergy
that palm is calling essentially what
that is is it integrates all of your
contacts all of your email all your
calendars will be in to one master list
you're the ability to control what that
is and that was one of the things that
found it kind of gimmicky to me but now
that I've actually stated in practice
it's really become invaluable for
example i use google cow
there's a lot any time I go into google
calendars and make a change on my
calendar it automatically gets sent to
the pre now that's nothing revolutionary
a lot of devices will sync wirelessly
with Google calendars but I also use
exchange server so I want to update my
exchange calendar gets updated in the
same calendar as well which is quite
nice and all my gmail contacts all my
contacts of exchange aren't stored in
separate contact lists stored just in
one master list it really makes it nice
and easy for content contact and
calendar management try saying that fast
content contact contacts and calendar
management really is quite quite nice on
the parade so as far as I'm concerned
the palm pre and the web OS is a network
good meaning something that gets more
value and more people use it that's
really one of the detriments of the
praise right now the web OS available on
one device on one carrier justin happens
to be one of the smallest carriers in
the US that of course being sprint so
the inherent value a device like this is
going to lie in the hands of developers
whether or not they want to spend their
time developing for it to help the
device reach its full potential and if
there aren't a lot of people using it
doesn't have that wide adoption
developers aren't going to come flock to
it like they have to the iphone and
particularly the App Store but if this
is released for other carriers like it's
rumored and if the operating system
makes the leap to other forum patches
other devices the palm pre has a sari
webOS has a lot of potential and the
palm pre being launched advice I think
is really going to assure that in the
screen on the palm pre is capacitive
much like the iphone and the g1 although
I will say it was not as responsive as
the iphones sometimes have to push
things really almost hard with the fat
part of your finger to let it know
you're making contact it's not always
but I will definitely say that it was
not as responsive as the iphone
resolution why is the same as the iphone
they're both bright you can watch videos
on it fantastically really the screen
just pops out of you so no problem there
on the screen and
all hardware was is another knock people
had on the palm pre they thought the
hardware felt flimsy I think the
hardware wise and actually very
impressed slider mechanism can often
time to feel cheap and can break but in
the now almost two weeks I've had the
phone a slider mechanism still feels
dirty and I love the way the phone feels
in the hand that sort of pebble feeling
that it it's got and it really just
makes it nice and again fun to hold it
fits in your pocket no problem doesn't
create a big lump it's just a very nice
thin profile having a full qwerty
keyboard has also been very nice
although the keyboard on the pre is
relatively small and it's definitely
going to take some getting used to or
nearly I would say don't worry about it
the autocorrect will take care of any
fat thumb errors but at time of this
filming the pretty does not have
autocorrect which is a little bit on the
annoying side I do think that palm and
sprint will update it to support
autocorrect some sort of dictionary
system because this can be updated over
the air with firmware so I think that
there are a lot of changes coming to the
palm pre and I think that auto update
will certainly be one of the biggest so
there are a ton of things that I can
talk about in this video and I've done
it really seven or eight and nine video
series on different features of the pre
so far more particular information
definitely check that out but generally
and overall I can say the pre has been
fantastic I'm excited by a potential of
the platform another device I think this
is the first true competitor to the
iphone I know it's hard to not compare
this to the iphone but on its own on its
own merits on its own legs the palm pre
really stands tall and really sounds
proud almost above the competition I
think that it's a robust operating
system it's a full-featured smartphone
it offers really a lot of killer killer
features that I've been very happy to
use and I've enjoyed using things like
the gesture control on the bottom and
the launcher when you swipe up on your
finger really are just great features
that augments a fantastic operating
system the fact that this is only first
release again is a very exciting process
to think about what palm might do in the
future with other updates and other
devices so overall do i recommend the
palm pre one hundred percent i can
recommend the palm pre to you i
definitely recommend that you look at
the pre if you're considering an iphone
3g or 3gs you may prefer the iphone
operating system but you owe it to
yourself to look at the pre so you can
see what device is best for you that is
assuming that you get sprint service i
think they are really close rivals now
is this gonna be my daily driver I don't
know right now it is and I'm enjoying
using it with the iphone 3gs i may
switch back and give that the daily use
that I had with previous iphones but i
have to say if i do continue to use this
as my regular phone i will not be
disappointed browser why's everything
it's a fantastic device on a one-to-five
scale I give the palm pre really really
really solid four or three quarters it
just missing a few key features that I
like to see like i mentioned the
autocorrect and some sort of on-screen
keyboard as well so guys I hope you
enjoyed what are your thoughts about the
palm pre are you going to consider it in
place of an iphone or a g1 or any other
new smartphones that are coming out the
summer or the future or your now you're
going to give it a shot you know it's a
I think it's worth definite looking at
