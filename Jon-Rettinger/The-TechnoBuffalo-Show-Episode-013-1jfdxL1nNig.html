TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your 3d
house for today I'm Sean ani editor and
chief of the site i'm joined by
executive editor gaming joey davidson
hello an executive editor mobile Todd
Hazleton everybody are you guys doing
today yeah just word of warning to
everyone if there's some technical
issues in this episode it's because I
lost power last night and my router got
fried and I'm still trying to get my
internet put back together so it's been
great fun trying to listen to these two
guys in the pre-show yeah we're great
try to muddle our wedding I talking to
each other yeah yeah there may be just a
lot of Joey and Todd talking and I'm
sorry guys I know yeah I know you really
just come here for me I know yeah it's
okay we don't have to tell them it's
okay it's our little secret ah so a lot
going on this week and of course the we
would be remiss if we do is just didn't
start with the biggest news of the week
hey leaked photos of star wars episode
so yeah it seriously is probably the
biggest news is I know in some ways I I
couldn't believe considering the secrecy
that JJ Abrams usually has on his films
the first batch of 44 and then the
second batch of 22 I was just like
someone is getting their ass chewed yeah
so everyone is fired yeah well pretty
crazy the the brilliant thing is JJ
Abrams is now dressed this and you know
and the way he did it was so masterful
you know he wrote on a card you know hey
I wish everyone stopped leaking you know
photos of Star Wars Episode 7 and making
these ridiculous claims that the
Millennium Falcon's in the movie and the
card is sitting on a table which if
you're a die-hard Star Wars fed you know
that's the hollow chess table from the
Millennium Falcon
all just table from the Millennium all
good man said I saw the picture I was
like well played Abrams nice the Wookiee
has one yeah pretty awesome but we won't
since I actually we didn't he requested
we removed the images we won't go into
too much detail on what was in the
images but they were really interesting
oh well I guess there was also some big
news this week about something called
WWDC oh yeah that thing yeah whatever
but it was it was exciting so Todd you
you've actually played with iOS 8 and
you played with OS 10 Yosemite can we
just address for the moment that Apple
made a marijuana joke yeah that was
crazy and a lot of there's like a bunch
of editorials yeah they were like how do
we how do we name Yosemite like so we
went around all these beautiful places
in California we were like OS 10 you
know this o is 10 that then we went up
to weed California OS 10 weed and
they're like that that was really
popular among the product marketing
department and then when they showed the
line of and leaving weed and started
doing circles yeah and like taking this
far along route no I'm just say they're
going I cannot believe Apple just paid a
marijuana choke yeah there were so many
people saying like this is a new apple
or like they're back they're funny and
stuff like that but i don't know i mean
i thought it was funny i just didn't
know that we'd be we'd seen this serious
Apple I mean they're not like tight like
Microsoft has been sometimes the owner
buttoned-up enterprise but yeah so we
super exciting with iOS 8 I have it
right here and I'm running right in here
Yosemite both are super buggy right now
you have somebody's a little better in
iOS 8 but I'd say there's a lot of
features that I think Apple fans and iOS
fans have been waiting for for a long
time and I think that the android fans
interview like yet you know who cares in
a lot of ways so widgets in the
notification
shin panel in the shade is pretty cool
so that'll be open to third parties now
so you can get you know ESPN get the
scores right there instead of a
notification very different you could
have like a widget that shows like you
know each inning of a baseball game or
something like that and and Sasha Mahal
was asking you what your each of our
thoughts are on Oh Alice Aiden OS 10
Yosemite and like I was saying only todd
has played with them so far but I have
you gotten any of the big features to
work yet Todd like I know the feature
excited me the most was the fact that
you're and your text messages and phone
calls could come in through Yosemite now
right yeah that's not there yet
unfortunately I was super excited about
that too it's why Russia to to try them
all but know some of the ones like where
you get the active notifications where
you pull down to respond to a text
message that's there the keyboards there
but it's also really really buggy right
now like it slows down a lot I mean it's
a super early beta um what else did I
really like I don't know I think mostly
it feels just like iOS 7 in a lot of
ways but like spotlights changed now
searches the itunes store for apps and
stuff like that so you sort of like as
i'm using and i start to see some of the
new changes pop up more but the ones i'm
waiting for like third-party
notifications third-party access to
touch ID third-party keyboards like when
we get swype and stuff like that none of
those are there yet so hopefully soon
overall I Sophie from Sasha Mahal I
think this addresses a question a lot of
people i have were any of you
disappointed that we didn't see any new
hardware from the WWDC 2014 keynote were
you hoping to the face one last thing
I'll take that real quick and you know
the thing is WWDC is about the
developers it's about software so we
kind of knew going in that we weren't
going to see hardware but still it would
have been nice to have least in a
refresh on some stuff I mean I was not
expecting the iphone I was not expecting
that I watch
yeah the leg last year we had the mac
pro was announced right and we had
refreshes on the macbook so you could
have seen that you know I think some
people were looking for a retina MacBook
Air it's tough but uh Joey there's
actually one question here for you I
don't know if you were you actually
watching WWDC during the event now okay
have you heard anything about the metal
gaming aspect of it no that's like their
new engine I think right like I don't
even know how gaming engines actually
work Joey I'd be for you but I think
what they announced was like this metal
engine for iOS developers take advantage
of that's how I understood it I mean I
imagine it looks really powerful it's
probably very similar to like the Unreal
Engine and everything else is probably
just add just a development engine so
basically think of it like a toolset for
developers to create their game with
that's more or less what it is right so
I mean if Apple's got an exclusive
development engine that's good news for
developers the only issue is depending
on how dynamic it is I don't have you
ever told around with GarageBand for
instance yeah I'm put it around tool
around with GarageBand enough and you
use this the sample loops enough just
like when you're goofing around you'll
start to notice garage pan songs like
used in crappy YouTube videos and stuff
yeah yeah if if the development suite
isn't very robust you'll see assets
repeat in games so like look I notice
that tree or something like that right
you bright right there's a reason why
all Unreal Engine characters have that
same like stocky big shoulder gears yeah
that's because of that that version of
the engine was not very well stocked
with builds for characters so that could
be an issue but it all depends on how
Apple does it which I have no idea
they're doing it so that's super
interesting that I didn't know that yeah
well be powerful there don't seem to be
a bigger focus on gaming so I'm not sure
what exactly apples going to try to do
here but let's see here what else we've
got we've got several WWDC question
and of course they all moved on and they
get a lot of ways so we can talk about
sort of the software enables a lot of
things that we don't know where they're
gonna go to yet and i think that there's
hardware coming that might support them
for example now when the iphones plugged
in you can say hey Siri and it'll answer
you it'll light up an answer and I think
maybe the iphone 6 if they really work
on the battery life will have like an
always listening mode so that like the
older iPhones have to be plugged in but
it still works but if you have the
iphone 6 you know you can say hey Siri
whenever you want that seems like pretty
plausible ten how yeah what I just I
just I wanted to kind of get this out
there because I think a lot of people
especially on our site during WWDC
announcements we're kind of making this
claim and I wanted to catch you're just
a blush opinion about it sure is Apple
playing catch up with a lot of Android
features here yeah yes to me that they
are yeah a lot of those are um so always
on is on the Moto X right and you can
google there right yay say okay Google
now um yeah we're okay Google and on a
lot of phones as long as the screens on
it works it doesn't have to be plugged
in so like the galaxy s5 I don't think
it works natively on the one mA actually
a pretty sure it doesn't I'm so a lot in
it obviously the Nexus 5 and stuff like
that so catch up there catch up in
obviously the notification shade where
you're getting third party widgets and
stuff like that catch up on third-party
keyboards in terms of the galaxy s5
catch up on opening up a fingerprint
reader to third parties so yeah there's
a lot of features that I think our Apple
is definitely playing catch-up but for
iOS fans that for whatever reason have
no interest in android these are nice
features for them too but um that's a
good point like there aren't many
features announced tonight that you
could get on Android one way or another
because it's so open in a lot of ways
for developers so like getting text
messages on your computer we've seen
that before with Motorola has their own
software that does that it's awesome and
there's software already actually for
both iOS and Android lets you do that
place phone calls and stuff from your
computer but I think native support
all this from Apple just shows kind of
like a different company where they used
to lock everything down and now it's I
mean it's still certainly locked down in
a lot of ways but its opening up more to
developers and that's what was exciting
I think for Apple for everybody actually
just they have announced a another
director for another of the standalone
Star Wars films oh god Sean his shot is
just live in the Star Wars life right
now yeah I'm not familiar with the
structure his name's josh trank he's
gonna keep going okay anyway yep I'm
living the star a it was breaking news
from Sasha Mahal and again Todd since
you've played with both of them do you
think the Apple is slowly emerging iOS
and OS 10 together because of the
changes they are making the both
platforms well I think we should they're
not merging them together at all and
then Apple's actually said that
specifically or not creating one
platform for all these devices at least
not yet and there they say they have no
plans to do so what they're doing though
is sort of creating an experience where
you can take your phone and and this is
something that is not available on
Android and was exciting or for google
um where you're using something on your
phone like email you're writing an email
and then you move to your computer and
you continue writing that email right in
the mail app and stuff like that's
really cool and then keeping the same
kind of design look and we knew that was
coming in Yosemite the iOS the flatter
icons I'm looking at it right now
they're all they're cleaner look you've
got a lot of the translucent user
interface styles so that kind of stuff
like it doesn't feel like you're leaving
an apple product or anything like that
or you're ever you but you don't have to
be in front of your computer or your
phone you can seamlessly switch between
them I think is where they're going with
this but not certainly not converging
the two to one platform well it's my
opinion that that and I think
anecdotally I see it working with
members of my extended family but it's
my opinion that Apple's trying
desperately to create this ubiquitous
ecosystem
right with their products it's like
because I own an iPad I'm just this is
generically speaking because I own an
iPad and because I own an iPhone it
would make using a macbook very easy or
you know and and and i look at my my
mother and father-in-law for instance
they recently made the switch over to
iOS devices like so they're on their
iphones on their iPads and and dick my
father-in-law that's right his name is
dick comes up to me and he just goes do
you think we should get a macbook and
I'm like well you get whatever you want
to get he's like well we know iOS now
and so there's like this kind of this
sense of like really easy unification
that makes the switch quite easy so when
I think I was Sasha bahal who said that
but I don't personally think like you
said Todd that they're ever going to be
like iOS is going to be the platform
period but I do think that they are
going to make the bridges between
devices less and less seamless right
right laura moore stephens yeah exactly
exactly yeah and that's what they did
even with messages and stuff like that
now every message i sent on my iphone
used to be that I go on my iPad and I
could see the message is coming to me
but not mine going out so now it's all
there across devices you know it's small
things like that and on my computer too
so I'd messages up right here it can see
all you know everything that's been
going on right alright so kind of cool
yeah I don't think their apples bluntly
said they're not going to completely
merge them by I definitely see them
influencing one another I think it's
like you were saying Joey it's referred
to as the halo effect and you know it's
definitely working yeah for sure so also
on monday and i am sure we'll come back
to WWDC during the open Q&amp;amp;A section but
also on Monday Joey there seemed to be a
lot of gaming news considering the fact
that III is only a week away do you
think is going on well I mean I there
there seems to be this conception right
now that PR firms need to get out ahead
of the e3 wave so that's kind of what
we're seeing instead of instead of
mortal kombat x for instance which was
announced on monday instead of that just
being a
a low Rumble amidst all the news it at
e3 it had dedicated news time on Monday
it's kind of frustrating from our point
because like I'm i am I'm working
towards III and then these announcements
come up and I'm just like crap I gotta
stop what I'm doing taking an
announcement whatever but but for the
games themselves and for the PR company
is representing them it makes more sense
to announce them a week or ahead of time
because Forza horizon 2 which was
announced on Monday Mortal Kombat X
which was announced on Monday and
Batman's delay in 2 2015 was also
announced on Monday it's it's all stuff
that I think that the companies wanted
to do ahead of e3 that way the buzz was
already starting to be generated for
their product and then they promised
more at the show which is what we're
gonna see there so it's just kind of an
interesting way for them to be handling
it you know we see that sometimes too
with like Mobile World Congress know any
sort of we're flying all the way out
there and then announcements are made
you're like alright why am I here again
you know or or CES in a lot of ways
sometimes right right yeah it's I I had
a feeling that's what was going on
instead of being caught in the crush of
so much news next week go ahead and get
your news out now when you could
potentially control the news cycle but
it looked like a whole bunch of people
had the same idea right right I want to
actually ask what what Brantley Jensen
just said what do you think the mystery
3ds title BTW 3d see that Sean I am
looking go go ahead and start asking all
good i I just I mean I wanted to say
like we we are on the books um there
there is definitely at least one on
announced 3ds title but what Nintendo
does is the show so like Tuesday they
have their their presser in the morning
or this year they're doing that digital
event thing again and then Tuesday
evening we're at a round table for I
think smash brothers and then Wednesday
evening they signed us up for a round
table that was just an unannounced
radius game so whatever it is which
which they have obviously have not
revealed yet it's big enough to dedicate
a hour to two hour
long developer roundtable discussion for
and they've only ever done this in the
past at least since I've been there for
titles like pokemon X&amp;amp;Y was one that
they did last year so it's it's going to
be a big game whatever it is I don't
think it's gonna be a simple we might
see Majora's Mask remake maybe that
could happen but I don't know if if
that's gonna be the big one there
there's they've got something going on I
don't know what it is yet obviously so
not sure but it's big yeah you would
know better than anyone Joey you know or
at least have a guess at what it is and
there was one other question here it's
the one thing i hate about the question
thing is it moves things around on me so
rapidly from a ver con ash mar do you
think nintendo will start selling
gamecube controllers again now that
they're releasing an adapter and that
was a a pre III announcement from them
that they will be an adapter for super
smash brothers yeah i mean when they
show off that adapter there was a
gamecube controller plugged into it with
the smash logo in the center so that
that might be something that you get
when you buy the adapter so if you buy
the the four gang thing the four input
thing i wouldn't be surprised if it
comes with that x that xbox that smash
brothers gamecube controller and
hopefully they start selling more
because I mean to be if Mario Kart 8 and
the new smash brothers are both playable
with the new gig with the old gamecube
controllers thanks to that adapter a lot
of nerds are going to be in stupid
heaven so hopefully they will sell a few
extra those input devices because I will
definitely buy a new one all my old ones
are shot at this point so I love that
controller it felt really good the
c-stick was stupid but the triggers on
that controller were the best yeah yeah
from dominique weber and this refers to
mortal kombat x Joey do you think that
the mortal kombat trailer was actual
gameplay um it's hard to say I'll start
there and I don't know but the thing
about fighting games
and it's also true for racing games they
can look better than everything else on
the console and that's mostly because of
the the very small specific slice of a
game's world that they have to render at
once instead of like an open world game
which tends to be the ugliest thing that
a platform will released because of the
vast amount of things that have to be
rendered in the fighting game in a
racing game you're you're rendering this
very narrow tiny slice so did Mortal
Kombat X look impressive yes is it
possible that it was gameplay yes that
wouldn't really surprise me I'm not sure
either way but it wouldn't necessarily
surprise me if it was and also in
relation to e3 here we have from sahal
Raja do you think he and III PlayStation
will actually show off project Morpheus
I might release it for ps4 uh well we
know it's coming for the PlayStation 4
that's that's a done deal whether or not
they'll show it at e3 I imagine they
will I think that they said at GDC that
they'll bill don't have more on a 93 so
we'll find out on Monday night is sony's
press conference so i imagine we'll know
that yeah it's gonna be a very busy
monday next week and flowing into
Tuesday morning with the Nintendo Direct
yeah but I you and Eric will both be on
the ground so we will have lots of
gaming coverage next day yeah yes we're
actually sending two people this year
this is a first so I expect it to be
worth it uh let's see here for also from
Dominique Weber is there any chance that
we'll see GTA 5 4 ps4 xbox one Andy 30
rock star doesn't typically show off
games v3 first of all that's that's not
really a big thing for them I mean they
would they can and they they could but I
wouldn't necessarily expect it from them
if if anything it might be a bullet
point one of the major pressors but I
doubt it I died out and I imagine
announce that on their own they don't
need III they really don't have all
right you guys are that game would be
for both platforms I mean I would love
to see it but I would love to see it on
PC first yes there is released on the pc
and that's that's it's just getting a
little bit ridiculous oh yeah here's a
question that kind of applies to all of
our fields from Sasha Mahal why is
everything either coming out in 2015 or
delayed until 2015 this goes for games
tekken movies and there has been a
tremendous amount of delays lately even
in films in games especially you know I
is there actually we did just hear about
windows delaying the start button in
2015 yeah but yeah that's true i guess
but i don't i don't see that as like a
huge thing and that's because i think
they're gonna put it in in i guess
windows 9 or something like that I don't
necessarily think that the things can be
related yeah I I I don't think they're
all related to one another Bay and what
the world is supposed to end in 2014
they just don't want the police right
let's just push it back that way we all
go out on a high note right III think
with with gaming at least it makes sense
to me that it's happening because these
are new consoles so maybe they were
developing for the xbox one and
playstation 4 and they hit a snag or
they discovered something that they
didn't know about the platform and that
could make their game better and so they
pushed it back it makes sense to me if
we were three years into these consoles
lives I don't think that we'd be seeing
the same types of delays but I'm not
surprised based on on how old these are
I mean they're not even to you they
won't even be a year old by this October
when a lot of these games were delayed
out of that month so we'll see it's
interesting i'm not sure about phones
though yeah i haven't heard anything
about mean phones the cycle is sort of
different what movies were delayed
actually just this morning the Warner
Brothers delayed Jupiter ascending from
the y cos keys from july until februari
okay well i know so are you gonna
sneak one out in the press release this
morning why I mean that they might be
trying to get it out for award season
they might have like what they see
rather than releasing it as a popcorn
flick tour released on its own in
February yeah exactly exactly but I make
sure for movies is just bonkers with
everything that's coming out right but
it will be think with some things too
like like a tough when you look at the
landscape and maybe decides not you know
the right choice we saw the surface mini
which a lot I mean pretty much everybody
assumed it was coming and then it just
didn't and it sounded like it was pretty
much cancelled like a couple days before
the press conference and you know and at
that point they might say like look we
have the display we have you know and
that's why there's talks of supplier the
supply chain still talking about the
surface mini they like they have the
display they have the memory and all
that stuff they want to use it maybe
they're waiting for a faster processor
or something before before tackling the
market and they just didn't think it was
a right time to do it now and I don't
think it would have been I've argued
against the surface mini sort of
especially because Windows RT sort of
lower powered but and actually I well
we'll go ahead and move into general
questions we have a some questions from
someone named jacob kleinman i never
heard of them who i believe should be
working and not listening to us do you
think an iWatch is more or less likely
after the health kit announcement I
think it's more likely that I might be
crazy but I think so I mean you have all
this I'll bring up health right here I
mean there's all this data that it can
collect the health app and I get it like
there's there's medical firms that make
devices that could easily you know use
bluetooth and plug in using Apple's new
health kit but there's a lot in here
that could be populated with anything
you know uh you know from anybody who
partners with Apple for just a regular
fitness band even and I think if Apple
wanted to they certainly have the
platform now to do it themselves and
that's why I think that watch is more
probable look a lot of people still
don't believe in it so who knows I
I don't know I tend to believe in it
they've hired too many people that are
from that field yeah and I and we saw
what was it called samsung's new
platform the name is escaping me but it
was super powerful like Samsung was on
stage wearing a watch and it showed you
know the heart ray and and fuck was it
blood pressure i think in there too all
kinds of data that it was using light
sort of from different angles in the
wrist through your bloodstream that it
was able to collect all this stuff in
real time so it's not a question of is
it possible because it's certainly
possible to make a slick looking and
powerful health wearable it's just it is
Apple going to do it themselves or work
with partners instead now n boat
probably both if and of course just as i
was going to click on a question for
Julia moved yeah from David berkovich do
you think Sony and Microsoft will
eventually do what Nintendo's doing with
their presentation for e3 in the future
or continue to have their press
conferences on stage um I think that man
that's a good question I don't know I
personally think that Nintendo is good
for doing what they're doing there I i
hate the stage presentations at this
point my life I think there's a here I
mean it's mine it's the internet and and
has just gotten so good that it doesn't
matter i don't need to be there alive
and nine times out of ten the only
people cheering in the audience for
these things are the people making them
the holidays right i remember i was at a
ubisoft show forever ago and the only
people cheering about like they're
raving rabbids stuff we're the guys who
made raving rabbits like that's it um so
I just I I do not like the press
conference format that we have now and I
would much rather have a straight solid
well made a glitch free video streaming
show that just happens that Allah
Nintendo but I don't know if Sony and
Microsoft are going to do it the thing
about Sony especially as they turn
theirs into a party so after the show is
over the current lifts up and then
there's like actual hands-on stations
and bars and crap behind it it's a P it
is a good PR thing for them they always
have the late
show they always have drinks and food
and pretty much every press member who
stays winds up liking it a lot so I
don't see them getting rid of that but
Microsoft they're like eight o'clock in
the morning man I know several people
who are like uh stupid microsoft make me
get out of bed at eight o'clock the
quickest way to win over press people
give us food yeah sony if i remember
correctly don't they have like a pregame
to outside in the parking lot and any
game but I think it's worth I'll gating
they do was if we have to have was like
yo Katie they have they have they
basically the last several years anyway
they just run out of parking lot yeah
well they build two separate bars and
fucks that like go around the perimeter
I mean there's it we take a really weird
stance on this personally and and I'm
the only person that goes for
TechnoBuffalo so that's I don't really
engage in this stuff because I find it
rather boring um I could I don't really
I don't like corona light and that's
about the best beer that they have there
so I don't really want their crappy
horde of wares and they're lame corona
lights they can but it's really super ol
it was cool when I first started when I
was younger yeah you're like oh I'd
rather just be at home with a coffee and
sandwich right I know that that sounds
really stupid but I mean it is it is how
I feel like so would intend to announce
that there go on digital just like yes I
can lay in bed not put pants on sit
there and watch the show and then what
then migrated over to the conventional
there's nothing better than covering a
press event in your underwear yeah much
other do that and drink crappy beer in
front of people in a way to hot parking
lot a question from Dominic Weber behind
the scenes of technobuffalo are all of
you working from home full-time well
those of us that are not in irvine work
from well I technically don't work from
home this is not my house I actually
have a separate building and
my office is in but the everyone in
irvine works out of the irvine office so
they actually go to an office and they
have to wear pants actually did shirts
aren't allowed right I got straight okay
well he was shorts no Roy when I was out
in California little story froze freak I
Roy was like hey if it's above what he
say like 85 I think there's above 85 you
can wear shorts and I was like oh I
brought shorts really hot out so I wore
shorts and everybody's like oh you can't
wear shorts and he tricked me the rule
is no sure it's gotta wear pants in the
office and I know the joke you have to
you have to cover you know you can't
just wear boxers but not even just
shorts I guess man hey god I would want
to work out there I mean I work in my
bracelet so is that I like I'm literally
that guy writes about video games yeah
that's me but I'm in my living room they
can have a piece I got a nice basement
thank you all right I got a pool table
over there you'd show you the view of
Manhattan there you go here you uh that
pool table is a write-off for business
meeting space happy go my club my
clients come over I since my computer's
an imac i'm not going to lift it and
show you guys yeah God because basically
anything not within the camera range is
a mess yeah everything behind me she
yeah Oh bodies which by the way Joey
last night once again the air
conditioning moved it and set off the
motion detector working from home I
don't know about you Todd I it is not
all it's cracked up to be yeah uh you
just don't give your desk uh yeah like I
always make a joke but it's I'm dead
serious my wife comes home and she's
like we need milk and I'm like I got it
I'm going to get the milk oh yeah don't
interact with some people attack my god
it's so true i'm like i need to get out
of here like i gotta go somewhere
around people oh god well and that's one
of the reasons i like the nicety the
fact that my office is in a building
other than my house so when I go home
I'm home because I used to work out of
my house and it did get to the point
where you're just like it's 2 a.m. I I
don't know when to stop working and I've
got to get up and leave it I mostly sit
at my desk just for work to let some
playing dayz with brandon and ralph's
like then I and that's like a way to do
it to like if you leave your desk yeah
yeah I mean I don't even have a TV nice
like I just like the video game stuff my
computer it's all work stuff we don't
even we don't hang out down here so yeah
yeah yeah the UH so yeah the the the
irvine folks all go to an office which
actually we just sign you last week for
a brand new office so there will be a
new office tour coming up sometime in
the fall I believe we move in in october
i mean if if they want to rent me in
office here I wish I know there are
Buffalo Delaware addition there are
lockers whoo hoo do that though they
like adding office spaces yeah I'll
totally do that yeah we can do a
collective office time we can meet a
better commute like we both have to our
commutes even though he's like man I'm
so sick of this commute just so Joey
Todd can hang out in a rented office
together right we'll probably hate each
other it would be the worst office I
never got my daughter cool trash
everywhere yeah love water cooler in a
nice plant there is a water cooler in
the TechnoBuffalo office and every once
awhile when I'm out there I just like to
go stand next to and goes anyone want to
gossip yeah yeah let's gossip song what
this is all cracked up to be from Sasha
Mahal hey Shawn well whatever is under
that sheet be revealed by the end of
2014 or will the reveal be delayed in
into 2015 it's the techno bubble show
series finales what that's what's gonna
happen yeah but it's got
it's gonna roll out like some crappy
found-footage horror film like Sean's
cameras gonna fall over and then these
sheets gonna drop and there's gonna be a
weird person just standing there yes but
actually you guys have seen what's
behind the curtain because during the
week I lift it it only by only drop it
to the ground during the don't we
haven't seen anything as noticed yet
let's do a word he's saying he's trying
to play it off like oh they've totally
seen it we have not from Dominique Weber
how successful is the tectum Buffalo
show um we're growing but I think it's
very successful we're very happy with
that otherwise we wouldn't be here every
week right i mean it it's knit we do
more than do more than the video show
which obviously you guys are watching
now that we have an audio show too so
people subscribe to it that way I know
our cumulative views have gone up since
we yeah dropped tech on the range and
then relaunch this so ya know our key
Moses viewership / listenership is
higher than was on tech on the range so
which I still I still love the name for
the show that I came up with but yeah
that is a great not everyone else dude
makes reminds me of red dead redemption
kind of oh yeah I mean I was so happy
with the with the CEO 2k or I mean
take-two interactive came out it was
just like red dead redemption is a red
dead as a permanent franchise for us yes
I know yeah that's awesome that was my
happiest news I've heard in a long time
but now we won't hear anything on that
at e3 right I I would love to see that
Eddie 3 I would collapse 83like I would
be like a like a stereotypical old woman
in the 1930s collapsing and Eric
frederickson's can have to fan me I've
either you ever seen Mike Meyers movie
so I married an axe murderer yeah yeah
remember the part where the bagpiper
falls down and Mike Myers goes we've got
the piper down oh these are Piper's now
someone would run up next to Joe angle
weave
bloggers down I reviewed a blog wrote it
down Walker his head's like an orange on
a toothpick we have a question that I I
want get to and I'm not even gonna try
to pronounce this name because it's
written in Russian dan Uggla thank you
for asking your question I'd love to say
your name but I now do you believe that
Google self-driving car service can kill
uber and other taxi services I I'm
fascinated by the self-driving car
movement because I'm one of those people
I despise driving yeah I hate driving
that's why i love Lewbert well and
especially like when I do fly out to
irvine I have to drive three hours to an
airport I those are the three worst
hours of my week I hate that so as for
if it will kill goober though I don't
think so i think uber will just I I
don't think google wants to get into the
business really of selling consumer cars
I think they want to develop the
technology and then license that
technology out to companies and I could
see uber purchasing cars with that
technology and getting rid of their
drivers yeah uber said it wants to have
self-driving cars you which is
interesting because they also brag about
how many people they give jobs to on a
weekly like how many jobs they create
each month I guess so they're about to
take them away but also GM didn't think
like one of the head executives there
just said that he sees Google
self-driving cars is serious competition
in the future so that kind of suggests
that maybe I mean you think that they
would if they saw google as such huge
competition then there wouldn't be a
licensing deal because they were just
probably license it I don't know right
something weird right I think it's all
really cool but uh who was I talking to
you somebody recently was like whoa this
is really scary to me because they talk
about real Big Brother stuff these
self-driving cars I know everything
where you are and also I think a health
stuff seeing crazy Joey I think you
would love a self-driving car
think of how much mobile gaming time you
get get in yeah I like driving it
doesn't hurt that tip to tip from my
status like an hour and 15 minutes but
whatever exactly yeah got big commute
today I Drive 20 minutes yeah I read
that's the biggest drawback to where I
live is whenever I have to fly somewhere
and it's like uh okay Kansas City she
isn't mean three hour drive each other
runway on your property yeah or at least
a helipad a helipad the techno Buffalo
chopper yeah just whatever John will get
real smart if you request one and send
that one of those crappy $50 remote
control jobbies it's like this denier
jerk yeah one of the parrot ar.drone
someone on the youtube comment stream
because it would you watch that or at
least i do ask about our views on piracy
on game piracy mmm do you guys want to
hit that I mean we go for it me well I
we can all touch on but I feel you
should leave it ok uh video game piracy
so I don't really think I mean I don't
know we talked about it here on the show
but I've written about our on
technobuffalo before I generically
speaking I think the people that pirate
games just because they don't want to
pay for them are not cool um I don't
like that guy I understand I understand
why certain people pirate game said that
you live somewhere in the world where a
game will be ludicrously priced like
even even Australia which you would
think they should have reasonable prices
for video games they do not even the
digital marketplaces just it's double
triple quadruple what they charge us for
games here which is ridiculous so I kind
of get that mentality when it's your
only way to stick it to the man is to
steal it I don't necessarily think that
makes it right but I kind of understand
it generically speaking I think that
video game piracy and the drm that it's
created and that companies have created
in lieu of video game piracy are really
really bad things all around I good
customers pay the price because bad
customers don't want to pay when SimCity
launched they said that that it was it
was always online so that they could
make it a better game experience for
everyone do not buy that crap and and
the reason why I can say definitively
now do not buy that crap is that the
game is running offline just fine so it
didn't need to be online at all it's
because they want to make sure that all
the copies are valid and the problem is
that people who are willing to buy them
legitimately are paying the price so I
hate piracy for that but I understand
why some do it you know I think that
stealing is stealing and you should
support developers with with with your
money if you like a game and you want to
see more of it the best way to cast your
vote so to speak is with your wallet so
mmm now Joanne I by no means am I trying
to insinuate that this is piracy but
I've always been curious about this how
do you feel about the humble bundles
because you can purchase those games
without any of the money going to the
developer you can give all the money to
charity if you want well with the Humble
Bundle uh developers make the decision
to be in on it so the Humble Bundle team
will say okay here's here's Humble
Bundle number 5 here's how well these
games did here's how much money
developer a B and C made you know would
you like to be a part of this and then
developers go in knowing that there are
going to be people who drop one penny
one dollar two dollars three dollars in
the bucket but then they also know that
depending on the crowd of games that the
bundle includes there's going to be
people that dropped five thousand ten
thousand fifteen thousand dollars into
the bucket as well they've made a ton of
money and the M games that have been
featured in humble bundles generically
speaking have done very very well so I
mean it's not obviously it's not piracy
but it's also not exactly taking
advantage of the developers either
because they're making good money off
with the program anyway so
okay I was just curious I'd never had a
chance to ask you about that and I
always wondered how you felt about that
in general I courts Todd you know with
piracy in your field that means someone
actually stole a phone ah we're apps for
like gonna cut I mean you can i install
alleged that apps pretty easily if you
you know on android especially or a
jailbroken iphone but you then you worry
about the quality of the app and the
updates and stuff like that I don't know
for me I've always just paid for it and
that's why I actually I love services
like Spotify and google play music and
stuff on that and because now I can get
all the music i want without you know
it's not cheap but it's also not that
expensive either right yeah yeah for me
eowyn while I cover technology i also
someone considered the the streaming
media guy and all that and for me you
know i think that there's such an
abundance of content now i just i don't
understand why anyone would pirate you
just turn on netflix there's gonna be
something you want to watch well though
dad yeah but I was just gonna say the
thing I have it with piracy and movies
and stuff is it movies are still pretty
expensive to rent not that bad pretty
expensive considering you're getting
like what an hour and a half two hours
of entertainment out of it and to own
obscenely expensive because most news
only watch once like I would buy a lot
of movies if they were four bucks but
i'm not spending you know no i agree
with you yeah i mean the the pricing is
out of line and but like for instance
you know I I didn't get a chance to see
machete kills in the theater last year
and I had no interest in buying it on
DVD because I knew I had watched it only
once and sure enough it showed up on
netflix last week I'm like okay so i had
to wait a year right big deal you know i
just turned on netflix and watched it
one morning while doing some work you
know so I i think the miss the quote
unquote necessity of piracy is
definitely dropping in movies and
television because
everything ends up online at some point
right well I mean that the biggest the
biggest and best way for publishers and
I mean games movies music whatever to
combat piracy is to increase
accessibility so do you think that
gamers in Australia would be pirating as
many games as they do now if games were
cheaper and easier to get the answer is
no they would not and that's part of the
reason why schemes wall garden works so
well steam what do you want to admit it
or not is drm that's what it is built on
it is built on the principle of drm but
because valve is so smart about how they
do things and they constantly offer
sales people like it and it makes valve
a ton of money as long as you make
things easy and accessible piracy
becomes a non-factor because why pirate
when you can get a legitimate working
copy of the game for like dollars you
know mmhmm yeah I love ya exactly
exactly well I think that is going to do
it for this week unless you've any final
thoughts I mean I'm just seeing someone
saying not everyone can get netflix you
know like that's exactly what we were
just saying though like we understand
that that piracy is is your your
recourse if you don't have the options
of availability and affordability we
understand that and I'm not chastising
those who are the situation where they
don't have access to these things no of
course them we're chastising those who
have a the money and be the
accessibility to them and pirate anyway
like because they just are standing on
principle that they don't want to pay
for a video game or a movie just support
content creators if you're in a position
to do so support them they need your
support so totally agree totally agree
Todd do you have any final thoughts no I
agree that's well put well Joey can
every once awhile string a thought
together but that was his one for the
day right even working clock is right
twice exactly well as always we
