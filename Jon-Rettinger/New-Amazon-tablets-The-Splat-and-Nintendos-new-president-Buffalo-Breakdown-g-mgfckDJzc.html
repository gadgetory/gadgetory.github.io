we've got some new Amazon tablets and
some 90s kids are going to be very happy
I'm r % / TechnoBuffalo it's Saturday
September 19th and this is the Buffalo
breakdown lots of great stuff to talk
about this week so let's get right into
it this week amazon announced quite a
few new devices first up is the new fire
HD eight inch and 10 inch models the 8
inch model is going to come in a variety
of color options while the 10 is going
to come in black or white the new end
tablets are running amazon's newest
version of their lollipop based fire OS
called bellini the new OS looks a lot
nicer than the previous entries but I'm
not sure about the hardware on these the
resolutions pretty low on both of them
feels very high and I still don't feel
super great about buying it Amazon's
ecosystem not just not sure it makes
sense right now then again they are
crazy cheap so if you're looking for
something that's on the budget and these
have always been a decent choice for the
price of course if you're looking to
really save some money you can also pick
up the newly-announced $50 tablet from
amazon simply dubbed the Amazon fire the
fire seriously crimps on form factor
internals and display but the 50 bucks
they're basically disposable so I really
really curious to see if we already live
in that age of the decent fifty dollar
tablet so when they get to the office
it's definitely gonna be on my radar
plus they have a sweet bulk deal if you
want to buy five of them they'll give
you one more for free so deck out your
entire house I guess I guess every
bathroom in your house has a fire now
the most exciting of these announcements
from amazon though is got to be the new
fire tvs with 4k and the fire TV six
that have Alexa remotes with them the 4k
fire TV is 99 bucks and the fire TV
stick is 49 bucks with the Alexa remote
bundled in which means you can talk to
it do stuff like that used to be like 30
bucks for a fire TV stick and then
another 40 for the remote so now it
comes bundled in at 50 bucks so that's
really great both of them are excellent
options if you're looking for a
streaming setup device for your home for
a little bit of entertainment stuff
those of you who are like me who are
children of the 90s are going to be
super thrilled to hear that many of our
favorite Nickelodeon favorites are going
be hitting the airwaves once again
Nickelodeon's new programming block the
splat will feature all of our favorites
like Rugrats Doug cat dog rocket power
hey arnold and of course who could
forget out real monsters hope lena the
block is set to air on nickelodeon's
existing channels and in their original
forms starting this October Apple's very
first Android app a move to iOS is now
live in the Play Store so if you've been
considering switching away from Android
this should make it really easy to do
then again if you're on an Android
device isn't most of your stuff stored
on google servers anyway and finally
nintendo announced a new president this
week after the passing of the late
Satoru Iwata tatsumi kimishima a
longtime executive of the company will
be the fifth president in there 125
years of operation his responsibilities
began this week on the sixteenth of
September and he's stated that he does
not intend to bring any sweeping changes
to the company it's probably a good
thing and a bad thing Nintendo is one of
a kind you know but they really need to
start making some serious changes more
quickly if we expect to see them stick
around over the next decade that's all

week if you enjoyed this episode you can
