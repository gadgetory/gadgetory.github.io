it from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
showing you guys our top five icon packs
for android now if you're using a custom
launcher like nova launcher
apex action or a v8 launcher you'll be
able to apply these icon packs without a
problem if you haven't checked out our
top five launchers for android we'll put
a link down in the description so make
sure to check that out this list is in
no particular order whatsoever so let's
start off with number one which is Rufus
now this icon pack is free from the
Google Play Store it offers more than
1300 icons that are shaped in a pretty
unique octagon shape complemented by
pastel colors to give the icons a very
unique look the Rufus app offers six
wallpapers to go with the I compact and
you'll also be able to request icons for
apps that aren't fully themed Rufus does
offer icon mask which essentially
overlays a shape over the untamed icons
making sure that the other icons that
you have won't look too different now
moving on to the second one which is
Elune now this one you guys may have
already seen in past videos but this was
my icon pack for over the period of two
months when I was using the galaxy note
4 it's clean simplistic flat and
circular which was something I was
looking for at the time elune is
currently on sale for just 99 cents from
the Google Play Store whereas before
you'd have to pay a dollar 99 cents even
offers more than 3000 icons that are
constantly being updated every week
which is crazy to think about now icons
look pretty sharp the colors aren't as
faded or flat as Rufus though the colors
an eel in really pop you'll also get 31
wallpapers to go along with this icon
pack and ability request icons that
aren't themed similar to Rufus next up
is max O's has I hope I'm saying that
right now this one is probably one of
the first icon pack I ever bought in a
Google Play Store and I was looking for
something flat minimalistic and
something that didn't necessarily use a
shape of some sort the icons aren't
Android lollipop flat meaning the color
palettes aren't the same but it's using
very contrasting colors which is
definitely something different from
themes that were used to seeing on the
Google Play Store Nexus taz is a dollar
49 cents and if you want something
different from the usual Android
lollipop look give this icon pack a try
the fourth one on our list is star Kai
compact no it's not an arm and theme but
it's an icon pack for minimalist it has
over 2100 unique icons rendered for qHD
devices offers
a ton of cloud-based wallpapers within
its app this alongside Nexus tabs were
the very first ones I bought on the
Google Play Store and actually
transition between these two when I
owned the HTC One m7 if you're a fan of
hard edged square icons with a flat
design this is definitely something to
check out it is a bit on the price
you're assigned coming at a dollar
ninety nine cents but if price isn't an
issue then the stark icon pack is
definitely worth checking out now the
fifth and last one on our list is called
giulio probably my new favorite icon
pack just because it's so different from
the rest aren't any colors it's simple
it's white and it's still very flat
looking it comes with over 2000 icons
that are also rendered for qHD devices
and also offers cloud stored wallpapers
just like the start icon pack it also
features icon masking foreign theme
icons and an icon requests full within
the app for any icons that you have that
aren't themed properly you can check out
giulio onto google play store for a
dollar in 56 cents I know it's very
weird pricing but maybe that's why I
like this icon packs so much it's
different from the usual flat material
design icons and speaking of which I
know that was our last one on our list
but I thought I'd also mention moonshine
as a wild card if you're looking for an
icon pack that resembles lollipop then
moonshine is pretty close to that there
are over 750 icons 20 wallpapers and
everything is completely free a new
update which hasn't been released yet
will apparently use the same color
palettes as Android lollipop so once
that update rolls out moonshine should
look pretty much the same as Android
lollipop anyways there you have it guys
let us know in a comment down below
which ones are your favorite icon packs
we're definitely interested in hearing
which ones you guys are using on a daily
basis which ones you want us to check
