techno buffoon here before review the
Android phone a lot of you have been
waiting for this is a Motorola Droid Pro
let's go ahead and dig in and see if
your weights gonna be rewarded
so before I start my phone reviews I
always start with call quality no matter
what the phone can do for a future
standpoint it's not gonna make good
phone calls for you
it's just not gonna be worth your money
so when I do my phone test I do a twenty
call test in various areas of Southern
California test for signal strength
called degradation and dropped calls so
at my twenty call test I had no drop
call was able to maintain a very strong
signal strength compared to other
Verizon phones and certainly using the
bar method so by appending a how many
bars of service you have is certainly
arbitrary and relies on sort of
proprietary algorithms but the reception
here was very strong again no drop calls
I had no white noise on my end the other
end the call had no white noise there
was no popping the Bluetooth illness was
actually outstanding connected to the
Bluetooth speaker in my car I was able
to take the phone very far away and
still maintain a static free connection
it sounds probably one of the strongest
Bluetooth radios of any phone that I've
tested speaker phone volume was average
if you speakerphone a while in a loud
place you're gonna be able to hear it
it's not gonna be booming loud but you
will probably be able to hear the caller
on the other end the microphone seems to
be very sensitive so if there is a lot
of background noise going on the caller
is most definitely going to hear it
so from a call standpoint this phone has
actually been one of the best that I've
tested it was loud crisp and clear so
now let's go ahead and talk about the
specs let me run through them real
quickly it's not a three point one inch
TFT experience the resolution of 320 by
480 which will most definitely talk
about it's got a 1412 20 milliamp hour
battery good for and advertised
supposedly seven hours of battery life
on the back of the phone it has a five
megapixel camera with autofocus an
actually dual LED flash from design
standpoint serve as that Motorola humph
seeing on a few other devices and most
notably the Droid X it is running
Android 2.2 with motoblur sitting on top
of it it's the less obtrusive version of
motoblur it's actually the version that
I prefer most that doesn't have the sort
of color arrays at the bottom and in
some versions of modal blur you don't
have the four capacitive Android buttons
you're missing the search but that is of
course a present here as well it's being
powered by a TI OMAP processor plucking
in at 1 gigahertz and it's got 512
megabytes of RAM camera quality was
average about what you'd expect from a 5
megapixel phone it does take HD video at
720p it was again just about average and
comparable with other cameras of similar
quality but that's not the reason that
most you are considering the Droid Pro
the reason probably you're looking at
this phone is because of what sits below
that 3.1 inch screen and that is this
fantastic full QWERTY keyboard a very
reminiscent of BlackBerry Bold devices
that's sort of that dual angled key so
it's almost slanted on each side so
while there is an actually physical
space between each two you can feel each
button very nicely
it's got a really nice big space bar
which I really enjoy using I like the
voice search function right on here on
the phone and the keyboard is absolutely
fantastic you can use on-screen
keyboards if you choose to but I don't
know why you would with the keyboard
this good this is the form factor a lot
of people have been waiting for and I
found it to be just quite nice and easy
to use and as you're typing you get the
autocorrect at the bottom as opposed to
maybe showing up the top where you may
have seen it before it's a lot easier
for your eyes as you're looking down at
the keyboard to type and you've got the
correction showing right up at top so a
keyboard wise this is definitely one of
the better phones out there if you need
a full QWERTY physical keyboard I know a
lot of you do this is really one of your
best choices it's got that familiar
blackberry form factor a lot of these
slide-out Android phones that we've seen
have a slide mechanism that comes out
from the side revealing the screen so
one of the sacrifices that you do make
for that full QWERTY keyboard is in
screen real estate 3 point
the screen is very very very small but
unfortunately there's not much that
Motorola and Verizon can do about the
screen size because you have over three
inch screen and a full keyboard below it
the phone is gonna be a bit on the
larger side if I bring in a 4.3 inch
phone here like the Evo 4G you'll notice
that there's really not that much
difference lengthwise so you can't have
a phone any bigger and you can't really
ask for a bigger screen because the
phone's not going to fit in your pocket
the resolution on the screen the 320 by
480 really was disappointing looking at
websites and looking at pictures the
text wasn't as clear as I would have
liked it to have been and the screen did
appear a bit washed out now that maybe
to the fact that this phone probably
shows brightness and gets brighter than
many other phones I've tested I've got
the brightness here right now turned
down almost all the way down actually
I'll show you how far down it is in the
phone is still extremely bright I'm
kicking the brightness up all the way
it's almost going to be blinding see how
far down it is right there all right
let's go ahead and take a look at a
website as I was mentioning here when
launched yet we've got we should have
TechnoBuffalo you're queuing and loading
and you will see Flash content actually
loading here as well which is quite nice
this does have Android 2 points you want
it so you will have full flash 10.1
support and it works very well it's
smooth the TI OMAP processor really does
a nice job keeping up the 512 megabytes
of RAM certainly helped aid in that so
Willow TechnoBuffalo here and we are on
Verizon's EVDO network which i guess
with the announcement of LTE you can
almost call legacy network so here it is
loading the flash clock that takes a bit
longer to load you can turn the flash
content off if you like you can don't
want to view and save your battery life
we can see it here working on a lot of
underpowered phones that do show flash
content pinch-to-zoom is very slow and a
little bit laggy not so on the Droid Pro
really does work very well despite flash
content there it almost does the
pinch-to-zoom multi-touch gestures as if
flash content wasn't even there so a big
I guess thumbs up to Motorola for really
a maximum
the hardware and the software put
together in a really outstanding package
battery life on the phone has not been
outstanding they claim seven hours of
battery life I'm a pretty heavy phone
user so I'm using email on watching an
occasional YouTube video a lot of web
browsing and texting and I had a hard
time getting through today generally by
the time the day ended I'd have about 10
ish percent now other people who have
used this phone I've got a few friends
who use the Droid Pro have to charge the
phone almost twice a day in fact
Motorola and Verizon offer larger
capacity batteries because that may be a
known problem so if you are a heavy user
you may want to that explore a bigger
battery option or you're going to have
to very diligently manage your battery
life overall on sort of put this package
together really is the phone that a lot
of business professionals we're looking
for people love the BlackBerry S form
factor of the QWERTY keyboard below
touch screen and or blow a screen rather
and the Droid Pro is really the only
phone that offers that and it doesn't a
very nice package even though the phone
and the screen is a little bit smaller
than I would have liked it's really the
biggest again that Motorola can do I
work like the higher resolution screen
on I think it would make the text pop a
little bit more but it definitely is
forgivable so on a one to five scale
this to form fax you're looking for this
phone is going to get a very solid four
and a half losing out on that half
because of the low resolution screen and
the knock-on battery life if this is a
four factor for you you can pick up this
phone and be very confident that you're
getting a very modern really capable
Android phone there's a lot of phones
out there to choose from and this one
really does a nice job of rising to the
surface above the rest of the Android
phones so I love to hear what you guys
think about the Droid pros at the phone
for you not for you if you like the form
factor you want a bigger screen you can
give up the QWERTY keyboard you know a
lot of options here I know you guys I'm
