TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the new iPad that is supposedly letter
than air although I can feel a little
something in this box let's go ahead
open it up and see what the latest
tablet from Apple passed off so very
familiar box for the iPad air you got a
picture of the iPad air on the front you
can see those are iOS 7 icons iPad air
right there on the side we've got the
I'm not going to call it white version
we've got the silver it also comes in
Space Gray but don't call it black we've
got the 16 gigabyte model here prices
are going to range from $499 all the way
up to 929 if you want to get the carrier
version and 128 gigs of storage so a lot
of storage space available rip off the
plastic I'm really excited to see this
Apple's announcement made it seem really
light and thin so see if that was just
Apple hype or actual real reality here I
also go ahead and take off the top of
the box ready boom iPad air and it looks
like an iPad at the same 9.7 inch screen
now it's a Retina display so that's 248
by 1536 with a 264 PPI we'll pull it off
definitely feels much lighter I will I
will give them that push it off the side
for just a quick second so what else we
are going to have in the box we've got a
little booklet with little booklet
things in it
iPad air about it with the things our
iPad info and 2 Apple stickers got a
lightning cable and a wall work nothing
else over the exciting there here though
is the reason you are all here this is
the iPad air father one time is how it's
not going to have just gross crazy
fingerprints on it well go ahead and
appeal is offer a push you get that
satisfying noise from design standpoint
it looks sort of like the iPad Mini
design language and then there is the
back I will say though from the
standpoint of lighter-than-air I
expected a tablet to feel not like
anything does have some weight to it it
certainly feels much lighter though than
the last generation iPad 4 other than
that though thinks you look pretty much
the same on left-hand side we've got
nothing on the right you've got your
volume up and down
then your profile switch or if you want
to set that to rotation lock you can do
that power and lock there's a microphone
there's a 3.5 millimeter headset jack we
now have stereo speakers on the bottom
now which is quite nice they're both
rear-facing as opposed to one on top one
on bottom and there is your lightning
port Apple logo 5 megapixel camera
living right there on the back and then
a FaceTime HD camera on front Wi-Fi 8 or
2 11 ABG nn it's a dual channel and MIMO
which is kind of nice and it weighs 16
ounces it's go ahead and fire it on real
quick and take a look we've got this guy
all fired up if you've used iOS 7 on an
iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s it can look very
familiar here you've got parallax the
background which makes it sort of kind
of look 3d go into settings since you're
going to look very familiar here all the
stuff that you are used to seeing I'll
go and take a look at general and go to
about just to see what we got here and
version 7.0 point 3 as what's shipping
with this tablet not though nothing else
really new here the big story is about
the design and of course the speed it's
the a7 chip with 64-bit architecture and
the m7 motion coprocessor
so this shares the processing with the
iPhone 5s traditionally the iPads have
had sort of a faster processor bradley
brought that up to parity and this is
the same processor it's going to be
found on the upcoming iPad Mini with the
retina display it does feel really light
definitely feels much thinner and
lighter than the outgoing model and
speaking of which let's go ahead and
bring that in now I can't really show
you how much lighter it feels but I
can't show you is the thinness the - you
can see a mono speaker versus stereo
here - more refined design I think on
the iPad air certainly falls in line
with what I think was a great design on
the iPad Mini so you can see these two
here side-by-side slim down bezels a
little bit from the four - yes we want
to call it iPad 5 or the iPad air I can
certainly see a difference the feels
really light if you're the kind of
person that likes a larger tablet in the
nine point seven inch screen I was going
to be great for you certainly I'll put
it through its paces oh and let you know
what we think until then though leave
your comments down below let us know
what you want to see or not see from our
coverage of the iPad air I'll put the
