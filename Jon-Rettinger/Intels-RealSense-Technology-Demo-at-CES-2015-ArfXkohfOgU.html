technobuffalo here we're at CES 2015 at
the intel booth taking out their real
sense technology it does a ton of cool
stuff they're highlighting it by showing
that you can focus your pictures
afterwards and to that i say what we've
done for me lately we've seen that
before someone tells like all right John
will show you some of the other cool
stuff it can do so they go ahead and
show you how some of the ridiculous
stuff that is actually out now and is
happening using Intel's real sense
technology so when I first watched our
Wars we were promised Holograms and we
have not had those yet looks like that
might be coming closer to reality using
some of the cameras here on Intel's real
sense technology so I see down here
looks like it is raised up and it is in
fact not raised up at all but the cool
thing is you can interact with it so
here's some stuff I can talk about the
weather I've want to learn about the
solar system i can just almost touch
right up there and i did actually make
contact with anything and now i can see
the planets moving I can learn about
Mars or Uranus and learn all about the
planets talking to other applications
the things you can do here like keyboard
for example I can look like I'm playing
some music if I had any musical ability
here and then just taking advantage
using a very interesting sort of
selection of sensors and camera raise
and of course social media because
that's important check out real sense at
CES a lot of other kind of cool
applications you can do here so we could
talk to these ladies they could show us
some the other stuff that you can do
with real sense but instead of just
watching a video let me show you it's on
the other stuff not Halle Graeme but but
equally cool all right so another cool
thing you can do is actually put
yourself inside of games you can see the
orc looking guy on the left is actually
a voice actor that I can talk to live
with the headset you can put yourself
inside here and you're probably saying
hey my webcam could do that like four
years ago not like this not as
accurately consents any where your head
is using real sense technology so Matt
you're putting yourself inside our video
game experience I know what you guys are
thinking it's not not for that kind of
use for gaming so we're gonna put the
headset on and show you what it looks
like
we stopped the video just real fast to
thank our friends and good peeps at
lenovo yoga is not just for people in
stretch pants anymore want a you guys
about the yoga tablets to pro is a
full-featured multimedia tablet that
gives you just a new way to entertain
you ever been just like watching a video
you're like all wish i could show this
to somebody well things got a freaking
projector built into it i can show a
50-inch image on any wall or screen that
kind of mobilize your home theater it's
got a rock in 13.3 inch 2560 x 1440
pixel resolutions you're not gonna miss
a thing it's great for work and play
watching videos or when your boss comes
and make it look like you're doing some
work I don't blame you I like the orc to
all right go thank you very much I
appreciate it have a good rest of the
day you too that was cool I got to be
that Jimmy Neutron looking guy and I got
to have a conversation with an actual
org so entails also showing some crazy
3d scanning and three printing
technology using this real sense Tech
which is really cool and really coming
do things here at CES kind of get me
excited to see the future and the future
is definitely a lot of cameras 3d
scanning and being able to sort of use
virtual services interact with just
really interesting and kind of fun to
see hope you guys had as much fun as I
did take a look at this till next time
