technobuffalo here with a full review
for you of the HTC AT&amp;amp;T one let's go I
put this guy through its paces and see
if it deserves a spot in your pocket
alright so in this video I'm going to
update the things I talked about in the
initial review of the HTC One as a
reminder that was a unlocked non carrier
branded unit so as part of our pledge to
TechnoBuffalo viewers i will say we use
this device for five and a half days
before putting out this full review we
got it several days before we're
actually able to publish videos that's
why three of you is coming out the same
day as the unboxing did alright so a few
things are different here than the
previous unit that we tested first got a
teeny tiny little AT&amp;amp;T branded logo on
the back I really like what AT&amp;amp;T and HTC
have done that's the only carrier
branding on here very subtle and really
nice so the big addition is the
inclusion of LTE and the big question
about that with none was gonna be a
drain on battery I actually found the
battery in the HTC One an initial review
to be pretty solid I was able to get
through a full day no problem LTE
drained it somewhere between three and
six ish percent so not as much as I
expected and I will say my daily usage
generally comes off the charger around
7-730 goes back on the charger around
midnight about two ish hours of phone
call it generally connected to Wi-Fi
when I'm at the office or at home play
some games some texts maybe watch a
YouTube video or two but I'm easily able
to get through a full day I did try and
push it and watch more YouTube videos
unusual about 45 ish minutes of video
and I've still was able to get through a
full day I was a little bit concerned
about how battery life is going to be
with LTE but it wasn't an issue here
either so one of the problems that I had
with the unlocked unit was GPS I had a
hard time picking up a signal I'm not so
here with ATT and I was able to pick up
a GPS location really quick so using
things like Foursquare wanted to check
in it was very fast google maps and
everything else made for a very quick
experience so that was a nice
improvement over the previous HTC One so
which is a refresher things I liked
about the HTC One I still stand here
other review in the unlock
unit got a 9.5 one of our highest review
Evers ever and I did say it was one of
the phones that I would sign a two-year
contract to very happily I love
everything about this phone from the
aluminum back to the way the phone feels
sort of the cool touch that it's got to
the hand that you pick it up in the
morning to that gorgeous 4.7 inch 1080p
screen everything about this phone
screams high quality to speakers here
and boom sounds and absolutely great
it's not going to do any justice to show
you what the speaker sound like or put
video on here I just got to go from here
it's in the microphone to you guys but
suffice to say speakers on this guy are
incredibly awesome so I do the same
thing I did with blinkfeed I go and push
it off all the way over to the left hand
side screen you can choose to do what
you want I when you click an article
like hey here's TechnoBuffalo on
blinkfeed about plop an article inside
of a mini viewer I really like that as
well the other things that I liked again
are all still here pictures and video
look absolutely awesome so here's a
gallery shot you can see Lucien Mercedes
look pretty great a picture i took with
the ultrapixel camera we ran through a
full test of the ultrapixel camera with
a ton of other cameras you up decide
whether or not it's going to be good for
you but the moral is the picture quality
came out awesome and video quality came
out awesome the only time that it wasn't
sort of one of the top performers when
you had to do a lot of digital zoom with
it so bear that in mind as well
everything else here is pretty much
exactly as it was with the last review
overall just a really impressive phone
if you're trying to decide what phone to
get you really owe yourself to look at
the HTC One this again it's the first
phone since the iphone 4 that I would
have really happily signed a two-year
contract on everything about this phone
I like for the way it feels it's how
fast it is a quad-core snapdragon
shipping here is blazing fast this thing
just blew away everything else I've
tested so the dick Kerr pair since how
it's going to perform against the galaxy
s4 whether or not you want to do a
head-to-head shopping with the two for
my money though I would pick up the HTC
One at least right now and certain we
haven't tested the galaxy s4 yet someone
the knocks on it is not an immovable
battery so if you like to carry to
supper batteries and you're going to
want to look elsewhere or if you want
expandable storage just comes in 32 or
64-bit configurations on AT&amp;amp;T so I would
have liked you've had expandable storage
the non removable battery isn't so much
an issue for me when I travel usually
I'll carry an external battery with me
any way that I can just plug in
and charged I can charge a time devices
not just for a phone that's never been a
problem attorney i would have liked
you've had expandable storage that's
really only knock on otherwise
incredibly stellar phone so again if
you're looking to get a phone over the
next few months really owed yourself to
look at HTC one that's coming to sprint
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile unfortunately nothing
for verizon everything about the phone
screams high quality and this would be 1
i'd be happy to carry for the next two
years so in our initial review of the
HTC one we actually tested two different
devices we got a pre-production unit in
and then we got an actual production
model and it was very cool and easy to
transfer from one to the other HTC has
an awesome backup solution that works
very similar to iCloud backs but backs
up everything you could be stored
directly to a new phone so I thought was
going to be very simple to switch over
to the 18-team model but unfortunately
HTC backup doesn't work on the AT&amp;amp;T
model instead they trying to push you to
use AT&amp;amp;T zone backup service now that's
unique to the AT&amp;amp;T model if you want to
use the t-mobile version there sprint
version you'll be able to use HTC's
backup there's something to keep in mind
you can't transfer them I'm very easily
using Wi-Fi coming from an Apple device
samsung LG whatever that curator might
be but if you're coming from HTC device
to the new HTC One the backup model made
things really easy but unfortunately
it's not here I hope you guys enjoyed
please give this video a thumbs up and
again link is gonna be down below to our
full review of HTC One the unlocked
model we've updated that review to
reflect we found with the carrier unit
so to hear your thoughts on that as well
again i'm drowning red rope
technobuffalo give this video a thumbs
up we definitely appreciate it and i
will see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
