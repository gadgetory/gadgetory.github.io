technobuffalo on to talk about apple fun
given some of the brouhaha brewing over
that company Tesla Motors a new york
times review and questions about battery
life we thought it'd be appropriate to
ask jon rettinger about this why well
hey he thinks it's phony or at least
thinks that the New York Times has
gotten something wrong and two he's on
the waiting list to buy one of these
cars so John you apparently know from
which you speak why do you then side
with musk and doubt the new york times
article so i'm not coming out and saying
anything was fabricated but a few things
definitely show it's a little bit fishy
first the Tesla is equipped with a 3g
radio that gives to come to the ability
to track pretty much everything at the
car is doing so charge total charge and
miles well they're not customers want
that's another discussion so they are
aware of the miles the car can drive
second of all if your car can drive 300
miles are you going to plan a 350 mile
road trip without stopping at a gas
station just to make a point they are
aware of the mileage range there's an EP
a range of 265 miles and a potential
range of 300 real world driving you
don't get that 300 miles so certainly
electric driving is different than
traditional internal combustion engine
but you have to live with those
limitations and it does not sound as if
that was done at all their sweet Roger
locations they're charging locations you
don't drive farther than their range
tells you and then be surprised when
your car stops in other words the test
this wasn't good enough I mean you're
saying it's not fabricated but maybe the
test wasn't rigorous enough it wasn't
accurate enough it just wasn't good
enough so the test isn't testing what
the car can actually do I mean certainly
driving outside of the range just to
make a point take a picture on a flatbed
is dramatic and it certainly makes a
very strong point but there also are
strong influences against the electric
car industry whether or not those played
a part in the review you know you'd have
to ask the author but the car has a
rated range to plan a trip longer than
that rated range is foolish and you
can't hold a car accountability wouldn't
hold any internal-combustion car
accountable for running out of gas that
is on the driver solely making sure you
fill up whether it's in electrons or in
gasoline and we've just actually been
watching the losses on the stock being
paired is now down only about six tenths
/ / said it was down by over one percent
earlier
Ron I want to quickly ask you you're on
the waitlist abaya Tesla right you
really like this guy you are poking out
that amount of money you are backing
this car I am back in the car and I'm
back to the company not from a green
standpoint like a lot of people out
there as a gearhead to have that instant
torque and at 0 to 60 times convertible
with a 911 the performance model is
absolutely incredible i love its
american company creating American jobs
right here in California you know John
we got to go but quickly listeners no
doubt electric cars are faster i drove
the roads to rest the first test letting
the thing just goes because there's no
combustion lag on the engine but 45
minutes to charge don't you think that's
a drawback so to get a full charge
absolutely but from a supercharger you
can get up to eighty percent charge in
just 30 minutes now certainly there's
not a time parody with internal
combustion but that's pretty darn good
