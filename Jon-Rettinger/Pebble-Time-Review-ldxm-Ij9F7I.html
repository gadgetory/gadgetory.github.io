it from TechnoBuffalo and what time is
it
it's pebble time wait was that corny
yeah it probably was today we'll be
taking a closer look at the latest
wearable from pebble the pebble time
I'll be using the time for about two and
a half weeks already and I think it's
time to give you guys our full review
the pebble time is different from past
pebbles and that it has a more
attractive rounded design along with a
colored e-ink display it's fairly thin
and looks a lot like the Apple watch
from afar it's also very lightweight and
water resistant for up to 30 meters
which means you can take the wearable
for a quick surf sesh if you're looking
for a stylish SmartWatch that can double
as a luxury timepiece the pebble time is
neither like its predecessor the pebble
time is more geek than stylish though
that's not necessarily a bad thing it
doesn't look as premium as something
like the watch or Bane but it is a
comfortable watched it doesn't feel too
bulky like other smartwatches you'll be
able to replace the stock 22 millimeter
silicone band with other third-party 22
millimeter bands the real differentiator
between the time and the original pebble
is the display which is now in color
instead of going with an OLED panel or
LCD panel pebble opted for a colored he
Inc display which means that the screen
isn't as bright and luminous as other
smartwatches with an OLED panel however
there are some advantages to this
technology one the display is always on
so there's no need to press a button or
flick your wrist to see what time it is
to the display is easy to look at under
really bright sunlight which is where
other smart watches like the Apple watch
fall short
however the pebble x e ink display
struggles in low-light situations there
is an LED backlight that you can turn on
when you flick your wrist but the
backlight is pretty weak and turns off
after a few seconds which can be a bit
frustrating if you're trying to read
your notifications as of now there
aren't any options to tweak the
backlight but hopefully a firmware
update in the future will make the
backlight better a one thing that I
didn't like so much about the x display
were the huge bezels there's a bunch of
wasted space all around a display and I
would have liked to see pebble minimize
this it's exacerbated even further by
the times bright colors which makes the
bezel stand out even more when it comes
to performance the pebble time is much
better than its predecessor I haven't
run into any issues yet everything is
smooth and lag free going through
different menus reading notifications
and changing watch faces all felt
smooth and instantaneous despite two new
animations and speaking of the new
animations I'm still on a fence with
this while the UI provides a very
refreshing look to pebbles new
SmartWatch the new animations make it
feel like I'm using a kids toy
maybe it's something I'll eventually get
used to but so far I'm so on the fence
about it just like the original pebble
you need to pair the watch for the phone
in order for it to work there's a new
pebble time app which is available on
both Android and iOS once you have the
SmartWatch paired you can start
downloading new watch faces apps and
games there are over 8,000 apps
available in the pebble app store from
uber misfit ESPN jawbone plus thousands
of independent apps and hundreds of
watch faces that are designed
specifically for the new colored eye ink
display the biggest addition to the
pebble times new software would probably
be the new Timeline feature which lets
you see your upcoming schedule and also
see what you might have missed recently
by pressing on the up and down buttons
it'll also show you the weather
information for the day along with the
sunset and sunrise which is handy the
new Timeline feature also supports
third-party apps like ESPN for example
will show sports scores in upcoming
games uber will show you the estimated
time for your ride which is pretty neat
the idea behind this timeline metaphor
is that you no longer need to launch an
app to find out information you can
simply look at your timeline and see
your information front and center just
like other smartwatches you'll be able
to receive text messages as for what you
can do with those well you can only
reply to a text message if you're using
an Android device due to a restriction
in iOS users who are using an iPhone
will only be able to dismiss a message
and nothing more on Android you'll be
able to choose from a list of can
responses or respond by voice it was
pretty accurate most of the time though
it wasn't as fast as something like
Google now on Android wear when it comes
to battery life probably promised the
time could last an entire week but from
my experience the time only lasted about
five days six if I was using to watch
very lightly I had a pair to my Nexus 6
the first week I had it and paired it
with my iPhone 6 the second week I
didn't really notice the difference in
battery life when I switched from the
Nexus 6 to my iPhone 6 but you do get
more features using an Android device
such as replying to text messages if
you're looking for a SmartWatch that
features an always-on screen offers
great battery life and compatibility
with both Android and iOS the pebble
time could be your next SmartWatch of
course it isn't as luxurious looking as
the
watch or some of the more fancier
looking Android wear devices but it sure
is a nice alternative to the other two
platforms the pebble time is available
for pre-order for $199 at the time of
making this video and will be available
by the end of July anyways thank you
guys so much for watching and if you
guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs
up and we will see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
