coverage what's up everyone jon
rettinger from technobuffalo here and we
are at CES 2012 take a look at the just
announced and now official galaxy note
for those guys that is a TNT go in and
closer i'd say a little bit of a closer
look at it here is the unlocked version
on the AT&amp;amp;T us one you've got four
capacitive buttons here at the bottom as
opposed to that one giant home button in
the middle so is supporting LTE it's got
the same specs are used to 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core chip 1 gig of ram a megapixel
camera on the back 16 gigs of storage a
little bit different here than the
european version it's got a bit of a
texture to it but it is that Samsung
plastic got that shiny vs. almost matte
plastic doll so no see you're getting a
five by five grit so you can see a lot
more with that 1280 x 800 screen
extremely a high resolution display so
i'll go ahead and go back and also with
the galaxy note bumpit back there is the
S Pen it's not a stylist it's not a
capacitor Silas fix advantage of a Wacom
technology then go ahead and use use it
to scroll around you can also go ahead
and write things like normal I'll go
into your real quick example that let's
go ahead and jump into the notes
application there's S Memo now you can
see some doodles I've been done here we
go ahead and open up a new one and you
go ahead and pick the pen size or pen
color as you push pressure in you go
ahead and get a thicker line there's a
little bit of a button on there if you
take the button and you'll hold it down
and hold that on the screen you take a
screenshot for you which you can go
ahead and edit so green google map for
something you don't to send directions
you go and do that so that is the S Pen
technology open API so developers can go
ahead and develop for it so around you
got a front facing camera i believe 1.3
megapixels 8 megapixel sensor on the
back you can shoot full 1080p video with
the LED flash on this guy is going to be
available in the coming months it's
going to launch with gingerbread man ice
cream sandwich is coming soon
and again it is one of the new LTE
devices at 18 10 ounce let's bring in
another phone you might know so this is
the 5.3 inch display let's bring in a
3.5 inch display this guy's in a case
too so it's got a little bit thick and
heft to it let's look at that screen
size it is like daddy and son here when
it comes to green size but it can
definitely see the difference now
surprisingly this is a pocketable phone
I've done this before that's a big
question can it fit in your pocket and
the answer is yeah it definitely can it
doesn't even look that bad you can sit
down you can do a little dances with it
without a problem the other question I
always get is how does it look up to
your face here's what it looks like and
it definitely does take some getting
used to out of all the phones I've
tested I have never gotten more people
looking at me strange II like what is
that then I've been using the Galaxy
Note so we can make a galaxy note love
fest here I'm drawn right in German
techno Buffalo and i'll see you guys in
the next video bye bye sync applink the
game trading technology lets you use
your voice to control mobile apps on
your phone like pandora internet radio
iheartradio stitcher smart radio slacker
radio and more look for more apps be
announced at the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
