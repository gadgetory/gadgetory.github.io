TechnoBuffalo and this is an overview
for you of the HTC Desire this is one of
HTC's newest Android devices back at
Mobile World Congress they announced
this device along with the HTC legend
and the HD Mini and of those three
devices the desire this one right here
is absolutely the most powerful device
that HTC has ever released that runs the
Android platform on the inside it's very
much like a Google Nexus One but
actually a little bit better it's got
the qualcomm 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor and it has a tremendous 576
megabytes of RAM compared to the Nexus 1
which has 512 megabytes of RAM that's
still a lot so let's talk about the
hardware on the HTC Desire then we're
gonna get into the web browsing and
we're going to talk about the Sense
interface really everything else so the
screen is 3.7 inches diagonal as a
comparison to the iPhone that is point
two inches bigger also the screen is
much higher resolution
so we've 800 down and 480 across whereas
the iPhone is 480 down and 320 across
which means on the desire icons are
super crisp text to super crisp photos
look fantastic and video comes through
very very nicely compared to a device
like the HD 2 well then the desire
doesn't look so impressive anymore the
the HD 2 has a 4.3 inch screen but it
has the same resolution 800 down and 480
across now the screen on the desire uses
AM OLED technology like the Nexus One
which means that blacks are ultra black
and power consumption is improved so
let's take a look around the device new
to this device compared to the Nexus One
is that it has a slight chin and the
benefit of the chin is that it raises
the optical d-pad slightly towards the
user so that's very very comfortable to
hold in one hand and to navigate like so
on the Nexus One if you remember there
is a d-pad but it's mechanical and it's
placed a little bit further below the
row of buttons down towards here those
mechanical D pads aren't as nice as the
optical keypads they're not as
they can get covered with dust and move
slower and those sorts of things on the
side with a volume rocker on the top
there's a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and the standby button nothing on this
side on the back we have a 5 megapixel
camera like the nexus one and we have a
single LED flash with a speaker large
HTC branding we have this nice rubbery
coating on the back so it feels really
secure in the hand it's also a bit
thicker than the Nexus 1 by a fraction
of a millimeter although it after after
but after having used both devices I can
say that the desire feels significantly
thicker but I really don't mind because
it makes the device feel more sturdy in
hand for some reason okay so let's turn
on the device and talk about the Sense
UI experience all right so I'm going to
unlock the device and look at this
really cool background animation this is
Android 2.1 which means that it supports
live wallpaper so I'm going to go over
to a blank screen and you can see the
really awesome looking live wallpaper
and I'm going to change the wallpaper to
something else so we've got a live
wallpaper and this particular one you
just saw is HTC's own live wallpaper but
of course we have the other ones that
come from the Google Nexus 1 so we can
choose the nexus wallpaper which is
quite cool anywhere you tak you'll see
kind of a ray of light with lots of
colors coming from there so we'll leave
that on for now let's talk about the
Sense interface so the Sense interface
is comprised of seven home screens onto
which you can put a ton of awesome
widgets and thanks to the really fast
processor and the large amount of RAM
these widgets perform very very well the
best we've seen yet now a problem with
having seven home screens and I'm going
to go through these in a second is how
do you get from the one all the way on
the left to the one all the way on the
right well this was a problem in
previous devices from HTC but now they
have this pinch feature where you pinch
of your fingers and you get a zoomed out
view of all of your different home
screens you can quickly jump around so I
can go to the weather I can go to the
one all the way on the right or the one
all the way on the left it's a very very
smart way that HTC's
to get around your home screens
furthermore you can get to that zoomed
out view by tapping on the home screen
button when you're on the home screen
okay so let me show you how I have my
home screens laid out then I'm going to
show you some other configurations that
you can have so right here I've got the
clock and the time of course and the the
weather so if I tap on the clock I am
taken to this beautiful HTC Sense
interface where I can change the alarm
where I can use a stopwatch so on and so
forth I get to see my weather I can quit
dial somebody that I call on a regular
basis I can go right into settings I've
got my mail here calendar internet
things like that if I go over to the
left I've got Twitter so I can in an
instant type what I'm doing I'm going to
Opera Mini got the XD application here
I've got a link to peep which is the
full HTC Twitter application which works
quite well and I also have in a shortcut
to a website over here on the Left I
have the weather and all the way on the
Left I haven't put anything here yet so
I'm going to go back to the center to
the right I have a list of my favourite
people with beautiful pictures to the
right of that I have the text messaging
carousel so I can flick through my text
messages like so and on the right I have
nothing now I'm going to change my scene
and scenes are from HTC that allow you
to have different widget configurations
so let's say you want one scene for the
weekend one scene for the work day one
scene when you're traveling so let's go
into scenes and I'm going to go to
social and I don't want to save my scene
and so we get a totally different widget
configuration we have this big clock
here over on the left we have an email
over on the Left we have a friend stream
which will actually pull from a
multitude of social networks right now I
have it pulling from just Twitter we
have a nice calendar here which
integrates with HTC's calendar
application that's a lot nicer than what
you get with just standard Android going
over to the right we had a different way
of looking at the favorites if you
remember on the previous screen
I had favourites arranged in a two by
three grid and now it's over
one by three grid and then I also have a
quick toggle for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and
the camera there's the text messaging
again nothing is over there so let's
jump to another scene let's go to travel
this time okay so here I have two
different clocks and you can see the
background just changed these clocks let
me see the time in two different areas
and here's email again this is HTC's
footprints which allows you to tag
coordinates to a picture and you can add
more information about a particular
place that you've been so this is
assuming that you're traveling it's also
going to load the weather and you can
flick between multiple areas for the
weather quite nice
over here on the right I have a music
player right on the home screen friends
stream so I can update my status to
multiple places at one time the calendar
and then there's nothing over there
let's jump to another scene this time
we're going to go to work let's see what
HTC thinks we should look at for our
work scene so the background is probably
going to change and it did so here we
have calendar right out in front so you
know where you need to be to the left we
have email to the left of that we have
stocks and Calendar let's go back to the
middle here's the same looking thing we
get a quick view of the weather and of
course tapping on that will bring you
into HTC's weather application to the
right of that we have news and we can
subscribe to oh saint BBC news and very
fast that's going to load news headlines
you can scroll through very elegantly
and to the right there is nothing let's
go to the one one more scene just to
make sure we have all the different
widgets go to play
and here's clay we get a similar-looking
clock to what we had before we can set a
new photo album so I'm going to go to
all photos here and now that is buzz
killington now I can flick through and I
can see all of my pictures right on my
home screen very handy if you've just
been somewhere you want to show your
friends where you've been you can tap on
a picture and it will zoom in and you
get this beautiful photo display we can
go into landscape and this is your photo
gallery and you can tap on a particular
photo to make it bigger and of course
you have really fantastic multi-touch to
zoom in on the image let's see what else
we have here
the friend stream once again makes an
appearance and weather is back again and
over here on the right we have a
different look to the music widget what
happens is that when you add these
widgets you can choose a variety of
different layouts and here's the
bookmarks widget you haven't yet seen
that so if I tap and hold and I go to
widget any one that you see designated
with the HTC lettering means it's one of
the HTC is made and and and it's better
than the Android counterpart that exists
on these devices so if I go to say music
HTC I get a two different choices of how
I want the widget to look I can go for
the small widget or for the larger
widget I'm gonna choose the larger
widget and here it is right on the home
screen and of course I can delete it so
in terms of widgets in terms of
performance of the home screens HTC has
nailed it I find myself staying on the
home screens and not actually having to
dig into any applications because these
widgets are so powerful that they are
applications themselves and thanks to
the really fast processor and the huge
amount of RAM the operation is super
smooth
whereas on some earlier devices that had
these widgets like the HTC Hero
performance wasn't as good okay so let's
take a look at the Internet the web
browser so I'm going to go to
TechnoBuffalo
and so here we go
and by the way the screen on this device
seems to be more solid than it is on the
Nexus one kind of like the iPhone so
typing on it just feels more solid okay
so here it is it's already coming up we
can go into landscape I'm going to zoom
in here Internet performance is really
fantastic on the HTC Desire let's go to
Engadget and we have the other other
kind of keyboard here I should learn how
to spell alright let's see how fast that
comes up and we've got the mobile view
here so let's find classic here it is
full and gadge experience
okay so I'm gonna pan around here very
smooth I don't see any checker boards to
zoom in of course I can DoubleTap
reflows the column where I can pinch
very precise zoom control let's see how
fast this web browser is compared to the
iPhone okay so here we go we've got the
iPhone 3GS here on the right and the HTC
Desire on the left let's go to a website
let's go to pocketnow.com
and we'll bring it up there and have to
type the whole thing it looks like that
there it goes so I'm going to tap them
at the same time if possible one two
three they're both on the same Wi-Fi
network and they're off
very very close oh it looks like the
desire won by half of a second that was
very impressive
well actually it seems to be loading
more stuff now okay so let's move around
on the page and click on a permalink so
let's go to here and this I have to say
that the multi-touch is more smooth on
the iPhone but the desire is definitely
capable and something I want you to
notice is the difference in screen
clarity so if you look at these two
images here it looks so much more
lifelike on the AMOLED display compared
to the iPhone you can see that the
iPhone just kind of seems washed out so
I'm going to tap on these headlines at
the same time and hopefully they will
load okay and they're off
okay the desire beat the iphone 3gs
again sort of yep there goes it's done
and we'll wait till the 3GS finishes
loading okay and let's do a screen
rotation speed test so we are going to
zoom out a little bit here and let's see
which one rotates faster okay it looks
like the desire was faster because it
doesn't have that screen animation that
the iPhone does let's try it again okay
the desire was faster again overall it
looks like the desire is a slightly
faster web browsing machine compared to
the iPhone 3GS which is extremely
impressive the iPhone 3GS beats almost
every device out there whether it's
running Android or Windows Mobile webOS
or even blackberry
so overall the HTC Desire is a killer
device it's like the Nexus One but in my
opinion better because you have this
gorgeous Sense interface you have more
RAM and the hardware is different so we
have this optical d-pad we have a screen
that just feels more secure and let me
give you a quick example of typing so
I'm just gonna launch into a word
processing application really quick okay
here we are it's just an email
so I find that I'm much faster in typing
with the HTC Desire than I am with the
iPhone or that I was with the Nexus One
when I had it so let's see here I'm
gonna say this is a test of the keyboard
on the desire and I'm not even looking
and look how fast very very fast
probably one of the best on-screen
keyboards that I've ever used on any
smartphone and that's saying something
I've used a lot of keyboards and there's
just something about the desire HTC has
got it right with this device so if you
have the opportunity to import this from
Europe I'd say give it a try this device
is awesome unfortunately it's not going
to come to the US as far as we know it's
in the US sort of as the Nexus One but
the Nexus One really isn't as good as
the desire so that's it for the look at
the HTC Desire that's a try now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
