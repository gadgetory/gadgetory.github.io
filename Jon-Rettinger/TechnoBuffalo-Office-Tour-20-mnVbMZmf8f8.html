to you by jack threads welcome back to
another episode of ask the Buffaloes to
show where you can ask me John Rhett
injure any question you've got from the
wide world of Technology one question I
get really more than any other
especially recently is we want to see a
tour of the TechnoBuffalo office
so I'm putting aside all the phone
questions for this week let me give you
guys a tour of everything that we've got
here TechnoBuffalo offices let's go and
get started alright so where we are
right now is the main lobby I'm gonna
bed step off the side for a minute and
see you've got just a logo on the wall
nothing overly fancy there what you
can't see is what's doing the filming we
have a Canon 5d Mark 3 audio is done via
this guy it is a Sennheiser wireless
audio pack the model is the e w100 g3 in
case you guys are wondering this is
actually the first time we're using
particular wireless setup usually when
we do our filming I will take this boom
mic I'll sort of put it off to the side
off the can't off camera we'll set it up
and I'll talk right so that'll take a
separate audio file and we'll sync them
up sometimes for shows like rumor
roundup or even other episodes of ask
the buffalo and techno buffalos driven
over on the tech feed there's a lot of
text to remember and sometimes it can be
a bit tough to get it all in your head
and get all the questions I want to keep
looking down at a paper you're looking
back up junk watch is all the editing
for this and it can be a bit tough Rams
you have to see me look down look up ask
questions look down so we've got a
teleprompter setup here attached to our
tripod actually works with an iPad a
full-size iPad a nine point seven inch
goes in there reflects up to the screen
I can see the text you can control
everything on the iPads pretty sweet if
you look down right here you can see one
of our office mascots this is Lucy Lucy
comes to office with us every day
teacher just hangs out and does pretty
much just that Lucy is my dog and it's
nice to have her here it's sort of
relaxing to have a dog at the office
when days get stressful if you look up
in the corners we've got whole security
system here we've got a lot of stuff
comes through the office right to make
sure that we are well protected walk you
guys through the rest of the office
nothing overly exciting going on in here
on the lights got a whiteboard we'll do
some brainstorming
we've got things going on we need to
prepare for if you got event coming up
in to prepare for sort of put our plan
of attack and just a couple chairs and
that's really it so I will grab Lucy and
we'll continue the officer all right all
right so we'll continue the office tour
we've got one open office here that
whenever you know Shawn comes into work
where you got someone coming in one of
our editors is in here could come with
me right here you can see our mini post
office and control center
we pretty much ship stuff professionally
we ship stuff back all the time so here
are lots of boxes to ship stuff back
with probably more boxes than we need so
let's go say hi to Roy right my pick on
all right so we'll go say hi to our
managing editor Roy Troy this is a this
is Roy's office this is where Roy does
all of his Roy Choi things yeah editing
post scheduling posts planning strategy
and negotiating contracts petting dogs
heading dogs speaking of dogs we have
another office mascot this is ava
Roy's dog and of course you can see all
the UCLA stuff around here Roy is a UCLA
alumni and actually met Roy when I was
in business school University of
California Irvine we became friends and
we started planning ways that we could
work together this is from August 2011
when I went to London this is outside of
the Covent Garden Apple Store people
came out to say hi we talked we asked
questions and had a chance to get to
know each other
was a lot of fun we've got a kitchen
with a bevy of healthy snacks you can
see all of our healthy snacks you can
see what nerves you are light reading is
a dnh catalog licorice apples almonds
randomly at dishwasher and the sweet not
sure why they put that in what they did
never used it I mean sure if it works
with saying hello it's one of our head
mobile writers this is Brandon Russell
hi Brandon
setup is a 11 inch MacBook Air paired to
a 27 inch cinema display you can't see
him but this is Ralph's command central
Ralph does all of the video annotations
video descriptions in the videos product
descriptions and a lot of stuff that
goes to the company runs to Ralph his
setup is kinda neat he's running a 13
inch MacBook Pro paired to a 24 inch
Cinema Display you can't see his MacBook
Pro he's got a really cool setup
actually he's got the stand
that hides the computer and hides the
wires we got some Mario stuff up on the
walls we still gotta finish our Mario
mosaic up here but there's a lot of
Mario things going on we have to open
cubes for future TechnoBuffalo employees
but for right now keep on the left
houses our nerf arsenal we have nerf
wars here will you sleep every Friday
now maybe once or twice a month we'll
blast each other with nerf guns seems
every time Shawn comes and it brings us
a new gun this was his latest addition
the Hale fire this was a picture someone
drew of me saying what's up everybody
HTC One X it's a note from Roy we hit an
all-time high traffic day for one day a
little over a million bit up there to
remind me uh and this is my office some
people ask what's on my wall to see
stuff in backgrounds and a word from
graduate school I was in a magazine in
2011 so I just have that framed got
something from VidCon two years ago
siege on quads rest of the referee folks
at the time Lucy stuff this is where she
she hangs out I wanta have to go to
lunch I gotta grab the office she'll
hang out in here otherwise just for food
and water behind here we've got ton of
different lenses that Ralph will use for
filming I got a 50 millimeter lens right
here and when I showed you guys the
teleprompter this is the iPad that goes
with it it's got a little receiver that
plugs in and remote that control the
prompter you got boxes and stuff that
I'm working on reviewing this guy just
came in actually the HTC One x+ for AT&amp;amp;T
which would be kind of neat this is my
setup I have two 27-inch cinema displays
paired two down below a 12 core Mac Pro
with 24 gigs of ram which sounds super
beastly but if you compare it to like a
SPECT out new Mac Mini not so beastly
I'm a sound setup I got two Bose
speakers on each side one on the left
kind of tissue box on the phone and one
I in the monitor and that's paired to
this guy I would just make control the
volume and since the Mac Pro has the
volume
audio in down below I couldn't like
headphones all the way down there so I
can plug in my headphones they're a pair
of non battery needing Bose headphones I
love these guys by the way that's pretty
much Lucy does everyday you'll sidon
snort and eat that actually I forgot to
show you one most important things in my
office
you guys know or might not know we were
sued two years ago to reveal a source we
ran an article on the Droid Bionic folks
at a printing house was printed the
materials that we got the leaks on
weren't overly happy about it I wanted
us to reveal our source they claimed we
didn't qualify as press and therefore
didn't get federal and state shield
protection we had to go through first
decision when we lost we thought weird
not to go to Appeals
I mean filed sort of a motion for
reconsideration and we won it was a
really long expensive drawn-out process
but that was really important for
industry to prove that we are
journalists bloggers because we're not
writing on politics we still are
journalists and we really had a fight
very hard to get this oh I'm
particularly proud of this guy sitting
right here if you guys want more
information on that I want me give you
