fell from TechnoBuffalo here and I'm
here in sunny Mountain View California
here at Google i/o 2018 you might not be
able to tell from this little reclusive
shelter here but the i/o keynote just
wrapped up and we found some shelter a
little safe haven so we can have a quiet
place to kind of chat about Android peek
and of course at the keynote we heard
the buzz words I heard about AI and
machine learning and deep learning but
really the whole message here at Google
was trying to talk about was being able
to use those really powerful tools to
allow us to have a better mobile
experience so on Android P were able to
do things that we often do in our phones
more quickly and basically just better
disconnect and keep those times we want
the phone out of our life completely out
and when we want it better engage and do
things faster so let's talk about the
five features that we are most excited
about in Android paper so feature number
one is this new digital well-being
dashboard and Google spent a lot of time
talking about this and how they can use
on the phone machine learning to
basically understand what you're doing
on the phone what apps are spending your
time in what services you're using to
basically give you a breakdown in this
dashboard of where your time is being
spent you can see what after spending a
lot of time and maybe you're using
Facebook an Instagram a lot you can see
how many notifications are getting how
often you're unlocking your phone and
maybe just glancing at it the dashboard
really gives you a better understanding
of how you're using your time on your
phone to make better decisions maybe you
notice that you have a little bit of a
newsfeed problem you can set an app
timer on there to kind of nudge you in
the right direction after let's say an
hour two hours in that app - hey maybe
it's time to get off your phone go do
something else and eventually that app
will be grayed out after you've hit that
time limit kind of reminding you that
hey you used your time allotted for this
app for the day why not do something
else
kind of pushing you out and getting you
to do more things this whole dashboard
is really about that idea of
understanding where your time is going
on your phone making better decisions
and kind of getting a grasp on your
digital behavior specifically under
Android peafowl all right feature number
two we are very excited about an Android
P adaptive brightness and adaptive
battery let start with brightness first
how many times during the day are you
constantly adjusting that toggle for the
brightness of your screen auto
brightness just never seems to get it
right for me and it's probably the case
for you as well so you're constantly
manually having to adjust that with this
new adaptive brightness feature
basically the AI in the phone learns
what you have the brightness set out in
a certain place a certain time so you
can automatically make those adjustments
for you kind of a smarter auto
brightness also number two with adaptive
battery the AI in the phone is again
using its powerful machine learning
technology to understand what apps
you're using what services you're using
and better shift the battery and the
phone's resources over to what you're
using so basically they said they would
have put the batteries juice into the
apps and services you're using and not
wasting them or just kind of a broad
overall sense of every little task
running on the phone
all right feature number three we are
excited about and that is the whole idea
of gestures built in natively supported
on Android P we can heard that and
repeat might be taking some features
from the iPhone 10 and this is one case
where we're gonna see those features
translate over and the gestures on
Android P work very similar to that on
the iPhone 10 you can swipe up from the
bottom to be able to get kind of a multi
split multitask window where you can
jump between different apps the cool
thing about how this works on Android P
though is that you're able to interact
with the different apps while they're in
this multitask state so if you want to
copy and paste from one app to another
made me from a website to email you can
do that simply easily and without having
to go back and forth between different
apps if you want to swipe up again you
can get a full list of all the apps on
your phone to go home it's simply you
just press down on that little pill icon
that gesture area on the bottom to go
home and it also has the ability to
swipe left and right to get kind of a
quicker more efficient apps which are
kind of like on the iPhone 10 so if you
want to switch any apps quickly from the
left on the right you can do that as
well feature number for wind down now
how many times do you guys spend laying
in your bed browsing through Reddit or
maybe watching a checkered Buffalo video
on YouTube and more time passes then you
might realize it happens to me all the
time Google is trying to fix that on
Android P with a new feature called
window
essentially what it's gonna do is you're
able to kind of put in what time you
want to go to bed and the phone will
kind of prompt you and remind you hey
it's time to go to bed it's time to you
know put the phone down and go to sleep
eventually turning the entire phone
screen great skill so everything is
basically my shade of gray almost black
and white in a sense that's really going
to try to get you to put that phone down
make you not want to use it and good a
good night's rest alright round out this
list feature number five on Android pee
we're very excited about uses new
feature called shush it's basically a
more seamless way of turning on Do Not
Disturb of course if do not disturb is
that mode where you can silence
notifications not get any phone calls
basically allows you to put your phone
down to be disconnected and not get
bothered unless an emergency is
occurring from a family member or friend
this works basically the same way but
let's say you're at a dinner party or
you're out with your friends and your
phones on the table and it's going off
instead having to pick up the phone you
know fiddle around with settings and
turn out to not disturb you can
literally just put the phone screen
facedown on the table and it'll activate
the shush mode which basically is do not
disturb your phone won't vibrate and
nothing's gonna go off nothing's gonna
ping and unless you get a call from
someone in your emergency contact list
or specific contacts that you set the
phone is not going to make a sound
really again following this initiative
of being more present and being less
connected to your smart device alright
guys so that's kind of an overview the
top five features of Android p.m. really
curious after watching the key know
obviously if you heard a lot about this
digital world being and Google really
pushing this digital initiative to get
us off of our smart phones off of our
computers and tablets and really more
connected and present in the real world
really kind of touching on this issue
but maybe we're a little bit more
addicted to our smartphones and we might
have bought it what do you guys think
leave a comment down below anything else
you saw that was cool here at i/o 2018
leave a comment down below let us know
and we'll have of course full coverage
on everything happening here as well as
more Android pee goodness especially
also when we get the actual name for
what Android P stands for we'll have
that all and more at TechnoBuffalo com
thanks much for watching this video guys
