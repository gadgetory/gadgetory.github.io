from TechnoBuffalo here buying a phone
can be really confusing there are just a
ridiculous amount of quality flagships
out there two of the phones you might be
looking at just came out pretty recently
we've got the HTC m9 and Samsung's
Galaxy s6 you consider this also the s6
edge could also be in here too since
they're almost identical phones so I
wanted to break these down into few
categories to talk about what was good
what was not good and declare a winner
and hopefully help you decide which
phone's going to be right for you
now obviously there are a ton of
categories we can talk about but I broke
them down to the ones I thought that
were the most salient the ones that I
cared the most about personally so I
thought further ado let's go ahead and
get started before you just say it's
gonna be a blowout one way or another
much closer than you might think
the other obvious caveats here both are
phones both make excellent phone calls I
get that question all the time they all
sound equally good so let's talk about
screen since that's really where you're
looking at almost the entire time with
these things both are almost exactly the
same size 5.1 on the s6 and 5 on the m9
resolutions different story 2560 by 1440
on the s6 and 1920 by 1080 on the m9 the
story is much more about those numbers
and less about ppi basics just has
better viewing angles it's better
outdoors it's got better color
representation and sourced and of course
the better resolution on top of that
looking at screens and without colors
look how black fit represented and how
White's look it's the s6 every single
day of the week whether it has to do
with the extra resolution or not I don't
know before you just jump down my throat
screaming about battery life and screen
resolution just hold on we're gonna get
there and since you're holding these
phones we want them to feel nice what
about the build quality so years ago a
really generation before this one this
would have been a complete blow out HTC
M devices vs. samsung galaxy s s would
have been just a knockout in the first
round
ihe sees that an incredible job would
build but Samsung didn't want to be left
out and has really stepped up their game
I really like the unibody aluminum on
the m9 I like to have to like the weight
of the phone makes you feel like you're
holding something significant and she
said she Co that's a lot of attention to
detail
like the gold trims around it the
texture on the buttons those little
small touches that I really enjoyed yes
six different story
I like big glass and the s6 delivers on
the front and the back totally a design
language here for Samsung and a way more
premium feel
it is like world's better than previous
generations of Samsung devices but based
on build quality alone GC still has the
edge they got the Mojo and they're not
losing it it's what about battery you
think got it last year right Liam powers
really mean nothing compared to actual
real-world usage how much juice are you
gonna get when you use it throughout a
day but to play fair here the numbers
2550 on the s6 and 2840 on the m9 of
course talk about milliamp hours on both
more pixels though I mean more power no
matter how much you tweak the software I
can go almost two days on the m9 and a
1080p screen with the s6 though it's
cutting it really close with just one
day leave their replaceable battery so
that didn't count here before you yell
at me about wireless charging just know
we're gonna get to that as well more
although if any the phone's gonna last
you all day you're travelers what I'm
only not gonna have to charge you don't
want to charge your phone every night
and that does a really nice job and it
takes this round so what about those
little suckers on the back the cameras
phone camera typically becoming our only
camera so the same story here at battery
numbers don't tell the whole story
60 megapixel on the s6 20 on the m9 the
m9 mate CeCe's own admission has had
some camera problems software updates
have made it definitely better when it
comes to image quality color
representation low-light shots pretty
much everything
the s6 just thumps it if I had to pick
one of these stick with me as a camera
if I was leaving for the night or going
out with my son I would pick the s6 100
out of 100 times based on camera so I
see what pictures look like on both
these would put links to them down boys
you can see what they look like outdoors
and low-light indoors and the rest so
there are obviously a lot of other
intangibles about these phones they
don't really qualify into a single round
the s6 is wireless charging while the m9
has boomsound speakers and expandable
storage for me though I don't really use
expandable storage that much so you know
it really wasn't that big a deal and the
down were firing speakers on the s6 are
pretty good too
I love being able to throw this thing on
a chart
while I work is really convenient that
couple with Samsung pay coming soon and
a fingerprint sensor built-in being the
s6 definitely takes this one if you
values extendable storage though the m9
is the one you want it's run a bit of
charging experience gonna be able to pay
with your phone not using Google Wallet
gift 6 is way to go and for intangible
and the s6 just has more taking this
round you I was also a category that I
considered adding in here but to be
honest I just like them both sense and
the modern TouchWiz are neck-and-neck
which is a huge compliment to TouchWiz
because it was absolutely horrible in
previous iterations and I've always
really liked sense again personal
preference so I didn't include it here
all right so what's the winner if you
can do mad that keeping track by a score
of 3 to 2 it is the galaxy s6 and that's
also true if I had to pick one of these
phones just to use with me I would pick
the s6 in fact I bought and s6 edge to
use because I really like everything
about the phone not saying the m9 is a
bad choice for HTC fan you've already
picked one up if you want the best
quality audio sound from the built-in
speakers the m9 is a great choice and a
really solid option basic just took my
first choice of how to pick one or the
other it's gotten to the point now where
flagship you have to almost look to find
a bad phone any phony pick up it's going
to be fine it's gonna work then get you
through the next year or two years I'd
again to things like horsepower and
processing power to talk about octa-core
or snap dragons or XD notes because
they're both really fast phones and
they're both easily gonna last you 12 18
and 24 months so you know bear all that
in mind you guys do agree disagree you
want to just yell at me in the comments
and you guys like to do that leave it
all down below give the video a thumbs
up though we always do appreciate it and
until next time I'm John Wright enger'
