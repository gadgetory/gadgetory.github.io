Lakers comm with a review for you of the
flip video minnow I did the unboxing I
give you a bit of a hardware overview
I'm gonna go ahead and do a real quick
one as well for those of you that may
not have seen it so the first of all the
flip minnow is very compact video camera
does not take still pictures it's meant
only for video first size comparison
I'll show you with the iPhone here see
thickness wise it's a little bit bigger
and on the front something a little bit
smaller a very pocketable size as you
can see there aren't that many hardware
buttons on it but what it does have on
the front are three hardware buttons
you've got a play button right there a
trash button there and a big record
button in the middle but you can sort of
see here there are four buttons to the
left right and top and below the record
button that are keep sensitive those are
for zoom and zoom out and to scroll
through your videos left and right and
I'll show you guys that what's unit is
turned on on the left side which makes
the flip Mino very handy little lever
here that if you push releases a USB 2.0
connector which you can plug right into
your computer and immediately check for
your video very handy no extra cords
needed and that just folds right down
I'll give this a device of the power
button and on the back is the lens which
is surrounded by black
fingerprint magnet plastic fortunately
in the box they include a bag that you
can put it in to also clean off the
inevitable fingerprints let's go ahead
and turn the device on here I'll show
you guys what it looks like hit the
power button you're greeted by flip
video splash screen and that's really it
you can see in the inch and a half LCD
screen that it is showing what's behind
there on the lens
that's record is very easy just hit the
big red record button I'll go ahead and
do a sample that and when you hit it red
light on the front as you guys can see
signifies that it's recording when you
push record button again that red light
turns off to play back what you just
recorded you hit the play button right
there very easily and if you don't like
hit delete and if you have more than one
video store on here you can hit the left
and the right buttons to scroll through
them and the zoom up and zoom out it's
pretty self-explanatory let's go ahead
and trying unit off for you don't give
you guys my take on it splash screens
running off flip Meno takes excellent
video for such a compact recorder you're
not gonna be able to make a feature film
on it but for taking quick YouTube
videos and wanting be able to have a
camera with you for family vacations or
personal milestones really I think can't
be beat as far as pocket ability in
price fits in your pocket very easily
how do you even know that it's there and
that's something right now in the US for
149 dollars that's what I paid at Best
Buy which is a big-box realist retailer
here in the US like I said before the
video quality isn't the best in the
world but it's certainly passable the
audio quality is excellent the strength
of the mic is fantastic how do you
recommend this for anybody who's looking
just to take some quick video and like
to do some more serious recording it
also has a port on the back for a tripod
ex-delta mention i'm gonna leave a
sample video of the flip minnow at the
end of this you guys can see a little
bit about what it looks like but i
highly highly highly recommend it for
just a compact you're recording it's a
great camera at a great and reasonable
price so guys hope you enjoyed watching
be sure to check out the website at
www.ge.com and if you're interested in
hearing what i have to say about things
not technology related check out the new
channel at inside john's mine put a link
to both up in the sidebar there hey guys
john r Ettinger John for Lakers and I
will talk to you guys soon alright guys
here's a sample recording like I
promised I'll the flip video minnow your
go ahead and turning around saying hello
um audio quality is great video quality
I think is fantastic YouTube distorts a
little bit but natively it's quite solid
one last point I want to bring up guys
that if you want to connect this to your
computer you plug it in your obviously
can have a little bit of a weight issue
with the camera you might be worried
about breaking off the USB 2.0 port so
what I did was I bought a simple USB
connection cable there plug into the
back of the computer and I all I can do
is plug the minnow right in stare
and transfers nice and easily just a
handy little tip I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
