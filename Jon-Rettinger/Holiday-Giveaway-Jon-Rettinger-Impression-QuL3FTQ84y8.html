TechnoBuffalo here if you follow the
channel you'll know that I love to do
giveaways it's an awesome chance to
interact with the audience and give back
to really thank you for all the support
over the months and now years that
you've given me so let me go and show
you what we're giving away this time
the folks at AT&amp;amp;T have hooked me up with
not one not two but three brand new
Motorola Bravo's to give out you may
remember this phone from a video review
that I did last week I want to make sure
how it's giving away something that I
actually like and something that
actually use and the Bravo is probably
one of the more surprising phones of
2010 so stick around I will go through
all the details so first let me talk
about the prize the Motorola Bravo is
rocking Android 2.1 with motoblur it's
got a 3.7 inch screen and if you watch
the review video was a surprising
performance performer performance
performer I in some of the benchmarking
test that I did phone really was
extremely impressive handling Flash
content and really everyday usage so I
hope that you guys like it so let me go
ahead and talk about what you gotta do
for this giveaway and before I get to
that I do want to mention again the
folks AT&amp;amp;T for hooking me a big time
with these phonons we check out AT&amp;amp;T
Facebook page you're actually doing a
ton of giveaways over there too they're
doing what's called the twelve days of
gift giving and if you go to
facebook.com slash 18t I'll put those
links down in the what have you you can
instantly win a ton of cool prizes from
speck I home Jabra and lots of other
whoo electronic what-have-yous so I hit
that link down below if you want to
insulate win surprises
who doesn't love sort of instant
gratification alright so let's talk
about the giveaways in the past I've
done you got to leave comments you have
to go here and do there and it's been
sort of a fun way to pick winners but
it's been totally random so I thought I
would have some fun with this giveaway
over the years that I've been doing
these videos I know that I have sort of
adapted a style with my videos I've got
my what's up everyone
perhaps monotone kings at time my awful
jokes I want to see your best
impressions of me and all you have to do
is leave a video response to this
giveaway video with your best impression
it can be either a dead-on imitation you
can poke some fun you can make me laugh
make the audience laugh whatever it
might be and I am going to pick through
my own whatever the three best videos
that I think offer the best impressions
and I will be open about it if you're
making fun of me I can laugh at myself
if you're doing sort of dead
imitation that's cool too whatever you
guys want to do the things is going to
be entertaining I will be open to it and
it's going to be subjective I'm gonna
pick the winner this time it's not going
to be random I figure if you're poking
fun at me I get a chance to pick the
winner so I think it could be kind of
fun and to coincide with a tease twelve
days of gift-giving which actually ran
from yesterday which was December 1st
until December 12th I am going to also
run this giveaway until this number 12
and on December 12 I will pick the top
three videos I'll post them up on
TechnoBuffalo comm so you guys can see
the videos I may pick some of the other
ones too and put them up there just so
you can see them I think it'll be a lot
of fun serve a way to have a laugh at
what I do
you know I review electronics and it is
a dream job for me and I put myself out
there I give a weight sort of talk to
the audience and it's got a cool way for
you guys to try and get some exposure as
well if you win the videos gonna be
posted on TechnoBuffalo so I get
thousands of people seeing your YouTube
video I know you guys this is gonna be
kind of fun I don't know what you think
about the subjective thing of me picking
a winner but I figure if everybody can
laugh themselves a little bit especially
now with the holidays coming up the
world maybe will be a bit of a less
serious better place so that's why you
got to do it let me recap super quickly
everything I'm winning capsulate and say
I'm encapsulated with my hands here
what you need to do so make a video
response doing your best imitation of me
can be anything you can be doing a sort
of a dead-on impression you can poke
some fun whatever it might be you can
use special effects not use special
effects you can make the audience laugh
I am going to pick the top three videos
that I think are the best I'm gonna post
in my TechnoBuffalo and each person is
going to win a new Motorola Bravo now
because these are US unlocked phones
this giveaway is going to be tied only
to the folks in the US I promise I'll
have other giveaways coming up for a
non-us folks the last giveaway I did
when I gave away a iPad or some cash was
open to everybody in the world and
they're a ton of international giveaways
coming up but this one is going to
just us and thank you again to the folks
at AT&amp;amp;T for hooking up with these
Motorola Bravo again all the links I
mentioned will be down below or are down
below because you're watching this video
