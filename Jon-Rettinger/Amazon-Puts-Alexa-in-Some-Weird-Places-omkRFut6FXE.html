am Robert Rosenfeld and typically what
I'm talking about the tech news of the
day I'm back at the studio kind of
recapping from afar but today's a little
bit different I am here in Seattle at
Amazon HQ where the company just
announced a bunch of new Alexa naval
devices and even some new upgrades to
the echo line that we currently have
there's a lot to unpack today a lot to
talk about and a lot to recap so let's
get into it let's top tech here's the
lowdown
so one of the biggest takeaways from
today's announcement is that Amazon is
really looking to put Alexa into the
places that they think you're gonna
really use a most specifically a home in
the kitchen in the living room and also
in the car but let's start with the home
first the biggest hardware update we saw
today was to the echo show version 2 and
this new versions about a 10 inch HD
display that Amazon says has two times
more screen real estate than on the
previous version with that new and
improved dual firing speakers that
should do a much better job of making
sure that room is filled with audio and
kind of projected a little bit better
than the previous version and it's also
going to get some software updates here
we're gonna get a browser we're gonna
get some integration into streaming
services like Hulu and also some
streaming support for a new device
called the fire TV recast but we'll get
to that in a minute we also saw a few
small updates come to the echo Plus and
the echo dot the plus has got a new and
improved audio system in it as well as a
built-in temperature monitor so you can
ask Alexa what the temperature is in the
room and it will respond and react
appropriately and also there's a new
design to the echo version 3 it's got a
new design with fabric around it and
also it was a bit bigger than version
number 2 as you can see here and Amazon
says it's thanks to a bigger speaker
that's going to make it 70% louder that
new and improved echo show is coming
with a starting price tag of 229 the new
echo plus is coming in at 149 and the
echo dot is remaining the same 50 bucks
all shipping soon besides some updates
to the existing hardware we're already
seeing from Amazon the company also
introduced a bunch of different software
integrations that allow the Amazon
echoes to work with some new announced
hardware and also just kind of work
together a little bit better so for
example echo speakers will soon support
stereo mode allowing you to basically
split audio into the left and right
speaker and it's gonna work nicely with
the brand-new $130 echo sub that will
give you a little bit more base to your
music you're listening to and they'll
pair with one or two echo speakers
there's also the addition of the echo
input to the echo link and the new echo
link amp which are all going to work
with your existing speakers you already
have in your house whether they're wired
to the ceiling or just an external
system you just plug these devices and
with the exception of the echo input
they don't have microphones so they're
gonna utilize the mics built into the
echos you have around your house to
basically send commands to these pieces
of equipment that are hidden in closets
or stowed away to execute commands and
play your music through the speakers you
already have another big announcement
today was with a new piece of hardware
called the fire TV recast this is
probably the most interesting thing that
Amazon announced today let me tell you
why so the
box essentially connects to a couple of
over-the-air antennas and it's not only
gonna let you record this video but you
can stream that signal to your fire to
leave your echo show or an iOS or
Android device it's only going to work
with over-the-air channels so the amount
of channels you get and what's gonna be
on those channels is going to be
dependent on where you're located and
this really isn't a replacement for
YouTube TV or any kind of streaming
service though it's still a really cool
idea utilizing the free over-the-air
channels that are already being
broadcast in the fire TV recast comes
with a starting price tag of 229 bucks
and what that's going to get you is a
500 gigabyte drive to store all that
media and also two tuners to bring in
those channels and allow you to stream
them to two different devices at the
same time
Amazon also talked a lot about the
underlying technology in these new
devices and how they want to make it way
easier and way less frustrating free to
add a new device into your smart home
ecosystem they talk a lot about
basically using the brainpower of a
full-fledged echo device like an echo
plus or an echo show to do the heavy
lifting and bring devices online that
are running more scaled-down versions of
Alexa like one running in a clock or a
microwave and yes Amazon did release
both a clock and a microwave today the
analog clock has LEDs built-in to
basically show off when a timer is going
off and yes there is support in there
for multiple timers and the microwave
can basically cookie your meal through
the power of Alexa and voice you tell
Alexi oh no microwave a potato for
example and it'll cook it for the exact
time it needs to cook for both of these
will be joining the Amazon basics family
with the clock coming in at 30 bucks in
the microwave starting at 60 bucks and
last but not least Amazon also
introduced the brand-new echo Auto
basically putting the power of Alexa
into your car the echo Auto is pretty
simple it's got the same eight mics
built into it that are also in the echo
show and it's location-aware so knows
where you are when you are at a specific
place and allows you to run routines
like turning off the lights when you
leave home without ever having to do
anything more than just programming at
once it can help you navigate through
third-party apps like Google Maps or
ways by using the screen on your phone
once you trigger it through Alexa the
echo Auto is gonna cost $49.99 at launch
it's on an invite-only basis right now
and starting sooner and starts rolling
up to that program it's gonna cost
$24.99 so that was just a very quick
very abbreviated recap of what Amazon
announced today there are way more
details to talk about here and we'll
have the full coverage over at
TechnoBuffalo comm and what do you guys
think of all that was announced today
are you gonna go buy that new microwave
you're looking into that clock or maybe
a new echo upgraded device for around
your home we have a comment down below
and let us know free chance to be
featured in the next episode low down I
am Robert Rosenthal from TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you back here on Tuesday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
