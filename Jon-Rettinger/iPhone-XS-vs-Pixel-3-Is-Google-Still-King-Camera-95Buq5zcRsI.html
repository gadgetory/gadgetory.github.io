smartphone camera you could buy for the
past year with the public release of the
new pixel 3 imminent we wanted to see if
what many consider to be the best
smartphone camera got even better on
this newer model and how well it's
stacked up to the latest and greatest
from Apple on the iPhone 10 us of course
we've got our full review of both the
new pixel 3 and three XL coming very
soon but before that video went live we
just want to do a very quick camera of
comparison between these two flagships
does he just how similar or different
they really are is the Google pixel
still the camera king of smartphones
let's find out
but when we take a look at the photo
samples looking at the spec sheets for
both phones reveals that both camera
systems on these phones are surprisingly
similar both have 12 megapixel rear
shooters with an F one-point aperture
optical image stabilization and HDR but
the iPhone has a second 12 megapixel
telephoto lens if the pixel does not
switching to the front is where we see a
bit more of a difference between these
two phones the advertised a standard
lens with a 7 megapixel sensor while the
pixels got dual front-facing lenses with
8 megapixel sensors in each of them with
one of those lens as being a wide-angle
field of view while the others just a
regular old standard lens don't get too
caught up on spec sheets though the big
difference here between these phones is
going to lie within the software really
the difference between how the pixel
handles photo processing versus how
Apple handles it on the iPhone 10 s of
course Google prides itself on its
advanced machine learning its software
wizardry and pixel core processing that
is really given the pixel photos the
edge but Apple has done a lot of work
recently to catch up and with the
introduction of smart HDR on the new 10s
the photos are closer than ever in many
scenarios let's take a look at some of
these samples there's a lot to unpack
from these photos and these first few
shots are very close nearly identical on
both phones
it's just goes to show that in ideal
conditions with good light both phones
can produce really good results though
the iPhone continues to typically
produce warmer tones in most photos but
this photo in particular is where we
start to notice a difference between
these two phones you can see a clear
difference between the 10s and the pixel
3 when it comes to sharpness the iPhone
is able to achieve the shallow depth of
field while the pixel photo sharpens
every part of the image almost to the
point where it looks a little bit over
sharpened losing that macro shallow
depth of field effect one of the iPhones
greatest strengths and weaknesses in the
new 10s is the addition of this new
smart HDR feature and essentially the
iPhone takes a series of over and
underexposed photos combines them
together to produce photos with more
details in both the highlights and the
shadows and the pixel does this as well
but the iPhone tends to do it a little
bit more aggressively here's an example
of that the addition of that smart HDR
brightens up the shadows and shows off
way more details in the vines than
compared to the pixel 3 that keeps those
vines a bit darker but a little bit more
true to life smart HDR is great but
sometime
you want to see some shadows in your
photos in this example of this portrait
mode shot you can see the 10s as smart
HDR working to brighten up the image
whereas the pixel 3 leaves the shadows
adding a bit of contrast which looks a
little bit better this is also a great
example of portrait mode on both the
phones with a lot of light to both do a
very good job of cutting out your
subject from the background and
separating those two you'll notice the
pixel 3 shot is sharper has more
contrast and doesn't leave the skin tone
as warm as on the iPhone 10s and here's
an example of where that smart HDR on
the iPhone can be a little bit too much
here's a low-light photo in our studio
that looks a little bit more accurate on
the pixel whereas the iPhone tries to
brighten up the dark areas resulting in
a much noisier less realistic photo and
jumping back to portrait mode for a
second we can see that in some cases
especially in tricky situations the
iPhones second telephoto lens really
does help portrait mode be more accurate
and provide some additional depth data
that's going to be needed both shots
look pretty good though not only does
the iPhone give more detail in Matt's
hair as you can see but also does a much
better job of separating him from the
background and the pixel struggles here
you can see the top-left corner next to
Matt didn't get blurred out though again
the colors are gonna look a little bit
more accurate and a little bit more
pleasing on the pixel than on the iPhone
quickly running through a few more
samples here just to kind of show you
guys some more photos both phones
definitely have their strengths and
their weaknesses the pixels seem to do a
better job with portrait mode in our
low-light tests and the super-high
resumes the image from the pixel look a
little bit more cartoony but it does
have much more detail than on the iPhone
the iPhone allows you to get just a
little bit closer to your subject and in
some cases the pixel just takes a much
more visually pleasing photo it retains
the detail and the look of this neon
sign much better than the 10s did and
when it comes to this shot in the car I
prefer the pixels image over the iPhones
just because it has a little bit more
contrast a little more saturation just
looks a little bit more visually
appealing to me than on the iPhone that
wide-angle lens is super convenient to
have on the pixel and produces some
good-looking group selfies and same goes
for this standard selfie in the car
obviously the iPhone is doing some heavy
noise reduction here and we're it's
going to result in some skin smoothing
that is a bit much but the pixel
although it's a great looking shot and
provides a lot of detail is a
again almost a little bit too sharp it's
like you're cranking that clarity filter
all the way up to a hundred percent
though it does do a good job retaining
both shadows and also details out of
that rear window that's very sunny both
phones also have their own individual
software tricks about the most basic
level I think the iPhone 10s and the
pixel three are closer now than they
ever have been before and the addition
of the smart HDR on the iPhone brings
the iPhone way closer to pixel three
level of photos that has been before but
again both cameras are gonna have their
strengths and their weaknesses in
different situations the iPhone 10s
gives you a lot of detail in your photos
and it's going to produce a really good
looking photo with minimal effort though
you're probably still going to want to
go in there and edit the photo to get it
looking exactly how you want it the
pixel three takes a simply great looking
photo with little to no effort on your
part and in many cases in a side-by-side
test it's gonna produce shots that look
more visually appealing than what you're
gonna get on the iPhone software
processing here on the pixel 3 is good
though at times it can be a little bit
too much when it comes to sharpness and
clarity and contrast but because it's
software base I'm sure this is going to
continue to get tweaked and refined over
time with software updates personally
for me I like to put the least amount of
effort into processing and editing my
photos after the fact as possible I just
want the phone that I'm going to be able
to use to snap a photo and it's gonna
look good and visually appealing so for
me the pixel 3 is gonna be my phone of
choice but again your mileage is going
to vary it's going to depend on what
you're looking for in your photos if you
really want to edit it after the fact
but for me little effort pixel threes
gonna be better in my case and if you
guys want to take a look at these photos
samples for yourselves we're gonna put a
link down below in the description we've
got a bunch of photos on there including
some we didn't show off in this video so
if you really want to take a deep dive
and take a look in pixel peep check out
that link down below and if you guys
want to see video samples from these
phones and some more comparisons between
them maybe even an all-out versus of the
iPhone 10s versus the pixel 3 leave a
thumbs up for this video and leave a
comment down below letting us know you
guys want to see that so we know that's
something you guys are interested in
again stay tuned for our full pixel 3
review coming very soon I am Robert
Rosenthal from TechnoBuffalo thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you in
the next one
