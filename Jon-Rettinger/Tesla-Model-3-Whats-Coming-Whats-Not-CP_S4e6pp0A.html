model 3 is coming and it's coming faster
I think most people expect there's a lot
to know about the car and also a huge
amount we don't know if he's our last
model 3 video so I want to share all the
stuff with you guys decide whether or
not the model 3 it's the right car for
you so the first thing we know you know
the price gonna be starting at around
$35,000 we can get that price down to as
low as about 2075 depending on what
state you live in so we've got an
affordable mass-market fully autonomous
car lease the technology will be in it
and that is a first so every model here
that's gonna shift is gonna ship with
Tesla's autopilot 2.0 and that's gonna
enable within two years musk is saying
full autonomy like go to sleep in the
back of your car type of autonomy musk
is saying no towards even the end of
this year early next year if you don't
have level 4 autonomy which is
essentially the Carl's are all the work
for you but if I got this in the
driver's seat just to like check things
out don't expect that technology to be
there at that thirty-five thousand
dollar price point gonna have to pay for
it but every car will have it you can
always get it later if you want we still
know the range good to have a starting a
range of 215 miles and that is deceptive
as a Tesla owner myself Tessa loves to
claim range the claim that range at a
hundred percent battery life and you
should never charge your card 100
percent that leads to huge about
aggregation down the line so real-world
it probably could have about 190 ish on
the range but there will be options and
there will be speed options as well
you're on must be saying this should be
cars it and gets from 0 to 60 in under 4
seconds if not faster so it should be a
PE variant as well we know it's going to
have a crazy glass roof option Tesla's
got their own Tesla glass similar what
we think we have in the Model X that
sort of almost helicopter ish
windshields Halen buses also hinted at a
solar roof option that hasn't been the
biggest success thing in the world we've
seen sorry to do it with the Prius in
Japan we've seen Fisker Automotive tried
to do it with the Karma hasn't worked
out that well just and create that much
electricity but it might be an option on
the model 3 so that's the moral of what
we know there's still a lot we don't yet
know about the car we should see the
production unit be unveiled in July but
things should change versus what we saw
and billed to last year there'll be a
wider trunk opening and things are a
little bit kind of up in the air as far
as what's actually going to happen
according to the folks at elec
tract Tesla's file the patents for
automated super charging if you guys
remember two years ago
that's like shared the video of like the
weird snake charger kind of winding its
way and plugging itself in as Tesla
gears up to full autonomy they want cars
bill to charge themselves so allegedly
you build a park your model three into a
supercharger let park itself and it's
going to charge itself via very like
phallic looking snake plugging itself in
which is kind of cool what's technology
at Tesla's shown does indeed exist
speaking of superchargers Tesla will
also be doubling the number of
supercharger stations in the u.s. from
3500 to 7000 by the end of this year's
that gear up for just a ton of model
threes on the road they're still
expected to hit the road later this year
but super charging will not be free to
have to pay to enable it and then you're
gonna have to sort of pay for use if you
want to supercharge your car which
should reach about eighty percent
battery life in like fifteen twenty
minutes we also don't know what the
center stack is going to look like I
heard rumors for a while I was going to
have a heads up this boy and that was a
rumor that I was sharing a few months
back must catch squash that's in and
will not be a heads up display instead
of having sure of the large portrait
style screen that you got in the Model S
and Model X going to be a landscape or
into screen so different UI here the big
question is is this the car you guys
have been waiting for $35,000 for its
hundred mile Eevee is pretty awesome
it's kind of that perfect compromise
between performance which one having
technology and also not breaking a thing
to do it let me know the comments down
below if you ordered a model three and
let me know why and if your pro model
three give the video a thumbs up let us
know I'll do a ton more Tesla coverage
as the card is going to release so next
time John Wright injured from
