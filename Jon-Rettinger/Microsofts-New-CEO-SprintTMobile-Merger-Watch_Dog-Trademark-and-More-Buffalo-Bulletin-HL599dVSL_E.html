hello internet and welcome to the
buffalo bolton where we recap stories
from our site technobuffalo calm every

stories it's official microsoft has
announced their new CEO earlier this
morning naming cloud and enterprise
executive satya nadella as the man who
will lead microsoft for the foreseeable
future now former CEO Steve Ballmer
posted a video to Microsoft's youtube
channel praising nadella and so did
Microsoft founder Bill Gates nadella
addressed Microsoft employees in an
email saying quote our job is to ensure
that Microsoft thrives in a mobile and
cloud first role we'll see what nadella
has in store for redmond but with 22
years experience at Microsoft they're in
pretty capable hands we heard a while
back sprint was considering a possible
merger with t-mobile and now we're
hearing the thoughts of FCC Chairman Tom
wheeler about that deal last week
Sprint's leadership met with the Justice
Department to discuss the possibility
and was met with a skeptical response
and it seems wheeler agrees with that
sentiment as an FCC official told
Reuters that wheeler admitted being
quote highly skeptical on quote of the
bid for now it looks like we probably
won't see an official merger especially
considering att's failed bid for tmobile
back in 2011 over in gaming some drama
unfolded for Ubisoft this week yesterday
a NeoGAF forum member noticed Ubisoft
filed for an express abandonment of the
watchdog's trade market had with the US
Patent and Trademark Office leading to
some crazy and wild speculation as to
why Ubisoft would jettison the game's
name so swiftly well it appears Ubisoft
didn't actually file for that
abandonment and the process was
completed fraudulently the company took
to the air at this morning to assure
fans the game was being polished as we
speak and that they'd already filed to
reverse the abandonment also in gaming
some good and bad news from Disney
Interactive an anonymous source inside
the studio says both Star Wars and
Marvel will be joining Disney infinity
as future expansions to the game there's
no word though on potential characters
or settings but we kind of expected this
as Disney now owns bull studios
unfortunately the same on
anonymous source said hundreds of people
at Disney Interactive are about to be
laid off due to financial cutbacks
hopefully it won't be too many people
though and the folks laid off will find
something new quickly our world card
story today is kind of fun it appears
Wikipedia is creating a database of some
of the most famous voices in the world
wikipedia editor Andy Mabbutt is
spearheading the project and it's open
to anybody with their own Wikipedia page
they're simple recordings oftentimes
just the subject introducing themselves
but it's open to every language and some
of the recordings are from places like
the BBC's audio archives it's kind of
nice to see somebody recognizing audio
as needing to be catalogued so check out
the project if you have a chance that's
the Buffalo bulletin for today if you
enjoyed the show a thumbs up would be
super awesome of you and if you want
