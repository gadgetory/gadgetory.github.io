TechnoBuffalo here the DHL delivery man
dressed dropped off what I hope is a
bounty of goodness from the folks at AE
Tech let's go ahead dig into the package
and see what we got
so for those of you guys that might have
missed some of the other 80 tech
unboxing I've done there a purveyor of
pretty awesome accessories for Apple
products and other electronics let's go
ahead and dig in III interested and
checking them out they'll be a link down
below and let's see what we've got in
here for potential giveaways coming up
of course we will use elfs tableau for
this and again all the links I mentioned
one last time will be down in the
underbar I guess there's no sidebar
anymore let's go ahead and dig in let me
know it's what's in here is fragile and
protected nicely go ahead and move off
the packaging yet another box to dig
through here it's good and see what we
got last thing is packaged tight so the
finger sliced waiting to happen see I
can rip this tape or just open up the
box if we almost got it opened up you go
ahead and cut some more tape right there
and still hopefully not finger cut away
from my cell phone there we go
alright so let's see what we've got here
looks like it's a couple things dump
dump duh it's like a grand reveal so
we've got looks like hpower case go
ahead and pull it out of here
boom screen guard inside there's some
saran wrap on it looks like the aegis
power case it rescues your phone's
battery so it's going to give you extra
five hours of talktime seven hours of
video time twenty hours of audio
playback let's go ahead and dig in and
see what this look
you want to pick one up again I'll put
the link down below so this is for the
iPhone 4 doesn't look to add that much
both pic there's a little bit of a
screen protector in there and squeegee
and a cloth go ahead and just drop your
iPhone right in there and you're going
to get a bit of extra battery looks like
there's some LED indicators there on the
back go ahead and see sort of what extra
bulk that's gonna add to the phone I'll
go ahead and slide my phone into here in
just a minute but let's see what else
we've got in the box okay and push this
off these are gonna make awesome I think
giveaways sake we've got a few more of
them which is always kind of fun so
you've got one two three four more of
these guys so stay tuned for giveaways
for these it's gonna be an awesome thing
to hand out especially with the holidays
coming up and it looks like we still
have one more mystery perhaps or maybe
it's just packing looks like our last
victory is indeed packing so then go
ahead and take out my iPhone and see
what it looks like here in this guy so
here is my phone took I've got a few
missed calls go ahead and slide that
right in let's go and do a little shimmy
on down all right so I've got that slid
in there and it looks like that's a
little bit of bulk on the side but not
that much more than in everyday case
wood let's go ahead and slide this guy
right on top and we'll take a look at
the packaging too because actually there
are a lot of benefit that you're gonna
get with this over some of these
standard charging accessories and there
you go that's the that's the whole thing
so something to notice on the back of
these there's a decent mat information
here actually that we didn't cover so
it's 100% harmless to your mobile phone
while installation so it's not going to
scratch the side of it which is kind of
nice some of these cases will actually
scratch the side this one will protect
it 100% harmless to mobile phones while
installing because talked about that
charging in data while it is plugged in
so you can actually charge this guy or
doodad transferred via micro us
which is always sort of a nice feature
to have an Apple uses that proprietary
30-pin connector so we also have here is
a 1700 milliamp hour lithium polymer
battery which is nice it's going to
extend communications in music playback
we sort of expect that I here serve the
other features that you're gonna get in
from the battery life from it super
lightweight 70 grams I won't be a burden
while caring it uses a unified mobile
phone charging connection which again we
just said is micro USB it's quick charge
it's gonna have no memory effect on the
battery which is important so your main
battery that's in your iPhone it's not
going to affect it sort of having a
traditional charge coming in so if
you're flying if you're a road warrior
someone who uses your phone quite a bit
carrying one of these guys with you is
really going to be a nice thing to have
I know when I travel probably carry at
least one of these with me
so make sure I've got the juice to get
me through and I guess I am John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo
and we did a unboxing of the aegis power
from the folks as AE tech should I check
out all the links and I will see you in
the next video I'm gonna go enjoy my
extra hours of battery life and be sure
to stay tuned for giveaway information
on the rest of those cases it'll be fun
to sort of share the unboxing joy of
this is actually surprisingly useful
product with you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
