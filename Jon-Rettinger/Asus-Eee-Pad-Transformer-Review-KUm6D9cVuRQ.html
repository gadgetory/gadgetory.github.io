TechnoBuffalo here with a full review
for you of the newest Android tablet
this is the Asus Eee Pad Transformer
let's go ahead dig in and see if there's
more than meets the eye I'm sure I'm the
first one to ever make that joke
all right so let me get through the
specs very quickly and we'll talk about
the transformer itself it's got a 10.1
inch diagonal IPS screen at the
resolution of 1280 by 800 the operating
system is quite obviously Android 3 Oh
honeycomb it's using Nvidia's Tegra 2
processor is becoming quite ubiquitous
in tablets so you're going to get one
gigahertz of power on each of its two
cores it's going to be sitting on top of
one gig of ram which are gonna help it
with its speed it's gonna come in 16 or
32 gig configurations ranging in price
from 399 to $4.99 on the front you've
got a 1.2 megapixel camera located right
in the middle and on its backside we've
got a 5 megapixel sensor capable of
shooting HD video let's go ahead this
guy back over oh so I wrote a written
review of the Asus Eee Pad Transformer I
don't write that many written reviews
but I thought this one really merited it
why came out last week on TechnoBuffalo
since today is the official launch day
the 26 of the e Pad Transformer I
thought of a video review would be quite
fitting as you guys watch this you'll
see why so I'm gonna break this video
review into the same sections I did for
their written if you want to read the
full written review links going to be
down below I'm gonna break out the DES
pros cons design performance talk about
the keyboard dock that gives us its
transformer name and then give a bit of
a conclusion so I want to give some
frame of reference and a perspective
into this review from a specs standpoint
this is very similar to the Motorola
Xoom a save for the 4G radio so I was
expecting very similar performance from
the Motorola Xoom which I've got on the
record is saying I was very disappointed
with there aren't that many Android
tablets out right now there's certainly
many more coming but my experience with
Android 3.0 was largely dictated by my
experience with the zoom so I came in
with tempered expectations I would say I
tried to put those at bay and be as
objective as I could and I have to say
the e pad transformer blew me away even
though they
share similar DNA never seen the movie
twins zoom would be DeVito the epad
transformer is by far the Schwarzenegger
first let's start at the screen it has
an absolutely gorgeous IPS display
you're going to get a hundred and
seventy eight degree viewing angle which
is really impressive colors pop blacks
look very black you can have a bit of
trouble in direct sunlight but the
screen here is absolutely beautiful or
something like the soom looks washed out
this is going to look nice and a vibrant
also most importantly it's extremely
responsive responds very quickly to your
touch whether or not you're scrolling
through a website or whether or not
you're pinching and zooming whatever it
might be it just works very well even
with Flash content being shown we go
ahead and move things around and see it
tracks my finger very very very well
it's also very lightweight clocking in
at just about one point four nine pounds
one of the other really nice things
about the transformer are uses custom
widgets nothing that you have to use but
they really are a nice addition you can
see I've got the date here I've got a
custom male one that's being shown and
the weather and location they show up on
every home screen you can see right
there at the bottom right on each
nothing that you have to have you can
certainly turn it off but I found it to
be very welcome so some of the collins
battery life most of my testing was done
on pre-production operating system
software so what was running Android 3.0
and the East just tweaks that they had
and battery life wasn't outstanding
cases was claiming nine and a half hours
since the final firmware is pushed to
the device I've actually seen the
battery life improve and have gotten
close to that nine and a half hour mark
not quite there yet but if you have the
brightness set to about sixty to seventy
and you're doing general computing
they're looking at websites watching
some videos you'll have no problem
getting close to hitting that mark some
of the cons that I've seen as well
initiative battery life has been the
audio fidelity and in all candor these
cons are really nitpicky I could just
extremely impressed you can hear a bit
of the audio so I got queued up it's not
gonna do it justice here coming from the
speakers to the camera and then getting
upload to YouTube but
nice to say you're not gonna want to
deejay a party just with the built-in
speakers here on the transformer one of
the other sort of nice things about the
design it will move on to that category
again it's 10.1 inch IPS display with
178 degree viewing angle is really
impressive so you can say goodbye pretty
much to black bars when you're watching
a video in full screen which if that
matters to you is kind of nice I was
happy to to not have it be there go
ahead and close out of this so you get a
true sort of widescreen angle here
it's point 5-1 inches thick go ahead and
see the thickness right there and weighs
1.49 pounds it's certainly not the
thinnest tablet in the world of the iPad
for example is 0.34 inches and weighs
1.33 pounds but it's not going to be
embarrassed in a bikini on the beach
this is definitely a thin tablet it
feels very very light in the hands
that's a good time to talk about the
feel of a tablet the bezel is just thick
enough that you have room to rest your
thumbs tablets that sort of come out to
the edge your problem when you're
holding it this one I did not have any
trouble with that as well I didn't have
any trouble with that rather not as well
I felt really really nice in the hands
the back while not necessarily the
sexiest looking I just provide a nice
grip so you're not gonna worry about
dropping the tablet I also really like
the camera placement so as I'm holding
the device I'm not worried about popping
my finger go over that camera sensor
which is a concern with some other
tablets particularly the iPad 2 and this
seems like a no-brainer thing to say but
I was so happy to have that home and
power button featured on the left hand
side and be very easy to access having
used a black gray playbooks miniscule
option on the top or the zooms backward
facing power and lock button it was
really really welcome and nice to have
so let's talk about performance and I
want to show you my notes that I've got
here for performance I have one word
awesome the performance here is really
really good and you guys are gonna have
to take my word for it when you're
browsing for example things look really
fast
even if you're using flash contact there
really isn't any worry it works very
well and pinching and zooming is all
very very very quick if you see this
flash contact loading there and it's
even faster with the Flash content
turned off and you have the option which
is quite nice
for android games like Angry Birds
worked very very well if you want to
even launch some Tegra 2 dedicated games
and go ahead and jump into NVIDIA Tegra
zone which you can download from the
marketplace and you can get a con stun
of custom Tegra 2 games and are a lot to
like here the Android Marketplace is
something that's growing there aren't
that many choices in there quite yet but
certainly as developers get more time to
spend develop they're going to you know
improve that as we go so overall with
the risk of making this a 30-minute long
video I've just been really happy with
the poor performance of the e Pad
Transformer it's just a tablet
whenever anybody would ask me what
tablet I recommended whether it was
Android or the iPad my answer was always
the iPad 2 because I didn't think it's
performance for people I just wanted to
browse the web was matched anywhere else
I haven't used a pet transformer I can
definitely say that anybody who's
looking to get a tablet and looking at
an iPad owes it to themselves to look at
the e Pad Transformer and if you're in
the market for an Android tablet a
particular look no farther than the e
Pad Transformer it is hands-down the
best Android tablet I have ever tested
and it's certainly in the running for
the best tablet I have ever used the
best endorsement I could give it is that
I could use this as my everyday tablet
on a regular basis really is absolutely
outstanding alright so now let's talk
about what gives the transformer its
name and that is this guy right here the
keyboard now so the doc does bring some
interesting things to the table first
and foremost it brings an almost full
sized QWERTY keyboard to the transformer
if you've ever used a standard netbook
keyboard this is going to be very
reminiscent especially an Asus netbook
keyboard you've got your standard
Android buttons including your menu
button your home button you can see
those right here you've got some
additional functionality across the top
including
why five volume and media playback
interestingly though you've got a
trackpad here with a single button sir
is it a left and right click once you
have the Asus Transformer dolphin you
got to do is just push it in you are
going to have a cursor it's going to
move around as you track this and
hopefully it's gonna be picking up on
camera now you can see it right there
that moves around go ahead and hit home
so you can select things if you'd like
you don't get that much additional
functionality that right clicking
doesn't always give you stuff that
there's a particular menu option you can
select it if you do a lot of word
processing or some excel documentation
it's a nice feature to have at a $149
you may be better suited with just a
Bluetooth keyboard it does bring some
interesting functionality though with it
sweet this guy over to the side we're
going to see that it actually has two
USB ports one lives right on the left
hand side one lives on the other side of
the guy right there under those doors
and that's gonna give you actually
storage access so if you plug in a USB
thumb drive I'd be able to drag files to
and from it's really nice to sort of
have that functionality it's just a
really nice implementation of that
you're also gonna have a full-size SD
card right there as well you can see the
bulk that this is adding it's gonna add
an extra 1.4 pounds that's also gonna
give you an extra seven hours of battery
life this has an internal battery it's
going to charge it when it's in use kind
of interesting I don't know if I would
use this on an everyday basis carrying
it around the months I'm sure I see the
value versus carrying a regular netbook
or laptop but if you're the kind of
person that only wants to carry one
thing you don't want to carry a tablet
you don't want to carry a laptop this
may be a nice choice for you hello for
me I'd probably just use a Bluetooth
keyboard and go on my way the cursor is
novel but sir-- defeats the purpose of
having a tablet especially one that
relies on a touchscreen interface when
you just want to go ahead and touch the
device so if I haven't heaped enough
compliments on to the e Pad Transformer
you're definitely going to know that
this is hands-down the best Android
on the market it is hard to believe that
this shares internals with the Motorola
Xoom as I mentioned earlier if you are
in the market for your tablet you're
looking for any tablet particular
especially Android you really owe it
yourself to look at the e Pad
Transformer
it just works well it's quick its
responsive the screen is finally
beautiful this is the tablet that
Android lovers and Android users deserve
the Motorola Xoom was a nice first try
by Motorola this is the one worth
waiting for if you've been holding out
for any tablet or an Android one in
particular you definitely need to give
the e patch back to former look
definitely gives it a TechnoBuffalo seal
of approval I am John retina from
TechnoBuffalo and I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
