TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you a hands-on with the brand new iPhone
5s there's a lot to see here let's go
ahead and get our hands on it so the big
story here at least in my estimation is
touch ID they'll use your fingerprints
to unlock the phone to go ahead and get
that to unlock and boom we are in the
device we got a whole separate video
coming showing you what touch ID does
hit the link down below if you want to
watch that soon as a video goes up so
first let's talk about the design of the
phone so we've got the Space Gray mod
and I've been thinking to yourself isn't
that just the black version with a fancy
new name well here is the outgoing black
iPhone 5 - the difference they do look
very similar and they sort of have that
same sort of glimmer and light but the
Space Gray is a little bit grayer
whereas the black clothes a little bit
darker and that extends all the way to
the sides as well see a difference here
on the LED flash the camera same 8
megapixels oh the megapixels are a
little bit bigger here on the 5s but now
you've got that dual LED right there if
you want to turn on the flashlight
you're only gonna activate that top LED
just as a heads up the bottom one is an
amber color so the two different colored
LEDs kind of interesting going around
and feeling the phone though it feels
very much the same story so you've got a
few extra options here you can go ahead
and set touch ID up everything else is
very similar from the 5 to the 5s iOS 7
obviously comes pre-installed on this
you get all the iOS 7's from goodness
you'd expect my favorite though is
probably the new camera app you can sort
of slide through and take pictures you
can hold it down if you want to take
burst modes see all different options
you can do square photo video slow-mo
it's also very neat now so you can
actually slow things down and speed it
back up depending on what you want your
video to look like and I'll do it at 120
frames per second which is kind of neat
you also have all kinds of other filters
and stuff you can set in here as well if
you want as well as panoramic all kinds
of other neat goodness found inside of
the camera app parallax obviously here
as well it's sort of weird thing that
makes the icons look like they're
floating no matter what you have is your
Mac router home screen it's kind of neat
see other than that there's really not
that much different here you don't have
that square button in the home button
anymore they set square icon on the home
button anymore that is totally gone
people were wondering what it was gonna
feel like the new home button with touch
ID and it feels almost identical to what
the home button on the iPhone 5 felt
like there is a metal ring around each
version of the 5s although on the Space
Gray model you can't really see it it's
much more prominent on the silver or the
gold variant so keep that in mind if you
decide with that you want that to really
be shown why don't you want to sort of
fade into the background like we have
here on our Space Gray 5s phone feels
very similar to the iPhone 5 got that
same sort of cold feel from the brushed
aluminum or aluminium depending on where
in the world you live picking these
phones up closing your eyes really won't
be able to feel any difference at all
between the two we're gonna continue to
put it through its paces just want to
give you guys a real quick overview and
see what the colours look like and how
it compared versus the old iPhone 5 just
for fun let's bring in its brother
here is the blue iPhone 5 seeing see
differences there as well obviously it
almost looks like from the front like
the 5c is a case on it and the back
obviously is a whole different story
both have the same Retina display
screens a6 processor in the 5c in the
iPhone 5 and the a7 m7 combination here
in the iPhone 5s please give the video a
thumbs up must definitely appreciate it
well have a ton more iPhone 5s coverage
