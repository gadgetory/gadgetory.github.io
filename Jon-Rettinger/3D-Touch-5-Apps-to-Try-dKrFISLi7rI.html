iPhone 6s and 6s plus which comes with
something called 3d touch we did a
separate video explaining what the
technology does so if you guys haven't
seen that video yet make sure to check
it out over here basically it adds
another layer of navigation to iOS
allowing users to access quick actions
along with features like peak and pop
it's a huge addition to the iPhone and
it works great in Apple stock apps but
it only really become a huge part of the
future if developers use it in their
apps after all our smartphones wouldn't
be anything without apps we use every
day now there aren't a whole lot of apps
that support Apple's new 3d touch tech
just yet but there are a few that caught
our eye and magic piano for example if I
were to press on the notes with
different levels of force 3d touch
changes the volume of the notes and
creates a more complex sound it's very
hard to show this in video but if you
try it out yourselves you'll hear the
difference the harder you press on a
display the more two sound changes it's
pretty much like playing a real piano
giving you a deeper level of immersion
magic piano doesn't support peek and pop
nor quick actions but it will be able to
figure out how hard you press on a
display when you're inside the app next
up is Shazam now with Shazam and Apple's
3d touch the Shazam app now supports
quick actions from the home screen which
means if you depress on the app icon a
new menu will pop up giving you an
option to either start listening or take
a photo for visual recognition the new
quick actions feature which Suzanne will
make it faster for Shazam to start
listening to songs whereas before you'd
have to launch the app wait for it to
load press the button and start
listening it's not a mind-blowing
feature but it's still cool nonetheless
moving on to instagram 3d touch takes
advantage of both quick actions and peek
and pop when you press hard on the app
icon and then you will pop-up giving you
options to add a new post view your
activity search and look at your DMS
inside the app if you're in someone's
profile you can peek at a photo with a
medium press and if you press a little
harder it'll pop into the actual photo
now you can do the same in your timeline
and let's say if you want to peek at
someone's profile without fully going
into their page you can 3d touch their
profile photo or name and it'll show you
a brief overview you can swipe up for
more options such as sending a message
unfollow or turn on post notifications
for that specific user I think it
changes the way we view photos and
profiles and Instagram and I personally
use this feature on a daily basis next
up is Dropbox now similar to instagrams
feature you'll be able to 3d touch the
app icon to bring up options like
uploading a photo of you recently action
files as well as search in your Dropbox
inside the app though you'll be able to
peek and pop to get previews of folders
or files it's a really neat feature that
I'm sure heavy Dropbox users will enjoy
and last but not least is Evernote now
if you're a heavy Evernote user you'll
be able to navigate through all your
notes using 3d touch with quick actions
from the home screen you'll be able to
add a new note take a photo or set a
reminder inside the Evernote app however
you can activate 3d touch to peek into
links and then press deeper to pop into
the full website you can even use the
same feature to get a preview of your
notes if you'd like which is very
similar to Dropbox making it easier for
you to find the right notes now all of
these apps we mentioned today are free
so if you guys want to check them out

below and if you guys haven't seen our
iPhone 6s and 6s plus reviews make sure
to check them out over here anyways
