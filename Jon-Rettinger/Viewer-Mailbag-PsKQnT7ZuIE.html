for lakers calm just got back from
dinner telling people about the website
in the videos and kind of made me want
to come home and make a video for you
guys so I'm going to do another edition
of reader or viewer mail bag depending
on what they are watching this on
youtube or John for lakers calm but in
cases the first one you've seen I pick
questions at random on answer I'm and
hopefully their representative of
questions that you may have or if
they're not hopefully you'll find the
answers to be interesting if not close
the video I'm sorry I'll some more
unboxing and stuff coming later all
right the first question here let's see
what this is here comes from user jtm
g11 and a question is hi John I recently
purchased an iphone 3g I need to know
what screen protector and soft case
you'd recommend Thanks actually this is
a great question do you get this quite a
bit I don't have a case on it as you can
see but i do have a clear screen
protector it's just the sticky adhesive
one that you get from the apple store i
don't know the brand on top of my head
but glee apple store ask them for the
sticky adhesive it does not interfere at
all with how you touch the screen or the
responsiveness of the screen they come
in both matte or glossy I've got the
glossy because that's how I prefer it
the mat blocks out the reflection from
the Sun but doesn't make the screen is
bright one of the features about the
phone that I like so much is the
brightness so let me go ahead and look
at another one here funding good one
alright this is from user JCL anagen
titled macbook and says hey John I want
to get a macbook and didn't know if I
could shoot movies from the isight
camera please email me email me back uh
yeah you can absolutely she moves
through isight camera the isight camera
in the macbook macbook pro imac macbook
air you can all use the isight camera to
shoot youtube videos that's what it's
there for you know for ichat skype also
so yes no problem hundred percent i know
a lot of people on here use the use it
for that
all right let's pick out another one
here let's go the next picking of a
random one from the next page here all
right this is not a computer one this
one is from mice lillo for titled xbox
360 or ps3 it says hi which is better
gaming system because I don't know what
to choose the xbox 360 or the ps3 not
the wii LOL well i made my decision i
sold my xbox and got the ps3 i liked
being able to play blu-ray movies if
movies watching movies high definition
are important to you than ps3 is really
really an option now gaming is important
to you or online gaming is the most
important thing I think that the xbox
live is one of the best around both have
great games both have great exclusive
titles people in the debate in which is
better but really comes down to personal
preference so go to the store play
though yeah make your decision based on
what's important to you let's pick out
one more alright alright this one's from
hockey nut 141 titled reader mail bag um
hey john i'm a current pc user from dell
and well i'm switching to mac suit next
March or April thing is I don't know
what to get and I was looking at the
macbook air and probe then I thought
that I might get an imac and then some
research on the Mac I think that I'm
gonna get but I had one question it's a
long sentence should I get the three
point 06 give you hurts 24-inch imac or
should I get the 2.8 gigahertz 24-inch
imac what should i do get a two point
four min much for doing some thai
intensive stuff from never notice a
difference by getting imac i'm going to
go for the 2.8 save the money send it on
whatever else didn't want to do you
don't don't worry i can understand
between that gigahertz speed now you'll
be very happy with either so that's it
