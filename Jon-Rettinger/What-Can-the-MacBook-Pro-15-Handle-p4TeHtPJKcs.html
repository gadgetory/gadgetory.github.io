been a lot of videos assessing the
performance of the new MacBook Pro but
most them take a look at the top
two-year forty three hundred dollar
model we wanted to take a more
budget-conscious approach and evaluate
the baseline 15-inch model it comes in
at twenty four hundred dollars on a day
to day basis I do most of my editing on
the rig so that's a warrant I'm
accustomed to let's see what kind of
performance we can get out of the
MacBook Pro so if you've used premiere
Final Cut when it comes down to it both
of them do more or less the same thing
you're not really gaining any
functionality or losing any
functionality between the two pieces of
software but the one main thing that I
wanted to assess was whether or not
Final Cut provided a smoother experience
in editorial process I've been hearing
love about how Final Cut works really
well Apple's Hardware they've optimized
the software to function well and
they're machines
I typically edit it in premiere but I
thought I'd give Final Cut X a shot and
see how the new MacBook Pro handles our
4k workflow and that's where everything
plays back very smoothly I'm not running
into issues and that's mostly my main
concern I don't want the workflow to
interfere with the creative process of
putting in clips organizing my timeline
and cutting together a video at first I
noticed that the settings were
configured for better performance over
quality even adjusting it to better
quality I still got smooth playback now
I did notice that the fans started kick
in and the laptop itself got warmer so I
was definitely taxing the hardware but
it kept up just fine which was pretty
impressive and so I have to say I think
apples done a pretty good job of
configuring and building final cut
around the different hardware components
that they incorporate into their
machines playback in Premiere it seems a
lot more laggy I can't play it at full
resolution at least unrendered it looks
like playing back at half resolution
works a little bit better but I'm still
getting some stuttering few drop frames
here and there it's not a very smooth
experience it looks like adjusting to
court resolution so from 4k that would
be 1080p that's we're actually getting
is the same sort of smooth playback that
we were getting in Final Cut so it looks
like is you're dropping stuff in your
timeline beginning to edit that's gonna
be okay but you're gonna have to run a
court resolution which is not bad like a
lot of times especially on a laptop you
kind of expect these compromises to be
made
and then to actually see a complete
representation of your edit and how it's
going to look on file export go up to
render everything out beforehand not a
super technical test I jumped into the
software kind of give you a glimpse of
the user experience between both ends of
the spectrum whether using final cut or
premiere definitely can tell that Adobe
struggle is a little bit more with the
same sort of footage and effects
compared to final cut exporting on a
Final Cut Pro it took 6 minutes and 55
seconds to render about 6 and a half
minute timeline the 4k footage to 1080p
h.264 codec this was with background
rendering the same h.264 export to 1080
P out of premiere it took nine minutes
and 30 seconds the computer got notes to
be louder and warmer during the export
to for reference the rig premiere export
was 4 minutes and 12 seconds alright so
this is my favorite part of the video
not because we're here getting ramen
which is one of my favorites but because
we're doing the gaming portion we're
gonna try out Diablo one of my favorites
first thing I wanted to try was just to
see how the game and run and max
resolution and it's pretty choppy and
this is with a resolution of 3840 by
2160 on high and we're getting about 17
to 18 frames per second pretty laggy I
mean you can still play the game but any
of the graphical improvements you get it
are gonna be negated by the sacrifices
you get in gameplay so it doesn't work
very well alright so we're gonna switch
it down to something a little bit more
reasonable mess around at the settings a
little bit we found that the best
compromise between gameplay and graphic
performance it was when we dropped
resolution down to about 1920 by 1200
and we're still able to keep all of our
settings on high with the exception of
shadow we brought those down to medium
and that's significantly improved our
framerate we got about an extra 20
frames per second out of that got some
lutes yeah
get my diamond to my insightful ring of
Valor all right booting up some
Borderlands here running at 1920 by 1200
which is the maximum resolution you can
do we got it decent framerate actually
have you seen to be averaging kind of in
the mid 30s just as a curiosity see like
what would happen if we drop down the
resolution we dropped that to 1680 by
1050 and we're still getting pretty good
framerate Mike still in the mid mid
thirties definitely playable stuff right
now booting up Tomb Raider it's gonna be
the most graphically intense game that
we're going to test out right now I said
not to go in anything too crazy just
because you know you have to understand
obviously it's a portable computer I
won't try to find something that was
gonna be reasonably intensive
performance wise for the same time I
wasn't gonna die completely break the
computer because we didn't want to be
able play the game that's like the whole
point first time you booted up we went
ahead and did the automatic settings
that Tomb Raider configured for us which
was a resolution of 1650 by 1050 all the
settings were kind of like on average
and we're getting about an average frame
rate of 42 pretty smooth and everything
Zilla playback it looks good on the
flipside I decided to see what would
happen if we expect this thing all the
way out we push the resolution and all
the settings up to max so today the
resolution up to 30 360 by 2100 and all
the settings on high and that's where
things got pretty bad kind of averaged
framerate about 13.8 thing you can
barely even run this verdict on gaming
computer definitely could handle it but
you have to understand the limitations
it has you won't be able to have
everything completely specked out then
again this is not really a gaming
computer but definitely works you know
it's like if you want a game on your Mac
you certainly boot up you know a few
games and have a good time had any
stress just like I am right so now we
have gaming and editing out of the way I
wanted to see how much rendering
horsepower can get out of the new
MacBook Pro we're gonna go ahead and
open up Maya which is 3d animation
software for animation modeling and
rendering so we got the file open let me
go ahead and kind of navigate around and
I'll change this over from wire
to the shaders okay so when most part
looks like it's pretty smooth a mole to
kind of reorient myself around the scene
zoom in here and check stuff out it's
not lagging too much so it's still
usable it seems to be holding up pretty
well let's go ahead and see what it's
like when I go ahead and try and render
this out so let me position the camera
we're gonna go ahead render using Arnold
which is a particular rendering software
we'll change that the JPEG and I'm gonna
go ahead and do this as HD 1920 by 1080
and our quality is 100 so we should get
a pretty interesting image out of this
so our full render time came out it's
about 421 I went and ran the same scene
on the rig using Maya and that one came
out at a minute and 46 seconds that was
using the same setting with Arnold does
a decent job at running Maya you could
definitely get your work done on here I
was really curious just to see I've used
Maya decent amount
mostly on a desktop computer so the
baseline 15-inch MacBook Pro perform
decently well but at that price point
it's a little underwhelming it works
well with an apples ecosystem but the
really only intensive application that
you would need out of Apple would be
Final Cut when it comes to gaming 3d
rendering or even premiere isn't
functioned very well if you're probably
better off getting another computer
that's better SPECT at that price point
it's gonna perform better because as
more computing course power now if you
need Final Cut you're gonna be pretty
much stuck using one of Apple's
computers and the MacBook Pros are gonna
work very well for that if you're gonna
be using your computer primarily for
premiere or 3d work or any gaming then
you might wanna look elsewhere you
probably get a better value at that
price point
they're good gaming options out there
like a razor blade or even the new
surface book computers that are probably
a more appealing option what do you guys
think any MacBook Pro users out there
using their computer for gaming 3d work
or any of the stuff that we evaluate in
this video what's your performance been
like we'd love to hear about it leave a
comment down below until next time I'm
Andrew from TechnoBuffalo see you next
video before I want to tell you guys
about the science go app I've been
watching a lot of the old Mythbusters
content on there and if you guys want to
watch along - be sure to download the
app you can watch your favorite Sancho
shows anytime anywhere click the link
below and learn more oh yeah Ron
and I feel like I like half of our
videos at least all my videos have food
in them I'm introducing you guys to do
food and tech at the same time gotta
have your priorities straight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
