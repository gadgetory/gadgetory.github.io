from TechnoBuffalo here back with a
video driven from rock curiosity the new
2010 ipod touch is so similar to the
iPhone 4 it's got the same a4 processor
it's got the same Retina display same
amount of RAM and the specs let's just
keep going on and on main difference
being its lack of a cellular radio so I
was just very curious to see if there's
any sort of speed difference between the
iPhone 4 and the iPod Touch so I'm gonna
put these two head-to-head and a few
speed tests and see if we've got a
winner
alright so both the iPhone 4 in the iPod
Touch are running the most current
version of iOS iOS 4.1 and both have no
programs and no processes running the
background I know Apple manages their
memory a bit differently but you want to
show that both were clean had nothing
running in the background
both are have the same wireless
capabilities 802 11 and are connected
via the same router on the same Wi-Fi
network so this webpage loading test
should be pretty close all the rest of
these tests is relatively unscientific
just curious if we see which one is
faster so the pages that we're gonna
load are pages that have been viewed on
both devices before so consider this a
test of sites that you visit on a
regular basis so we're gonna go ahead
and load Safari it's gonna load
TechnoBuffalo first and we'll see if
we've got a winner go ahead and then
safari at exactly the same time or at
least as close as I can get there we go
and both are off I've got the iPhone 4
on the left and the iPod Touch on the
right so Safari is loading pretty
quickly on each and if those of you who
are wondering why I've got airplane mode
on the iPhone 4 it's my daily phone I
don't like phone call or text messaging
to come in while I am filming
TechnoBuffalo is a pretty graphics heavy
page so there's a lot of content to load
here looks like we're almost done on
each iPhone 4 still loading iPod Touch
is still loading I should mention - and
I've got a video uploading the
background on this network while I'm
doing these tests so it should affect
both
same time in the same way so the ipod
touch finished just a hair quicker the
iPhone 4 is still chugging along or at
least trying to chug along and is now
done so the iPod Touch actually finished
noticeably quicker on that speed test
let's go like Lotus site like ESPN it's
gonna load the mobile page by default
see if there's any sort of difference
here i'm Meccans are gonna be an
unscientific test so right now we've got
the iPod Touch being a bit quicker
there's ESPN ESPN here as well and we'll
go to let's go to the main ESPN site and
see if we can see any sort of speed
difference all right so that's loading
as well and we are going to the mobile
version first
it looks like the iPod Touch very
handily be to the iPhone 4 let's go
ahead and go down to the bottom and it
will give us an option to launch the
full page and ESPN is a very graphics
and there's some video sort of embedded
on there so see if there's a big
difference here as well
I'll open each up get that to say open
do the same thing here and we'll go
ahead and hit open and see if that seems
to be different phones true with the
iPod Touch being a bit faster than the
iPhone 4 so it looks like the iPhone 4s
got a bit of an early age so actually
the showing stuff now almost exactly the
same time
iPhone 4 maybe just a little bit faster
at this point and we'll see how this
ends up we can already start to see
content you can see pictures you can see
some of the articles sort of up in the
upper right hand corner and both are
still loading and appear to be loading
them relatively slowly the content is
still coming in it looks like both are
hung up at almost exactly the same place
maybe there's some sort of content on
the website that is slow running for
mobile devices so and again it looks
like we're watching this in stereo half
at exactly the same time here it looks
like maybe the iPhone 4 is got a bit of
a speed edge we can already go through
and view the content on each go ahead
and all restart to scroll through and
see what things look like and the ipod
touch just finished the iPhone 4 finish
a little bit later so there we go the
iPod Touch they're very long-winded
tests does load of webpages a little bit
faster and then behind phone for even
when the network is bogged down with
uploading so you can see now let's go
ahead and jump on and do a few other
tests let's see how it opens
applications so since both these have
the same processor in the same operating
system also the same applications let's
go and open some of the similar ones and
see if there is any speed difference
let's start with the App Store loading
so it opened up at exactly the same time
you saw as icons show up I mean really
you can see it one by one by one
happening at exactly the same time so
really no difference here with the App
Store let's go ahead and open up
something like iTunes use any difference
there as well so go into my apps folder
and open up iTunes so everything's
showing up now pretty close to the same
looks like maybe the iPhone 4 is a
little bit faster here loading its
content you can also see that in iTunes
on iOS 4.1 you've got ping I'll show you
that in a later video but it's present
on any of the aya devices here to check
out so really in this very unscientific
test of rock curiosity really nothing
got got answered with a great degree of
certainty both loaded websites pretty
similarly perhaps the iPod Touch was a
little bit faster speed ones than the
iPhone 4 it seems like the same hardware
is going to yield the same speed results
I was wondering if maybe the iPod Touch
might be optimized a bit better so it
doesn't have to do the same processes
that the iPhone 4 does namely the phone
calls and always be searching for
Network
things like that but appears that both
are very very similar and we guys hope
you enjoyed this very again unscientific
test I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo be sure to stay tuned to
the channel and the website for all
kinds of upcoming tech news all that
information will be down below see in
the next video
buh-bye
