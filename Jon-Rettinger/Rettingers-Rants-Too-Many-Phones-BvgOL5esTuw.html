to you by full sail university welcome
back to another episode of renter's
rancis the show where I ran into rave
and give it pains about anything from
the world of technology or even outside
the world of technology up this week
we're to talk about android phones and
why there are so many of them and why i
think it's a bad thing for consumers
have new phones come out every few
months i'm jon rettinger go and get
started alright sony preface this video
by saying yes i realize i'm kind of
stabbing myself on the wallet the more
phones that come out the better it is
for TechnoBuffalo we get more phones to
review talk about make videos about it's
great for content but I'm a consumer
just like you i don't think the
frequency of phones is necessarily the
best for us i was going through looking
at the amount of videos that we've made
over the past year phones we've had in
our review drawer review cabinet and
they were just been an astronomical
number of devices and I don't think it's
Esther the best thing for consumers I
think the art table example if you take
the say the droid razr on verizon built
by motorola droid razr came out it was a
huge success every was excited out of
Kevlar back it was waterproof it was
thin it was quick it worked really
really well and it's sold like
gangbusters but the battery wasn't the
best in it was sealed in there and
people weren't getting to bail out there
hoping for a few months later droid razr
maxx with 2 x's for emphasis comes out
boasting better battery life the galaxy
s galaxy s2 galaxy s3 the time between
them is very very thin so what is this
mean for a consumer and a very vocal
consumer well let's say you're looking
to sign a new two year contract you're
stuck with a phone for two years you can
take the subsidy on it want to make sure
you can have the best phone for you
during that two-year period so let's say
you're on Verizon and this is when the
droid razr came out you go and sign your
name to a two-year deal well couple
months go by and suddenly your phone's
not really new anymore most consumers
aren't as text abuse perhaps you or me
walk into a store i want to buy a phone
they see what sitting there it's a great
i'll take that one so you're going to be
a bit perturb you're going to be annoyed
there can be different versions of
android f3 supported different phones
out to be supported and you're going to
have broader fragmentation and maybe
this is
the consumerist in me thinking it when I
bias piece of technology i want it to be
the latest on it to the greatest at
least for a period of time I'm not
foolish enough to think that it's always
going to be new it's always going to be
awesome it's always going to be great
but at least for a few months after I
bought that shiny piece of tech let it
be cutting edge it's really tough in the
world of Android something new is always
coming out and it's always coming out
with perhaps different operating systems
now you got phones with Gingerbread
still being shipped Ice Cream Sandwich
some stuff shipping with jelly bean and
you got seven eight ten different
devices coming from different
manufacturers you got different skins on
each different versions of skins on each
maybe you got sense for sense 3.1 maybe
you got TouchWiz or maybe got older
version of motoblur all these different
devices different skins make it very
hard for developers to keep track of
device to support and that's really
hurting I think android they've got a
great google play store there are some
gems of applications in there but you
got to wade through a lot of crap to get
to the golden items in there that's
really unfortunate because the good
stuff in google play is really really
good I think better than on really any
other app infrastructure can tell you
how many emails I get and again maybe
I'm slanted because the industry I'm in
saying you know I'm so annoyed that i
bought this new phone that's something
new is out and share we turn it should I
not return it should I sell it and buy
something at full price it just makes
for an unhappy consume I know it's made
me pretty unhappy so you say what you
will about Apple you generally know a
new phones coming out once a year I'm
wondering if perhaps that might be a
good model for other manufacturers to
emulate or maybe two models a year so
that could say HTC they're going to be
too high end HTC phones per year know
what you're getting know what to look
for it's got a set ready cycle the new
phone comes out in January you buy it in
december then you know that you're
really gonna have a new phone for a
month and you know that it's expected I
like that model I like that there are
options for consumers to know they're
gonna have the latest and greatest
technology now the other side of that
coin is that the more device is the more
choice and certainly I like choice as
well so yes I am contacting myself but
as a consumer it annoys me and I found
that that wrote about this I've talked
about in previous videos I find it
infuriating that if I had bought a phone
and two months later as a new version of
it out I'd be mad too one thing i will
say ballys mobile device were talking
about y'all have
awesome app stores whether it's Google
Play whether it's the App Store on Apple
devices whatever it might be though the
application store world application
