TechnoBuffalo here it started through a
rough and tech industry without hearing
the term 4G thrown around whether it's
referring to LTE WiMAX or HSPA+ there's
no doubt that all of the major networks
are tatting their 4G prowess what we've
got right here is a test of two 4G
networks in this case the HSPA+ variety
on the left hand side we have t-mobile's
4G network being tested on the Galaxy S
4G on the right we have 18 Keys 4G
network being tested on the inspire 4G
18 he has an LTE network coming which
they're gonna increase speeds but for
right now we have HSPA+ which is what
both carriers are referring to 4G so I'm
gonna be interesting to do a speed test
on both and see which one was quicker
now certainly this is going to vary
depending on where you are in the
country right now I'm in Southern
California so these speeds a really only
representative of my area wherever you
are your signal strength might vary
string a little signal strength here is
pretty even we actually have two bars
each you can see the H+ icon right up at
the top on the inspire and its 4G icon
right over there on the Galaxy S 4G so
we've got the same speed test app here
on both will go ahead and run them you
can certainly see a difference here
between the Super AMOLED screen on the
standard LCD so I have begin test
suddenly matter if it gets hit at the
same time we're just testing the speeds
and Wi-Fi has been turned off on both
them doesn't really matter what else is
running as long as we're testing the
network speeds here so we'll go ahead
and let these begin latency test was a
little bit quicker on the Galaxy S 4G
and we're gonna look at megabits per
second t-mobile claims they can get up
to 24 megabits per second and 18 teeth
claiming noticeably slower here so you
can see there's a significant difference
here what that was speeds so this is one
point two eight megabits per second here
on the download for eight
tea and that's 2.75 they're showing
their their I mean kilobytes but we can
go ahead and convert it that is a
significant difference on the download
on the upload t-mobile's giving us 1
point 5 whereas AT&amp;amp;T is giving us point
two two significant differences here let
me go ahead and I'll change the settings
so you can see what it looks like in
megabits per second but those results
are quite astounding so you can see that
there's a giant difference now is one
test representative
maybe not let's go ahead and run more
and we'll see you up if any difference I
would actually have now one extra bar of
4G HSPA+ on a TMT compared to the two
that we still have on two mobiles let's
go ahead and test these guys again and
seek the speeds give us the same results
so we'll go ahead and load of both of
these and already you can see that
there's a difference now with with a GE
TMT gave us three point one three down
and Timo would give us two point eight
seven this is a fun game to play keep
testing networks I found myself doing it
over and over and over again I'm like a
kid in a candy store here testing speeds
so you can get either the huge
difference in the upload speeds the
download speeds now AT&amp;amp;T came in faster
we'll do a quick tiebreaking test then
we'll try loading some website and see
how real-world usage varies so I'll go
ahead and test again and I will say
that's eight out of ten texts that I've
run the t-mobile 4G has been noticeably
quicker than AT&amp;amp;T you can see right here
two point eight nine versus three point
six on the down the upload appears to
not be much of a competition the mortal
being however that the download speeds
on both are relatively quick but no pair
near what's the advertised network
capability is 24 megabits per second on
t-mobile and about 12 or so with et you
know we're getting a 12th or a tenth of
that depending on what your score is
whether it's in the ones or the threes
big differences here so let's go ahead
and try and load a couple web pages
all of these scores in mind all right so
I've got ESPN the full version loaded
and ready to test on both devices of
course as you can see it this is a site
that has them loaded before on each I
will say that plugins have been disabled
on both browsers meaning flash has been
turned off so it'll get sort of the most
optimal performance that we can and
again we've got t-mobile's 4G on the
left and 18 T's on the right and a
quickest way to make sure I can hit them
at the same time is just to do simple
refresh so I'll go ahead and do both
those here go and hit the Go button one
more time I'll go ahead and hit the Go
button here hold it down and the Go
button here as well and we'll let them
go at exactly the same time and see if
we have any sort of speed difference now
keeping in mind that t-mobile's was
showing as an actual faster downloads we
can see eight GMT is almost done
t-mobile's almost the same spot 18 T
finished just a little bit before
t-mobile did and I will say despite the
maybe one mega megabit per second
difference that I saw on actual tests
the t-mobile was on the tad bit faster
certainly you know we can read load web
pages and keep reloading web pages but
it's only going to show one time in one
instance on video both were very quick
both were notice will be quicker than 3G
but certainly are getting nowhere near
capabilities if you have to pick a three
a four G network and assuming you're in
the area of service for both t-mobile is
gonna serve you a little bit better on
the short term with their HSPA+ network
however what AT&amp;amp;T is true for G LTE
network coming soon you may be better
off taking a little bit of a speed hit
now with the notion that you're going to
get better long term data speeds in the
future they're both fantastic networks
that'll be fun to sort of test both
these guys and see what you guys thought
so anyway I'm John Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo with the short fun network
speed test which camp are you in whether
or not you consider HSPA+ 4G there's
certainly no debating that the marketing
folks and the carriers are treating it
as such
anyway guys I will see you in the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
