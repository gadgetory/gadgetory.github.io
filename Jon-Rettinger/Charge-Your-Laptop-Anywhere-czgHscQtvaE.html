here from TechnoBuffalo and today I
wanted to take a look at the charge tech
27,000 milliamp hour AC output battery
pack basically a giant battery pack with
an AC output so I'm gonna cut right to
the chase here I wanted to test this out
because I run out of juice on the road
when I'm editing on my macbook pro and I
wanted to see if this could help me
extend battery life during exports and
renders and the short answer is yes it
does it has a price tag of one hundred
and eighty-five dollars so I'll let you
guys decide whether that's in your
budget or not for me it's a pretty
affordable rate for what the product is
and how much it can speed up my workflow
and make it more practical for me the
battery itself is a bit on the larger
side compared to most mobile batteries
but for how many million powers it's
packin it is actually pretty slick it's
about the size of a paperback book so
not that bad you can easily slide it in
your backpack without having to worry
too much in real world usage charging
times are not bad at all from 0 to 60%
it took me about an hour and 10 minutes
now in 15 minutes and from 0 to 100% on
my macbook pro it took about 2 to 2 and
a half hours a word of warning however
if the battery pack gets super super hot
after charging for a while so bear that
in mind you don't want to leave this in
your backpack if there's something
you're going to burn or melt possibly if
he's a plastic or something just for
safety reasons in addition to the AC
outlet you're going to have two USB
ports to charge your phone tablet
whatever they are just regular USB ports
however no quick charging here with the
27,000 million power capacity you could
charge my macbook pro from zero to a
hundred I'd say a solid two to three
times however in my real-world usage I
didn't really get around to that I was
more using the battery pack to top off
my phones and my tablets and then plug
in my laptop to keep the battery level
constant during exports or renders just
kind of hold me over the only other
thing you are going to have to pay
attention to is that when you're going
to charge up the battery pack itself it
uses a proprietary connector so you're
going to have to carry around a separate
charging brick I'll let you guys decide
if that's really a hassle or not for me
it really wasn't I would charge up the
battery at home at night and then just
take it with me so I wouldn't have to
carry on the brick not a huge deal for
me maybe it is for you guys and that's
really it for this video guys let me
know what you think of this battery
solution I for sure like it because it's
improving my mobile editing workflow and
I'm all
productivity let me know what you think
in the comments down below are you a fan
of it are you not what other alternative
solutions would you recommend I take a
look at thank you so much for watching
give us a thumbs up if you liked this
video hit subscribe for more awesome
tech content I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
