we've got a lot to cover in the wide
world of technology today is June tenth
2011 happy Friday hopefully it's going
to be a nice weekend for you for me this
graduation weekend on Sunday I finally
get my master's degree after three years
of working towards it so I'm quite happy
let's talk about technology we've got an
iPhone rumor Palooza as you can see
right here audrianna wrote up that we
might be looking at two new iPhones
running on dual gsm and cdma bands
potentially at the rumor mills to be
believed we will have one iphone that'll
be for verizon and AT&amp;amp;T using a
dual-mode chipset and another iphone
that will work with sprint and t-mobile
no idea what might happen if the AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile merger goes through allegedly
there's talks of LTE being included even
wimax on the sprint side and potentially
as a port for hspa+ I wouldn't
necessarily hold your breath but there's
a potential that all this could happen I
will be seeing updates to each phone
every other year so if you're on AT&amp;amp;T
the AT&amp;amp;T and verizon phone will get
updated every other year so we won't see
the same release cycle that we've been
seeing could be a bit tough for those
you that like to upgrade regularly what
do you guys think leave your comment
down below and pointing at you so you
leave your comments down okay next we've
got Mike's unboxing and review of the
Canon Vixia HF g10 this is according to
Mike the Optimus Prime of consumer HD
camcorders it's actually my new
camcorder I let Mike do the unboxing but
you can see it right here this is what
it looks like it's got the big ol rode
mic on top of there because it looks
kind of menacing coming at me like that
this is going to give me 1080p video
finally and better audio because of this
guy so I'm obviously very excited in my
recent videos you might have seen that
they've been 1080p and that's because
I've been experimenting and shooting
with this so if you want to see mike's
full review of the camera be sure to
check it out it from the market for a
new video camera I'll
I can certainly recommend it Facebook
tests a new real-time happening now
sidebar if you're interested in facebook
you're active in facebook give it a read
also note the implement some new face
tracking stuff for face recognition
things so that could be potentially
creepy and you have to opt out of it
three a bit been apprehended in Spain
for the sony playstation attack finally
good news for the consumer this isn't
that they're getting hacked again
they're finally putting the stranglehold
on those that have been doing the
hacking angry birds live video if you
watch one YouTube video today make it
this one I folks at t-mobile actually
did a live Angry Birds reenactment with
exploding birds and exploding pigs it is
super awesome if you watch to youtube
videos today definitely watch the other
video of the lady on her online dating
profile talking about her love for tats
if you've seen it you know what I'm
talking about it if not you got to find
it someone's got to sent to you because
it's very very funny sony launches video
series to probe their new tablets the
s-1 and the s2 we've covered those sort
of at length they look to be pretty
awesome new tablets Apple's recalling
verizon op had two units new iphone 5
features hinted at it was the LED
notification thing on the back here I'll
actually light up and blink when you get
notifications we're postulated that
wraps you might see a front-facing LED
on the iphone 5 sony an apple plan to
implement wii u inspired controls i was
actually watching Mollywood on the buzz
report actually today talking about the
wii u sounding like a siren it totally
made me laugh think about it we really i
found it it's friday come on guys um
