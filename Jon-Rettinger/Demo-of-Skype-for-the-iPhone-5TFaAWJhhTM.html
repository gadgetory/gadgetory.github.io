demo for you of Skype for the iPhone
this was just released actually seven
minutes ago at midnight Eastern Time on
March 31st so I go ahead and show you
guys what this looks like this is not a
jailbroken iPhone this is a free
download from the App Store go ahead and
unlock the phone here with the camera
focus there you have Skype and keep in
mind this can only work on a Wi-Fi
connection this will not work over a 3G
or edge connection you have to have
Wi-Fi so philia don't know what Skype is
it is voice over IP calling and instant
messaging and if you're calling somebody
who has another Skype account Skype to
Skype is free but you can also make
Skype to landlines if you have some
credits which actually are relatively
inexpensive good open this up here
launch is a pretty Skype screen I see
the login giving your login information
and here you've got a dial screen it
looks just like an iPhone you can dial
any number you like go and delete that
you also can view all your contacts that
you have in your iPhone and you can dial
right from there you've got your back
button just like on an iPhone you can
view your Skype contacts
go ahead that you see that those are
Mo's who are available you keeping you
Skype chats you guys actually has a
built-in instant messaging client
there's your call button where you just
were that your history and you've got
your my info which displays your Skype
number which I'm not gonna go ahead and
show let's go ahead and make a test call
here I will go ahead and call my
girlfriend
that's routing call make sure you tell
one before you dial anything sir it goes
routing call they can see what that
looks like it just says calling Rebecca
routing call and that's it go ahead and
hang out from her don't tell her I hung
up from her she'll be very upset
so yeah just just a real quick demo of
what Skype for the iPhone looks like
it's just a real simple free way to make
calls if you're low on minutes you want
to you have an IM chat with somebody on
skype you want to call international for
example Skype to Skype calls anywhere in
the world are free and just a great way
to make phone calls I'm really happy
that this guy finally released a client
here I'm going to use this to call
friends and some family that I have in
Europe and elsewhere and it really makes
it nice it's not I can do it right for
my iPhone anywhere I have a Wi-Fi
connection so I'm very very happy about
that and we guys hope you enjoyed for
