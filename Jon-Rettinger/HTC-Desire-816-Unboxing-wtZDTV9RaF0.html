to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo here than
unboxing of this guy the desire eight
one six you're playing yourself John
it's clearly out of the box we've got a
crazy for this experiment going on right
now
we've been boxed this back in time
actually I filmed the unboxing and then
throw in the intro but I like my crazy
back in time explanation better let's go
ahead open it up and see what it looks
like so here is the box for the HTC
Desire eight one six think of this is
the HTC One m8 plastic kid-brother it's
got a lot of the goodness but a little
bit of a different body so this is
probably not coming to the US since
international phone available in
international markets with a ton of
different networks so there is 4G LTE
connectivity but certainly if you want
to pick one of these up you're gonna
want to make sure that's going to work
in your region so typical HTC bucks it's
white it's kind of thin and it looks
like a rectangle let's go ahead and
bring in the unboxing scissors of doom
and cut this sucker open and see what
this looks like
I like the last generation desires I
think HTC really does actually nice job
with some of their plastic design phones
although certainly I prefer the aluminum
feel of the HTC One m8 which will bring
it in a minute I do a comparison with
will run through all the specs on the
desire each one six go ahead and open
this up in our gadget striptease here
man in a in it boom that just I think I
should just make it rain on the phone so
here is HTC Desire eight one six with a
pretty nice 5.5 inch screen so bigger
screen that we see on the HTC One m8
those were going to have in the box
you're going to have I don't know what
those are me those are NFC tags but
there's stickers of some sort HTC desire
paperwork paperwork got a wall charger
sync and charge cable and then HTC
standard headphones that we've seen in
most other phones but that is not overly
exciting if I'm wrong and you guys want
to make sure I show all the headphones
and stuff and other unboxings letting me
know and I'll do that please for me it's
all about
the phone so here is HTC desire eight
one six well slide it out of that
package boom Wow
it was really nice it's got a like a
polycarbonate plastic feel it feels very
similar to the Nokia Lumia lines it's
not sort of removable back plastic that
we've seen on Samsung phones it's sort
of more that unibody type design so
let's see if it's got enough power in to
turn it on if I can find a power button
which sort of oddly now lives on the
left side device before he gets all the
good stuff about the desire eight one

anymore
I backed unboxing this guy so you are
looking at a 5.5 inch grant a 720 by
1280 resolution so it's 720 by 1280 if
you can do math really fast you know
that is 267 PPI certainly below the
1080p of its Big Brother powering it is
a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 400
chip
it's an 801 on HTC One so it's you know
401 snapdragons better so it's still a
very capable processor it's a quad-core
processor it's clocked at 1.2 gigahertz
it'll certainly get you through anything
that you need to do it's got eight gigs
of RAM on board here as well it also has
a microSD card store she can go up to 64
gigs on there if you want to get your
external storage on so know what you're
gonna say to yourself self the HTC One
has an ultra pixel camera what's on the
back of this
guy this is just plain old megapixels
and it's got 13 of them crammed in there
of course you've got the flash on the
back as well
there's a 5-megapixel selfie camera
living right there on the front keeps
you want to take them selfies 802 11 a B
G and n Bluetooth 4.0 2600 milliamp hour
battery is sealed in here something
about getting to it it's got a really
nice weight to it 165 grams or 5.8 to
balance is available in a ton of colors
black blue gray green red and white
let's go ahead and take a look at the
settings and you can see what else we
are going to have on board I'll go to
settings go down to about and we can see
what we've got to go to software
information and see what's here so it's
running HTC Sense 6.0 so another six
cents phone Android version 4.4.2 so the
latest version of course it's KitKat and
I always love doing this does go give me
KitKat not gonna work that's too bad
double tap sometimes you will get kick
at so let's do a quick tour of the
device on the left hand side volume
rocker up and down pretty common see at
all time no big deal but weird power
button living on left-hand side it's
gonna have to train your thumbs to not
do this and start kind of reaching
around and it's a 5.5 inch phone I've
got larger hands I can't really see it
being an issue trying to get your finger
in there to lock it I say I miss it to
lock it and then unlock the phone so
we'll be aware of that and we'll sort of
see how it works when we start doing our
tests strangely really nothing here at
all take you to a little removable door
actually to get to there's your SIM card
and your SD card slot is gonna live in
there push that back on haven't seen
something that big
HTC phone 3.5 millimeter headset jack
right there microphone and then of
course we've got the boom sound s
speakers on the top and bottom and
on-screen buttons which will merge and
morph depending on what you're doing
so I mentioned HTC One a lot let's go
ahead and bring that guy in and see what
these two look like side-by-side so
certainly big size difference 5.5 and 5
inches so if by my keen mass kills that
is half an inch difference I've got the
aluminum and the plastic here it
certainly you can pick what you what you
prefer on the back of the phones
oh look at that Marvell shield 104
kind of neat you'll see a difference
there on the back as well so the plastic
versus the metal I'm still prefer the
metal but the plastic does feel really
nice HTC has done a great job with that
here we can stack them make a hand they
can meet sweet love sweet phone love you
get together they'll make what like a
like a mini phone or dig a megaphone who
knows what they'll make but it'll
probably be pretty sweet so anyway here
are the two of them just just making out
you see the thickness different to no
two of them nothing giant there anything
you guys want to see you about b16 sure
to let us know and we'll do some more
coverage on if you guys are interested
I'd love to hear your thoughts on it to
create international phone to great
traveling phones a great fun and funny
to hear in the US if you just gonna get
HSPA+ it could pop it in 18 G SIM card
it's a Mobile SIM card you will be good
to go if you live outside the US so
check your network to make sure it's
gonna support it make sure you don't get
a phone when you're like oh John you
said this one was great but I can't use
it anywhere your face is dumb and stupid
and I don't want you to get mad at me so
check those things I know you guys hope
you enjoyed again leave questions you
