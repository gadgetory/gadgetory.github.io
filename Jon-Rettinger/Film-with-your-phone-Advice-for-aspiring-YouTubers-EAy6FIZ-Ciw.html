to you by the LG G flex to buy LG life
good what's going on everyone John
render from TechnoBuffalo here when I do
ask the Buffalo every week one question
I seem to get over and over again is
what equipment do I need to film a video
I want to start my own YouTube channel I
want things to look professional do I
have to spend a ton of money and the
answer that I always give is no with
cameras on cell phones getting so much
better what you have in your pocket can
be a ridiculously awesome YouTube camera
so this tutorial I'm going to show you
how to use your phone as your main
camera for YouTube we're going to use
the LG G flex suit for this video you
can shoot 4k when talk a lot about the
resolution that it's got on it it's
laser autofocus you can get really crisp
images out of it's 13 megapixel sensor
so obviously whatever phone you're going
to use you can have a little bit of
differences but the main thoughts here
are going to be the same so first let's
not use a front-facing camera let's go
ahead and switch out of this guy and for
subject let's pretend I'm filming this
unnecessarily hard to solve route
through books cube so a few things to
know first the higher the resolution
you're going to have the better it's
going to lie to do sort of things like
punching in in your editing software now
I'm assuming that you're going to use a
normal editor for this you're not going
to editing on device you're going to
import it to a their Adobe or Final Cut
or Vegas whatever other software you
want to use so before you start dialing
into the phone itself check the lighting
around you you want to try to make sure
you've got uniform lighting what that
essentially means is a single light
source so if you've got overhead light
and like coming in from outside and then
you got a lamp it's going to make things
look very weird on camera this is a good
advice for really whatever camera you're
using so either try to film outside or
if you're inside you to try and turn off
the overhead lights or using only light
coming in or if it's dark out you can
just use one single light source that's
going to make life a lot easier for you
the next thing is try and mount your
camera if you can if you notice when I
hold my hand up it's not resting on
anything
things get a little bit shaky if you
don't have a mount what you can do is
either rest your hands down on a table
or put your elbows down and sort of use
that as an anchor and then you can do it
can add weight is going to keep it from
shaking and it's going to help stabilize
your shot
next you want to see if your phone's
going to let you have grids and we can
do that here on the G flex so that just
pulls essentially what it sounds like a
list of grids here lets you kind of use
the rule of thirds which is basically
placing your subject at the
intersections and next you're gonna want
to turn off image products things you
have more flexibility in color grading
so things like HDR and such I get a lot
more flexibility sort of tweak your
colors and make them look however you
want and also again high resolution the
better high resolution is going to let
you do things like crop again also leave
it allow you to stabilize shots in post
so this guy can shoot in 4k so you want
to go through and check your resolution
so we've got it set for you way too deep
so you want to go ahead and keep it
there and the next thing you want to
keep in mind is audio and every phone's
got a 3.5 millimeter headset jack and a
headset jack can also be home to an
external microphone so you can pick up a
really nice cheap microphone and be good
to go we use a rode mic and goes like 40
bucks and that is really it so things to
keep in mind safety uniform lighting
definitely try and auto lock your
exposure find some sort of mounting
system with the very least trying to get
your elbows down or put anything is
going to add weight turn on grids turn
off any image processing things like HDR
and film the highest resolution you can
whether you got a phone like this one
that can do 4k or 1080p try and avoid
the front-facing camera and if you make
mistake which are going to happen try
and shoot a lot of b-roll you can just
be roll to put over really anything if
you have to cut out I mistake enough to
have a lot of jump cuts it makes life
just a lot easier and that's really all
you need to use your phone as a YouTube
camera so we're gonna have a video that
I actually filmed using the LG G flex 2
starting right now in a time before time
there was a man an Android man
struggling to find his place the world
as he knew it had changed and he had to
assemble the world's mightiest heroes
Mader eating glad was there Superman's
pal Jimmy Olsen was there and every
other be listed here you could think of
joined together to help become the
d-team Avenger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
