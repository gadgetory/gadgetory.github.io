TechnoBuffalo checking out the brand new
Samsung Galaxy K zoom it was just
announced today and as you can see it's
sort of a follow up on the galaxy s4
zoom but it's not actually in the same
family it's a smartphone first with a
really nice camera attached to it you've
got a twenty point seven megapixel lens
on the back there and I'll try to open
it up for you here
and it's got a 10x optical zoom okay now
you're looking at the front and that's a
four point eight inch display it's a
Super AMOLED HD screen 1280 by 720 pixel
resolution though so not the full a
1080p that you see on the galaxy s5 but
moving around the device you have some
of that design carried over you can see
the dimple back on the right side you
have a power button the volume controls
and the camera quick launch key and the
shutter button microUSB charging on the
bottom on the left there's a micro SD
card slot that supports up to 64 two
gigs of storage and end up top a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and of course
here next to the camera of a xenon flash
that goes with it under the hood you've
got a hexa core processor at six-course
taking advantage of a quad-core 1.3
gigahertz processor in addition to a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core processor 2 gigs of
ram on board - under the hood there's
removable and you can see the flap there
to pull it up 2430 milliamp power
battery LTE category 4 and like I said 8
gigs of storage onboard in addition to
the microSD card slot and then up top
here a 2 megapixel camera let's check
out some of the camera features and just
do that by hitting the camera button
there and on the back you have you can
see that this popped out now with the
10x optical zoom see if I can do this
with one hand ok so there are several
modes here some of them Pro suggests is
a really cool one depending on the
scenario so let's we'll shoot here you
can see it brought up vivid color strong
color color transit and text because it
thinks it's in macro mode let's say I go
down to a darker situation and try to
focus though that changes
with war mode blue hue sunrise because
it thinks I'm in a darker area so pretty
cool
there also it's gonna need selfie alarm
it's called so what we do is we the
screen sets up right there with a box
and then we're gonna try to get in that
box so let's let's try that now and
you'll hear it beep three times we're in
focus so it has a little delay because
it was probably looking at the camera
didn't think it saw my face but uh there
I am so you can use the nicer camera the
20 point seven megapixel camera to snap
your own photos as opposed to relying on
the two megapixel front-facing camera so
right now no plans for this to launch in
the United States but different variants
will launch around in Asia and we might
see a 16 gig storage version in some
markets but so far nothing here and I
just wanted to bring you a quick look
here it's the Galaxy K zoom and this is
