to you by domain.com what's going on
everybody look right there pisode of ask
the Buffalo I'm your host Jon ventures
to show you can ask me whatever question
is going on your mind if you don't know
what tech to get your not sure when your
rash you're going to go away this is a
place you can ask let's jump right into
the questions the first one comes from
ads vino 4261 who asks at john for
lakers is the LG g4 worth upgrading from
the LG g3 if camera is the most
important thing to you are one of those
important things to you about a phone
and yes it is absolutely worth the
upgrade screen resolutions say the same
though it does look much better on the
g4 getting a faster processor but the g3
is still playing plenty fast if camera
is your main focus if you want to take
advantage of having ridiculously awesome
camera in your pocket pocket then yes
the g4 is definitely nice upgrade from
the g3 next one comes from eugene's gb
ass at john for lakers this is a
question I get a variant of quite often
my school junior and aspiring tech
journalists hopefully going to Yale
humble brag what would you recommend to
major in college as if you want to talk
about the writing side of things
anything that's written intensive so you
want to write for a tech site whatever
is going to make you do creative writing
is awesome you don't have to be a
journalism major ellesse always
preferred any sort of liberal arts or
creative writing English it's a great
way to go if you want to be more on
camera major matters a little bit less
anything it's going to sort of make you
talk take Speech and Debate join debate
class anything gets you in front of an
audience you comfortable talking
learning how to talk on your feet how to
improvise is really important join an
improv troupe those are all things least
that I did in college as i enjoy public
speaking hopefully that will help you
guys you look to advance your careers if
you've got that idea for new website you
want to start you've been itching to
start run on the shower or domain com
has you covered it's a place to go when
the next great idea hit too it's a
one-stop shopping for all of your domain

list of extensions are growing like
crazy so you can now have not just calm

a ton more our friends at domain.com on

@ john for lakers i'm searching for a
good SmartWatch to buy should buy that
moto 360 or should I wait for the next
generation Moto 360 wait Google i/o is
next week presumably we will see a ton
of Android wear updates this is like the
worst week to buy android wear do not
don't buy anything don't be enticed by
any discounts chances are they will get
even bigger next week if I was a betting
man up known role of dies every now and
then I would say we will see the
next-gen moto 360 announced and probably
giving or given away to attendees at
Google i/o next week so just wait chill
out sit calmly no you're going to get
something new something fancy something
that is probably a little better
processor a little better screen and
probably running a new version of the OS
wait just your credit card down step
over your computer it will be fine on
another note if you guys want to see
more behind-the-scenes stuff we do a
technobuffalo you want to hear my
thoughts for example why I'm embarrassed
