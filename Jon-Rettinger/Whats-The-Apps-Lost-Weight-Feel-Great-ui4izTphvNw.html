to you by gamefly while other people
happy new years ref to reviewers
TechnoBuffalo readers youtubers and all
you are the fine folks out there welcome
to 2012 in the very first episode what's
the F for the year and you know with
every new years comes them good old New
Year's resolutions and in my opinion the
most common new year's resolution has to
do with dieting and weight loss and I
might just have the app and the service
that will help you find folks out there
so sit tight because we is gonna fight
til we see the sunlight that's right I
briefly mentioned this application in
the 2011 app roundup but I want to go a
little bit more in depth because I
believe that this app is just it's just
so amazing and the service is just so
awesome and it'll really help people
change their lives the app is called
calorie tracker although it might have a
different name depending on your
operating system it's available on
multiple os's ends going for 299 US
dollars before the Windows Phone OS it's
actually temporarily free right now so
you wp7 owners just go pick it up
because you know it's free in a nutshell
it's basically a dietary and fitness
tracker it has a huge selection of
different dishes and food items from
brand name condiments to pre-portioned
measurements mean to all different kinds
of fruits and even dishes from
restaurants very handy when you're on
the go I've used this app on my iPhone
my samsung focused my iPad and so on and
so forth and to be honest the app is
kind of man but but it does get the job
done more often than not I do experience
a sync issues and the functionality is
very very different from one OS to the
other so it's a little bit inconsistent
the fitness selection isn't as specific
though it doesn't have specific
exercises like bench press instead it
has more generalized items like weight
lifting or circuit training however it
does have a lot of treadmill options
which is handy thankfully they have a
wickedly build web app that works pretty
gosh darn well you have to sign up for
an account for all this magic to work
but it's free and so is the service of
course there is a paid version but we
don't need any of that shenanigans I'm
gonna take a real quick break to thank
our friends at gamefly but when we come
back
share some to hide again imma take a
real quick break to thank our friends at
gamefly but when weird come back I'm a
sheriff's I'm dieting and weight loss

dining and fitness i'ma share with you
guys some background info here growing
up I was on a rather large child and
when I was about 16 or 17 I weighed
about 250 pounds not very nice okay and
it was then that I decided to do
something about it so I started my
journey to losing weight and also to
learning as much as I can about the
science of weight loss I eventually lost
her around 100 pounds or so and got into
bodybuilding than powerlifting but that
that's like a whole nother thing weight
loss is actually quite simple but simple
doesn't necessarily mean easy those are
two very very different things all you
gotta do is eat less calories and what
your body expends metabolically and you
should be in good shape and by that I
mean okay let's pretend you didn't your
body needs around 2,000 calories to do
whatever I need to do you know like um
waking up going to work going to the
park to watch the ducks fly and all that
kind of stuff you know just your daily
activities so let's pretend you need two
thousand and daily you consume 1,500
that puts you at a 500 calorie deficient
so it will take that 500 calorie worth
of energy from stored energy which is
your fat so if you keep this up you will
eventually lose fat mass very very
simple stuff livestrong.com and various
other online sites can help you
calculate your metabolic needs based on
your age your height your goals your
weight and so on and so forth very very
great tools to help you stay focused
instant and keep you aware of what
you're eating and how much you need to
eat on it on a daily basis here are five
quick weight loss tips that I can give
you right now one eat smaller more
frequent meals throughout the day so in
between your portion breakfast and your
lunch have yourself you know little
snack I personally have some almonds or
something along the way to drink lots of
water okay sometimes your body can
confuse thirst for hunger 3 stay
consistent a lot of people including
myself lose motivation along the way
which is bad news bears do whatever it
is you need to do to stay motivated and
help you stay focus for me that
livestrong thing really really helps out
for educate yourself learn whatever
learn as much as you can about dieting
fitness and nutrition and all that fun
wonderful stuff because for me what the
more I learned about my body and the
more I learned about nutrition the more
I can tweak my dieting and exercise plan
to optoma help me optimize my results
and 5 control your portions I got myself
a little looks like a basically it's a
miniature scale but instead of waiting
people you wait food I find that that
really really helps me out with portion
control and highly recommend it it's
about five or ten bucks depending on
where you pick it up so if you're like
me and you want to lose a little bit of
way to want to get back in shape you
want to get healthier searcy check out
LIVESTRONG calm and their applications
highly highly recommended but most
importantly stay motivated educate
yourself and exercise and diet safely
this was john q from technobuffalo calm
and i'll see you guys at CES latest
