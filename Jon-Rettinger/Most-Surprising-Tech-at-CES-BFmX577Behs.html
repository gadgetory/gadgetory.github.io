is finding the hidden gems there's kind
of technology from the larger companies
you'd expect but if you walk around the
show floor and roam the halls you will
see some incredible tech from companies
you would not expect let me share with
you some of the most surprising
technology of CES 2017 let's start the
company it's been around for I think 240
odd years the United States Postal
Service
as a big booth here and had a ton of
awesome technology in it one of the
coolest ones for me though was the
appropriately named most wonderful
ornament and it's an ornament that's
gonna glow different colors to track a
package that you sent so if you're
sending a present out to Grandma and you
want to know when she got it when it got
shipped and when she opens it up it'll
glow three different colors it'll change
to blue when the package out for
delivery ready when it's been dropped
off and the color you want it will glow
green when has been open so you should
check your phone and make sure grandma
called you grandma to be more courteous
I used a Siler technology in the sensor
it's actually built into the box when it
opens
USPS is gonna know it so you don't to
check your phone or put enough tracking
information into a website you look at
your tree and be able to know what the
package is there did you come down in
the morning you'll see the ornament is
glowing different colors it'll plug or
right into your string of lights too so
you have to worry about external power
it was kind of cool to see ornament
technology start to be a thing and come
from the USPS so from technology for
your Christmas tree what about
technology for where you work this is
the alt workstation it's a gravity desk
that lets you sit stand or pretty much
lay down and work so the bad news first
it's gonna cost forty nine hundred bucks
the cool news though is it looks awesome
it puts magnets on the bottom of your
stuff so like your keyboard and your
mouse and it lets you lato talese lat
and you can type in and look pretty cool
while you're doing it it's got an
integrated monitor desk and chair that's
gonna move with your body to create an
amazingly comfortable and productive
workstation for me though I probably
would just we'll just sleep but if you
think you can do work while laying down
and take a look at it if you guys been
watching a lot of MTV Cribs or maybe you
see Diddy's yacht out there you think
you know I wish I could have that yacht
but maybe in a
like a giant RV form then the fury on
Elysium is probably gonna be for you
this is clearly a concept and it's I
can't describe it any better than like a
land yacht it's kind of a cool marriage
of high-tech and unnecessary luxurious
living for an RV this is a trail like
you're gonna you're gonna want to invite
people over too so it's a 45 foot RV
that showcases their latest tech it's
got HGTV's it's got kitchen appliances
audio guidance observations stuff it's
even has a very Tesla inspired
navigation screen and oh hey it also has
a helicopter landing pad and a hot tub
and beyond that the helicopter itself
will retract into the RV just let that
sink in for a minute
and then they're claiming the upper deck
is perfect for entertaining company and
the hot tub but and we all know what
that what that's for
if you're gonna spend the money for an
RV the hot tub I mean maybe maybe spring
spring for a real boat fury on a company
I hadn't admitted Lee never heard of it
before the show also had a giant
mechanical I guess prosthesis but it
looks like it came from Avatar and say
20 foot EXO Bionic and mech suit capable
of running at a speed of more than 21
miles per hour which doesn't sound that
fast but if you see a giant mechanical
spider looking thing with the dude
inside of it coming at you 21 miles per
hour is plenty fast it was built for a
pilot and is the creation of responsive
stable and powerful EXO Bionic platform
amplifies the motion of the pilot so
like if the dude inside or lady moves
their leg it's going to move with them
it stands nearly 14 feet tall 16 feet
wide and weighs more than 7,000 pounds
and it is electrically powered so I
guess kind of goofy environment the next
technology is from a company you'd
expect to put out awesome tech but in an
unexpected way this is razors project
Ariana it's the world's first video
projection system designed for immersive
gaming it's a crazy cool video projector
which uses an ultra wide fisheye lens
and advanced processing capabilities to
take your game just like out of your
setup so if you're gaming and you have
your TV up on the wall it's gonna
project what you're looking at around
the TV as well to create a really
immersive environment it's got pretty
cool intelligent calibration for
personalized projection this is
obviously a concept it may never
come to market but the way it immerses
you into the game is unlike anything
I've ever seen if you ever looked at a
hoverboard and thought that just looks
too safe
the folks at one wheel have you covered
with the Plus this $1500 single wheel
hyper core motor thing takes performance
- and they claim next level it's got a
five to seven mile range before folks
yell at me that's 8 to 11 kilometers can
also go up to 19 miles per hour or 30
kilometers per hour which is really fast
and it looks like you are just putting
your feet on opposite sides of a go-kart
wheel it's available now it looks crazy
it was hard to ride by matching yourself
getting used to it so there's a ton
attack obviously get CES and if you go
looking for it you'll find a lot of
really cool things for companies you
wouldn't expect I was really impressed
what I saw from Razer from the USPS let
me know down below what kind of tech you
guys like the most anything sound
interesting to you have a discussion
about it I'm sure you've notifications
turned on so you when new videos are
coming until next time I am John Rhett
