TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing I am
super excited about this is the latest
flagship Nexus device from Google it is
the Nexus 6p designed by Google and
built by Huawei a hallways been an
established player in the phone building
market not for quite a while but is
their first four rights making a Nexus
device which typically are my favorite
Android phones of the year so really
excited to dig into this on the box
you've got that kind of cool P logo
looks like an aerial view of a beach
like you managed in Hawaii and I'm
relaxing like right there so you've got
that P logo on it on the back we've got
a picture of it it looks like we're
gonna have the graphite one here
available in three colors either
aluminum graphite or Frost let's go
ahead and open this sucker up and really
excited to see what's inside I had a
chance to go to the launch of in a few
weeks ago I had the opportunity to play
with these devices and I came away
really impressed the phone felt great in
the hands but it was limited usage so
you know we'll test it and let you guys
know what we think Google sent us this
device and by time you guys watch this
video I already been using it for about
three days little P logo on there as
well and it's just a hard cardboard
again that P logo a little bit of card
in here
gonna tell us about the phone where the
SIM card is NFC USBC and that kind of
stuff and here we have the 6p hello my
friend let's go ahead and pull this out
of the box this is this is my favorite
color the graphite so I'm really happy
that's what they sent us push that off
to the side real fast
try 90 days of Google Play Music on us
Thank You Google I will try that this is
also compatible as well as a 5x with
Google's project Phi so if you want to
use that these phones will also work
again Nexus P little booklet sim removal
tray and something that's going to tell
us about safety and warranty got a while
work with USB C and a all-black USBC
cable here we also get a that's kind of
cool you get a regular USB presumably
3.0 to USBC cable as well so just want
to charge from your computer or
something you'll have that option nice
of a hallway and Google to include that
it's not why you're here push all that
off to the side let's take a look at
this guy hello friend I like the blue
Nexus logo there let's go ahead and take
off the plastic if I can get my
whooshing noise did I enjoy so much
pretty pretty satisfying ahh that
all-metal body feels really nice and
cool to the touch somebody walk you
through the phone I'll power it on and
show you what this guy's got in it
highlighting it though is Android 6.0
marshmallow this metal phone weighs 178
grams
powering it is the Snapdragon 810
version 2.1 it's clock at 2 gigahertz
its octa-core of course 64-bit with the
audrina 430 GPU onboard making sure this
is a multitasking dream got three gigs
of RAM gonna be available in three
different sizes either 32 64 or 128
although I'm not sure what Google sent
us here as well as it puts up that
screen you can see is 5.7 inches at wqhg
so that means it is 2560 by 1440 it's
AMOLED and has a PPI of 518 also nicely
has a 16 by 9 aspect ratio and making
sure that if you drop it which is
probably put a case on it but if you do
or get scratched in your pocket it's
going to try and prevent those things
from happening with Gorilla Glass 4 on
the back we've got cameras is a twelve
point three megapixel sensor with the F
2.0 does record 4k video at 30 frames
per second and it's got laser assisted
autofocus so should focus very fast the
camera upfront is eight megapixel and
that's an F 2.4 I really gigantic
battery in here at three thousand four
hundred fifty and milliamp hours a way
to charge it is via USB see it's got
fast charging enabled so you should get
up to seven hours of battery life only
10 minutes of charging pretty awesome
pricing points varies for ninety nine
thirty to five forty nine for sixty four
or six forty nine for 128 you can also
get Google's new Nexus protect for $89
on this guy as well before I jump into
the OS talk a little bit more about the
design I know there's been some concern
about this camera hump but I gotta tell
you in person it's not pronounced at all
it actually looks really nice
when you put it down on a table it does
sit flat so that was a concern of yours
if you do not need to worry at all
around the device on the left hand side
that's where your sim is going to live
again nano SIM and Project Phi in abled
you can also use this guy with any
carrier which is really cool as well
I'll pop in a salmon and you're good to
go
on the right hand side that's where your
power and lock buttons going to live
it's bit of a texture too it's easy to
find and then your volume up and down
USB see on the bottom 3.5 milimeter
headset jack living on top and we've got
a fingerprint sensor on here as well
located just below the NFC antenna which
i think is right around there gives a
fingerprint sensor here to authenticate
Android pay to unlock your phone just
make sure things are generally more
secure big Nexus logo on the back and
small hallway branding there as well not
removable battery and again it's 34 15
milliamp hours let me go and set this
guy up and I'll come right back I let's
see what version Google sent us here
we'll go scroll down go to settings
storage and USB we've got the 64gb
version if you're wondering how much
storage is going to come on it you're
going to have fifty three point six
seven gigs when you pick up your phone
so bear that in mind go ahead and go
home a ton of highlights of Android 6.0
marshmallow doze Bing I think one of the
killer features now it's going to save a
ton of battery life by essentially
powering down idle or unused apps and of
course now on tap I'm a big Google now
fan being able to sort of access Google
now information inside of other apps is
really cool as well I'm gonna get
anything you guys want to see in
particular let us know about the phone
and we'll make sure we cover in our full
review our other coverage coming up if
you're worried how big the phones going
to feel in your hand it doesn't feel
giant it's pretty close to edge to edge
the bezels on the side are not very big
so you're getting a 5.7 inch screen in
what feels like a much smaller package
so I'm really excited to test this guy
out anyway until next time I'm John
Ranger from TechnoBuffalo see you guys
next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
