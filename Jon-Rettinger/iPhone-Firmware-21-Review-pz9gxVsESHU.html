lakers john for lakers calm here with a
review for you of the iphone 2.1
software so you guys know it came out
last friday with the promise of a wide
variety of bug fixes and reception
issues and something that was going to
overall improve the quality of the phone
and the user experience so the first
issue i made a video about the iphone
probably two days before the update was
released second i was having carbal
reception issues i was getting maybe one
bar 3g and it wouldn't switch over to
edge um well i'm very happy to say that
problem has been more than taken care of
as you can see on my phone right now i
have five bars of now edge service and i
went to goes to 3g i get three or four
bars of 3g in my apartment which is
fantastic i'll show you that one more
time so you can see it um my reception
everywhere i go has been better you know
it's tough to imagine how they can
improve reception when the hardware is
the same they must have improved the
software accessing the chipset in the
phone the reception has been much better
drop calls no longer an issue which is
fantastic I was having maybe two or
three drop calls a day that's down now
it's almost zero when I friends since
one of the big problems people had at
the phone was even hit your contacts it
would be very slow to respond to that
it's now lightning-fast a push contact
comes up immediately you're able to
scroll through them immediately um this
software is what the iphone should have
launched with evidently the 2 point 0
software was not ready and if you've
been waiting for the bugs be worked out
2.1 is your answer everything is just
much smoother the experience is much
easier I'm not worried about crashing
iTunes when you sync your phone it does
backups the backups now or twice as fast
you have the ability to pause installs
from the App Store which didn't have it
before games or programs from the App
Store now install much quicker which is
nice just everything overall is
much improved user experience I am had
any crashes on the phone everything has
really just been perfect where I was
maybe getting close to thinking about
switching phones I am now a hundred
percent satisfied with the iphone 3g
again if you haven't upgraded to 2.1
synced to your computer and go ahead and
do it all you have to do is plug in your
iPhone to your computer open up iTunes
and it'll ask you if you want to update
to say yes and leave it let it do its
thing whole update download the file and
install it probably took about 10
minutes there's 10 minutes well spent
really takes advantage of the hardware
people are also reporting that they now
have better reception with Bluetooth
headsets which is nice I use the apple
bluetooth headset which I haven't had
any issues with but if you were having
some some problems that should be taken
care of as well really a 2.1 software
thumbs up can't recommend it enough get
upgrading its all you gotta say anyway
guys uh jon rettinger with john for
lakers com i'll see you guys in the next
video bye oh if you haven't yet sure to
check out the new channel i'll put a
link to it in the sidebar it's inside

you want to anyway guys I'll see you in
the day the next one bye so I just want
to show you guys to now I've got I said
it to get 3g here and I've got two bars
of 3g and that's been going between two
and three and sometimes they just went
back up again whereas before I really
only had one my reception now is so much
better um just wanted to show you that
again look just went up you know again i
can use 3g now in my apartment 2.1 way
to go guys on a non-iphone little more
serious note i want to draw your
attention to a global pandemic a cause
that we should all get behind something
that affects the world over that's aids
in aids research i'm going to put
another link in the sidebar and i'll put
annotation somewhere around here for a
few guests to click on a site and learn
more about how you can help the world

involved with right guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
