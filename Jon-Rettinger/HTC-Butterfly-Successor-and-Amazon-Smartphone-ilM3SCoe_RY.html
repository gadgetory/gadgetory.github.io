to you by full sail university welcome
back to the episode of rumor roundup
this to show redic all the tech rumors
from the week and snacks impassioned
ensem into one show to serve you up all
those tech rumors you need to know up
this week we're going to talk about
Apple's I TV or to talk about HTC
allegedly planning a successor to their
butterfly smartphone and speaking of
smartphone amazon might be packing one
that's got a 4.7 inch display this is
rumor roundup let's go and get started
apple's television set i'm just calling
it i GV cuz i don't else to call it
allegedly it's going to pack a 4k screen
this one comes from didja times would
take it with a gigantic head size grain
of salt allegedly Apple's ITV may offer
Siri it might change the way we watch TV
and it may revolutionize our living
rooms the biggest one though is that it
might pack a 4k or ultra HD display
according to a new report and surface on
Wednesday so that was nice everal
televisions with that resolution that
were invalid ring this year's from
Electronic Show although they still cost
a freaking this and a leg down below
Foxconn's allegedly been tapped to build
the TVs and LG is on board to supply the
panel's it at times also said Apple's
planning to launch your TV either late
this year early next year sometime the
year after that perhaps you're after
that or definitely the year after that
so who knows the more we learn about
this thing the more we don't know about
it but it's fun to think about could a
4k TV maybe becoming affordable could
Apple leverage economies of scale to get
the prices down and make 4k available to
the masses I'm not so sure there isn't
really a standard yet for 4k and what's
really considered true 4k across all
platforms so I'm not sure if we're gonna
see it so the HTC One is still gonna
launch North America in April however
it's just he's got another phone that
works is successor to the HTC butterfly
are also known as the droid DNA on
verizon wireless apparently HTC is going
to keep the butterfly brand name
although we hope it adds some sort of
distinguishing feature select consumers
know it's been upgraded in some way
maybe it'll give it wings watching some
silly phone names but really guys
butterfly HTC chief marketing officer
Ben ho told focus Taiwan Theresa
interview did not say what a sort of
hardware we can expect in the successor
but we're expecting sense 5 hopefully
the same for ultrapixel camera on HTC
one unfortunately though that camera has
been the cause for delays on the one so
really don't know how also recently said
HTC is ditching the quietly brilliant
marketing term for more aggressive
slogan more aggressive is great go after
Samsung get some of that hot market
chair where you're probably looking at
though with this butterfly to in the
droid DNA to is verizon's answer to the
HTC One verizon's not gonna be carrying
the HTC One so they'll be carrying an
upgraded version of the DNA to or
butterfly to that should match your
pretty close to spec suspect so you
verizon folks hopefully won't have to
wait that much longer Amazon's super
javi remembered smartphones going to
ship with a 4.7 inch display according
to a new report published by you guessed
it didja times Amazon's reportedly
playing to shift the smartphone ER in
the second quarter of this year although
reselling rumors suggest the schedule
device launch was delayed the approach
of problems with a foxconn subsidiary n
ski tech so right now I really don't
know anything with the smartphones
granite cost rumors suggesting though
it's gonna fall between 100 and 200
dollars if and when Amazon does announce
it we're not really sure if it's going
to take Google's approach by selling the
device itself working with carrier
partners instead Apple's reportedly cut
shipments of the first generation iPad
Mini anticipation of a third quarter
launch of the op pad mini 2 according to
boom digit times i think this news is
coming at a perfect time i'm using my
ipad mini as my daily tablet started
notice to getting a little slow if i got
a lot of apps running perhaps in the
background try and load up several tabs
in safari just starts the leg a little
bit so didja time said the parts
supplier revealed that apple shipments
are down 10 to 12 million units in q2
which apparently represents a twenty
percent cut from regular shipment levels
chip ins for the year or cut the 33
million units to the impending launch of
the really yet to be announced ipad mini
2 isn't the only reason shipments were
sliced however sources also said that
apple made the cuts because of increased
competition from very 7-inch android
tablets look at you Nexus 7 let me step
back from the rumors for a minute thank
our friends and sponsors at full sail
university we talked a lot about
smartphones and the apps that run on
them and you know the mobile app
industry is on fire right now boss Neil
University's online mobile development
bachelor's degree program to teach you

you need to take advantage of these
emerging opportunities this degree you
learn both the programming the business
side of mobile development so that you
looking at you can concept develop and
deploy an application from start to
finish you can explore events
programming languages visual framework
usability principles and app development
for iOS android operating system between
apple's app store and google play store
over 50 billion apps been downloaded and
growing every day with really no signs
of slowing down if you're ready to
master technology and software to
compete in this rapidly growing industry
we just got an idea for a really cool
app check out full steel dot edu slash
technobuffalo to learn more but online
