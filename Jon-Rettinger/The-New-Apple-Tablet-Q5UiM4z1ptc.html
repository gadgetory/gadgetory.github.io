technobuffalo hear rumors of an apple
tablet predate the iphone go back
actually much further but as those
rumors reach a fever pitch now coming to
a head at a rumored September 7 product
announcement that ships to share the
stage with a new ipod touch i thought it
was appropriate to talk about sort of
what we know what we expect and sort of
give my take on what I think we're going
to see so what we know is really nothing
other than Apple has been working on a
tablet and that should come as no
surprise Apple puts out a plethora of
patents and do a lot of patent research
and does a lot of R&amp;amp;D so I'm sure
they've got many products in the
pipeline that may see the light of day
and some that may not so I think saying
that Apple has a tablet in the work
somewhere in cupertino labs it's
probably a pretty safe bet so the way I
see it Apple can really take two paths
with this tablet in two very divergent
paths thick either take a full computing
path and use a tad well as an extension
of your laptop or desktop meaning you're
getting a full functioning PC or in this
case Mac on a tablet form factor so
we're talking multitasking talking full
internet browsing with flash we're
talking programs that you could use on a
Mac and really everything that you can
do on your home computer you'll be able
to do on this tablet the other path they
can take is more of an extension of the
ipod touch and the iphone just on a
larger screen meaning you're not going
to be able to multitask really gonna be
able to single task so one thing open at
a time like you can on the iphone of the
ipod touch have access to custom apps
that will probably be in its unique app
store that will run on a widescreen form
factor i would expect that this tab was
going to come in probably around 10
inches that is assuming that does come
on sins just rumored so i think those
are the two pass apple can take either a
desktop computing extension or an
extension of the iphone sort of ipod
touch hybrid model so what I expect is
that we're going to probably see
something on the iphone ipod touch
tablet model
and it's going to be an extension of
that experience I also think we may see
apple finally well you get to the e-book
reader market with this tablet it's
going to be 10 inch screen I wouldn't be
surprised if they launch their own book
store this in rumors that Apple has been
digitizing book content for quite a
while so I think that would be a
reasonable expectation to see I would
also expect that this new tablet to take
some sort of macbook name Apple spent so
long and so much money building up that
macbook name through all successful
product launches to press releases
through marketing efforts that macbook
name that really now only resides on one
outdated plastic model really not living
up to what I think they've established
for a brand identity and apples not
stupid they're very smart business savvy
executives you know it's really headed
by steve jobs that would be like
mercedes suddenly drop in the mercedes
lion only making may box they spend so
long building up that mercedes-benz live
of a sudden they just drop it and focus
on their premium brand in this case is
the macbook pro so in conclusion what i
would expect to see a 10 inch extension
of your iphone ipod touch there may be
some sort of 3G connectivity in there
there have been rumored talks with
verizon but a very well maybe just an
extension of AT&amp;amp;T is relationship I
don't have any inside information on
that I think we'll see a custom version
of the app store that will have custom
apps that are meant for this larger
screen size we may very well see some
sort of emulation for current apps that
are found on the iphone and ipod touch
the sort of extension of the well the
iphone and ipod touch may very well also
carry its way over to the apple TV this
may serve as an apple TV extension as
well you could say download your content
directly or wirelessly if there's a 3g
modem and stream it right to your
television sort of stepping in and
replacing the stepchild apple TV in the
product lineup just sort of a stream of
consciousness so what I'm thinking this
product may be may also be able to use
it for a desktop monitor
knows it could dock even in a new imac
Apple really some patents flat a while
back so what do you guys think you agree
with really any of my wild projection do
you think we might see something else do
you think this is even silly to talk
about because that allows an announced
anything was there anything you'd like
to see leave text or video comments I'm
really curious to hear what you guys
have to say about this rumored and
much-hyped apple tablet anyway i'm jon
