videos but this one is different
hey guys john here with a very special
and much-hyped unboxing for you right
you guessed it the Apple iPhone so I'm a
bit of a back story almost 10 years ago
actually I started making YouTube videos
in my one-bedroom apartment about a love
of technology I used my webcam and
horrible audio and I just talked about
technology and much to my surprise
because the channel was named John for
Lakers clearly I had no vision it grew
and it grew a lot faster than I ever
could have imagined
as the channel started to grow up to be
an opportunity to make a website that
was video centric so I reached out to
all the big tech websites at the time
it's like hey Vicky was gonna be a
really important thing let me make video
for you and nobody got back to me and
you know younger and perhaps feeling
like I could conquer the world thought
any business experience whatsoever
TechnoBuffalo comm was born to sort of
fulfill that vision but now I am so
happy and thrilled to finally share with
you guys what TechnoBuffalo is what it's
going to be and more importantly what
it's going to do and about 45 seconds
into launch
it crashed miserably and from really the
first week on it was taking a lot of my
time to run the website and it's been a
passion of love I've loved the website
I've had great timed at the web site
I've met a lot of great people in
contacts through the website but the
time has come for me to focus all of my
first love has always been and my first
love has always been video so effective
today I'm actually handing the reins of
TechnoBuffalo comm over to the very
capable hands at mobile nations they
know how to run a website's they've been
running multirow websites for years and
they will do a better job than I ever
could I'm excited to see what content
comes up on technoboy flow comm I will
be reading it you guys should keep
checking it out now I get a plan out
these videos I get a focus from morning
until the night on making awesome video
con
and really for the first time in almost
nine years I feel really creative again
I feel excited about it so you'll see
you'll see some banners change and kind
of a bit of a rebrand and again I want
to reiterate this channel is not
changing the URLs not changing
everything with the YouTube channel and
the videos that we've already published
are all staying the same this is mostly
focused just on the website and my time
I could not be more excited for the
future something that I've wanted to do
for a long time I think it's sort of a
natural bookend to the almost decade
with the website and looking forward to
the next decade of the making awesome
video content that makes me excited it's
also a really good time if there's
videos that you guys want to see let us
know in the comments down below
we can it's a clean slate video wise we
can try absolutely anything I'm a bunch
of emotions but it's something that I
really wanted to do in my heart I felt
like I wanted find a way to get back to
video full time as able to sort of
facilitate that with the incredible help
of the folks at Global Nations so for
the first time in almost ten years
I'm just John Rhett enger' and thank you
guys for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
