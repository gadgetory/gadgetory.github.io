with performance-based looking almost
identical to the last gen surface book
the magnesium clad tune won the
Microsoft was touting as the ultimate
computer and he really likes the first
gen thought it showed a lot of promise
but is lacking some things both hardware
and software we thought future
iterations would improve on well we've
got it here in performance base you've
got bigger battery faster processor
you've got an improved video card things
that ordinarily make a laptop soon
faster that was really excited to test
this I figured what better way to test
computer and to actually use a computer
so I took some advice for myself and I
tested the way I do with phones I use
this as my only computer for the better
part of a week I unplugged my 5k iMac
set this up with the dock and two
monitors and got to work using this as I
needed to use a computer throughout the
days and beyond that pick at home with
me using my home computer as well this
is my only computing that I've been
using and I want to share my thoughts
with you whether or not I'm going to
keep using it and most importantly
should you consider buying can I guess
officer said you review the surface book
I think should start with the design
since that's a big chunk what you're
paying for and for this version you're
going to be paying a lot this is a
$3,300 fully loaded version Microsoft
sent us so the big story here is not
necessarily the magnesium body which
looks and feels really nice it's the
hinge and the hinge is different right
off the bat you can tell it's not your
typical clamshell laptop as you go and
open it up a kind of unfurls like a rug
and one of the issues we have last gen
is that I couldn't quite open it with
one finger so let's see if that's been
fixed this time around not quite but the
opening is still really cool as it
unfurls you're greeted with now the
traditional laptop look but with that
kind of cool hinge are some downsides
first you've got that gap which allows
dust or papers to get in there although
with the performance base it is much
smaller because the base is bigger for
the batteries and presumably for the
extra GPU horsepower if you're not
familiar with the surface book it
detached and the two separate pieces got
the clipboard and you've got the
performance base and it doesn't kind of
a cool way
push the button next delete key you get
an audible unlock noise it's actually
just being piped through the speakers
and this part comes off completely and
this part microsoft calls a clipboard
actually houses almost your entire PC
it's got your core i7 your RAM and a
smaller battery how's the performance
base way more batteries that people talk
about and the dedicated GPU I generally
just using the clipboard I got about two
hours of battery life and it connects
via five pins on the bottom the two on
the left and the writers for connection
and the three are actually transferring
data although the middle one you can
actually use the charger that comes with
the computer to charge it on its own but
it will not charge itself with the
performance base without being plugged
in so if you want to charge this this
has to be plugged in when you plug
things back in though it does recognize
it really quickly which is improvement
over last generation you can plug it in
a few different ways you can plug it
normally like a laptop or turn it around
put it in its dock and you could use it
as a presentation mode it's great for
airplanes for watching movies or you can
always fold it down and use as a heavy
three point six three pound
tablet the keyboard and original surface
book was one of the best laptop keyboard
I've ever tested I'd love to throw on it
and fortunately Microsoft didn't change
it if it ain't broke don't fix it it is
a really good typing experience and the
glass trackpad is still amongst the best
glass trackpads that I have ever used it
feels a little bit different texturizer
you get on something like a macbook pro
but it works equally well if you want to
worried about scrolling us really it's
gonna be with two finger scrolling don't
be also supports multi-touch gestures
it's a really weird time for i/o or
input/output everything's clearly moving
to the combo or USB type-c and
Thunderbolt 3 but nothing's really bared
yet so you look at a new computer like
yeah it's good but is it future proof
that's a question to ask yourself with
the surface book and it's got a pretty
generous IO on the left-hand side you've
got two USB type a ports are just
traditional USB a really shallow SD card
reader but you have an SD card reader
here
on the opposite side you've got mini
displayport and you've got Microsoft
proprietary surface charger or dock port
and it's magnetic
not unlike MagSafe and that's where
everything is going to kind of plug in
an accessory front but no USB see here
and it's kind of hard to knock computer
for not having it
while I'm knocking some computers were
having too many USB C ports if it's
important to you know this doesn't have
it but at least right now it's not
really a deal-breaker for me but it may
be in about 12 months performance is
what matters with the surface book and
again at this being the full
top-of-the-line SPECT surface book
including the gtx 960 5m q gigs of DDR
five-membered expected to be fast
performance is also the reason that we
ended up returning our first gen service
book I couldn't handle the editing load
that we were putting on it at a big show
like CES so I had run free to come give
it a shot on Premiere Pro happy to
report the results were very different
than what we saw just about a year ago
4k scrubbing was very smooth rendering
was very fast in fact Ron said it was on
par with his 5k iMac and faster than his
SPECT to the gills 2015 MacBook Pro so
this solves a fundamental problem we had
again with flash and we couldn't use
this as an editing powerhouse and it
worked well it's not going to replace a
desktop may stretch the imagination but
it works extremely well and Adobe's kind
of tight-lipped about what they use most
with their suite of software whether or
not it's really heavily GPU base or CPU
base or a combination of both
whatever it is Microsoft really has
optimized the software and the hardware
to hum along smoothly with Adobe suite
if you want to see a full video on how
the surface book performs and editing
let us know we'll have Ron or Andrew
make a full video showing you how a
performance but if you want to know if
you can use this editing machine in fact
making it even more impressive was a
smooth performance was even when the
computer was docked to two separate
monitors and testing this as my everyday
computer I didn't have that much time to
push it with gaming plans doing a follow
up gaming dedicated video but I did try
some Starcraft 2 which is my advice when
I take a few minutes and it worked
really well and obviously it's not the
most graphics intensive game but I
easily push it to 50 frames per second
at 1080p I probably even got higher it
was buttery smooth another dock we had
on the last gen
was the SSD was fast on the read but not
fast on the right Microsoft has righted
the ship here I got a little over 1,600
Meg's per second on the read and now
1,200 Meg's per second on the right so
it's way faster probably accounts for a
lot of the improvements that I saw while
I was editing I mentioned using this as
my everday computer and I that means all
the emails I was doing and video editing
and browsing and it worked really well
it did choke a little bit on Chrome with
8 video tabs open where an edge it
didn't that's certainly more of a chrome
issue than a service book issue but if
you do work in Chrome when you have a
lot of video tabs open bear that in mind
the fans here also ran relatively silent
when it was open being used as a laptop
when it was docked and a clamshell motor
definitely here the fans kick on that's
to be expected because he is
anticipating as much as it would good
Scout that monitor just slammed on top
so about 8 percent of my service book
usage was right here with it plugged in
and not really worrying about battery
life but I could take it home and use it
as my only computer when I was traveling
and at home that's where I really tested
the battery Microsoft is claiming up to
16 hours of battery life and that wasn't
quite realistic although I did get a
really solid almost 12 hours of
brightness at about 80% now you can turn
the brightness almost all the way down
to black which is nice to see and if you
do that they took them close to their 16
hours I never did I like a bright screen
that was my real-world usage while
testing but if you decide to undock the
clipboard and use that on its own really
gonna get about two hours battery life
and just through that it's also a lot of
intangibles that come with the surface
book you get things like these surface
pen which admittedly I didn't use that
much but it does work really well it's
got different things you can do you can
tap it once to launch OneNote long press
to launch Cortana and the back feels
like an actual pencil eraser you can use
it to erase the screen when you're not
using it 6 magnetically to the side
really nice that it does that you don't
have to plug it into a power port or
anything it just sticks there unzila I
was tough on the service book and not
tough and what I tested but toughen how
I using it was my only computer for the
better part of a week so I got a chance
to really learn Windows and some of the
Knox I had when I did the last
generation review with Windows itself
the mail app for example I couldn't find
one I liked the built-in one wasn't
pulling an address book
drag-and-drop files Microsoft has fixed
that that's no longer an issue
I found third-party apps if they see
things as used to on the Apple side like
screenshots had automatic assigned
documents to be a preview things like
sear and that will keep it spacebar to
open up a document like you can on Mac
OS made this a really Pleasant
transition now it did take me about
three or four days to actually get used
to the differences in Windows once you
get past that hump if you push through
it I really found the elegance in
Windows and I've really enjoyed using
Windows 10 I think Microsoft has is a
flagship computer to showcase what the
OS can do but not everything was giant
roses and wonderful I did have a few
issues primarily with Bluetooth my
bluetooth headphones of choice are the
bose qc25 sync to the best out there but
about 8% of the time I get crackling and
disconnect and reconnect nothing I've
had any other computer that I've tested
but appears to be isolated to just those
headphones might be a bose issue things
like bleaches mice and printers i know
she's with it all so if you couldn't
tell I really liked using the surface
book I like having the power of a
desktop the portability of a laptop the
flexibility of a tablet and be able to
combine my home and work computer into
one so I ask you questions the beginning
one am i you continue using the surface
pro and two should you consider buying
one
I am absolutely going to keep using this
as my only computer I've learned the
elegance of Windows it does what you
need to do it's flexible and I need it
to be and I like the power that comes
with it in fact I can see myself very
happily using us for the next one two
years now should you buy it's a
different story it's a very expensive
compute this one's jacked up again at
3,300 bucks but if you want the best for
Microsoft and the hardware and software
standpoint I think look no farther than
a surface book we guys think about a
surface book because it's a computer for
you is price holding you back I know a
lot of folks are considering making a
switch from Apple to Windows this
generation if that's you look at this go
to Microsoft Store go to your Best Buy
wherever your hands on one and try it I
think you're really going to like it now
you're gonna take a lot of you see
aspect ratio and that kind of stuff once
you do that you're gonna appreciate what
Microsoft has done here give the video a
thumbs up you always appreciate it let
us know again if you want to see
dedicated videos on
video editing until next time Jai Ranger
