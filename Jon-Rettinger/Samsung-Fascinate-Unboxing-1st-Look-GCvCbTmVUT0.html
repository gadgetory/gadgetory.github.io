TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the samsung fascinate
this is Verizon Wireless as Galaxy S
device which we've seen quite a bit of
lately
these things are blistering fast
something excited take a look at
bryden's off right and see if it lives
up to its fascinating name alright let's
go ahead and dig in and I'll go over the
specs as we check out the box and such
this is gonna set you back just about
$200 on a two-year contract so of course
we will bring in please slice your
finger off cutter the big ol knife go
ahead and slice the package this just
came from the Verizon yard hook you push
them off to the sides is available now
go ahead and it looks like there's some
PR stuff in there
a business card here is the phone itself
or the box itself rather it's like it
comes in a bit of a sleeve alright so
some specs on the device this is a
galaxy s device so does running
Samsung's hummingbird processor which
let me tell you is one of the fastest
processors that I've seen to get more
specific it's a 1 gigahertz cortex a8
hummingbird processor all you gotta know
is this thing flies test another galaxy
s devices I expect be fascinate to be
the same speed as the others and if it
is it will be blazing fast although I
will put it through the tests it's going
to come with Android 2.1 which is Eclair
though you've keeping touch at home with
Samsung's TouchWiz interface sitting on
top of it you're going to have 2 gigs of
memory automatically put into the device
installed hardware wise and you're going
to get a 16 gigabyte microSD card
already thrown in there by megapixel
camera with LED flash capable of
shooting 720p video and enough of me
talking let's go ahead and to the phone
itself so here is the samsung fascinate
it does have a Super AMOLED display
which is incredibly impressive really
bright colors and vivid blacks 2 4 inch
screen the resolution of
480 and by 800 so there's a picture of
it like we said nothing on the side on
the back this box contains we will open
the box right now and take a look slide
this off and pull off the Samsung topper
and they serve so hard cardboard
protective device and here is the
samsung fascinate go and push it off to
the side for just one minute and see
what else you're going to get in the box
you're gonna get tips hints and
shortcuts it's nice and Samsung and
Verizon are including actual manuals
with their phones I think are very nice
to have so here is the power outlet
which I assume a power adapter rather
assumed just has a USB port right into
the side this I'm guessing is your
charging micro USB cord and that is
about it no headphones nothing else in
here that is all you're going to get in
the box let's push that off to the side
and take a look at the phone and it
looks very similar to what we've seen on
other galaxy s devices so here's the
4-inch screen that we talked about
earlier the Super AMOLED display with
the resolution 480 by 800 so you've got
your a typical Android buttons on the
bottom you've got your menu button home
button back button and search button
they are at the passage of buttons I do
like that they are actually visible
though I'm gonna have to wait for them
to illuminate we'll talk about that in
just a minute 4 inch screen you've got
your sensors on the front for proximity
5 megapixel camera on the back with LED
flash capable of shooting 720p video so
that is pretty nice the back of it is
classic it looks textured but it's not
let me know it's a galaxy s device on
the left hand side volume up and down
toggle on the right you've got your
power and lock button on the bottom
you've got a microphone jack and the
battery release and a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and the micro SD or micro
USB charging port which I assume has a
little bit of a door like receiving some
other galaxy s devices and speaking of
other galaxy s devices let's bring in
its brethren to see the difference here
we have the
I'm captivate for 18t you can see how
they all look similar but a bit
different these two are probably the
closest related looking we got some
square edges on the 18 t version ground
versions here and Verizon but you can
see the buttons across the bottom which
is very important you look at something
like the Epic 4G for Sprint what you
cannot see those buttons on the bottom
which becomes quite an annoyance when
you want to use them you got tap it whip
it to light up and oftentimes tap it
again so push that off to the side bring
the fascinate back and here it is with
the iPhone 4 see it definitely looks a
bit larger in the screen Department go
ahead and stack them and very very very
thin let's go ahead and boot this on for
the first time and of course they tuned
to the channel and TechnoBuffalo for all
of your Galaxy essence in this case
samsung fascinate coverage I got to say
Samsung is getting very good gut seat
with their naming schemes that captivate
the epic the fascinate they're really
proud of their phones evidently and if
you haven't seen by the way the screen
on the galaxy s devices they are very
very very impressive the Super AMOLED
display looks really good so here it is
fit puzzle to unlock things got a new
sort of unlock screen see how that works
go ahead and slide it over to the puzzle
that interesting and there it is this is
the samsung fascinate with bing as the
search engine has been talked about
quite a bit anyway guys i am john r
Ettinger from TechnoBuffalo if you have
any questions about the device and
things you want to see go ahead and let
me know i'm kind of curious to hear what
you guys have to say i will see you in
the next video goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
