Sanger from technobuffalo and in today's
episode of rumor roundup we're going to
be talking about the galaxy s6 and s6
edge the HTC One m9 and if you're on
verizon's network and you're still
waiting for the Nexus 6 we've got some
bad news for you HTC One m9 has been
leaking a lot recently but this last
leak might be the biggest one yet a
handful of new promo videos published
earlier this week revealed pretty much
every remaining secret surrounding HTC's
next flagship phone just days ahead of
its official unveiling now since the
video has been pulled most of the new
stuff centers on the next version of HTC
Sense software the new sense UI includes
some pretty exciting features including
a sense widget which offers easy access
to relevant apps depending on your
location now HTC also added a fourth
on-screen navigation button giving you
the ability to easily turn off the
device without needing the stretch your
fingers we're also expecting the HTC One
m9 to be packing the new Dolby powered
boomsound speakers and new photo editing
tools HTC one m9 is expected to pack the
new Snapdragon 810 processor from
Qualcomm a 20 megapixel rear camera and
an ultrapixel shooter up front for
better low-light selfies we're just days
away from mwc 2015 and HTC's
announcements so we'll know for sure in
just a few days now coming up next is
the nexus 6 and verizon now the nexus 6
was supposed to launch on verizon this
month the month of februari and at least
that's what we thought but a new report
claims is verizon nexus 6 won't be
available until march 12 an anonymous
source revealed two phandroid that the
nexus 6 was delayed though it's unclear
exactly why now once it does hit the
market the verizon branded nexus 6 is
expected to run android 5.1 out of the
box along wit enhance 4g LTE and
built-in volte calling it's possible
that's the reason for the delay but
that's just an assumption from our end
the Nexus 6 is an awesome device though
it's just a bit too big for me it
features a 6 inch qhd display is
snapdragon 805 processor 3 gigabytes of
ram a huge 3220 milliamp battery a 13
megapixel camera and it's running stock
Android lollipop out of the box though
it's likely verizon will add at least a
little bit of its own bloatware so if
you've been waiting for a while to get
your hands on this subsidized next 26
you'll have to wait a little bit
longer of course you can also order the
device unlock straight from google right
now but you have to pay 649 dollars up
front which is a lot of money last but
not least let's talk about the new
galaxy s6 and s6 edge now someone over
all about Samsung has snagged what is
allegedly in early galaxy s6 unit giving
us a look at what the upcoming device
looks like a day after that leaked the
galaxy s6 edge leak as well alongside
the regular galaxy s6 both the s6 and s6
edge appear to be running the latest
version of TouchWiz now if you recall
from previous episodes of roundup we
talked about Samsung bringing a lighter
version of TouchWiz which is supposed to
be closer to stock Android now to be
honest from looking at the photos it
still looks a lot like TouchWiz but I
could be wrong the physical design shown
in the photos looks identical to the
leaked images released a few weeks back
the metal frames the thin bezels and
protruding camera and a home button also
seems to be a bit bigger hopefully we'll
see an improved fingerprint reader on
the galaxy s6 we're expecting Samsung to
put the latest hardware on the galaxy s6
and s6 edge including a qHD display an
octa-core Exynos processor and improve
cameras we're just a few days away from
Samsung's big announcements so make sure
to stay tuned on march first /
technobuffalo com we'll be covering the
entire thing live as it happens anyways
that's it for this episode of rumor
