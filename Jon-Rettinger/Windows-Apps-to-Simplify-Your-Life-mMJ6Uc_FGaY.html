from the TechnoBuffalo here haven't done
intro like that and Wow felt feel good
to bring it back when I'm here at the
office I'm generally using my MacBook
Pro as my OS to get my work done but I
like to experience other operating
systems so for the past like ten months
at home I was using a pixel book trying
Chrome OS and I wanted to go back to
trying Windows 10 to see what Windows 10
could do it's been a while since I used
it on a daily basis and used my home
computer all the time so I switched to
try to use Windows and as I've been
switching I found apps that had made a
transition a lot easier and have made
Windows work better for me especially
coming from Mac OS I wanted to share the
apps that have made the windows
transition more seamless for me and if
you guys have suggested something at
work leaving the comments down below and
if you are fast we're also giving away a
surface pro 6 for the next few days I'll
link to that one down below I realize
how often I use quick look on Mac OS and
there's a slight trivia question for the
video what version of Mac OS did
QuickLook come out on let us know in the
comments down below and I missed having
it on Windows he just pushed spacebar
and you could preview a document without
having to double click and open it up so
there's appropriately an app in the
Windows Store it's totally free called
quick look it does the same thing and
does it really well you push spacebar
you can open a document it saves me time
and it just made the transition its bit
easier this next app I want to thank our
sponsor freedom VPN I really start using
VPNs until the past 8 months when I
started talking about products with my
wife and I started getting
advertisements for them showing up on
Instagram and Facebook so VPNs have
become a little bit important for me
essentially it's a virtual private
network it can mask what you're doing
and it can mask where you are and just
gives me a little bit of peace of mind
so freedom is by f-secure it's a company
with 30 years of spotless track record
for protecting its customers which is a
kind of a big deal for for anybody it's
super easy to set up you can get it up
and running under a minute you don't
need like a rocket science degree to get
this working there's a gigantic on/off
button so you can choose when you want
your VPN on and when you want your
VPN off you be debating trying a VPN
ticket I am there's really no risk you
can try it free for five days you can
also get 20% off with discount code
TechnoBuffalo will put all the
information to it down below so you
spotlight a ton on mac OS just putting
the command space and searching for
anything I love that feature
the Start menu in the search bar inside
of in a Windows 10 is crazy powerful my
fingers just got used to sort of putting
those hotkeys to do it this is gonna
view the same thing on the windows it
just Alt + spacebar and it pulls up a
search box it doesn't give you any
additional functionality that you don't
get it the search in the Start menu my
fingers just used to those hotkeys so it
just been a nice thing to have for me
I've never been the biggest fan of
screenshotting on Windows 10 I always
use command shift 4 to select the area I
want to take a screenshot of there's an
app totally free called green shot that
gives you crazy granular controls over
screenshot you can set for the hotkeys
are used to so for me I just used alt
shift 4 so it was the same hotkeys I was
used to you can pick the file format you
could pick the size you can pick where
it saves to you could have it all
automate I absolutely love green shot
it's made my life a ton easier I do a
lot of screenshotting and just the
granular options it gives you have been
totally awesome when I switch to Windows
it's like one of the first 3 apps I
always download
so somebody who suffers from insomnia a
lot of my work is done either like
unnecessarily late at night or way early
in the morning so I like the color
temperature on my screen to kind of
shift at the time so I use flux for that
if you're coming from a kits similar to
what you get with nightshift you can set
a schedule to be cool during the day
warmer at night or you can adjust it
manually so Windows 10 has a feature
called a nightlight that's gonna kind of
give you similar options it just gives
you way more control and I kind of like
that there's also a ton of built-in free
stuff you can use and you can also
disable it for a full screen app so
that's not your jam this next one is
called Backblaze it does cost five
dollars per month but for me it kind of
gives me peace of mind
it does whole computer backups you can
access your backup to get an option to
get a drive of all of the data mailed to
you if your computer goes lost or stolen
you've got kind of a fine in my computer
feature built in so Windows 10 does have
backups built in you can do backups onto
external drives too if you want it's
been a little bit finicky in my
experience the five bucks for me was
just a price to pay for peace of mind
not a necessity but I kind of enjoyed
having it so these are the apps that
have made the transition for somebody
coming from Mac OS to Windows 10 the
easiest this has made Windows 10 not
really Macke but it's sort of giving me
the features that I got used to on Mac
OS to Windows oftentimes with more
option than I ever got on Mac OS there's
an app that you use on Windows that make
people's lives easier let us know in the
comments and we'll reply and we'll even
pin the top one up to the top so people
can see it and find some new apps to
help them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
