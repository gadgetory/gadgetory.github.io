the girl you met at the beach you're
gonna stay in touch and perhaps be
together forever but you got to go back
to school and you might need some new
tech to go along with you so we've got
the top back-to-school tech under 100
bucks I'm not gonna tell you to go buy a
$2,000 laptop to take with you to school
we're keeping things affordable for your
back-to-school tech so let's start
making sure you don't lose your stuff
it's the tile sport if you want to put
on these guys on your backpack if I
pathetical your new freshman year
roommate thinks it's super funny to hide
your backpack in the shower now you can
find it talk about the tile in the past
it's a Bluetooth tracker this one has
almost double the range the last version
it's 2 times louder - so you can squeeze
it it'll make noise we need to find
stuff or you can have it trigger from
your phone to find wherever it's at it's
a great way to keep track your things
you can pick one up for 35 bucks or a 2
pack for 60 I keep one on my wallet
because I lose that all the time so it's
just great great way just to keep track
large stuff so smart speakers are a big
deal you might want one for your dorm
room or to keep you in a room to wake
you up to remind you to not sleep
through like your 2:00 p.m. class but
they're also expensive and below is
actually allowed Alexa to be on non echo
products the echo Dodd is probably the
most popular out there but only is it
kind of expensive it's also not very
loud and music does not sound good so
enter the you fee genie it's between
like six and perhaps like eight times I
just made those numbers up louder than
the echo dot but it just sounds better
the sound feels it more of the room
doesn't sound tinny it's got more bass
just overall better product and it's
actually cheaper than the echo dot you
pick one up for about 35 bucks or even
less if you get it during the sale will
link to it down below and with Alexa
built-in you could ask the whether you
can set calendar reminders so you don't
forget to write that paper due tomorrow
you can send an alarm clock to wake you
up so you don't sleep through your 2:00
p.m. class if you decide to go with the
UV genie you can also pick up the you
feel uma smart bulb it's at 20 bucks the
60 watt smart bulb so you can turn on
and off your lights in your dorm room or
you can just mess with your roommate
put it by his bed or her bed and wake
them up with your voice
no hub needed it all - it's all totally
Wi-Fi so big bonus there so I mentioned
maybe your jerk roommate hide your
backpack and I've got a backpack for you
from a company you might not expect this
is actually the one Plus backpack the
company that makes the phones they
legitimately make a really good bag in
fact people in our office actually use
this bag on a daily basis it's not that
expensive either at 70 bucks compared to
other bags at costly - three times that
you pick one up or black or gray we we
obviously have the black one here the
gray looks nice but can kind of get
dirty so if you're prone to drop in your
bag and dirt you might want to go the
black color I can store up to a 15 inch
laptop it's got a luggage strap so you
can attach it to a larger bag it's got a
memory foam back pad so keep things safe
it's also super breathable it's gonna
hold all your stuff it's not gonna hurt
your back that's immoral
ain't not gonna look stupid doing it so
I've had a mouse it's not the most like
sexy product in the world but you're
gonna want a good one and if you paste I
had to pick up a laptop we're gonna want
you can carry with you
I think Logitech can make some of the
best I personally use the MX master it's
kind of a bigger version of this this is
the MX anywhere 2 s and it's an
incredible Mouse its compact it's great
if you're on the go again just throw it
in your backpack you can take up to
three different computers - it is nice
if you've got like a PC you know at a
science lab and you've got a Mac at your
dorm room or whatever you want to hook
it up to another tablet you do three
separate devices and make it really easy
to do you just push a button on the
bottom and if you want to use that Mouse
to like play game I recommend picking up
battlegrounds it's about thirty bucks
right now it's an alpha build and it's
not even close to being optimized for 4k
displays for video cards and all kinds
of other stuff don't have to track to
you from a thing just a really awesome
game in fact the guys at the office here
stream it on Twitch which will link our
twitch channel down below almost on a
daily basis it's kind of a open world
battle royale style game it's windows
and Steam only so either time to build
the PC or or dust off your old rig so
affordable back-to-school tech I was
like fighting the urge to be like you
need to go out and buy a razor blade Pro
it's the best bet school laptop
wanted to keep things
portable and keep stuff that is for
folks in a budget that still get really
high quality things and this is stuff
that I would use in fact stuff that I do
use but if we miss something if there's
like a big piece of back-to-school tech
that you think we need to have him here
let us know down below and we will add
it we'll talk about it and maybe I'll
add it to the comments and pin your
comment to the top but something that I
think is particularly awesome but that
being said I want to thank you fee for
sponsoring the video making this whole
back-to-school tech video possible
definitely check them out and it's
legitimately awesome products at a
pretty badass price until next time I'm
