Sanger from TechnoBuffalo and today
we'll be taking a look at the revamp
music app that was included in the
latest iOS 8.4 beta
Apple said the new look is cleaner and
simpler to use than ever before
ultimately making for a more powerful
experience now do keep in mind that this
is an early preview of the apps so what
we're showing you today could change in
the coming weeks and months with future
updates so if we head into the music app
you can see right away that there are
three main pages here we have my music
you have the playlist and we have iTunes
radio so let's jump back into my music
and right away we can see all of our
recently added songs here and we can
actually scroll through all of our music
here in different categories we have
songs we have albums artists and they're
all in alphabetical order so if we head
into a specific artists like ac/dc you
can see that there is this new album art
cover as a header and you can scroll
through all of their albums in
alphabetical order so if we head into
albums we can see all of the album's
from different artists here and the same
goes for the songs and we now have a
global search button at the top right
which is always going to be there you
can search for your music or you can
search for different radio stations as
well so if we add into playlists you can
see all of your playlists here that
you've made on your iPhone or iTunes so
if we try to create a new playlist you
can add your own title and your own
description and probably the coolest
thing here is that you can choose a
photo or take a photo to set as your
playlist cover and of course you can add
your songs here by different artists
albums and songs so if we go back and go
into radio you can see all your featured
stations here front and center not much
has really changed here you can see a
list of different genres when you scroll
down and your recently played stations
are at the top and you now get this new
mini player at the bottom which you can
control playback or if you simply tap on
it it'll show you the full now playing
page so in this new phone now playing
page you can see your shuffle button and
your repeat button and you now have a
list for your up next songs which you
can then reorder you can delete and see
which songs are playing next and also
what's new in this version is you can
quickly stream your track to any of your
airplay devices as whereas before you
would have to go to your control center
and use that airplay button there and
the other thing that we also noticed
that the audiobooks are no longer in a
music app but it's now in the iBooks app
under audiobooks so just to quickly
compare the new music app to the older
music app here you can see that there
are a lot of new changes here there are
three main navigation buttons at the
bottom and here you have your specific
label for your artists album and songs
and then you can access your radio by
hitting more now again just keep in mind
that this is the first beta that's only
available to developers at the moment
but we wanted to give you guys an early
look of what's to come now to be quite
honest I really like where Apple's going
with this new music app I think it's
much easier to navigate through menus
the new features are most certainly
welcome and the app overall looks much
better than the previous music app that
we're all used to I hope you guys liked
this quick video make sure to give it a
thumbs up if you liked it subscribe if
you guys haven't already and we will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
