Justin TechnoBuffalo it is a gorgeous
day in 77 California makes me want to be
outside and talk some rumors today it's
all about Android n and the next new
iPhone that's not the iPhone 7 the very
silly seemingly named iPhone 5s e or
something along those lines let's start
with Android n a good friends Android
police unearthed a few images of a
seemingly innocuous Bluetooth setting
screen and if you look at it it looks
like every other Bluetooth settings for
that we've seen but see that delicious
looking a hamburger icon what that is
supposedly going to do is open up a side
menu that let you access the other
settings instead of jumping back going
to settings and running back again make
things a little bit simpler but it's a
sign of things to come with Android and
other things I expect to see with
Android and split view multicast and
finally and Google's even hinted that
they might get rid of the app drawer in
a way to streamline the UI oh I'm hoping
that just a vicious horrible disgusting
rumor we don't know yet when Android n
is going to be called with CEO sundar
Pichai said they might just open up to a
poll that people vote on what Android n
is going to be but I'm just saying it
right now Nutella
just delicious goes on everything kind
of like Android we shouldn't have more
about Android end though at Google IO
towards the end of May next let's jump
over to Apple and the iPhone 5se which
at this point is like taxes know it's
coming we don't quite know what it's
going to be let's add two more rumors to
the mix coming from on leaks himself
from shared schematics of two alleged
design options that Apple was supposedly
considering for the iPhone 5se both look
eerily similar to the current gen i
phone 6 and 6s which conflicts with
other rumors we've seen I say the phone
can look like an iPhone 5s on a
schematic you can see its are the curved
rounded edges of the iPhone 6 and 6s you
could expect a pretty powerful a nine
chip touch ID to being board
I will not expect though to see 3d touch
on there so no force touch for you folks
of course support for Apple pay and the
rest of the things you can expect from a
modern gen I phone what we do kind then
though or at least have a better idea of
them when we're gonna see this guy and
that date is March 15th but we'll see
the view alongside the next gen iPad air
the appropriately named iPad air 3 so
what do you guys think
iPads iPhones Android n what are you
excited about let's hear your thoughts
on it
and does anybody even care about a lower
price iPhone at this point the iPhone 5c
was not the hit Apple expected but
perhaps this one will be the home run
that the company needs I know what do
you guys think video a thumbs up we
always appreciate it
the next time I'm John Rhett injure you
guys next in you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
