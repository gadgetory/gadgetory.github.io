from TechnoBuffalo and Apple on Monday
introduced iOS 9 which includes a lot of
big new features its namely the addition
of a smarter Siri with the first beta
already available we've had the chance
to take Apple's new OS for spin and have
our first look right here Siri got a bit
of a design change in iOS 9 so she looks
how she does on the Apple watch
along with a new proactive feature that
will suggest relevant people suggested
apps nearby places and more depending on
your preferences and usage throughout
the day the new more proactive Siri is
contextually aware and can offer you
more information than ever for example
if you run every morning Siri can offer
music to listen to you when you plug in
your headphones
the music is context-sensitive and is
dependent on the time in place so if
you're at the gym working out it'll play
music with an upbeat tempo to get you
hyped up for your workout Proactive will
even tell you when to leave for an event
based on traffic and make a suggestion
for who might be calling from that
unknown number with iOS 9 there's also a
brand new search window when swiping to
the left of the home screen which offers
commonly used apps contacts one tap
links to nearby locations and breaking
news you'll also see what's in the news
based on your location so you're always
up to date with what's happening in your
community not only that but Siri now
powers a more intelligent search and the
new search bar you can search for sports
scores and weather and she'll also
provide stocks calculations and
conversions and search deep within your
apps you can also ask her to search
through your photos show me photos I
took in San Francisco and those images
will pop up double pressing the home
button now gives you a new look to the
app switcher giving users card-like
overview to their opened apps it doesn't
appear to offer much more at least
functionality compared to the current
apps which are in iOS 8 but it does look
pretty and seems to be a much smoother
experience compared to the current
methods of card the Notes app also got
major improvements with brand-new
formatting options photos checklist
options and drawing and sketching tools
the updated Notes app is also much
richer than before allowing users to add
images links with previews and map
directions all without ruining the style
format it makes a note application a
much more powerful experience and
something you might actually want to use
maps finally got transit directions in
select cities around the world transit
will show you lines and stations right
from within maps Siri is also integrated
into transit which means we
can finally ask Siri how to get to a
certain location via transit option but
as of now transit is only available in
places like San Francisco Washington d.c
Baltimore New York and Chicago just to
name a few but it's great that it's
finally here and it was a long time
coming
searching for nearby locations is also
much easier in Apple Maps giving you a
variety of options to choose from from
food drinks shopping and more apple also
announced a brand new Flipboard like app
called news which takes content from
sources like ESPN wired in the New York
Times presents them would rich
typography and really nice imagery with
a new news app the more you read the
more personalized the news app becomes
which means you'll see more articles
that are more tailored to you the app
isn't available in the first public beta
on our iPhone though from what Apple
showed us at WWDC it does look really
nice the iPad got some love in iOS Ines
while including true multitasking in a
brand new quicktype keyboard the new
multitasking feature includes something
known as slide over which means you can
bring smaller versions of the apps like
notes mail and messages with a quick
gestures right beside the Safari app
there's also split view which allows
users to put two apps next to each other
something we've seen in competing
tablets already additionally there's a
picture-in-picture feature that'll allow
you to keep watching videos while you
jump into another app while most of
these new features are available for
most iPads split view is only available
for the iPad air 2 Apple also decided to
ditch the name passbook and replace it
with wallet which makes more sense since
Apple added store credit and debit cards
alongside your other cards and security
has been ramped up in iOS with the
introduction of a six digit passcode the
passcode to use on your touch ID enabled
iphone and ipad will now have six digits
instead of four if you use such ID it's
a change you'll hardly notice but it's
not much harder to crack your device
with one million possible combinations
lastly Apple said the performance and
battery life have also been improved in
iOS 9 with a brand new low-power mode
that can extend battery life for three
hours Apple has also reduced the free
space needed to download in iOS 9 from
4.6 gigabytes to 1.3 gigabytes
now there's a lot more that Apple didn't
discuss like map customization Swift 2
Wireless carplay and homekit iCloud
remote access this is just the first
beta of iOS 9 so there could be changes
in future updates from UI changes to
feature changes but if you guys
interested in trying out the iOS 9 beta
Apple is launching a public beta of iOS
9 which will start in July and will be
available for everyone else around fall
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
