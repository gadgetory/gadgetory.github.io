to you by harry's what is going on
YouTube and Internet world I'm John
Berringer this is another episode of
Rhett endures risk usually I sit right
here in this chair sometimes I get mad
at stuff sometimes I get kind of
metaphorical with stuff and whimsical
but this week I got something special
for you I want to show you what's on my
iOS device three weeks ago I showed you
it was on my Android device and I won
plus 1 and then freakin marker to steal
my Thunder did the same thing with his
oneplus one and I refused to be outdone
so I'm gonna show you what's rockin on
my iPhone 5s what apps I've got how I've
got it set up you can show me what
you've got on yours we could find the
best apps and we could be friendly and
share our advice this is Retton Drew's
riffs let's start riffing so here is my
iPhone 5s I am running iOS 8 least a
beta of iOS 8 I got a t-mobile SIM card
thrown in that guy so if you saw the
video I did on my Android device for
what's on that I like sort of a simple
design I've got just a row of icons down
the right-hand side and fortunately I
can do the same thing on iOS try to make
my homescreen kind of as simple as
possible at least the main screen so I
just have two rows and this is what I
used the most photos I got a little baby
at home I like to look at way too many
pictures of him my calendar my settings
and my camera thing for the liquid car
I've got some TechnoBuffalo tracking
stuff for tracking our stats analytics
if you have a website is the best
analytics app I have ever used it pulls
in information way quicker than any
other app I think it pulls in for
analytics Pro so it gives you just a
quick as information we use Charpy it's
a an app that lets you track real time
traffic on your site and then that
analytics app just gives me sort of a
recap you know I like to overdo it on
the analytics side of things social
media I've got things broken down here
Tweetbot for Twitter Facebook Instagram
LinkedIn and Foursquare though I'm very
readily use Foursquare anymore but the
new icons kind of cool and the sites I
visit the most I could probably take
this one out and just do it right from
Safari but TechnoBuffalo in ESPN cuz I'm
a sports nut and I got to see how angels
are doing you were the best record in
MLB after all and then down here and my
dog got my phone
male safari and messages I don't use
Chrome for iOS for the reasons I just
have always preferred Safari but I use
Chrome on my desktop so here's where
things get IOS seen just a lot of apps
and a lot of folders so I tried to be a
little bit elegant and I broke things
down by category so Apple and through
all my Apple stuff live app store stocks
contact calendar and you can see the
rest of that stuff there health
maps weather kind of the rest that
business including FaceTime then other
this is where just I just threw
everything else I couldn't put in a
category drop cam I friggin love drop
cam if you haven't checked it out or
picked one up you're totally sure Google
just bought him we've got him in the
office I use them at home too
to watch the baby which I know was a
little creeper but I just like to make
sure he's okay
HBO go Flixster I use Flickr for movies
a square it's a great way to send
payment sometimes we can pay the staff
at credit card the payments other people
just a great way to go keyring was one
app I was really excited about
essentially it scans the little you know
cards you get on your keys to have
barcodes like it into a gym and stuff
and puts it all on there but half the
time but companies that use a little key
fob things they can't scan the screen so
it's kind of been a bust for me Yahoo
fantasy basketball Netflix you player
was sort of another YouTube app Redfin
and actually offices are near asteroids
like the track what's going on with
retail property around the area chrome
contacting it's a great way to sync over
all of your contacts from Google over to
your iOS device that's an awesome way to
do it actually turbo notes right way to
sort of sign documents the c-w I like to
watch arrow on the go atomic web is
another web browser that I used to try
show jams kind of obvious action movies
kind of awesome lets you cool effects
with videos you take free emoji Wells
Fargo UPS Skype u-verse for TV it's what
I have at home sign now another thing to
serve sign documents nest
I got a thermostat at home and I love it
and also because my wife always forgets
to turn off the AC so I can do that
a 1password is probably the best app I
have ever bought I don't know what it
cost now the price is always changing on
it but it is the best app on desktop or
mobile to keep your password secure I
cannot recommend that one enough YouTube
Bloomberg for stocks uber for doing her
things
uber conference not related to the uber
driver
is a great way to set up conference
calls buzzfeed to check out my listicles
weather wallet voodoo grant way to watch
movies PlayStation of course bit shipped
you've gotta make cartoons out of your
own icon Pandora Amex for paying credit
card bills eBay Chase I just switched
banking over for most rugged of Jason I
kind of love it
kevo cuz I've got a kevo at home it's a
way to get into your house that having
use a physical key use the Bluetooth 4.0
and Southwest there's a lot of stuff in
my other folder games I can secured I
got here gang as a lot of Angry Birds
game centers in there Temple Run threes
which I have a really unhealthy
addiction to these are kind of my
passbook apps and see all the passbook
stuff that's they're not that much
haven't found much use not honesty for
passbook from charging apps to find
available charging stations you stop the
video right here just to stroke my long
flowy beautiful beard and look at it I
know what you're thinking how can
someone who have such a beautiful beard
possibly want to shave I gotta tell ya
so they could be a little bit on the
itchy side so I always go to my friends
at Harry's do not know Harry's you
should they're less than a year old they
are already crazily disrupting the
shaving industry offering a way better
experience a better value then these
giant shaving but he missed like Schick
and the folks at Gillette the company
makes ridiculously awesome
german-engineered blades and they cared
so much about quality they just friggin
bought the whole tiny 300 factory like
boom arse all your factory are belong to
us their co-founder also founded Warby
Parker so if you like the way they do
the business you'll also really really
like Harry's they've got a big emphasis
on design we take those craftsmanship
amazing value and high-quality personal
and dedicated customer service if you
want to try them and you want to go from
this look to this look go to harrys.com
use promo code techno save 5 smackers
off your first purchase 15 bucks again a
to be set that includes a handle three
blades shaving cream and shipped right
to your door they'll even offer custom
engraving options so your dirty roommate
is not going to shave parts you don't
want to know using your razor blade
food apps I got opentable Yelp Domino's
and tender greens which I love their
salad are delicious the office stuff
Pages Numbers and Keynote storage
I love using sugar think and everybody's
all like glue Dropbox is the best which
I use and like and Google Drive it's
best I love sugar sink I think it works
awesome you should give that a shot some
Amazon stuff I want to some Amazon apps
live here as well case I want to search
for things and check out prices media
this is where I tunes I can store our
videos and podcasts are gonna be
messaging said yourself explanatory
what's happened bbm for third-party
messengers pebble ice out other pebble
ops in there but I just kind of kept the
folder when I was in Geneva for the Auto
Show I had a whole folder of a stuff I
walk did you use for translation and
that kind of stuff and forgot exchange
rate so I got Google Support Center
TaskRabbit
it's kind of a crazy thing I'd that'll
be Gavin plated it but I've actually
tried the service yet essentially you
can find people that want to do stuff
for you like if you need someone to go
pick up dinner pick up dry cleaning you
can do it you could pay them right from
here I do all kinds of crazy stuff I'll
show you the app actually because if you
haven't tried it it's ridiculously crazy
for what it does they go ahead and I'll
just sign in with Facebook and I'll show
you real quickly what it can do so you
can pick what you need someone to do
cleaning handyman assistance moving
whatever it's let's just say cleaning
for example and you can see people's
profiles and what they charge per hour
to come do your stuff so this guy see
where how far he is near me for 18 bucks
an hour and you just sort of tap on it
and they just show up it's crazy I'm
looking forward to finding it useful but
just was it cool out in general numerix
