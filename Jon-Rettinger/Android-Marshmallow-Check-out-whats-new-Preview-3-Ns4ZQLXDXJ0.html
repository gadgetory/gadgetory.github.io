from technobuffalo and this is a nexus 5
running the latest Android marshmallow
Developer Preview one of the biggest and
most notable changes in this new
developer preview is the boot animation
it's more playful and colorful yet still
very Google like matching the same
animations in material design of
lollipop your first taste of android is
the boot animation and it's cool to see
a cool new one has been made
unfortunately Google is now on tap is
still unavailable which is one of
Android marshmallows bigger features for
what it's worth the animation when
trying to access now on SAP has been
changed but we still can't actually take
the feature for spin hopefully we'll get
to try it out before the final release
of marshmallow later this year another
playful trick Google included in this
preview is if you swipe down on a
notification tray and hold down on a
Settings icon but your will start
rotating and this will enable system UI
tuner which lets you tweak the toggles
inside the notification tray and enable
and disable elements in your status bar
there's also a few new wallpapers which
look really nice going into settings and
checking out about phone android
marshmallow is now labeled as android
version 6.0 which is a big jump up from
the most recent version of android 5.1
point 1 when you click on a version
however there's still no easter egg
google still shows the shrug emoji and
that's about it there aren't a whole lot
of changes in this Developer Preview
besides the new boot animation new
wallpapers and enabling system UI tuner
google said in two blog posts that the
preview images are near final but
they're not intended for consumer use so
if you want to try out android
marshmallow we recommend a flash the
image file on a secondary device and not
your daily driver once the final version
of android marshmallow does become
available this fall it'll include
features like android pay and
fingerprint support now on tap better
app permissions and Appling 'king if you
want to see some of the other major
changes and new additions to android
marshmallow make sure to check out our
previous videos over here anyways thank
you guys so much for watching and if you
guys enjoy this video make sure to give
it a thumbs up and we will see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
