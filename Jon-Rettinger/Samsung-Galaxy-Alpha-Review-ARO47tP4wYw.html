from technobuffalo and today we'll be
talking about the Samsung Galaxy alpha
you saw John in boxes a few weeks ago
and we've been using it ever since so
let's see how same things new design
language holds up the Galaxy alpha is
noteworthy for being a first samsung
phone we've seen that uses of metal
casing it's the most attractive
smartphone Samsung has made thus far add
until the note 4 becomes available the
metal signs with chamfered edge is
similar to Apple's design looks
beautiful and feels great in the hand
the plastic back meanwhile has a soft
touch quality to it that's somewhat
similar to the galaxy s5 is plastic back
which I really like for some odd reason
hardware-wise the phone features a 4.7
inch 720p display it's 2.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor with
2 gigabytes of RAM it packs a decent
sized battery at eighteen sixty milliamp
and a non expandable storage at 32
gigabytes there's a heart rate sensor
beside its 12 megapixel camera in the
back which is capable of recording 4k
videos as well as a 2.1 megapixel
front-facing camera that can film in
1080p there's also a built-in
fingerprint scanner which samsung has
been improving quite a lot recently and
the Galaxy alpha is running Android 4.4
point for kid cat out of the box of
course with Samsung's TouchWiz get over
it the Galaxy alpha will say you buy for
199 dollars with a two-year contract
through AT&amp;amp;T or six hundred twelve
dollars and ninety-nine cents off
contract it is a bit more expensive than
the galaxy s5s off contract even though
it doesn't have the very latest specs
though it does support a better design
which might account for the higher price
tag the 4.7 inch Super AMOLED display is
color rich and vibrant with good
contrast wide viewing angles and a pixel
density of 312 PPI while it is sharp for
reading text and viewing photos it is
noticeably less clips in the galaxy s5s
5.1 inch 1080p screen would 432 PPI
nonetheless the screen is very bright
and has extremely rich colors which is
great for watching movies on Netflix or
videos on YouTube of course with some of
Samsung's latest software tweaks you can
change the screen modes if you prefer a
more natural screen tone performance
wise the alphas plenty fast the 2.5
gigahertz Snapdragon 801 processor is
abby's and can handle pretty much
anything you throw at it whether you're
just browsing the web playing games or
watching movies it hasn't really slowed
down on me during the weeks
tested it battery life on the other hand
isn't all that impressive it lasts about
a full workday with medium to heavy
usage that's about it I would have to
charge the phone every night which could
be fine for the average person but I was
expecting something better from Samsung
and it's two hundred dollars price tag
in terms of software android 4.4 point
for comes with the same touch with skin
as you'll get on s5 as much as I want to
like TouchWiz on a phone samsung stock
apps like their web browser calendar app
store and more are inferior to google's
version and always have been there are
some pretty cool software tweaks that
samsung included that a lot of people
could find useful like private mode
which lets you protect files behind a
password or fingerprint easy mode which
is great for parents or grandparents and
there's also multi window which you can
run two apps at once to get a feel for a
true multitasking feature but since the
galaxy alpha only features a 4.7 inch
screen it's not all that great on this
phone but nonetheless the feature is
still present so let's talk about
cameras cameras are probably one of the
most important feature that a lot of
people look for in a smartphone a lot of
people say the best camera is the one in
your pocket and a lot of companies like
HTC Samsung LG and app will really try
to emphasize on how great their cameras
are the camera on the Galaxy alpha is
good it's not the best it's just good I
noticed what a lot of Samsung devices
they tend to over sharpen the image and
the images tend to be a bit too Chris
for my taste but nonetheless or a ton of
built in software tweaks Samsung
included with all of their devices to
make your shots better and when it comes
to build quality it's well-built the
Shan furred edges the metal buttons it's
the very first samsung phone design-wise
that i love and i can't wait to see what
samsung has in store for us when the
note 4 is available so to wrap things up
for you guys i'm giving the galaxy alpha
a TechnoBuffalo score of 7 point 5 out
of 10 it's one of the best-looking
galaxy phones around right now and the
camera is good and is plenty powerful
for the average person but I just wish
the screen battery was just a bit better
especially for the price you're paying
anyways that's it for this video guys if

know in the comments down below and as
