different TechnoBuffalo here and I hope
wherever you are you're enjoying your
day with your head casually resting on
your left hand there's a ton of holiday
videos out there it's time to pony up
and buy some gifts guests are gonna give
it a gift like a lot of people are
giving the Amazon echo dot there are a
lot of ways to get into the smart home
eco system and Alexa I think it's
probably the best way to get in but
there's a ton of products that sort of
go beyond just the dot Amazon has opened
up Alexa sort of work with a bunch of
other products that bring in new
functionality that add the best of Alexa
but also the best the other products so
I want to create the ultimate and I'm
calling it the ultimate the epic and
other words that get misused and used
too much on YouTube the world's most
ultimate epic real truth about just
buying the right products with Alexa
built in so I want to thank Alexa for
sponsoring this video and apologies in
advance if I turn on your echo devices
all the products that we're gonna
mention of course will be available on
amazon.com but to make it easy we just
got them linked down below in the in the
what-have-you so let's start with a pair
of headphones that are legit my favorite
I have loved them so much I've actually
bought them twice so these are the bose
qc25 twos I had the bose qc25
I had them for a week I left them at the
airport and I bought them again because
I absolutely love them what the two
brings to the table is you might guess
it brings the assistant part to it it
also has a new blue color if you want a
really good pair of headphones with
incredible noise canceling and the best
part for me has been battery life is
insane I can easily go two days without
plugging these things in the QC 35 tubes
are absolutely incredible you've got a
new button on the left ear cup now that
you can pair with the Bose app and you
can call up Alexa to do all kinds of
Alexa stuff
come on find out the weather you want to
find out what the score the Rams Bears
games don't find out what score the Rams
Bears games was I'm still
I'm still a little hurt from it so are
350 bucks you definitely not the
cheapest headphones but these are the
ones that have been in my bag with me
anywhere I've traveled anywhere I've
gone rent that I've left in one place
but this is worth every penny
you're getting some of the bests in
noise cancelling some the best sound
fidelity and I throw all that on to it
you're also getting the awesome services
from Alexa so device is with Alexa built
in or like Drake at basketball game and
see you never know where they're gonna
show up they seem to be everywhere so
obviously we saw them on the bose qc25
Stu's but if over the ear headphones
aren't your jam and like something a
little more compact in-ear they've also
got you covered these are the Jabra
elites 65 T and it's got elite in them
so you know they're good so first on the
Alexa part it's pretty simple you just
push a button on the right ear cup and
you can find out what the weather is you
could have your coffee maker make your
coffee at home all the Alexus stuff that
you like control your smart home right
from your earpiece I don't charge these
as often as I should when I do plug them
in for about 15 minutes to get about an
hour and a half of charge they do charge
though via microUSB I would have liked
to seen USB type-c here I think it's
becoming more of ubiquitous standard but
I'm sure you've got some micro USB
cables lingering around so that's how
this is going to charge once you put
them in your ear though they're pretty
comfortable you have different ear tips
to find one that's gonna fit your your
proper
ear hole this is not a style of
headphone that's for everybody
but if you do like this style of sort of
the real slim profile in your headphones
I think it's one the best sound quality
is really good battery life a solid and
you've got alexa built in so job right
up folks and don't feel guilty it's a
good gift for Dad
this next one needs no introduction it's
like it's like share the Pope or like
Paul McCartney you know what it is by
looking at it
all hail King Sonos this is the Sonos
one smart speaker so I'm not gonna spend
too much talking about how great the
Sonos system is because it is and you
should know it this one integrates
obviously with the whole sono system but
it does have the Alexa functionality
built in so take it the Alexa part out
you've got one hundred ninety-nine bucks
this is one of the cheapest ways to get
into the Sonos eco system and you add
the Alexa functionality and it's kind of
like an extra bonus all usual sono stuff
you can get is obviously here you
compare different units and get an
awesome multi room setup and they sound
really good for a speaker of this size
that's why it's King King so dose these
things are absolutely incredible if this
color is not your jam it's also
available in white and it seals for
humidity so they take out showers you
can put in your bathroom and Allison
this is gonna be sitting in your home
anyway you could ask Alec's that help
you with some smart home control you
could have it ask you the weather tell
you sports scores you're getting the
best is Sonos now you're also getting
Alexa built in the Bose and so knows
maybe it's like oil and water but we got
him to stay situated and be friends at
least for one video this is the bose
home speaker 500 it's pretty similar the
Sonos but it's got a screen what its
gonna do is mostly show you album art
leon the state to music which is kind of
a bummer
you will go get a white light that will
come across the top to show you when
you're talking to alexa but when it
comes to sound beau still does a killer
job with the sound quality so what about
the tech side there are two custom
driver points opposite directions that's
gonna bounce sound off wall to help kind
of fill up a room with a richer sound
just like being kind of one small
speaker so it's available in white it's
gonna set you back 400 bucks and when
you compare it to what we just saw with
the Sonos if like straight up audio
fidelity and that is your most important
sermoning factor when buying a smart
speaker then yeah the bose is probably a
decent way to go if you care more about
creating an ecosystem around your house
and Sonos is going to be absolutely
killer
so Facebook has been in the news quite a
bit recently and if you are interested
in bringing Facebook into your home
complete with extra cameras and mics
there is the portal and this is the
portal plus it's a 15.6 inch screen that
does look absolutely gorgeous that kind
of serves as a portal into facebook
ecosystem also of course it's integrated
with Alexa so you can talk and have
Alexa do all the things that you'd want
to do so you're gonna get a highly
immersive facebook messenger video
calling experience so the idea here is
that you could set one up at Grandma's
house and make a phone call very easily
and you can talk and you can interact
the screen looks really good again 15.6
inches it's got a 1080p video display
with the 12 megapixel camera and what's
pretty awesome it's got 140 degree
fields of view so it'll kind of follow
you wherever you go you are getting
again Alexa built in so if you want to
ask Alexa to do certain things for you
you can do that you know sports course
weather is home control so they're also
apps you can install things like YouTube
and Hulu and kind of unlike that little
boat screen this screen actually shows
you stuff well Facebook camera thing
definitely gives me a little bit of
pause but they do give you a little
plastic thing to just cover it up if you
don't want that camera activated it also
will rotate if you want different angles
so you can just you know easily turn it
and you're good to go
it looks great functionally it functions
as expected and it's up to you if it's
gonna be worked at 350 bucks
so poke is not just where Al Bundy went
to high school they also make some
pretty killer sound bars this is the
pulk audio command bar in it kind of
looks they just like they drop to echo
dot in there but it's gonna give you a
lot of stuff so first Alexa built in so
if you're gonna pair this with a fire TV
you can control your television and what
you're watching using your voice which
is awesome and does seem like magic if
you try it gonna give you two built in
4k HDMI 2 ports you get one HDMI AARC
output you've got optical input for TV
audio you got a ton of ports here to
come with a wireless sub as well it's
not a huge profile which sometimes sound
bars can be gigantic and again for a
package that's under 300 bucks you're
getting a legit awesome sound bar and
then you're also getting the alexa
functionality sort of built in as kind
of an added bonus we're starting to see
is the changing conception of a smart
home it doesn't mean that you need your
home to physically wired for all these
connections we've seen alexa built into
light switches we've seen alexa built
into thermostats and they've got it
built into a myriad of other products
you could smart home your life without
having to rewire your house these are a
ton of product options and maybe one of
them will be right for you for me if I
was buying one of these products or or
to the bose qc25 tubes I would buy those
10 out of 10 times but there's a product
for everybody if you want the better
fidelity and you want the screen then
you've got the bose option if you want a
sound bar you've got poke if you want in
ear headphones you've got Jabra you can
find a product LexA built in to work for
you instead of having to hunts to find
something the other way around there's a
lot of choices so whether that you're
buying these for you for somebody you
love these are the best ways to get
Alexa into your house some cheaply some
not but all with really good products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
