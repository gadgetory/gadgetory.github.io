TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of one
of the latest phones in the Motorola
Droid lineup this is the Droid ultra
let's go ahead and unbox it and see how
ultra this thing really is here is the
box for the Droid ultra with a very
familiar red robot eye glaring at you
nothing else super exciting package
contains but that's what we're gonna
show you in this video we will slide off
the sleeve with gusto
boom there's gussto and there's that
bigger eye hopefully those phones got
that definitely not annoying draw a boot
up animation and noise that goes with it
so here is the droid ultras the first
the new line of droids being joined by a
mini and a max with two x's for extra
emphasis so it's got the nice plastic
back to it and all kind of other
business would take a look at that in
just a moment
telling us to ingress so there it is
this device doubles as an ingress
scanner so you can scan things digging
further into the box got getting to know
your phone hello phone my name is John
what that bedroom okay droid ultra books
other books and different languages
product safety and warranty information
this should just say like don't put in
the microwave or throw at your sister's
head we've got a charging and syncing
all pretty standard variety and micro
USB and we've got a wall wart with two
prongs and a USB port for two USB ports
well that's new that's kinda nice you
get an extra one for charging multiple
things if you'd like but that's not the
reason you're here this is the reason
you are here we'll go and peel off the
sticker so you can get that whooshing
noise kind of had it all right anything
else on the back we got a sticker
covering the Motorola logo let's go
ahead and boot this up and see if we do
have that animation and I'll walk you
guys through all the specs so now it
says Motorola a Google company that's a
new as far as I can tell so we've got
there it is every time I test a new
Droid phone my wife was gets up sex I
could inadvertently turn it on and
forget the bed in the morning it
droid sounds like the
alarm and the house are going off
alright so you've got a three capacitive
buttons on the bottom I got a back
button home button and a multitasking
button on the left hand side there's
nothing on the right hand side you've
got a volume rocker up and down really
well pronounced buttons you'll have no
problem finding these they got some
texture on them as well on the power and
the lock button around the back you'll
find the tenant megapixel camera on the
front we've got a 2 megapixel camera the
screen you're looking at here is a
5-inch display with 1280 by 720 giving
it a 294 ppi Android 4.2 at launch is on
here it's got 2 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs
of storage but it's not expandable mat
PC Motorola kept this little circle with
its I really like that from the skin
previously known as motoblur Wi-Fi here
it's got all kinds of goodness come into
an 802 11 ABG and and AC at both 2.4 and
5 gigahertz Bluetooth 4.0 on a pretty
nice sized 21:30 million power battery
NFC is also here as well and weighs four
point nine four ounces or 140 grams and
should be available in black or red all
the black version those look pretty
sweet so let's see we're going to have
here it looks like the most part
motorola is letting android be Android
which makes sense because they're now
owned by Google so a couple carrier
bundled apps here one of the ones I
really like this one is not carrier but
Motorola's Moto assist we saw that in
the Moto X and I really liked it or read
your text messages while you're driving
it'll put your phone automatically in
silent when you're in meetings when you
go to bed a lot of really cool things
there so don't just assume that that
something you want to but overlook
definitely take a look at it there's
some rides and stuff mobile hotspot my
verizon mobile my great make me just
switch over to your phone from something
else
NFL mobile than some other bird eyes and
things which chances are you probably
won't take much of a look at so see what
else are gonna have in the widget wise
me there's something new and fancier we
haven't seen pretty standard stuff so
far there is the Droid command center I
really like that widget I'm happy to see
that it still kept its self in the new
line of droid phones we'll go and leave
that there and you can flick through a
kind of different stuff here only one
circle widget can be added so I can't
have more so there's the one that I can
show
they do a lot more to it I'll do a quick
size comparison here with the galaxy s4
go and turn that screen off you can see
that they are very similar in size
actually very similar and feel as well
the plastic back feels a little more
sturdy here on the droid ultra in the
perhaps because the back is not
removable so bear that in mind as well
see what these two guys look like the
black and a white one and there they are
sort of staring down each other like
rivals so go ahead and pick this guy up
from your verizon so definitely check
the prices because they changed almost
on a daily basis it is being powered I
should mention buy a 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core processor so sort of falls
into the mid to high range of the droid
line and Verizon's line of devices and
you guys want to see we've did it in the
comments down below make sure that we
show them to you please do the video a
