technobuffalo here about a month and a
half ago had the chance actually go to
dell's campus in texas and get a chance
to walk through and sort of see how Dell
works talk to him about their customer
service and certainly in the time has
passed I have unboxed and looked at
probably when the flagship smartphones a
dell streak you've seen my review of you
see my unboxing obviously my software
comparisons I've seen really everything
about it but what is Della think about
the device themselves during one of the
street meetings I was able to bring in
my camera and actually show what Dell
executives say about what they think
about it than you I was filming so it's
kind of interesting to sort of hear it
from the inside and I sort of asked some
questions about how the cleanse position
it with the iphone how they view sort of
Apple and Android in general I was very
interesting it's sort of hear the
opinions straight from the horse's mouth
so to speak so I hope you enjoy the
footage and i'll see you in the next
video bye bye
some android-based tablet five inches
yeah let's connect my turn off oh oh it
came on and so you guys know about
mastering that demo Steven and I are
going to be walking around getting a few
of your reactions on videos you first
pick on the streak and interact with the
street sorry I so cannot be a real
quickly the development of Asia rounds
we try to achieve a couple different
things first of all what some people
don't know is we wanted to do this so
act as a funny we also wanted to do this
bit and the other part is we
wanted to create a great mobile web
browsing experience that showcase that
the web is the publisher independent so
one of the challenges on smaller smaller
smartphone or devices and look at the
web page they don't really always look
like they should on laptop but that's
good cook is need to find the right
balance of a large enough screen is
something that's all support so I want
to show you what kind of my
if you look here you've got this home
knock but I have at my house that I with
one cable to the TV and think about how
many you guys live in the city you
finally take suddenly work trying to
kill time
but it's the movies on here and your
home you having me like 20 minutes left
your movie you want to finish it if you
cook dinner sources one button but in my
gosh buggers to sabotage my so
that's right your you can watch it's a
great experience let's say you get like
you know refer to a movie but you really
want to watch rest of it by doing
something else one cut just one button
what resolution does it export 720p
another something sure can't go higher
this is actually for about a thousand
people from the phrase is racer master
it were provided a unit as a beta tester
and so we did is we completed customers
dude so if android window that you can
have multiple home screens right you can
customize them with whatever pictures
you want or widgets applications so for
this to get a thousand people some
idiots and you complete your custom
honest with their pictures but then
crossing the finish one videos of them
running hey this was a this is a new
segment that the kmt here Houston taped
a Tiny's was
so what my actual creative things that I
use this for is it's my navigation my
GPS device in my car we have you know
accessories like a doctor
can you teleconference attend to but can
you skype with it too I got a conference
well we're talking to another guy
communications companies we're not ready
to kind of all of our partners it does
have a front facing than ever there
right yes are facing eg a 5-megapixel
what's the process Qualcomm Snapdragon
does it support flash it will it a
little support flashed end up the one
when frodo comes out so one of the great
things about devices you can buy two
it's not have all the great you know
technology do for you that you want
today but it's going to be prepared Wow
so some of those devices you by then it
simply updated it you know in a month
right this will support all over the air
update so when the carrier pushes out
the android update froyo which is to do
doc too i think then this will support
and then flash 10 dot one is dependent
on freud so you'll be able to get those
updates right resolution video yeah
Wi-Fi yes sorry Wi-Fi bluetooth I have
my stick right here something for
right now handwriting recognition now
it's a pets classic if we do want to
harkins mushrooms there there are apps
sure your ass bro street is there any is
there to catch ya on the side so there's
our pots so touch the homeowner in turn
can feel it so on the front you have
your back button your menu key and your
home fighting so it's a real quick if
you get like five windows in my skin I
came up screams quick touch when today
they're cool buttons is just like on
your web browser works tab browsing on
you can open up
close one browser down to go surgery or
something else true it's you know you
can be browsing talking the fun at the
same time you don't have to close one
and then I so you've got a good
marketing going down much how many
thousands of apps occurred there queuing
up about an extra 10 grand ten thousand
thousand month or something like that so
it's growing incredible developers are
on board this credits the first one I
know internationally it's been picked up
by international carriers is any carrier
announcement in the US they're all be
later this summer so so May twenty-fifth
we launched with 0 tues the carrier in
the UK and carphone warehouse's the
retailer so you can buy off Oh to calm
the two retail stores or the carphone
warehouse burrito okay or online and I
mentioned to to my audience that I was
coming to look at gels my building I had
a few questions that I promised I would
ask ok so the first one that I would ask
is is dell planning on entering the
mobile space permanently and it's been
served little forays here and there is
Della something that Dells committed to
wear here we have a whole business unit
called communication solutions group
that that all these devices are coming
and the next question they want to ask
is how does the dell team view the
iphone 4 and head of a few sort of
apples design as well then what
cocktails so the question would be
considered a product like the iphone 4
to be direct competitor or something
like this or is it something that's in a
completely different markets here and
what what market are you trying to
target with it sort of seems like an
in-between well though I just
like I said before we really wanted to
create a product that that was capable
of providing great web browsing
experience but also what you don't see
in some of the other tablets is the
ability to do this to making phone calls
and okay if I mean it's the form factor
and the weight really great on you hold
this product and play with it larger
tablets that are coming out now that
they're heavy hearted whole so the
emotion days or whatever taxing and this
one factory things really right
typically you see this is a ultra high
resolution display you can see a full
web page on the on the display so skinny
scrolling what's the screen resolution
and does it have an accelerometer yes
yes so it'll turn as you return
okay and I won't do this doing here cuz
it always scares me and I know it's be
able to do it but it does have what's
called gorilla glass so it's super
resistant to scratches and I've given
the demo probably about 20 or 30 times
in it I you know I've only got so many
four-leaf clovers in that pocket not I
just prefer oh this is this is my house
it's a yeah it's great i know some of
the guys that work on the product team I
mean they take pens and they're just
jamming people are what are you doing it
again this really is a whop whop whop
said you know you can get fun too I mean
it's really optimizer I'm did it first
invoice second whereas you know if you
want something smaller silence your
phone we've got smarter close to have
you over here than I can pass around as
well and it is this is the first in the
streak product line correct so you know
we're continually investing and looking
at others you know the reform factors
depending on what the usage needs are
that we hear from folks like you and end
up in our carrier partners you know
we'll continue to monitor them feedback
and and it's team that the mad scientist
over here will definitely cook something
up there so I'm a mystic with dessert
street date in the price for it later
this summer in us it's already available
in the UK okay we haven't what do you
want you paid first you know to be a
number of reasons we've had a
relationship with o2 for quite some time
it was back in December actually
telefonica which is their current
company but i think what folks need to
remember though is a global company
right and depending on the carrier in
the region and the government rules
there are a lot of different cycle
comments for getting a certified through
the equivalent of FCC here or the
carrier's also want to make sure their
customers have a great experience so
they may want to put it in their labs
for you know anywhere from eight to 16
weeks whereas different carriers may
have digital my time so it's really
combination with many things done where
we want to launch its just like fisting
time this is this is a global product
ready you're going to see it show up
every Coosa I bet idea probably 15 to 20
25 emails a day from focusin in France
and Germany and Singapore everybody
except we're doing sport I I know there
isn't a carrier announcement yet but the
unlock device does support AT&amp;amp;T 3g
networks in the US correct I have 18 x
18 too soon in here right now some folks
that are on our beta team I think
they're under G t-mobile 0 this what
soda okay will be sold unlocked or just
carrier yeah it really depends when we
make those announcer to make those
details right but also I mean if you
looked at if you look at like 02 you can
buy the product without without a
contract it's it's not unlocked without
so you can't think to the carrier's stop
x 42 but you know again
you guys know I would say like pricing I
was interested in pricing that again
will be announced when we make our nest
occur in the US but I know with our
partners 02 depending on the contractor
by others there's some contract options
where the device actually they it's free
if you you know if you and I think it's
349 369 pounds out of contrast which we
floated about something
