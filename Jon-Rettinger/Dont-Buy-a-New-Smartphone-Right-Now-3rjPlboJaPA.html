TechnoBuffalo PSA I get a ton of emails
and comments on YouTube and the biggest
question I always get is which phone
should I buy should I get this phone
over that phone should I wait
so we're doing a PSA so I can answer all
these blanket questions now is a really
bad time to buy a phone now being like
the middle of January 2017 very bad time
with the one caveat for gonna buy an
iPhone then buy an iPhone now is a fine
time it's after September go go buy an
iPhone it's looking at anything other
than an iPhone don't do it right now
wait a little bit here's why Mobile
World Congress is coming the end of
February we're expecting new phones from
Sony's Xiaomi hallway we're expecting
Samsung to announce the s8 although they
said that's going to be coming sometime
in March or April the g6 is coming
there's a ton of new phones coming out
like especially huge amount of new
phones coming out and getting announced
over the next three to five weeks even
if you don't want to buy one of those
phones the previous phones that are out
now most likely will get a discount you
don't want a g6 g5 is gonna have a sale
probably the V 20 as well new
technologies are coming wait to see what
it is see what just counts come on
existing hardware or maybe something's
going to strike your fancy it should be
a ton of new stuff move where Congress
highlights I think are going to be the
g6 which looks to be absolutely baller
LG appears to have ditched a modular
design from the g5 which is probably a
thumbs-up good move in favor of a
metallic lose the liter true awesome
build Xiaomi and hallways would be
bringing the Thunder as well then a few
weeks after that we'll finally see
Samsung's Galaxy s8 which now is an
eight point test for batteries to make
sure it's not going to explode
so moral being do not buy a phone right
now don't do it
wait I know it's tough you keep
scrolling and reading articles and
watching videos on the phones I do the
same thing and I want to buy it I want
that immediate gratification but you'll
be rewarded if you can just wait a
little while trust me
hi I'm John render from TechnoBuffalo
one in three people are afflicted with
buying stones too early a ptosis of
wouldja per conversations with loved
ones don't have to call ex-girlfriend's
to let them know

really bad time this has been a message
from your friend John render</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
