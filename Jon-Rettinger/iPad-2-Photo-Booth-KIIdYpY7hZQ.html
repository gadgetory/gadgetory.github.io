lost in the desktop shuffle of OS 10 is
photobooth at least if you're like me I
played it that once thought that was
cool and probably never looked at it
again
well photo booth is making a comeback on
the iPad 2 let's go ahead and take a
look and see what's new so it opens up
and you're greeted with 90 chases and
they're also running here simultaneously
the a5 processor and the 512 megabytes
of RAM handles us without any problem
lag or stutter let's take a look at what
your night choices are one is a thermal
camera and any of these choices you can
switch to the rear-facing camera so
there we've got for Mercedes again as
their subject this one sort of conveys
thermal imaging or like thermal imaging
would look like the next one Mir sort of
mirrors yourself so you can have it say
kissing myself you could have two heads
weird looking hands you know whatever
you want you have ton of fun choices
next is x-ray sort of makes you look
like an x-ray and make your eyes look
really creepy in your mouth looks gross
next you got platta scope sort of puts
you right in a kaleidoscope looking from
you can move around whatever you're
doing normal is normal that's up to you
what that one's going to look like this
is probably we're ready to see a lot of
Facebook picture people holding this
thing up
maybe the piece is on next we've got
light tunnel which sort of puts your
face whatever's in the middle right in a
light tunnel next we've got squeeze
which is going to do nothing for your
ego make you feel probably a little bit
bad about yourself third ago my nose
looks tiny my chin looks gigantic and my
head looks like it's deformed we've got
twirl which is going to twirl your face
you can make your eyes kind of look like
the Masters scream if you get it just
right or like I got Picasso painting for
me to post modern era next we've got
stretch which will stretch your head and
probably not make you feel good about
yourself either gonna make your head
look like it is
completely square and again you could
switch this around and now we can sort
of make fun of for Mercedes and again
you can use this for whatever you can
like front or rear cameras this has been
a very very quick tour an overview of
photo booth which comes built-in and
free on every iPad 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
