TechnoBuffalo here I get a lot of
questions about iphone and ipod touch
applications so i thought it could be
fun to show you what i have on my iphone
this is my daily phone it goes with me
everywhere I go it's my main
productivity tool so let's go ahead and
get started the first thing is I've got
an awful sense of direction I get lost
going anywhere so for me AT&amp;amp;T Navigator
is a must it is a five dollar month
subscription fee but it's worth every
penny just to have the peace of mind to
know where I'm going I've been really
happy with it twitterrific is my main
Twitter client for the John for lakers
account the echo phone is the twitter
client that i use for the TechnoBuffalo
twitter of course facebook app store and
things is a great application for
keeping track of to-do lists there's a
desktop client you can get for the mac
and they sink back and forth when you're
on the same Wi-Fi network I've got a lot
of stuff to do as i'm sure you do and
sometimes i forget about them so things
helps me keep track of well things I
gotta do let's go ahead and keep moving
let alone um we've got a I am I don't
really use it that much but it's nice to
have what I wanted a 12-c is a a
financial calculator comes in handy
sometimes anonymous it's a sort of a
secondary a web browser i use it just
for demonstration purposes balloon bash
is a fun sort of balloon bubble popping
game I used to play it all the time and
played it in a while but I keep it on
here just in case I ever get bored we've
got my fan teams you guys know I'm a big
sports guy use that to manage all of my
fantasy sports teams I knew fantasy
basketball and football and baseball
when it's in season so that's what I use
to manage everything camera zoom I think
I did a video on that adds a bit of a
digital zoom to the iphone 3gs is a
camera Wells Fargo lets me manage to my
banking online and voice is a kind of a
fun application that changes your voice
around we've got a ton of different
choices you can make yourself sound like
Darth Vader or really ton of different
ones actually i'll show you real quickly
what that looks like it's sort of a fun
application i think it's like a buck or
something
you can pick all these different voices
that you want to sound like and you just
sort of record something kind of neat
alright so let's keep moving along
there's a lot to cover movies I love
movies and this is a great way to see
what's playing it gives you some some
reviews on it you can view trailers free
application is quite handy net chair
which was an application that was
released on the app store for I'm just a
brief period of time essentially what it
did was allow you to you to share your
connection doesn't really work anymore
at the 3gs I just kind of kept it on
here just for to remind me of a better
time navigon that's another GPS solution
that I've been using and testing this
one is maps are stored locally on the
device so there's no subscription fee
it's a one-time purchase i believe it's
something like 80 bucks and it works
just like any other turn-by-turn gps
navigation device fieldrunners is a fun
stour defense game Frogger of course
everybody knows froggers play that all
the time as a kid I disc lets me manage
my mobileme idisk from my phone and
access files we've got I am plus light
which I use for you know google chat and
things like that kindle which is quite
obviously an e-book reader that amazon
offers for the iphone it syncs up using
Amazon's whispernet to sort of keep
saying to where you are page wise with
your kindle and on your iPhone although
reading on an iphone is really small and
it hurts my eyes so I don't use that
very often locator is a fun way I made a
video about this to locate all the pervy
sex offenders in your area you can
search by address or contact address and
hope a picture of them and give you a
map store the located if you've got kids
or anything it's a good thing to know
you know who's around you and if you are
a sex offender you can find people of
like minds I guess um megaman light sort
of a fun Megaman game it's a thinks
Megaman 2 and it pulls it controls up on
the screen is kind of hard to use a
d-pad and a and B buttons without
actually physical buttons but it does
work ocarina that's I've demonstrated
that in video before it's by smule lets
you get a play an ocarina you blow into
the microphone port and a bunch of key
show up on the screen it's kind of neat
sort of fun my favorite application
for the iphone and I've done probably
two or three videos on this one it's
free it's a game called tap defense and
I play that all the time it's such a fun
game it's getting a little annoying
they're kind of making you download
other free applications in order to get
access to new content but the game is
just a lot of funds tower defense game
if you're into those and you want sort
of a light way to to waste some time if
you need to it is just a really really
fun game I can't recommend it enough
that's called tap defense we've got
labyrinth 3d it's just a labyrinth game
from using the accelerometer Pandora of
course is internet radio pandora is
really vickers at this point and we've
got a video of the application i
demonstrated last week remote tap which
lets me remotely access my imac we've
got a few more here to go through a hero
of sparta serbs the fun game to play
monopoly I'm big into board game so it's
fun to have monopoly you can play a
friends over Wi-Fi remote lets me
control my itunes or really any other
music library stored on my mac on the
same Wi-Fi network doom resurrection
first-person shooter game for the iphone
sort of in the old doomed fashion sonic
one it's the initial Sonic the Hedgehog
game it's a lot of fun but a little hard
to control with the iphone speed test
lets you do a full speed test on your
iphone either using your Wi-Fi or your
3g or edge network depending on what
you're on sodoku it's a sudoku game tap
word is pretty much the same as the game
boggle pulled a bunch of letters and you
get to sort of make words out of them
Tris is a free version of Tetris I don't
believe it's on the app store anymore a
uniwar sort of a turn by turn game that
you play with friends it's fun sort of
Stratego ish urbanspoon great way to
sort of learn about new restaurants and
gives you a restaurant ratings and
reviews and can randomly select places
for you to go in your area wolfenstein
RPG I bought that I played it once
thought it was stupidly boring I don't
know why it's on here I'm actually been
flipping it now never play it deletes

zillow which is a application for
looking at real estate
houses and apartments and condos and
things police radio foot to actually
listen in to the police bands you can
hear what's going on in your area or

red laser i think i did a video
demonstrating how that worked it's a
barcode scanner and a Family Guy game

got just a few more here battery magic

diagnostics on your phone what helps you
maintain optimal battery life and shows
how much time you have left with
different things you can do you can see
your device if you're playing just games

left it is handy I don't use it as often
as I probably should I believe that when
you have to pay for I cute with just
sort of free IQ test out it's very
accurate but fun questions looking for a
way to work out your brain it's a good
way to go SPG that's a starwood
preferred guest for starwood hotels cut
hut that is a cut hut bookmark takes me
right to the cut hunt web app we've got
TM wars that's another tower defense
game I don't play it that much but you
can tell i really like tower defense
games such as another option I've got
for free and that is sort of a connect
four game it's a free alternative to
think the paid connect four works just
the same as a lot of fun snood is
quickly becoming one of my new favorites
I used to play snood all the time when I
was in college and it's fun to have seen
on the iphone it translates really well
as how it works so if you're big fan of

must buy and then tap sodoku is just
