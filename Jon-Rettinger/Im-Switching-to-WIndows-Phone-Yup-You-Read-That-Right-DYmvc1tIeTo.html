John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo a
year from time to time like the check-in
just say hi and let you know what's
going on with me personally and what I'm
carrying gear wise and what's sort of
grace in my pocket I have the very
distinct privilege and honour being able
to play with pretty much every phone out
there on the market you guys obviously
know I love phones so I get a chance to
try almost everything that comes across
my plate
I've been primarily an iPhone user since
2007 before that I used blackberries I
had a couple and then before that just
you know regular Nokia flip phones and
intermittently I have used Android for a
little while I had a brief fling with
blackberry with the 9900 then ultimately
I went back to the iPhone with the
iPhone 4s I know I still forget the
iPhone and iOS is a very elegant really
easy to use and understand the bull
operating system I think for a lot of
people it's the best choice out there
but for me it's still becoming very
boring I think that probably has to do
with some of the hardware stuff as well
the iPhone 4s exactly the same as the
iPhone 4 before that so yeah there's a
little bit of speed improvement and
better camera there's been some software
improvements obviously with iOS 5 I
ranted a little bit about the previous
notification systems and iOS 4 and
earlier and that's been fixed and there
are some sort of cool things that iOS 5
has but for the most part I just become
very bored with it the screen size has
become a little bit too small for me
seeing all these larger phones a little
bit bigger screens something that I
found that I was missing so when I got
the HTC Titan in to review boys actually
you guys check out the videos from way
back I've always been a big fan of
Windows Phone but I never really could
use it as my daily driver it was missing
a few things that I really needed
previous tamango the first thing that I
really needed was a unified inbox you
know to have one inbox for all my email
was really important
for me to have and then some sort of
multitasking it was just too hard to
navigate an operating system without any
multitasking you know I'm probably like
you do a lot on my phone so when the
Titan came in with its monster four
point six five inch Greta Lucy by the
way a french bulldog puppy I was really
excited to give it a try and the more I
use it the more I liked it actually
something doesn't slide this up this is
not very technical I'm not pushing the
camera down just want to show you
Windows Phone 7 so it's got a pretty low
resolution 480 by 800 a lot of people
get really caught up on specs and I'm
probably one of them you know whether or
not it's dual-core 1.2 or 1.4 if it's
the Exynos chip set or whether not its
Qualcomm feeling it's 512 gigabyte of
RAM or a gig of ram for a lot of phones
that matters and I think Android in
particular specs really influenced the
user experience because you can do a lot
of customization with Android so you
look at something that's maybe a bit
more processor and RAM intensive like
TouchWiz on Android you're gonna want a
phone with better specs get that better
user experience I look at something like
Android that's really vertically
controlled so Apple controls the
operating system the hardware you're
gonna get user experience that's
tailored you know just for that
particular device but you're a can get
any choice with device or customization
because that's very much controlled in
the walled garden
Microsoft has taken kind of that
approach and so because this is a little
bit of a lower resolution screen at 480
by 800 things just look big I took a bit
of a tangent there I was talking about
the resolution I like the lower
resolution screen you can see the same
amount of tiles here you can on pretty
much every other Windows Phone device
out there but they're gigantic
which is awesome my eyesight from
staring at monitors your phones whatever
is getting worse and worse often times
that I'm not filming I'm sitting here
like this and I feel like my dad or my
grandma or someone old looking it's
definitely I gotta hold it out here like
squinting to see it um I'm taking stops
out on fuels I'm also getting gray hairs
you can see I'm on the side okay that's
angle kind of sucks
not so good but I'm getting old and I'm
also digressing
I love the lower resolution giant screen
here on the Titan I also really am
liking the whole Windows Phone
experience my biggest concern in
thinking about switching to Windows
Phone 7 was apps most of the apps I use
actually are in the Windows Phone
Marketplace or if they're not have an
equivalent so this one's that I use all
the time obviously Facebook has a really
good app for Windows Phone Netflix is
here Kindle is here there's a visual
voicemail application I haven't tried
yet called magic mail that was one thing
I thought Windows Phone was missing was
a visual voicemail option so hopefully
that application will work so I've got
Netflix pocket recorder you can see some
of them here out of the camera angles
reflecting it or not
YouTube's whatsapp I use quite a bit for
text messaging and that's here Twitter
you know obviously you can see my live
tiles that I got going on I do it it's
funny there's a dedicated Google search
application because the search built-in
here is Bing I really like being all
that much something able to have
dedicated Google panel on here it's
quite nice the live tiles are really
handy and not all applications take
advantage of them yet whatsapp which
they only work on mango does take avenge
you get a counter there that'll show you
have any messages that you have I do
love the People Hub as well which is
something that I didn't think I was
really gonna use so for example like my
wife I go right into her tile I can look
at it can see your posts I can flick
through it I can reply to things right
here I can send pictures right from
Twitter Google Analytics application is
really nice the camera on a Titans kind
of blah battery life hasn't been as
great as I initially thought that it was
using it on a daily basis and sort of
putting it through the grinds that I do
generally I'm at like 12% by time I go
to bed at night so it's lasting you know
for a full day I'm really liking the
keyboard there is voice in here that you
can search for it works okay
it's sort of an average but I'm really
enjoying the user experience the live
tiles here are great and actually
everyone that I've shown this to said oh
you know I could actually really use
Windows Phone I think the biggest
thing that it's got going against it is
that right there that actually has
windows in the title people have
preconceived notions about Windows I
know I did this sort of a random rant
video but I know I did about using a
Windows device and I was concerned that
wasn't gonna be able to get any of my
media on there I use Mac's I haven't had
a PC laptop or desktop in a while so all
my information is stored in iTunes
that's one reason that iOS worked so
well for me everything sort of sunk
together but there are Windows Phone
applications for Mac and PC obviously
that you can sync all your pictures on
you can sync all your music together
there's something called SkyDrive which
is sort of a cloud storage of Microsoft
has it'll sync all your pictures and
store them to the SkyDrive essentially
store into the cloud so I've really
found that I'm missing anything I'll
make you see Titan in particular
HTC puts something in here called HTC
watch which is will let you download
movies and stuff right on here I'm gonna
go and open it up um so you can see it
they have it on some of their Android
devices so I haven't really missed you
know all that much with it I think that
the power and lock button here is
incredibly reset it's a pain in the butt
to hit but for the most part I really
like this I don't have any intention of
going back to iOS at least as long as
the hardware is what it is as long as
the iPhone 4s is the newest phone out
there I've been really happy with
Windows Phone
I've tried obviously the Galaxy Nexus
and I'll talk about that in another
video but for me Windows Phone has been
really good so if you're looking to get
a phone you can see the video store here
a lot of stuff try it just pick it up in
the store and give it a shot I think a
lot of people gloss over it whether or
not they're looking for the new Android
device for that's looking for an Apple
device or even some of you might looking
for a blackberry people don't look at
Windows Phone very often and I just
really liked it I'm not Microsoft
there's no influence on me or the
content I just I'm really enjoying using
the phone I love the giant screen though
it's a pretty thin device despite how
big it is it's been great the browser is
really solid
no flash reports kind of annoying but
you know I'm used to that
obviously but things just work well on
it and the applications are really
coming along so give it a shot try it I
think you guys might actually like
Windows Phone 7 I definitely do and I
have no intention of switching and I get
a lot of question marks and people send
me email responses I still have sent
from Windows Phone as my signature I
haven't changed it I get a lot of WTFs
responses but I really like it so I'm a
walking contradiction I'm a Mac guy
using a Windows Phone I like what I like
what do you guys think have you tried
Windows Phone do you like it not like it
I don't hear you guys have to say
hopefully you sat around and watch this
video no special effects going on it's
just sort of a fun way to talk to you
guys John right in your deck no buffer
I'll see you next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
