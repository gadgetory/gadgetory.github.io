to you by jack threats welcome back to
the episode of ask the Buffaloes to show
you could ask me jon rettinger any
question you've got from the wide world
of technology don't know what phone to
get don't know what tablet to get not
sure if the new microsoft surface is up
your alley this is the show where you
can ask up this week we're gonna talk
rumors about a new iphone called the
iphone math we're gonna talk tablets
we're gonna talk cell phones everything
in between this disaster Buffalo it's
going to get started so our first
question comes from Jose yurius who
asked John what are your thoughts on the
rumored iphone Matt a good or bad thing
for Apple and its customers so China
times last week said a apples gonna make
a four point eight inch iphone that
sounds absolutely ludicrous from Apple
to go to 3.5 to 4.8 two generations is
not going to happen as much as I might
want it to happen I love the larger
screen phones certainly the 4 inch
screen on the iPhone 5s on the smaller
side of modern smartphones but if you
think Apple is going to go 4.8 and
further their fragmentation after one
generation I think you'd be sorely
mistaken if we have the 5s or the six of
route both sides to call it with a four
point eight inch screen that's three
different screen sizes to support it
ain't going to happen not to say a
larger screen size iphone might not
happen the future but I would not hold
your breath in what China x is tank sofa
don't enter question so next question
comes from hose hey john i'm looking at
the samsung achieve smart pc and the
Microsoft Surface I like them both but I
can't decide which one I want which one
would you go for well assuming you're
speaking about the atif which has or a
full Intel chip in it and not the
surface RT to speak about the surface
pro we had a chance to play with the
achieve at CES I came away really
impressed these demo units that are at
trade shows have been manhandled by tons
of people have lots of applications
going they're not optimized like you or
I would use a tablet keep on opening all
kinds of crazy stuff and changing
settings and this achieves smart PC was
humming along incredibly fast I could
it's one of the fastest windows 8
experiences that I've seen
now i'm holding off and what I'm going
to say about the surface pro until our
full review comes out but it's really
hard to vote against the achieve it was
really really impressive and just worked
absolutely well so if you're looking at
something that gets heard of a hybrid
it's going to be a good way to go we saw
a ton of awesome accessories with the
two we saw keyboard docks and all kinds
of other fun covers for it so if you
want a tablet but still want to be able
to do some power use on it you want to
be able to use Photoshop you want to
play some like gaming looks like it's
gonna be a great way to go this next
question comes from Twitter user at
probably two three four asks at John for
lakers do you think Sony can compete
with companies such as Apple and Samsung
in the mobile industry so Sony used to
have all their phones branded with their
partner ericsson those are gone now we
just have dedicated Sony phones we've
got the experience d the Xperia ZL those
announced at CES I had a lot of time to
spend thinking to the folks at Sona and
learnt something very interesting so
first I don't think Sony's released
cutting-edge phones those phones that
have it made it to the market right away
I'm thinking about the Xperia Arc some
of the other devices now when they were
announced they were certainly comparable
with other phones on the market so I
asked what they thought about that they
had septum very interesting to say
they're releasing these phones with
specs that are important right now that
are up to date having a hard time
getting them to you assures I followed
up with well why I dentally other phone
manufacturers are paying carriers to
keep their phones out of the stores and
to keep their displays larger and bigger
to make sure you don't see so many other
manufacturers I let's hypothetically
call this company fam some fam sung this
hypothetical comfy I just made up I
might go to the carriers pay them the
sum of money make sure their phones have
the biggest display ad to perhaps keep
other competitors phones from being sold
they can create incentives for the sales
staff at the carrier store to make sure
that those phones are being pushed so
despite Sony for example having some
cutting-edge phones it's very hard to
get them into market they're huge layers
of bureaucracy you've got to go through
in order to get a phone from you know
conception to being able to be delivered
to a carrier for testing and get it into
stores I despite the availability of
buying phones unlocked most people still
get their phone subsidized through a
carrier so there's a lot of stuff that
goes on behind the scenes other than
just saying hey Sony how come you don't
have your phones here in the US it must
be your fault and to something
sansom to blame does lie with sony they
merely slow on updates for their phones
oh we're also sort of told that the
carriers may have something to do with
holding off updates for some of the
phones but certainly the unlock units
there's no excuse to not get those
updates out so I all sort of a long
convoluted answer I do think devices
like the Xperia Z camp celui compete I
was really impressed with how it felt
and I'm hoping that we will see the
tread change I am perhaps see those
devices in the carrier stores in your
future hopefully that helped answer your
