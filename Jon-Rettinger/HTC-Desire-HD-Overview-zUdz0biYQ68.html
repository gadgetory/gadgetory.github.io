technobuffalo here with a tour for you
of the HTC Desire HD and an overview of
the new scent skin sitting on top of
Android that's going to be making its
way into a ton of upcoming HTC devices
let's go ahead and get started so
unfortunately I only have the desire HD
for just under 24 hours which is not
enough time for me to conduct the
thorough review that I usually like and
to run the battery of tests that I need
to do so this is going to sort us a
plant a review and just going to be an
overview of the device and its skin
sense UI sitting on top of Android 2.2
so let's run through the specs real
quickly it does have a 4.3 inch diagonal
wvga screen means got a resolution of
480 x 800 it's got on a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor it's got 1.5 gigs
of internal memory and 768 of RAM on the
back it features an 8 megapixel
autofocus camera with dual-led flash
capable of shooting 720p hence they sort
of HD name in it it's got a battery of
1230 milliamp hour so not the most
powerful battery got interestingly
enough on the most of HTC phones the
whole back actually slides off to reveal
the battery and sim card slot and this
actually doesn't the battery is under
this slot and your SIM card and microsd
go right under there kinda neat alright
so let's go ahead and start the tour on
first blush it looks very similar to
what we've seen on other HTC Sense
devices for example the evo 4g however
there's a lot more under the hood and it
starts with that little icon right there
personalized she go ahead and jump in
and you can pick a lot of customizations
now of HTC Sense you couldn't do in the
past at least for now it's minimal
hacking so you don't have scenes she can
go ahead and pick different scenes you
can download more from HTC Sense website
these are sort of just different little
backgrounds little skins that you can
put on here and speaking of skins
they're actually legitimate skins now to
change the way it sense looks and it
changed away those
on the bottom actually look so by
default you've got a menu phone and
settings but you can pick a sort of
different look so you've got the rounded
look on the bottom there you've got a
bit more of a jump back one more time
there we go I've got a bit more of a
modern look got sort of a metal look
there slate would I go ahead and get
more and download these stuff from HTC's
website I have a cool way to customize
let's go ahead and pick one and show
what it looks like let's go ahead and
apply let's go ahead and get some wood
go in the plywood and you can see it
sort of loads up there in the background
and now it is set interchanges to way
everything looks customization
definitely runs a little bit deeper I've
got a ton of widgets obviously and serve
the typical Android in HTC fashion and
some of them are new and sort of
refreshed you got a new tips widget a
Twitter widget has been updated search
anywhere is now on here and you can see
sort of what the rest of the options are
things that you'd expect from a modern
Android device go ahead and jump back
and go ahead and really much easily
select your custom sound set so for your
alerts and ringtones and the rest you
had a separate ringtone sing right thing
we've got notification sounds and alarm
you can all set stuff right here and you
can also go ahead and organize your
folders right from that customization
screen other than that it's pretty
standard sense you can go ahead and do
your sort of pinch to zoom and it can
jump to any of the seven screens that
you'd like so there really is a lot to
like about the phone it's on an
evolutionary revolutionary rather step
ahead for android HTC it's a bit more
evolutionary but I like the
customization options here you can pick
what you want it to look like in the
past you are limited with what your
device sort of look like out of the box
now the possibilities are really endless
this is probably very similar and look
and feel to what we've seen with the evo
4g in a lot of ways this is there sort
of the gsm version although
unfortunately least right now there's
not a version available that supports us
3g so if you live in europe or other
parts
world this sucker is going to be great
for you if you sort of been looking in
awe at the evo 4g but couldn't quite
have one for yourself this is going to
be a really good way to go let's go
ahead and pull this back it does not
have the front facing camera however of
the evo for gene does not have a 4G
network capabilities that the evo 4g has
it does have a pretty decent camera
sensor does a very nice job and I'd love
to go in and sort of show you a lot more
details about the phone my short time
with that unfortunately limits what I
can do and what I can show you overall
it's got great build quality the screen
is beautiful it's got sort of that
typical HTC feel to it lets you know you
have a quality device if your place in
the world where this phone is going to
be available it's going to be a hard one
not to recommend and definitely position
itself at the top of the line of the
Android lineup and I guess i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and this
has been a first look at the new HTC
Desire HD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
