Google Pixel 2 XL.
The not surprising sequels to last year's
flagships from Google, and in my heart I wanted
to love these phones.
I was a big fan of the last gens, the cameras
are incredible.
Throughout the course of this review I am
going to talk about weather or not you should
get these phones, if I am buying these phones,
and who these phones are for.
As we go through the different categories
perhaps you will find out which camp you are
in.
Alright so lets start where I always begin
my reviews with the screen because that's
mostly what you are looking at.
It's a 5-inch version and a 6-inch version
depending on which phone you want to go with.
It's a 1920 x 1080 panel or it's a 6-inch
2880 x 1440 panel.
Both screens look really nice this time around.
I was not a fan of the screen technology on
the last-gen Pixel phones but these look really
nice.
They don't get that bright but when you do
go outside you notice that they will work
in direct sunlight, which is quite nice to
say and also the black levels are incredible
as you would expect from an OLED panel.
The colors are bright and vibrant.
The whites are incredibly white.
On both phone I didn't have any soft of screen
bleed as you get often times if you look at
an all white image or an all black image.
So pretty impressed with screen technology.
The big things for me, can I see it in the
sun how bright is it going to get at night
and how do blacks and colors look, and everything
across the board looked really nice on both
phones.
While I do love the screen, the auto-brightness
calibration is super wonky.
It's nothing I ever noticed on any other phone.
It was changing all the time when I was just
holding the phone.
If I was in a dark environment, it got too
dark.
If I was in a bright environment, it didn't
brighten the screen enough.
I had to turn it off.
Something's got to give, so hopefully a software
update will fix it.
Next lets talk about design.
This is a category that's becoming increasingly
important to me.
It a big way of how phones differentiate themselves
from each other.
How they look and how they feel.
Let's start with the Pixel 2.
That is not a pretty picture from a design
standpoint, with the Pixel 2.
It looks like it got left in 2015.
Its got gigantic bezels, its got that big
Pixel chin and I get that there big bezels
there and I also get that there are front
facing speakers now on the phone but those
bezels on the smaller device look almost inexcusable
by 2017 standards and considering this phone
is going to be Google's flagship until almost
the end of 2018.
It is becoming even harder to understand why
they would go with that really antiquated
design for the Pixel.
So it's a different story on the Pixel 2 XL.
It is definitely the better looking of the
brothers.
It's a way better looking phone, still retaining
the front facing speakers of its smaller brother
but in a way better package.
In fact, the bezels are so much smaller the
phone itself, despite having a screen that's
an inch bigger, is not even that much larger
than the Pixel.
A couple things that I don't like about the
build, and this is on both phones, you can
very clearly feel where the screen goes into
the body.
There is definitely a ridge there and dust
is getting caught.
I imagine they did that to make it a little
bit more durable during drops, so no glass
is going to be on the outside.
As you scroll your finger definitely hits
up against it and there is certainly a noticeable
gap you can feel with your finger.
I should at least talk a little bit about
durability cause while I was testing this
phone, admittedly without a case, I dropped
it on concrete and I didn't have any cracks,
scratches, or any issue at all.
So perhaps that seam along the device that
I was complaining about collecting dust does
protect the screen if you happen to drop it
on the corner.
So both phones have a texture on the back
that is kinda nice to feel.
I've been using glass phones for a while wether
it was the Samsungs or the iPhone 8 that I
had been testing before this, but it does
feel nice and no it is not fingerprinty on
the back of the phone so hurray there!
The fingerprint sensor is where fingerprint
sensor should be, on the back, really nice
and easily placed.
You can locate it quickly with your finger.
It is also going to respond incredibly fast.
So I think the big questions that I had as
I was using the Pixel 2, is this stock Android
anymore?
It used to be the Nexus phones and the Pixels
were stock Android but as things are only
coming to the Pixel-the launcher unique to
the Pixel, always on display unique to the
Pixel, things like that make you wonder if
this even stock Android anymore or is this
one of the skins or the UI that is put on
top of Android for the Pixel line.
I am not sure what stock Android is anymore,
maybe this is it but still unique to one or
two phones.
What do you guys think I am not entirely sure.
It used to be one of the benefits of using
a Pixel phone was you got a native Google
experience, now you're getting a native Google
experience that's tweaked and customized for
the Pixel 2, but those tweaks are really nice.
I like the always on display.
It's almost identical to what we saw with
Samsung and LG.
It doesn't mean it doesn't work, and it works
really well, handy to see information at a
glance.
I liked having that.
As you go ahead and turn the phone on and
start swiping through it you will notice the
launcher is different.
So Google moved the search bar to the bottom.
I get why they did that, it's easier to reach
with your thumb.
On top of that is your dock, on top of that
is things you can customize, and then on top
of that you've got the new At a Glance where
you can set things like weather traffic or
calendar.
So what that's going to mean in real world
usage is about 20% of your screen, you cannot
customize because you've got a gigantic Google
Search and then your dock on top of that.
Obviously this can be fixed by putting on
a third party launcher.
I am a big fan of Nova, but for the first
time in a while, I do not like the launcher
that comes with Nexus or Pixel devices.
It takes up way too much precious screen real
estate.
It's weird for me having that gigantic Google
Search bar at the bottom, especially when
I can launch the assistant and subsequent
search in a myriad of different ways by squeezing
the phone or long pressing the home button.
So that's personal preference thing, but for
me, the new UI tweaks, specially on the launcher
are a no go.
Other things that are new here, its got something
called now playing.
You have to turn it on, it's not on by default,
but when you do it'll show you on the lock
screen what song is playing.
I found it to be inconsistent.
Sometimes things worked, sometimes it didn't,
but I imagine that'll get better with software
updates but out of the box, it was kind of
squirrely.
Another things that's new to Android 8.0 is
notification dots.
I initially thought that was just a fancy
way of showing notifications.
I've got 4 unread messages!
But it is a really cool way to get information
in context with the app.
It gives you more information a badge count.
I liked having it, some of you may not, but
I appreciated what it did.
So camera is what's been the big deal with
the Pixel line of phones.
Google said when the first Pixel came it has
the best camera ever, and they said it again
when the Pixel 2s came out-Best Camera Ever!
I can't say it's the best camera ever since
pretty much every flagship camera looks good,
but man these pictures do look beautiful when
they come out.
There's a portrait mode built into here.
It'll blur the background and keep the stuff
in the foreground in focus.
It also works on the front facing camera.
I found when it works, it works really well
but there are times when it doesn't and things
look all kinds of strange but presumably that
will get better because of machine learning
but at least out of the box, it works like
85%-90% of the time.
It does look really good.
Speaking of looking really good, the pictures
coming out of this thing look incredible.
If you are outdoors in ordinary sunlight the
photos look gorgeous.
You're not getting the over saturated look
like you get with a Samsung.
You're getting really true to image colors.
Things look absolutely beautiful here.
Low light is another area where the camera
shines.
If you don't have that much light, if you're
taking pictures of your kids like I do when
the sun is down, it is really nice here.
So I don't have a shaky hand but often times
I am running raking video.
This has not only optical stabilization, but
optical stabilization and digital both at
the same time.
Things look really stable.
If you have a shaky hand or trying to film
while you're running, skating, or doing something
else weird with your video camera, it's going
to look pretty stable.
So battery is one of the few areas where these
phones differ.
You've got a 2700 mAh in the Pixel 2 and a
3520 mAh in the Pixel 2 XL.
As you would expect from pretty decent sized
batteries, battery life is going to be pretty
good on both.
I am very easily able to get through a full
day on both devices with almost 50% battery
life left, and that's with pretty extensive
usage.
A lot of YouTube browsing which you can do
in full screen this time, a lot of social
media, a lot of email, and just looking at
the screen quite a bit.
I found having the always on display actually
saved my battery a lot because I am not turning
on the screen a lot checking notifications.
That's probably why I am up in the 50s opposed
to being in the 40s, where I usually am, on
other device.
No issues with battery life at all.
Intangibles are usually where I make my decision
on phones.
What does this give me that another phone
doesn't and these Pixels give you a lot of
stuff.
You get smart storage, unlimited photo storage
with Google Photos, you get guaranteed software
updates.
They are priced pretty well and pretty competitively
compared to the competition, but there is
a lot of negatives here as well.
You're not getting expandable storage.
You're not getting a headphone jack, which
is mind boggling-especially on the XL considering
it is based on the XL which has a headphone
jack.
You're not getting wireless charging, but
of corse a really solid quick charging feature.
You're getting IP67 instead of IP68 like most
flagships have.
I am guessing one of those things is going
to annoy a lot of buyers and if you don't
care about any of that stuff you're going
to get a really good phone but if you look
at the competition-especially similarly priced
competition-the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL
don't really separate themselves that much.
So I said in the beginning I would answer
if I was going to buy these phones and I think
I would probably sit this generation out of
the Pixel line.
The sacrifices of expandable storage, wireless
charging and the rest that I mentioned I can
get with other similarly priced flagships.
So the Pixel line, is it for you, are you
going to pick one up?
Are you disappointed?
I want to know why you're picking one up and
why you are not.
Leave it in the comments down below.
We will pin a few comments to the top and
we will change them up so if you guys have
a good reason let us know.
Give the give thumbs up, we always appreciate
it.
