all-in-one video solution to instantly
improve the quality of your live streams
check out an EVO at the link down below
if the iPhone 10 was a person it would
be middle aged it has been six months
since Apple debuted their nachi wireless
charging phone I wanted to look back and
see how things have changed how my
initial review has changed with the
iPhone 10 so a lot of guys are still
deciding whether or not you want to pick
one up or perhaps are regretting your
decision or are super happy that you
bought one so let's go ahead and jump in
there's still a lot of things I like
about the iPhone 10 the biggest one is
the screen the screen has been
absolutely amazing for me from day one
until now
not surprising Samsung made the display
here but the way Apple tuned it is
absolutely outstanding there's enough
contrast in the pictures I can see it in
direct sunlight probably have a
high-resolution display from Apple I
love the screen colors text black levels
everything looks the way they should the
best screen from Apple and since the
iPhone 10 came out six months ago we've
already started to see the iPhone 10
clone start to hit phones with these
notches and the more these clones start
to hit from I'm impressed what Apple did
they know it essentially bends at the
display around the bottom of the phone
essentially removing the chin you see
all these competitors try to do the
notched bezel those phone sub Chin's at
the bottom so I'm impressed what Apple's
done with their design another thing I
like and I know that I'm in the minority
here and folks I've talked to in the
office and my own wife would disagree
with me but I've been pretty happy with
face ID it's worked really well in
almost every situation for me again
though I know that I am in the minority
here for that my wife's I've had to redo
her facial recognition
almost every two months it stopped
working the folks in the office here say
it hardly works for them in my
experience so face ID has been awesome
and made me not miss any sort of touch
ID at all I also got used to gestures a
lot quicker than I thought even going
back to an iPhone 8 with a button seems
a little bit strange the learning curve
is definitely there but it's not nearly
as long as I initially thought
and now that's we come to pull a second
nature to use the phone so this is a pro
and a con I'll talk about it more bread
you'd like the wireless charging is here
for convenience and the phone's been a
little bit more durable that I've
expected from typical phones and
generally I've got a case on it because
my toddlers are constantly ripping the
phone out of my
hands evidently server cracks on the
screen and no cracks at all on the back
and I've dropped it twice and I've seen
my heart like just fall to my feet surf
happens in slow motion
speaking of slow motion the cameras have
been really good I haven't done much
it's not as much as I thought I was
gonna do going to manual mode and
tweaking settings
I usually just shooting my kids in auto
mode and it works really well I use
portrait mode quite a bit more than I
thought I was going to on the rear
camera those the reason I want to get to
ten over the A+ doesn't have that
front-facing portrait I've really used
it all that much but one camera setup I
have been using lately is our new me VOC
camera you guys have probably heard of
it it's a one-stop shop live-streaming
solution lets you edit manipulate videos
as you are streaming live events it's
like a whole video crew and there's a
little tiny black portable package it's
really cool it's like different reasons
of the cameras frame to stream even pan
in different spots all without ever
removing the camera you can shoot all
your favorite places that you'd expect
like YouTube Twitter Facebook and
Twitter or even just save the footage
locally if you want another feature that
I have never seen before in a
pocket-sized camera like this is the
ability to automatically detect people
in your shot and create different
virtual cameras for each of them maybe
was even gonna track and keep people in
the frame as they move around and thanks
to its 4k resolution the quality is
gonna say super crisp and consistent
we've only connect reliably also through
a Wi-Fi or even via LTE we decided to
pick up the boost attachment you can
only increase your battery life but also
use a built-in Ethernet jack for a more
consistent connection looking for a
great and affordable way to improve your
live streaming or step up your live
streaming game check out an Evo and
because I like you you can save 50 bucks
the coupon code down below so onto the
negatives of the things I'm kind of
ambivalent about let's start with them
man stereo speakers I was super pumped
about it when the iPhone 10 first hit
now I could really care less new Myst
used to it but I don't mind them that
much and I mentioned wireless charging
in my positive section wireless charging
is still stupid slow on the iPhone and
I've just a countless Android phones
with wireless charging each one has
enabled me to turn the phone off while
still wirelessly charging at nights any
Apple phone has wireless charging so the
iPhone eats the iPhone
hens they'll do it and then sometimes
the night they will turn back on it's
infuriating I turned my phone off
tonight's a personal preference
something I like to do both the iPhones
hen I cannot wireless chard and turn off
I have to plug it in a small annoyance
on the software's I got the iPhone 10
and iOS in general I cannot understand
why Apple won't borrow some features
from Android like secure and lock I'm
wearing an Apple watch why won't the
phone just unlock when I'm wearing an
Apple watch why won't it unlock when I'm
connected to a secure Wi-Fi network
while an unlock when I'm at a
geolocation area where I say I'm secure
and gonna be me at the very least give
me the choice to have those options it
still annoys me with iOS and but perhaps
the biggest negative of the iPhone 10
has been battery life but our life has
gotten worse and worse me the more views
of phone or perhaps more accurately as
each software update tends to come out I
went through and checked my battery hell
if you go too bad or you'll see a beta
score there it's a hundred percent my
battery is still super healthy but I'm
about 15 to 20 percent and less into the
day than I was when I first got the
phone so I'm guessing that is software
incredibly annoying that that's
happening I really liked the iPhone 10
I've keep coming back to it after I test
Android devices and other phones it's a
really good phone for me right now
I wish the price was lower it's still
probably more expensive than it needs to
be
I wish they'd come out with an awesome
project red color they've gone for the
iPhone 8 line but overall the iPhone 10
has been an absolute winner
and despite harbingers of doom saying
apples not selling a lot of phones they
are selling a lot of phones their stock
price as of this filming is at an
all-time high so Apple is doing
something right if I could go back and
decide whether or not I would buy an
iPhone 10 I would buy it again
but it's not a perfect device nothing is
perfect so no those negatives going in
but overall thumbs up down
