German I am in Berlin at about 10 p.m.
at night for going sleep because I want
to show you the latest move away as
quickly as humanly possible this is the
make book X their made book family is
growing and this is a flagship for 2017
there's a lot of technology in a super
extend twelve point five millimeter
package so the first thing that I always
wonder when I see a really thin computer
is power usually the trade-off is always
been if you want thin you're going to
get a really slow processor now you can
option to make book X up to get the
seventh gen Intel Core I use there's a
process or none of that core and stuff
so that's also a wall way for that
there's also a lot of world's first
stuff happening in here and the one that
I think much about it generally think
that much about sound in my laptop
usually I've got headphones in but
you're going to want to think about the
sound in the X the world's first
notebook that Dolby Atmos certified and
these speakers that put out is previous
down they're kind of innocuous looking
but the sound is incredible we had a
chance to take a look at it in a display
area and hear movies and music and you
will not believe the fidelity of the
sound of something so thin so really
awesome that's always able to do that
I'm pretty clearly worth the dough Beats
or bring that out to the market other
world's first it's got a fingerprint
reader built for the tower but if you're
worried about security thing is
incredibly secure uh and perhaps the
most important one to me and it's not a
world's first something that is awesome
as a father and someone who is
legitimately ruined two laptops by
spilling stuff on it and you might not
think that you need a spill proof
keyboard because maybe you're better
than me maybe you're not as cavalier
with your coffee when you're reading the
news or browsing Facebook but still
proof keyboard which is awesome to have
because trust me that one time you need
it you're going to be happy that you got
it I'm thinking of keyboard there really
nicely laid out
Chiclets about keyboard and usually with
thin kind of the throw is not so good
it's a pretty decent throw and Yuki's it
actually feels really nice what will we
talk about how fast the SSD is so I
asked them ask
what kind of SSD unfortunately they
really went for fat is the PCIe SSD this
would go from off to ready to use in
about nine seconds it is nice you could
option it up to half a terabyte so five
seven twelve gigabytes you should have
plenty of storage and also plenty of
speed another crazy thing about this
actually used technology found in
spacesuits to cool the processor I'm
clearly no scientist but what I got out
of it was there's a material inside of
here that will change its taste
depending on the heat coming out of this
so it'll be like a gel and it'll be a
liquid to keep your computer cool what
that boils down to for consumer is it's
totally family so while your gel is
changing its state you don't have to
worry about hearing any sandwich which
is really awesome to have also hats off
the ball way for putting two USB type-c
ports on here one on each side one you
can use for charging and data the other
one is just for data and also it's like
such thing I have to mention now got a
headphone jack so each other computer on
here to be greeted by an incredible
almost bezel list display when I say
almost bezel is talking four point four
millimeters of bezel it is almost not
there at all and it's a 2k display so
2160 by 1440 and things look absolutely
beautiful in it a couple other things to
know it's also covered in Gorilla Glass
so keys you're worried about scratches
you should be okay it's pretty well
protected they spend a lot of time
talking about a unibody design and how
its sandblasted it just feels nice in
the hand this is not the only laptop
notebook that fall way launched at their
event they also launched the meets book
deep on the mate Book II these kind of
cool it's a tablet and it's a laptop you
can take the whole computer out with you
and get this or the power of a PC in a
tablet but also that really cool
keyboard gosh and put it in it's got
three pogo pins which is a new word I
learned through the presentation it kind
of just goes in almost magnetically and
you can adjust the hinge 250 degrees any
way you want it to have the best typing
angle I play the keyboard for a few
minutes and it felt really nice it's a
pretty cool option if you won't really
spin ultimate portability but Silvio's
actually do like normal person work and
also it's a great 2k screen you want to
watch
music just sort of consume stuff on it
so that's the ladies room hallway this
is when I'm probably most excited about
the main book X it looks awesome to keep
here that I think I can use a lot for
travel which is important I'm in Berlin
right now I want to carry a giant
computer with me so what's the thing
that's powerful you can put in your bag
but also have crazy good speakers this
looks like a really good choice so what
if you guys do a full review on it let
us know down below and of course any
questions you've got about the computer
well it's know I'll try and answer I do
the floor review so next time I'm John
Renick from TechnoBuffalo I'll do my
German friends a favor and not try and
massacre the language anymore
see you guys next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
