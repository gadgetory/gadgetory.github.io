well wherever you're at it's been a
couple weeks that last made a video and
wanted to give you guys some updates on
some things I've been having going on
and what I've been up to so let's get
started first thing is my macbook pro
computer has been amazingly saladin
eight months I've had it except I am
having one problem with it now when it's
on battery power when it hits about
fifty sixty percent computer just shuts
off completely um so I think I assume
it's a battery issue I'm gonna bring it
into the apple store and check it out
and see what they say Zane Beadles had
similar problems next I'm coming up on a
year at the computer and deciding
whether or not to buy applecare so like
you guys to let me know you think apple
care is worthwhile if you had problems
with your macbook for Mac Pro's that
you've been glad you had it where did
you buy it and never landed immediate so
you'll leave me a comment down below or
video and let me know second my videos
been a little spaced out on a personal
note i'm applying to business school
which for those at the united states
it's a master's program to get my degree
in business administration it's
technically called a masters in business
administration but most people just
refer to it as an MBA so I've been just
swamped and get all those applications
out in the essays applying to a couple
different schools in each one at
different essays so it's taking a lot of
time to get each one right and represent
me the best so in addition to that and
work that's kind of what I've been up to
mostly they give to everybody also for
the great wishes on my new little niece
she's doing great seen her a few times
held her actually gun and see your
almost every week and it's great it's
amazing being an uncle I love it numb
looking forward to it so those you guys
that are uncles or aunts or even big
brothers our sisters you know what I'm
talking about it really is just saying
just an amazingly great feeling I'm also
deciding whether or not I should get the
apple wireless keyboard I've got the
wired one right now but occasionally I
like to bring my computer out to my
kitchen and type and it's kind of pain
in the ass have to go down underneath my
table unplug the USB and bring it back
think about me be picking that up so as
you guys that have used it you know what
your what your thoughts on it so the
overall question just wanted to say hi
and give you guys a few updates so hope
you're doing well we've got some new
videos cooking that hope to get up here
soon and as always guys have a good one
talk to you soon that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
