TechnoBuffalo here for a while leopards
been my favorite cat but there's a new
feline in town Snow Leopard today Apple
announced that this Friday August
twenty-eighth snow leopard will become
available for all the eager mac owners
and perspective and potential owners so
you can pick up your copy of snow
leopard either in an apple store or an
authorized retailer or pre-order online
for 29 bucks for an upgrade which really
is a pretty sick deal of considering
well what other companies cost for OS
upgrades so this is quite nice so what
are you going to get with snow leopard
if you decide to upgrade here are some
of the highlights and a refresher on
some of the things you're going to get
so you're going to get a more advanced
and more nimble looking finder you're
going to get a new look and new features
in expose and statics you're going to
get much quicker time machine backups
which hooray for that time machine takes
freaking forever so it'll be nice to
speed that up say it can be up to eighty
percent faster so yeah eighty percent
faster you're gonna get faster wake up
and shut down Times awesome you're going
to get faster more reliable installation
are they saying it wasn't reliable
before I don't know you're also going to
get back seven gigs of free space that
you're taking up with current leopard so
it's got a much smaller footprint
getting all of that for 29 bucks you're
also going to get into more quicktime
stuff you're going to get a new
innovative chinese character input if
you're not chinese or live in china yay
more reliable higher resolution i chat
sweet you're going to get automatic time
zone set up automatic updates for
printer drivers easy PDF text selection
faster more improve Safari more reliable
disc ejects and more efficient
file-sharing just is you're getting to
some more reliable stable operating
system a ton of accouterments nothing
drastic that you got from the upgrade
from tiger to leopard but you're just
getting it more reliable sort of
more well-rounded OS it's also going to
be 64 bits so your system will be able
to recognize more RAM which is always
nice if you use Ram intensive programs
or processes 29 bucks again seems pretty
good are you guys can go run out and get
snow leopard on Friday you're going to
wait to see what people say are you
going to pre-order it from apple com
which they have free shipping by the way
or are you going to go to the store and
get it you have no interest one thing I
should mention though that snow leopard
is only going to work with intel based
mac so if you got an old Power PC Mac
laying around enjoy Tiger order a leper
if you have on it that's as high up in
the OS food chain as you're going to go
maybe this is enough to even push you
over the edge if you're looking to maybe
get a new computer now before snow
leopard comes out you can upgrade the OS
for just ten bucks it's not a bad deal
or you can just wait a couple weeks
until it comes pre-installed on the
computer and I guys just kind of wanted
to know what you think about so uh
pretty excited about it not excited
about it you give a flying crap
personally I'm excited I'm looking for a
more stable operating system i'm looking
for a more robust operating system i'm
also really looking forward to getting
back seven gigs of disk space all the
videos I might takes up a lot of space
so it's mostly sort out external hard
drives it'll be nice to have some space
freed up and for those time machine
backups yes for that anyway I will see
you guys in the next video for exclusive
