go to Hawaii and hang out with some of
the biggest tech youtubers on the planet
unfortunately we were all together and
not in meetings for like 15 minutes so I
thought it was too good an opportunity
to not just talk and ask them questions
so the video you're gonna see I wasn't
sure if we were gonna publish it but I
just asked him questions friends that
I've known for years this is probably
the most fun that I've had making a
video and that was kind of a cool thing
to put up before the holidays I hope you
guys enjoy this light-hearted video and
Happy Holidays to you guys and a very
early happy 2019 enjoy the random video
first one Michael Fisher ambushed with
questions windless what phones in your
pocket which none I left them on the
table how to keep the beard so silky
jeans genetics I really don't do much
but you do have to trim it every so
often you quality get too lazy how bored
are you at work I'm never bored what's
the most disappointing tech 28 did the
disappointing tech it had to be that the
red hydrogen bomb that sounds like
not doing too well man the red hydrogen
one red hide it from one I mean so many
high expectations and as a bonus is the
3d my most of the point in fact though
has to be the pixel three my god the
pixel three XL is one of the favorite
one of my favorite phones that I hate
seen I don't know what the designers
were thinking and with the display
cheese cheese cheese
Josh Vergara question yes macro cheese
mac or geez geez I'm Kido come Jesus
what's the best thing kugel did this
year is brought I don't know skip let me
come back to Android or iOS okay with
you for two days
what a bit right now it is the wall wave
mate 20 pro and that is because it's got
to get back but your opinion on Mark
Watson oh my god so you said he did a
makeup video once tutorial
most importantly tell me something super
nice about me can I need it today
Oh immediately dude I was about to say
when we were walking over here I was
like you know I've known you for a long
time this is the this you are in the
best shape of your life I gotta say how
does it feel to be one of the two oldest
in tech it feels rewarding especially
being with you Mac oh guys did your boss
know how bored you were at work yeah no
maybe what's the best thing Apple did
this year oh the iPad pro made it built
it and made me didn't fall in love with
the iPad again can you say how much
would you chuck which I could chuck wood
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if
a woodchuck could chuck wood Mac or PC
Google surprised you in 2018 the
boldness of taking Provo west to a
different level but then not doing a
good job with the pixel slave what
company disappointed you most as year
okay
and what's your opinion on David the
unlocker over the baby being loca Hogan
Austin source source what's your
greatest fear in life I want to say for
my first ward camera line was failure
but I don't think that's true
I think becoming dishonest with myself
Michael Fisher high five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
