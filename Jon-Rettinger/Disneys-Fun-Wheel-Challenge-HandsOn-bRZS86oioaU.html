TechnoBuffalo we're here at Disney
California Adventure Park we're here to
check out an interactive game from the
fine folks at Disney so we'll check it
out right now so the folks at the
Disneyland Resort invited us to come
check out the fun wheel challenge and
this game is a game that starts off
right before the world of color show if
you haven't seen world of color yet you
need to make your trip down now the best
way to that I can describe it it's a
combination of water lights fire bubbles
and a whole bunch of technologies that
just well to sum it up it's just pure
magic
I'm Jeff Boras I'm an executive Rd
Imagineer and I lead the team that
created the fun wheel challenge the fun
wheel challenge is a game of
follow-the-leader with Mickey's fun
wheel as the game board the wheel lights
up in different colors and sequences and
you try to match those on your device
the game runs before every showing of
world of color so every showing has an
opportunity for several people to
control what happens on the wheel the
wheel is the game board and that's true
but it also works with all the glow with
the show ears in the area as the wheel
lights up in different sequences and
colors so to all the ears around so you
can use them as your game board as well
you're playing against all the guests in
the area who want to play with you and
the one guest who wins gets to control
what shows up on the fun drill you press
a button on your device and it lights up
the way you tell it to we wanted it to
be as simple as possible so all you need
to do is to join a Wi-Fi network and
you're redirected automatically into the
game in your browser you don't need to
download an app or do anything so we
have lots of great ideas for what to do
next but right now our goal is to get
this out let guests play with it see how
they like and see what they like about
it and that'll help us determine what we
want to do next our bigger philosophical
goal gets it the notion that we know
that you come here with people you like
and we'd like you to spend time with
them and be engaged with them in the
environment around you rather than be
head down in your device all the time
when we make mobile things in our parks
that's very important to us so that's
the fun wheel challenge so next time you
come to Disney California Adventure Park
you might want to show up a little early
just so you can play the game for the
latest and greatest in all the tech news
check out TechnoBuffalo com
