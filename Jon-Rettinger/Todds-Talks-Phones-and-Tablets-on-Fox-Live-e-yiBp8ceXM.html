tech world because first of all the ipad
3 is all the buzz but there's a lot of
other stuff going on these days todd
haselton is with us right now senior
editor technobuffalo we love the love
you guys follow them on twitter at
TechnoBuffalo um okay before we get to
the ipad 3 sure what do you got in your
hands this is the new Galaxy Note 10.1
from Samsung it was announced last week
in Barcelona we were there on the show
floor so it's very similar to the galaxy
note that launched on AT&amp;amp;T there's a big
Super Bowl commercial a huge phone in
the United States now and so it's got a
lot of similar technology and the
stylist here and we can get it to work I
use a pen you use a pen yet so it's
about content creation for a lot of the
parts so you can take notes on the
device you can use Photoshop mobile to
draw pictures edit pictures stuff like
that so it's sort of something that I
see better used in classrooms as opposed
to or or people that you want just want
to be creative on the side what are so
than the iPad I don't know you know
we'll have to see what the ipad 3 is
gonna get an offer but right now this is
sort of what was new at the show among
many other things one of the things that
impressed you the most it was one of the
things that did impress me the most
because it's taking something that
usually everybody's like stylus why do I
want to stylus and now it's kind of
showing that hey you can use a stylus
for interesting things and it's actually
pretty fun the only thing I wish is that
it's stored inside yeah they didn't do
that no huh just like the phone um let's
talk about the ipad 3 because i know
that's everything everything soon hey
what are we hearing about it so today
there were rumors that just broke that
it's the 16 that could launch so
tomorrow's the announcement date they
kind of apples stole the show a little
bit during Mobile World Congress when
Eric Schmidt Google's chairman took the
stage and was trying to talk about
Android then Apple sends out a press
release from 6,000 miles away oh my god
everybody's turning their heads and
saying hey so at ipad 3 Wednesday the
seventh so now rumor this morning is
that it will hit store shelves on the
16th but it's still remember soul seat
did totally do that on purpose Rebecca
I'm I know we're hearing better
green things like that but same pretty
much same product well I don't know I
think it could be it's supposed to offer
better battery life although with a
quad-core processor among the rumors
that remains to be unseen too because
quad core is obviously going to suck
some power and then of course there's
LTE support supposed to be again hit
another store yesterday which would mean
it will run on AT&amp;amp;T and horizons faster
networks that 4g get a battery drain so
it could be a little thicker in order to
balance out right we did you hear that
tell us again about the quad core quad
course a quad-core huge that was also
big in Barcelona what it will enable I
think at first is better gaming but I
think right now you have the power from
nvidia tegra 3 that's the chip that was
mostly announced that in a in Barcelona
but you have the power it's just now up
to developers and software creators to
sort of see what we can do with that
right so you have enough there but we
don't really know what we can do with it
yet and I think apple will have to show
that on stage tomorrow and I think all
of these phone manufacturers that are
announcing quad-core devices are really
gonna have to show us what can be done
with that so quad cores the way to go
well I'm not sure yet because right now
we have dual core at the high end yeah
and quad core processors that were
announced in phones HTC One X for
example it will launch it as a quad core
phone in Europe but in the United States
it has to be dual core because the
chipset currently doesn't support 18
tease faster networks so it's sort of we
still have to wait to see you know what
can be done with quad-core HTC's
generally like I had to pack though
right yeah they've been really good at
getting ahead with the with the best
phones the fastest it was one of my
favorite phones when i first started
like when you know the cell phone cree
sorry yeah so um okay we're waiting the
air and what happens with this quad core
right let's talk though about this
notion that your phone or your tablet
it's pretty much good you really gonna
need one thing i think at the end of the
day right you're not gonna need a
computer at home and am at I laptop and
yeah right and there's some clothes two
fronts to this convergence so a company
called the Zeus is trying this with
their pad phone which is a powerful
phone that then sort of plugs into the
back of a tablet to then power the tab
and then you can plug the tablet into a
keyboard to create a laptop so that's
kind of interesting new way to do it but
then you have Microsoft's Windows 8
operating system which has a beautiful
tablet interface easy to use sort of
going after the the way Apple does
things where you don't have to think too
much to get what you need but then you
can plug in to two monitors get the full
desktop experience something that we
haven't seen before either so you get
power and ease of use depending on where
you need it cuz it's the power that you
were missing with the ipad right because
right I've seen people with ipads and
keyboards it looks like a little laptop
right but you're not getting a full
desktop experience and so what
Microsoft's trying to do is give you
that tablet experience and then the
option to plug in monitors and a mouse
and a keyboard and then use it as you
would sort of windows seven right now
with the full desktop computing
experience what was um what are some of
your favorite phones my favorite phone I
would say the One X from HTC because
it's so powerful unfortunately it'll
come a little less powerful when it
lands on a tnt yeah it's also the LG
optimus 4x HD another quad core phone
really beautiful display really nice
phone Nokia's Lumia 900 we already know
that's coming to AT&amp;amp;T the United States
they announced that at CES this year but
it's a huge announcement for Europe
because all of a sudden now they have
their own flagship product and Nokia's
always been pretty huge in the European
market all these phones trump the iphone
that's up to the user I think you know
right now I carry an iphone but I also
carry an Android device from time to
time and Barcelona it was great to have
an android phone because I was able to
star places on google maps it was easier
to get around something my hand my
iphone couldn't do and especially when
you get into these faster data networks
the iphone doesn't support them yet so
it's really want it's what the consumer
wants if you want these ATT or verizon's
I think there's so much unknown out
there though like I don't know really
the difference between the droid and a
iphone yeah I mean it's really about
playing with devices and Zoomer seeing
to find out what they want but as you
get more powerful I think we'll see the
reliance fall on developers and so
consumers will start to see hey I can do
this with my phone because developers
are saying you know we have the power
and this is where you can so what's the
next big thing I look for
ipad 3 really yeah it's gonna be huge
you know begin again one I think so I
think so depends how long the lines are
and what about these phones when these
phones come to the United States what
are you getting I'm looking at the Lumia
900 still you know I really want to see
Nokia get back in shape the United
States it's a beautiful device windows
phones a great platform I want to see
where Microsoft takes it but also you
know HTC One X is a beautiful phone too
so well then you gotta come back on
Thursday iphone 5 and there's the I
think that I've coming you're right so
again everybody's trying to catch up
okay I to Apple yeah yeah they're all
trying to sort of pre-plan what Oh
dapples gonna have and sort of get their
devices out first that people are
talking Apple still wins at the end of
the day though no think so when Apple
talks people listen seems to be right
yeah you know I heard the other day that
Ferrari is putting their new one out and
white because of apple products there
you go we're at the geneva auto show
this week actually to check out the way
ferrari Todd you're awesome todd
