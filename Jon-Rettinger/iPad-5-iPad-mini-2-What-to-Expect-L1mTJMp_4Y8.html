technobuffalo here the ipad event is
coming in its coming next tuesday on the
20 seconds so I thought to myself self
this seems like a perfect time to run
down you can expect from the ipad 5 and
next generation ipad mini jump calling
the ipad mini 2 let's go and get start
start with the big daddy the ipads the
first one seems obvious and a foregone
conclusion since we first saw the ipad
mini and that is an ipad mini like
design meeting it'll be thinner lighter
and a little bit more on the narrow side
so think of the ipad 5 it's just being
like a larger iPad Mini which makes
sense anyway the processor side we
should seeing the a7 chip or possibly an
a7x chip we should also see the
fingerprint accent touch ID and 802 11
AC which was oddly missing from the
iphone 5s we should also see new fancy
colors so say goodbye to black and say
goodbye to white and say hello to silver
and Space Gray we might also be like hey
gold iPad we've seen shells that are
revealing that those are gonna be the
three colors app was going to stick with
so expect those to make their way I'd
also expect the same retina display to
be there I wouldn't expect any serve up
edge in resolution until the next
generation iPad so really it's going to
be all about the design probably a
little more speed the 802 11 AC and
touch ID should probably be the big
change we might see a bit of an upping
of the cameras as well let's talk about
the ipad mini probably my favorite
tablet on the market i'm going to go out
on a limb and say we're going to have a
Retina display although it seems like
depending on the day there are
conflicting reports but i think we're
going to finally get a retina display on
an iPad Mini which means they'll
probably get a little bit thicker and a
tad wider which I'm totally okay with if
it means we get just the beautiful res
screen I do not think are going to touch
ID I think that's going to be reserved
for the iPad line new colors as well you
should have the space gray the silver
and the gold probably the a7 chip with
the a7x more than likely going to the
larger iPad design should stay pretty
much exactly the same save for a little
this if it does get that reten to splat
expected price thing to say the same the
size storage to say the same the
carriers to say the same if you want the
cellular version probably not going to
be that many changes going to be going
on to it'll be I think incremental but
that might not be the only thing that
Apple shows us we might finally see new
apple TV hardware not the apple
television set but you did that little
black box my family see some new
hardware to that might finally get a mac
pro ruby state what you're hearing is
going to be november a date and price
for mavericks which might finally happen
updated MacBook Pros seem long overdue
we just had an update to the macbook air
so they expect that to change and that
should be about it unless Apple wants to
throw everybody for luke and be like hey
galaxy gear your what diana isn't so
good you check out my apple iwatch
whatever it might be I wouldn't expect a
giant one more thing so do you guys
think you excited about this next
generation iPads I'm really kind of man
on the iPad 5 but I'm more excited about
the ipad mini escs I prefer my tablets
in the 7-inch variety but you might be
different so what are you excited about
not excited about do care do not care I
