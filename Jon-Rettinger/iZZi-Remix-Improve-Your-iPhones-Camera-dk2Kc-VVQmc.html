from TechnoBuffalo and we're here at
showstoppers 2015 at the Izzi booth we
are here with Jason to talk about the
new Izzi slim case for the iPhone 6 and
6 plus so Jason why don't you tell us a
little bit about the new case
absolutely well here's our 6 plus model
it's our new addition to the family
including the it's called the Izzy remix
it has 5 different lenses it has our new
lens which is our ultra wide-angle lens
coupled with a macro you also have a
fisheye lens that doubles as a polarizer
and then you have our 2x telephoto zoom
lens which now comes with a lens hood to
kind of keep away from some of the light
when you're done using it it kind of
fuses our dual layer protection so you
have your protective sleeve that fits in
the cavity of it and when you're ready
to use it
you pop it in when you don't want to use
it you just pop it out now how does this
differ from like oh yo Clippers say oh
well our system is kind of all-in-one
the versatility in terms of using it for
photo and video really allows you to
switch on the fly and get those
different perspective that you can't do
if you're having to remove and attach
your lens so I mean that's kind of where
you wing with this and I mean it's a
great conversation starter
so it's like hey check out my Izzy it's
super cool and you know I think a lot of
people like to show it off you know what
I mean it's a talking piece we're kind
of more lifestyle than we are gadget you
know so we really kind of foster the
community and that's kind of what we've
been doing now in terms of quality how
how did you guys improve the glass on
this new Izzy case oh well it still
utilizes the same high optical glass for
all of our lenses our ultra wide which
kind of gives you a wider field of view
is is really allowing some of our
shooters to really capture everything
now
so that's kind of one of the new things
and if you're shooting with reflections
and stuff like that that's where our
polarizing lens helps out as well
anyways that's it for this video guys
I'm mark on second from TechnoBuffalo
