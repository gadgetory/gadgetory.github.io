bit is what do I use to record my videos
I'm glad you guys saw me in bucks last
week I got a new Sony HD camera that's
obviously what I'm using to film right
now but what amazing is a tripod well
I've got a standard tripod that I use
for videos when I'm talking directly to
you guys but when I film unboxing using
a tripod be a little bit difficult
especially sitting at a desk because
they can only extend so far the legs
can't go into the desk so actually about
two months ago a company called Smart
Pot sent me their new invention that was
just coming out and I've actually been
using it ever since and I'll show you
guys what it is in just a minute
it definitely files them in the category
one of those things that are so simple
you know why didn't I think of it type
ideas it really is quite cool let me
show you guys this is it this is a smart
bot comes in a whole bunch of different
sizes and it's fantastic for unboxings
so it's got this little clamp at the
bottom you unscrew it attach it to the
bottom of your desk aim your camera back
to flip minnow attached to it right now
aim it I'm like and go a difficult
tripod instead it's difficult because it
hits the side of the desk but with this
you can actually extend it far over the
side of your desk we've got a little
bigger one too that I use when I want to
go a little bit higher and this little
arm can support a tremendous amount of
weight I've used it with the Sony and it
really just does a great job it's just
simple invention I'm really surprised
that it took something this long to come
up with it so again show you guys what a
just a clamp and arm and a little bit of
a screw on top and that's it you can
leave position it anywhere if you want
to film the video outside attach it to
the side of a roof can I use it mostly
for unboxings it's not going to replace
the traditional tripod by any means you
know certainly doing videos like this is
what I generally do and that's when a
typical you know three legs stand is the
best way to go but if you're arguing a
lot of unboxings and you find that you
can't move a position your camera will
or if you're using something small like
the minnow it doesn't have a lot of neck
that can get over a desk if you have a
big package the Smart Pot is a really
cool way to go
to look it up it's just called the Smart
Pot they didn't sponsor me or anything
it was just a product that I had really
been using I thought was pretty neat I
thought I could share with you guys
anyway just a real quick video hope you
enjoy it for exclusive content be sure
to follow me on Twitter twitter.com
slash John for Lakers I will see you
guys in the next video go back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
