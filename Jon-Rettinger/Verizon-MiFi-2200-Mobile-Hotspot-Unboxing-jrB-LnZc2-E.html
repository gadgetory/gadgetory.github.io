technobuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the verizon wireless mifi 2200
intelligent mobile hotspot so what this
does it will take verizon wireless's
evdo rev a signal suck it in and kick it
out as a Wi-Fi hotspot so essentially
what that means is you've got a Wi-Fi
hotspot anywhere you go so you can
connect your laptop your cell phone
anything with Wi-Fi you can connect to
this just as you would any other Wi-Fi
network taking it one step further this
also lets five people connect to it so
if you're out with some friends and they
need a signal you can have five people
hook up right to this actually is a
pretty nice concept and it's just about
the size of eight credit cards stacked
as you'll see in just a moment let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing and if
you're interested in one of these it
will run you 149 then a fifty-dollar
mail-in rebate so just about a hundred
bucks or you can get it without a
contract for about two hundred and sixty
dollars and you can spend about sixty
dollars a month for a five gigabyte plan
or I believe forty bucks a month for 256
megabytes I'm not a big fan of contract
so I think getting this off contract
makes more sense and certainly that five
gigabyte plan is the way to go it is
definitely expensive but five gigabytes
they say is about eight hours total of
streaming video continuously so it is a
decent size so since is an unboxing
let's take a look at the box there's a
picture of the device right there the
mifi 2200 you've got some stuff at the
package includes but we'll see that in a
minute another picture of the device and
that is about it let's go ahead and dig
in we got the obligatory knife for this
try not to stab myself all if I do I
promised upload the video there we go
okay but open it up and see what we got
I should mention that sprint has one of
these as well exact same concept it's
just white and their plans are exactly
the same price so here it is be mine 520
200 and it is actually very thin i'll do
a size comparison for you guys in just a
moment looks like it uses micro USB as
well which is nice that it's not a
proprietary port put that off to the
side dig into the tray you've got your
setup information no big deal you've got
your battery of size 11 hundred and
fifty milliamp hour battery and they
claim about four hours of battery life
with this which is quite nice that's
four hours with up to five people
connected you can also charge it via USB
using this micro USB to USB cable and
it'll work while it's charging as well
and then we've got a wall charger that
looks like we also have a little pouch
to keep it in let's see if this is a
leather pouch or what it's made out of
now just sort of a soft cloth material
nothing terribly fancy there and all you
have to do is activate this thing once
and it is completely good to go so let's
take a look at the size I'm go ahead and
move this off to the side it is very
very thin which is quite nice let's say
we want to compare it to a devices at
you're familiar with for example here's
the iphone 3gs you can see it's much
smaller saket on top it's also
noticeably thinner you could very easily
put this in a pocket or slide in your
laptop bag and always have Wi-Fi
wherever you are and this also comes
with full protection so you can use wpa
or a ton of other encryption methods
make sure no one else that you don't
want is hopping on your network so
there's with the iphone how about an old
classic here it is with the original
RAZR you can see it's pretty close in
size and lastly here is the HTC hero
so taking a look around the device we go
ahead and peel off the plastic no
whooshing sound it kind of like that on
a pillock classic from a new devices
you've got a power button with an LED
indicator light there and when you're
connected it'll blink to let you know
that you are hooked up and again you'll
need to set this thing up once and you
are good to go there's the battery door
right there warning remove label before
battery assembly okay so we will pop
this out and just like a cell phone it's
got a battery eleven hundred and fifty
million power battery it's not huge but
it should be pretty good it's already a
fingerprint magnet as you guys can see
and I am excited to use this be nice to
always have internet wherever I go so
hopefully it will be worthwhile and live
up to the hype anyway this is a jon
