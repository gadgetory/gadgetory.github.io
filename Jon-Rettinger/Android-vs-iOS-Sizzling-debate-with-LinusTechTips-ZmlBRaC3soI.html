little different I'm gonna let John kind
of explain the premise because I had him
on when show like two months ago it was
way too long and we were like yeah we
need to do a collab and then I was
traveling and then he had some goofball
Apple event he had to something or
whatever I wasn't there um now we're
finally doing it we are gonna have the
ultimate debate iOS versus Android but
John how's it gonna work all right
so we're gonna do this we're gonna make
this fun here's what we're gonna do so
it's about against the two months since
I was on Linus's show we want to debate
iOS versus Android but we figure instead
of one of us picking aside we're gonna
do a two fav style and flip a coin for
who's going to get what side and if you
want to watch my part obviously watch it
on on my channel if you want to watch
the Linus's part hit the link down below
and go watch it on his channel she can
get a better sense of you know what he's
got to say and we can run through
everything together so of course my
video is going to have all John's stuff
linked below as well we're doing this
live folks all right heads as iOS tails
is Android and we're flipping for my
topic we are flipping for your for for
your topic are you ready yeah all right
we're flipping for you're losing topic I
should say tails look a mix-up you are
going to be on the losing side of
Android and I am going to talk about the
glory that is iOS all right well um so I
will give the microphone to you and tell
me why somebody they're picking a phone
should pick Android and not even look at
the beautifully crafted workmanship that
comes out of Cupertino all right well
we're going to start right off with the
beautifully crafted workmanship which is
a big load of bollocks right off the hop
here because Android has a customizable
experience so you're not locked into
well gee what if I actually wanted more
than just a five by four grid of icons
on my home screens that I can swipe to
and from just like this and nothing
other than that with Android you can
change up your launcher
or you can throw an aviate launcher on
there i mean i OS did you see Tim Cook
on stage talking I don't even remember
who it was it was some some guy from
Apple doesn't really matter talking
about how now when you wake up in the
morning you can fire up your meditation
app contextually from the lock screen
how is that a feature there's two things
you can launch from the lock screen you
can launch your camera which by the way
on my Android device is as simple as
wiggling whether it's locked or not
walked what wow
oh so fast so amazing what innovation
and you can launch your contextually you
know sensitive app which who knows if
it's going to be right what if I don't
want to meditate that morning what if I
want to check my email what if it's
going to wreck my meditation that I
can't see my email before I meditate is
that innovation on the ILS side so part
of me feels like we should be doing this
epic Rap Battles of History style and
just like drop the mic jab yeah going to
do it like like like Tim Cook I could
they put some gray in my hair and do it
this is going to be a really easy slam
dunk debate so you know you said it was
so cool you could twist your Android
phone to launch it what if you pick up
another Android phone trying to us to
launch it is it going to do it
nope because you my friend have too much
fragmentation maybe one phone doesn't
maybe another phone doesn't let's say
you upgrade from your last generation
Moto X to a new Nexus 6 for example
you're like oh great I know how this is
going to work you do not know how that's
going to work you gotta learn something
brand new with every version of Android
maybe you're running something that was
two years ago operating systems are not
always going to be the same stories and
get the same experience on your devices
let's say you're stuck on a galaxy s5
for example galaxy s4 you're very
unlikely ever going to have the latest
at Google has to offer which means you
are like wide open legs spread waiting
for viruses I mean you just just come
come at me Trojans come just just just
give it to me
all you're looking at an open source OS
which means there are open source
problems customization always sounds
great in theory in reality your
experience is not going to be the same
yeah you can customize how if we're
going to go through and actually
download OS is going to tweak going to
tweak skins most people that get a
phones are out into the perhaps aside
use the
out-of-the-box experience a lebackes
experience on iOS is so easy and so
seamless and that's the beauty of Apple
provides and let's take that out of the
equation completely say you disagree app
experience so much simpler apps are
designed for iOS to work across all iOS
devices you pick up an Android phone
your app experience might be incredibly
far off don't even get me started on the
tablet experience there are not that
many tablet apps available for for
Android you get apps are designed for
iOS and beyond that you're getting exit
Lee crafted hardware you know what
you're going to be getting hardware with
with Android maybe you're gonna get
something from Huawei
that's made of plastic maybe I get
something from Samsung that uses a glass
you don't know the experience is never
going to be consistent maybe like
Android from one phone you might hate it
the next generation apple offers
consistencies you know what you're
getting you know it's going to work and
they also offer an ecosystem a seamless
ecosystem that's going to work you're
going to have continuity to answer your
phone calls from your tablet they just
make it simpler and simpler my friends
it's better so I heard a whole lot of
Apple fanboying over there I didn't hear
any valid points so point number one
that you brought up is that oh you know
the you know feature that blah blah blah
might not work on another Android phone
what if you have a galaxy s5 and some
you know what how excited were the Apple
fanboys when Apple started putting
accelerometers and gyroscopes in their
phone they were like oh my god now it
has a compass did they complain did they
complain that you know oh now I don't
understand how to use this compass this
is so confusing you know what they
probably did because their Apple fanboys
that is why the argument for a simple
pick it up and use it experience wow
this is just like my last phone what
tremendous innovation that's what you
get on the Apple side you get the same
damn experience every single time and
you get a last gen experience anyway
because they're innovating so much
slower the industry went okay we're
gonna have and you know what hasn't
always been that way there was a time
when Apple actually seemed to give a
crap about releasing a technologically
advanced phone the iPhone
or great example high screen pixel
density fantastic how long did it take
them to make a reasonable sized iPhone
after that they're like oh look we added
an extra row of icons it all comes back
to the icons extra row of icons Wow
look so amazing and then finally years
after the release of the Galaxy Note
they acknowledge people's desire for
larger phones and then they missed the
point entirely the point of the larger
phone is the more tablet like large
battery experience with which quite
frankly Apple has their head stuck so
far up their asses about delivering a
long battery life experience that I
don't think they're ever going to get it
they're just going to keep making it
better and keep making it so that you
have to DPS somewhere which let's face
it most Apple users are going to have to
do what actually figure out where
they're going today no they need their
phone to tell them that you're going to
run it about every halfway through the
day you're going to be carrying around
half a dozen stupid battery banks in
your pocket and what good do your fancy
shiny by the way more expensive apps do
you if your phone is dead I mean so what
I'm hearing from you is that being first
is better if that was true how's your a
new windows mobile phone working out
that you've been using we'd all be using
Windows mobile phones first to come out
was always better I would rather have
some that's going to work and work well
then be a beta tester for some new
technology that's so how was Google
Wallet when first came out everybody use
it immediately no Apple fine-tuned what
they needed to do and they got that
right when Apple Wallet finally came out
and Apple pay came out so now you can
actually use the technology instead of
just having it there and be like look
what we can do and you argument that
phones are going to die I would argue
that the 6 plus battery life is amongst
the best phone battery life out there
and you don't need fancy power saving
mode that turns the screen off and
limits functionality because the battery
is actually going to last you at going
into question whether or not Apple fans
can navigate using GPS I mean that's
just seems petty at this point and
invoking the fanboy name because people
prefer one over the other you know that
silly commenters do it and you all
'we say don't pick sides the side you
pick though I'm going to say it right
here is wrong okay so I have to address
being first to market not necessarily
being better I don't think either of us
could enter this debate and even managed
to defend Windows Phone in fact that
might have been hilarious we should have
had a three sided coin with one of them
being Windows Phone and that side should
have just said like the bitch of the
argument on it because you were going to
get owned regardless but like what I
think you have to agree about is Apple
prides itself on being innovative and
quite frankly nothing they showed off at
WDC was innovative in fact they even
made me look stupid because I thought
their window snapping feature one of the
huge complaints I had about OS 10 was
poor window management I thought that
exposing the rest of your windows to pop
up the other side was innovative turns
out that's been in the Windows 10
preview all this time so that's apples
fault clearly that I didn't know that so
what I'm hearing is you not wanting to
talk about iOS versus Android talk about
another topic because you know that
you've lost if you thought WWDC was
boring we're at Google i/o that I was
almost fell asleep i didint making jokes
that I had to pee the whole time on
Twitter because I was so boring they
were talking about you know what's
exciting let's spend 45 minutes talking
about AP is nothing sexier than that 45
minutes talking about AP is that's
basically all Apple did that's the nci's
Apple Daddy
if we're gonna talk comp that is all oh
oh no no Apple run okay Drake was there
the weekend was there they had sense of
humor about themselves
who cares if Drake is there okay hold on
a second Oaxaca go on UTIs for a sec
you're in Canada everybody loves king of
Drake and gather right innovation is
that you can make standalone apps for
the I watch whose screen doesn't even
turn on unless you do a gesture that's
that's innovation Google where has our
excuse me Android wear whatever it
doesn't matter
Google's Android wear has had apps
running directly off of the device since
ages ago and you should probably say
yeah they've had apps running directly
off the watch from ages ago but only
running off the watch
half today because then the battery's
gonna die I think you you know what this
breaks it down for me
does your Android phone that you bought
did it come with an anti-virus software
installed on it it doesn't need to I
have never had my virus most Android
phones come pre-installed with antivirus
should tell you absolutely everything
maybe on iOS that I'll give you you
can't customize you can would it's your
home screen I think that that's a big
flaw in the OS but Lisa I know when I
put in my bank information into my phone
then it's going to stay on my phone and
not end up in somebody else's database
somewhere else yeah that's what you
think smart guy I'm sure the NSA has got
it figured out in your American so
you're compromised regardless and what
you're gonna play that card oh it's the
NSA big scary we're talking about OS is
here iOS is more secure than Android
every day of the week every day of the
year you're to more secure operating
system okay so you're gonna pull up that
stupid Windows Phone low-blow fine then
why don't you go use blackberry smart
guy what whoa whoa whoa don't get hasty
hold on a second ball of the Sun don't
get hasty now now that's not necessary
I've Rosetta gasp we're done let the
audience decide young who lured the
audience decide so I think you've
clearly run out of ways to defend apples
shiny phones that only have one eye
climbeth all day Italy yeah buttons
because the OS is elegant you need to
throw a ton of buttons on there do what
you need to do the OS is elegant
you know what's elegant double tapping
the home button to bring down the the
one handed mode and move all your icons
down because they can't build a UI
that's actually optimized for the size
of their phone and on that note I want
to leave it up to you guys the audience
to tell us who you thought won leave a
like on my video which is linked in
John's video description and leave a
like on Jon's video which is linked in
my video description to let us know who
you thought won the iOS versus Android
debate and if you would like to see this
format returned drop
comment under the videos and maybe even
suggest some topics because I certainly
had some fun making this videos are a
blast - thank you and come vote on my
side for the more elegant OS and the
better hardware so that's how you're
gonna play it you're gonna act all
you're gonna act all gracious you're
gonna find you for participating I am
baking you and then with your fancy
pants xik wireless touch sensitive
headphones over there
you're gonna tell people to vote for you
well I'm gonna tell people don't vote
for a phony thanks for watching see you
guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
