to you by thrillist phones phones phones
a tablet and more phones it's techno
buffalos rumor roundup
what is going on everybody I'm Noah
Kravitz editor-at-large for
technobuffalo otherwise known as the guy
who talks so much poor John cuadras up
all night editing me down to size it's
Tecna Buffalo's rumor roundup for the
week ending today Friday August 26th
2011 this episode of the rumor roundup
is brought to you by our friends at
Thrillist it's all about mobile this
week and luckily the stock market didn't
plunge although there was an earthquake
on the east coast of the United States
crazy I hope everybody out there is safe
and sound and recovering from the
unexpected an earthquake on the East
Coast plenty rulers to catch up on those
so let's get right to it first and
foremost September first HTC is having
an event in London our own killing and
Bell will be there it's actually it's a
party it's a fan reader meetup kind of
thing so if you're in London you like
HTC phones I believe there's a sign-up
page on Facebook but Chilean will be
there covering what well apparently he's
going to be covering the new HTC windows
phone mango phones that's right a leak
earlier this week points to two devices
bound for US carriers one of them is
headed to AT&amp;amp;T it's called the Eternity
and the other is coming to t-mobile it's
the HTC omega the Eternity is said to
have a 3.7 inch display while the Omega
is a little more up in the air some
reports saying three point eight inches
other sang a whopping 4.5 inches which
would put it head-to-head with the
infuse 4g an android phone on AT&amp;amp;T in
the race for the largest screen on a
smartphone carried by a US carrier right
now the dell streak with its 5-inch
display was end-of-life little while ago
rumors about that nexus prime we talked
about last week might have a 4.6 5-inch
display but for now it looks like the
Omega could take the crown or at least
share it with you infuse 4g with a 4.5
inch display if that comes true whatever
it is will be there on September first
covering it live from London again our
own Killian Bell will be at the HTC
event so stay tuned for more on that
speaking of AT&amp;amp;T
katie's roadmap for the rest of this
year into early 2012 may have leaked
something leaked people seem to think
it's the official road map it's got a
whole lot of gingerbread and some mango
as well everything this whole lot this
whole show is going to make me hungry
after a second lunch / sounds the last
thing I need the road map does not
include our other favorite mobile
flavored food Apple oh it's something on
them in just a second but it does
include several Android Gingerbread
phones as well as a couple of Windows
Phone 7.5 mango devices the devices are
from the likes of HTC motorola samsung
and pantech with one of the highlights
being a samsung windows mobile phone
that resembles the galaxy s2 which would
be hot still waiting for the galaxy s2
speaking of techno buffalo's covering
events August twenty-ninth in New York
City Mike Pearlman covering the big
samsung mobile event where we are
expecting to see the u.s. variants of
the galaxy s2 so stay tuned for that but
a galaxy s2 look alike especially if
it's got similarly awesome internals
running Windows Phone 7 5 would be a
pretty cool thing if you're looking for
an alternative to the whole android vs
iphone horse race at the mobile world is
fast becoming any way you can check out
the whole road map over on technobuffalo
calm but again a whole lot of Android a
little bit of mango and a couple of
BlackBerry's to keep you AT&amp;amp;T
subscribers busy through the rest of
this year and into early 2012 speaking
of AT&amp;amp;T some photos emerged earlier this
week of what's believed to be the HTC
Puccini aka the jet stream Puccini will
be HTC's first 10 inch tablet computer
and also their first tablet to run on
Android 3 honeycomb if you recall HTC
release a tablet earlier this year the
7-inch flyer which runs on a version of
Android too that's heavily customized
with HTC's Sense user experience the
bikini is said to be headed to AT&amp;amp;T
later this year and will support 88 ents
new 4G LTE network it'll also sport a
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor 16
gigs of internal storage and all kinds
of Android goodness to keep your high
speed on the go touch only keyword lists
needs in
you know you have that one friend who
always hooks you up with the cool new
bands before anyone else has even heard
of them well Thrillist is like that but
for cool new stuff to do and places to
go want to know about a star wars
burlesque show a beer garden that
screens 80s flicks or a restaurant with
a sushi robot I want to know about the
sushi robot then sign up for Thrillist a
free daily email that sifts through the
crap to find the best new bars
restaurants events and services whatever
it is they promise it won't suck hit up
Thrillist calm / Buffalo and you'll
start getting thrilla sweet sweet
knowledge right away that I think
everybody should have that slogan
whatever it is they promise it won't
suck speaking of AT&amp;amp;T things are just
kind of segwaying so nicely this show
last but certainly not least a little
more iphone juice for you this week the
two wild cards who are always left out
of the conversation in America may have
something to say about the iphone 5
earlier this week or report came out
that sprint the now network will be
getting the next iPhone and then after
that a report the t-mobile USA may also
be getting the next iPhone now whether
this means iPhone 5 or the Rue bird new
version of the iphone for sporting eight
gigs of storage at a lower price or
perhaps both remains to be seen but
according to people who know analysts
who know sources to be revealed later
familiar with the situation Apple is at
work on the device it will be a
dual-mode gsm cdma version and
apparently either this one device also
will support t-mobile's AWS banning for
high speed data or there'll be more than
one version including a tmobile
compatible version now if you ask me the
sprint rumor has a little bit more on
the way legs in the t-mobile rumor if
for no other reason that t-mobile's
involved in this whole buyout merger
deal with AT&amp;amp;T and would be kind of
silly for Apple to sink a whole bunch of
money into a tmobile variant of the
phone if Tebow was just going to get
bought by AT&amp;amp;T who already has the
iphone anyway then again what do I know
I'm used to talk about these things but
the rumor mill says of course verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T now it's looking like sprint
and possibly t-mobile which begs the
question if you're in the US and you can
get an iphone on any one of the four
major carriers
which one would you go with and why ah
that's a good poll question maybe we
should throw that up on the site anyway
everybody's still expecting an iphone 5
launch sometime in late September with a
ship date of early to mid October
hopefully more like earlier than mid
whatever happens we'll bring it to you
on that website I keep talking about all
right that'll do it for this week's
episode of the roundup lucky for you or
at least lucky for me I'm also going to
be hosting asked the Buffalo next week
while John's off in Europe gallivanting
around needed a meet up at an apple
store in London thanks to everybody who
came out to that I think he's headed
over to Paris for a little while and
then of course to Berlin Germany to
cover Aoife with some of the other
revision3 personalities so while he's
doing that I'll be hosted ask the
Buffalo and then of course bring you the
rumor roundup again next week till next
time thanks again to our friends at
thrillist for sponsoring this week's
show thanks as always to John quach for
editing me down to size as best as
anybody can and thanks to you for
watching much much more information on
all these stories and all the rumors
bound to crop up between now and then
over on TechnoBuffalo com so next time
my name is Noah thanks for watching well
