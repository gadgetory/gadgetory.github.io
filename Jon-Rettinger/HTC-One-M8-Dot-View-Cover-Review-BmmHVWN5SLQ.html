to you by audible what's up everyone
John rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo
here a full review on the HTC one is
coming but I wanted to talk first about
what's gonna protect your phone and that
is the dot of you case go ahead run
through all the pros and cons and see if
it's worth you're about fifty bucks
so full candor I'm not usually a big fan
of flippy style cases whether it's
Samsung's SFU case or sort of other
third-party cases out there usually I
like to just see my phone so I saw the
dot view case I was kind of intrigued
though because you could see information
on the front you can interact with the
phone and the case I thought it was just
kind of neat so what is the dot view
case so first it protects the back and
the front of your phone the back goes
into serve a plastic finish plastic back
in the front has sort of a rubber feel
to it it's got a whole bunch of little
dots similar to a dot matrix right there
on it so when you DoubleTap the screen
like you would if it wasn't protected it
would unlock it we double tap it using
the dot view case you can see quick
information so you can see the time you
can see the weather sort of handy if you
have emails it'll pull up a little email
logo if you got a text let's pull up a
text box you can see the clouds what the
weather is and you can interact it as
well so when you see the weather you can
just hold it down and I'll tell you what
temperature that's kind of neat but one
the coolest things for me the reasons I
didn't like to flip because every time I
want to answer my phone have to usually
open it up look who's calling answer it
and then put it up to my ear this one
you can actually interact with the phone
again while it's closed somebody's
calling you swipe it up and you just
answer it while it's closing up to your
ear on to climb the call you just swipe
down and did a really cool job with it
see wonder how it worked it's pretty
simple the case is just dots with holes
in it on the phone actually does all the
work so it pulls up kind of a bigger box
text and if you open the phone up really
quickly you can see what it looks like
behind it and it's just really neat
they're kind of ingenious way break just
need to make a case so when I say you
interact with it you got to touch the
case to actually make it work but you
got a touch really hard so you don't
just sort of tap it lightly you got to
sort of dig your finger in there to make
it move if you like it kind of case it's
gonna protect your phone sort of give
you something else sort of keep the
screen protected it's a pretty good
option you're gonna have cutouts on the
back for
cameras and the flash one thing that
annoyed me don't want to take a picture
you got to sort of hold it kind of weird
so if you want to take a picture
obviously you can't fold this back it's
gonna cover it so I got a sort of either
hold it with one hand or sort of hold
the case and then use the camera and try
and take a picture could be a bit
difficult and kind of annoying take a
picture with it also when you're trying
to interact with the phone when it's
open since the phone curves the case
doesn't curve so it sort of sits weirdly
on it and it feels kind of uncomfortable
in your hand like it's trying to open
itself up so as I hold it here you can
see it really wants to sort of kick
itself forward so sort of be prepared
going into it it's old that right now we
can find it at some places if you want a
case that again it's can protect your
back and give you some information on
the front you be protected it's a pretty
good option I used it for the whole
weekend it's about 10 app days and I
kind of liked it am I gonna keep it on
my phone probably now I'm done climbing
this video in the review I'll probably
go back in the box now just good song
for me might not mean it's not for you
for the kind of person that likes flippy
cases it's probably the best flippy case
I've ever tested and I just flip the
case probably not the technical term
it's a dot view case again it's gonna be
about 50 bucks if you want to check when
I go to HTC comm for all of that
