off to the Apple store for Genius Bar
appointment take a look at my 15-inch
MacBook Pro a touch bar I'm getting a
true shift battery life like three to
four hours with I thought which is
Chrome's that maybe there's chrome
issues I've closed chromatin Safari
I'm loving pretty much the same battery
life with Safari and with the mail app
open so really nothing else going on in
the background
I did a over the phone diagnostic test
with Apple over the weekend battery life
better health rather came back as normal
I boot into safe mode as if maybe
something was going on at the OS and
nothing sort of popped up as an anomaly
and I still had the same battery life
issues even in safe mode when I set up a
computer at first I offered to set up as
a brand new computer so I didn't bring
anything over so I didn't bring over any
issues for maybe a previous computer to
set it up all from scratch
and as a added bonus I'm also bringing
my iPhone 7 plus that I switched back
and forth to for Bluetooth connectivity
issues so it's really a Apple issues day
the main goal though is to find out if
the battery life on my macbook pro is an
anomaly or sort of typical of the new
line of computers I'm hoping it just an
anomaly and could be fixed swap I really
don't want to set up a new computer
we'll we'll see so come on I'm just your
average everyday consumer walk around
with the microphone on and into the half
we'll start
so it's a good news/bad news situation I
wanted to come up here to make myself
feel a little better the good news it's
not my computer if the bad news is I got
a lifelike version of the shrug emoji
it's just the issue with the 15-inch
MacBook Pros in general I don't know if
the none GPU versions have the same
issue but these this one definitely does
the guy at the Genius Bar I wasn't the
first one that they've had one solution
that seemed to give me an extra hour nap
about it life lease on the estimated
battery was to go into system
preferences and then energy saver and
then deselect then reselect the graphics
switching so to switch from the
dedicated GPU to integrative GPU the
thought was that maybe it wasn't doing
it on its own so by turning it off turn
it back on again it'll sort of reenable
it and it looked like that helped but I
don't know if in real worlds can
actually do anything but it's an option
if you like me are running into power
issues I'm still debating what to use
for my computer if I want to sort of
keep the 15 inch or go back to surface
book a battery life is definitely an
issue and so they're not helping the
MacBook Pros
case in this situation but have you guys
had issues have you had issues with
maybe the non and dedicated GPU versions
issues with the 30 inch of touch part
it's just the 13 inch without touch bar
so it's got the only version that that
we've had to try it I've had the tries
leave a comment down below and let us
know share native of notifications also
for a video so you know and we put up a
new one and give it a thumbs up cuz
you're a good human and it makes us feel
good about ourselves I would enjoy the
view here in Irvine hopefully does rain
and I'm gonna look sadly at the poor
battery life on my macbook pro
so let's say hypothetically you bought
this new MacBook Pro and you want to
make a website about the battery life on
said MacBook Pro you could go to the
folks at Squarespace and design your own
site that looks super professional it's
easy to do no skill or coding required
they got intuitive easy-to-use tools and
you can get a free domain when you sign
