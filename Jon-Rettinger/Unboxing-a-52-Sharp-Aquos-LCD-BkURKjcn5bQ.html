had to get a new one it's actually the
second time it blew up same problem both
times and it wasn't worth the money to
fix it again so I got a new TV it's a 52
inch LCD
it's a Sharp Aquos I picked up from
Costco which for those of you outside of
the US is a large warehouse store so I
take you guys around it and I'll show
you what we got on the box here 52 inch
LCD right there a picture of a guy
riding a BMX full 1080p Energy Star HD
TV HDMI and all that goodness there's a
model number two sharp LC - C five two
five five you strap up coast slimline
design advanced super view HD 1080p LCD
TV high contrast brightness and ratio
advanced connectivity it's got four HDMI
ports two components PC inputs and
additional connections
so that's front of the box some boring
instructions on the top I'll give you
guys a profile truck you can see on the
other side of the box looked exactly the
same as the front I'm nothing terribly
exciting there sharp aquos on the side
some serial numbers and such pictures of
the remote pictures are the connectors
right there and on the other side of the
box I'll take you around exactly the
same thing nothing terribly exciting so
let's go ahead and open this thing up so
we've got a very special guest camera
woman who is helping me
record this my beautiful girl
no this was an unanticipated expense I
bought that about three years ago and I
expected it to last much longer than
it's just three years
somebody use whatever a little influence
I have a technology world to advise you
don't buy LG your LG maybe finally made
good luck with it
a certain kind of knowledge so take it
as a cautionary tale there's a cat
playing with her duck she's quite into
it
that was a bribe I gave her for moving
to a new place she's not happy to be put
in the box
and then locked in a bathroom all but my
LG is it 50-inch plasma and this TV is
actually significantly lighter than the
outgoing call G so I don't know if it's
just new technology or LCDs in general
or later but something to keep in mind
also one thing to know about little CD
versus plasma which I just kind of
learned you can't transport plasmas flat
you always have to be upright LCDs you
can turn around so if you have to put in
the back of an SUV or truck or something
you know you can't run away a flat
desert so you come over here top of the
box
we've got I'll lick your remote control
pretty standard remote control four
buttons right there I'll probably never
use this since I use a universal remote
with my cable but case I do need it
there it is and since I compare
everything to the iPhone here's a
comparison of the TV next to the iPhone
you see it's got a one button right
there
just kidding guys alright so go over
here it's a DOS we got power cord
a stylist just a rapport it's a battery
- they wrote the book so guys I'm going
to take this out but it's gonna take two
of us to get this out so the next thing
you're gonna see is that the TV looks
like out of the box so there is what it
is inside feet box big TV they send you
guys to see it it'll be unwrapped
alright guys you finally got the TV out
of the box let's take a look at the
connections we've got an analog RGB for
PC in I've got a DVI port s-video
components video component video the old
composite optical audio some analogue
audio there are three HDMI ports my old
one only had one so I'm quite happy
about that and there's a fourth one
right there on the side as well as
component ports and a USB port which is
a little bit weird you guys can see that
down there
strange keep going around nothing else
here and the front of the TV is a great
big panel nothing terribly exciting to
look at but you got show you guys once I
have it up on my stand so that one USB
port we are talking about evidently you
can take a USB stick with pictures and
plug it right in and you can make your
own little slideshow kind of cool nice
job sharp most importantly its picture
quality so I'm excited to plug this in
and see what it looks like
alright guys you got the TV up on the
stairs a stand stand there ask some a
little bit of the legs to it we had a
build and screw in but they came with
all the included screws not a big deal
let's go ahead and take the plastic off
this thing this is always fun always fun
don't feel about making you guys too
nauseous with my handheld action never
claimed to be a director so guys there
you go here is an unboxing of my Sharp
Aquos I will use it for a little while
and give you guys my impressions on it
see you guys in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
