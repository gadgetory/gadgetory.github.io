series this is the iPhone 7 isn't if you
want to know the other side of the
argument click the link right here and
watch the iPhone 7 is to hear all the
great things about the iPhone 7 and who
it might be for but not everything is
all rose golden chocolates with the
iPhone 7 there's a lot of things here
that are missing and while you might not
want to get the iPhone 7 in the iPhone 7
plus let's start with some just giant
omissions think you can get in the
android world wireless charging and fast
charging are gigantic things for me that
I use all the time both not-here improve
screen resolution not getting it with
the iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus the
resolutions are staying the same from
previous generations and apple claims
the uptick color gamut make it more
cinema style I saw both screens I've
seen them that the event didn't look any
better maybe a little bit brighter
nothing noticeable there at all you want
a qHD screen Android's way to go what
about the new pair of headphones you
just bought that maybe you might want to
plug in to the 3.5 millimeter headset
jack you're gonna have to use an
included dongle or buy a brand new pair
of headphones cos Apple and their
benevolence and their courage which I
make a whole video on the use of the
word courage ditch dad phone Jack that
dad that is what it is so let the rage
flow through you my child my best boys
Apple did add new colors I think jet
black is one of the more appealing color
options that they add and before you get
too excited hit order don't do it having
held this thing is a fingerprint magnet
and is going to get scratched oh holy
hell so lets you plan on keeping your
phone in a case or just putting it in a
glass display which not gonna do when
why buy the jet block and put in a case
anyway don't consider the jet black
option and hey how about the home button
which is presumably one of the big
reasons why Apple will decide to get rid
of the headphone jacks they could put
that taptic engine down at the bottom
doesn't add any more utility it's
something else that can break it's got a
little taptic buzz fine doesn't do
anything differently we didn't do before
they changed it just for changing its
sake so they can say something else is
different
with the phone not a reason to upgrade
also the iPhone 7
Plus still doing the Humpty dance camera
humps still there move that a little bit
and on the seven plus it is just ee
there you get you get cue hums love the
ass on hump with a new model number from
the 6s to the 72 expect the phone to
look drastically different it does not
it looks like an iterative update of the
iPhone 6 design which is what the iPhone
success looked like which is now kind of
what the iPhone 7 looks like say for a
few color options if you want your phone
to look different than maybe the pointy
already got in your pocket the iPhone 7
and 7 plus or do not not gonna be for
you so what tight argument are you on
are you pro iPhone excited or you like
Apple you drop the ball I am NOT
interested let us know in the comments
watch both videos get the video thumbs
up if you like this new style if you
like knowing the pros and the cons and
way we broke it up we'd love to hear
your thoughts on it until next time I'm
generating from TechnoBuffalo see you
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
