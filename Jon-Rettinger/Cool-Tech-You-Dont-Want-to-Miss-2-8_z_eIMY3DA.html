TechnoBuffalo and about I don't know a
month and a half two months ago we did a
video called cool tech where we covered
cool tech for things that didn't really
make it in traditional product
categories that we wanted to cover and
share with you guys we got a really good
response for me your comments were very
positive so I wanted to come with cool
tech part two I'm gonna be covering two
products Johnson - covering two product
let's go ahead and get started so first
we have the lifx bulb these are sort of
colored LED bulbs and you haven't heard
of these there's a couple on the market
not just lifx and they're all very cool
they allow you to pick from millions of
colors different shades of white life
expels will function independently
without a smart home hub would you need
for something because they have the
independent of Wi-Fi sitting on each
bulb so very cool the app is pretty
fantastic you can do crazy stuff like
have a little Club rave in your own
house with pulsing lights and all that
kind of awesome stuff really really like
these and you also save power because
their LED but they are expensive up
front they're about $60 a pop so you're
gonna be making that big upfront
investment if you want to fill your
whole home with them or go one by one
which is what I might be doing so for
mine I'm going audio-only let's start
with the listen Apollo speakers there
are a ton of Bluetooth speakers that
sound great that are way less expensive
these costs two hundred and ninety nine
dollars now for that I'm gonna get all
draped up in would our jar and ebony you
can also get them in a zebra type of
wood so each speaker is gonna look
different because each piece of wood is
a little bit different listen the reason
I picked it a socially conscious company
they donate proceeds from each sale to
the Starkey Hearing Foundation which
help people hear all over the world
in the past three years alone that
donate over twenty thousand hearing aids
help people hear things for the first
time so I really liked the social
consciousness aspect of the company but
the speaker's themselves also sound
pretty good Bluetooth 4.0 over ten hours
of battery life you can plug it in there
and keep it going with a micro USB cable
which is recessed super far so meant to
find a special USB cable it's gonna work
audio is gonna sound pretty awesome -
they got twin 45 millimeter drivers the
bass sounds really solid I can fill up a
room it doesn't get any Rumble and you
turn the volume all the way up either
it's loud enough to DJ a small party but
I wouldn't like take you to the club and
expect to you know blast your tunes
through their speaker that big but does
look good it's gonna sound good it's
also
help the world one of my favorite
headphones of the past years when the
parrot Zeek - and they are back with the
parrot seek three designed by Philip
Starck and if you know anything about
designs nothing designed by Stark has
ever been bad it's one of the few
headphones out there that are bluetooth
and also offer noise cancellation always
cancelling on these absolutely
incredible
you can customize how adaptive it is
through their mobile app which also lets
you simulate without you're in a concert
hall or whether or not you're indoors or
outdoors lets you simulate a lot of
really cool things one reason I've
always liked the Zeek headphones
removable batteries so if you're
traveling long distances you pick up an
extra battery charge it and be good to
go I also features touch controls so if
you want to raise the volume you can
swipe up but be prepared to launch
i-tunes almost every time you touch the
earcup i found that a little on the
annoying side also it's gonna charge
wirelessly now and last but not least we
have the DJI phantom 4 now the phantom 3
pro was a great drone but with the for
what DJI has done to take a bunch of
small upgrades that sort of add up to a
much bigger package you have a slightly
bigger battery better signal so you can
fly further faster or longer it can go
faster and you also get a bunch of sort
of smart features so obstacle avoidance
have to fly so you can just you know tap
and it'll fly very obvious I think it
makes it much more palatable out the box
for the average consumer I think that's
what makes it cool it is a little bit
expensive for just you know your regular
buyers out there who aren't really into
drones it comes in at thirteen ninety
nine but I think that is a bargain for
people who want to go shoot school stock
footage scenic footage and maybe do some
pro related stuff and so that's pretty
much it for this video guys let me know
what you think we're doing a little poll
because we want to know what you guys
think what your favorite product is out
of the four that we talked about so top
right of your screen whichever side that
is click and let us know we're also
doing more thematic oriented series like
cool tech so let us know what you guys
want to see we're trying to do more in
that direction and would love your
feedback give us a thumbs up if you
liked this video and subscribe and I'll
see you guys next post thanks so much
