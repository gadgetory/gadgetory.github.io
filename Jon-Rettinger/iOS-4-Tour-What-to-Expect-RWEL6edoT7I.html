technobuffalo here in the day a lot of
you have been waiting for is finally
upon us I OS four point oh previously
called iphone OS four is here so I want
to give you a walkthrough and
reintroduce you to some of the cool new
features you're going to be getting on
your iphone 3gs iphone 3g ipod touch
although on some of those model is not
can get all of these features let's go
ahead and get started and one of the
ones that forever silly reason i was the
most excited about is backgrounds you
can see I've got a new background gone
is the old static black you can now set
any image you want as your wallpaper you
can either pick different ones for your
unlock screen and your background or use
the same for both kind of fun although
the biggest announcement about iPhone
iOS 4.0 or iphone OS 4 is the addition
of multitasking which is finally here
and it's accessed very simply all you're
going to do is double tap your home
button and you know get a list of open
program you can jump right to any of
those any way you choose now Apple and
Steve Jobs said they want to eliminate
the task manager although you are gonna
have to close programs you can keep as
many open as you like there really isn't
a set limit but you are gonna notice
this severe battery drain so if you want
to close the program you hold it down
it's gonna do a little jiggly dance and
you get that familiar sort of red little
dash you go ahead and close whatever you
would like so you can now run pandora in
the background you can run your itunes
music in the background you can run a
GPS in the background and speaking of
music if you are running music and if
you go all the way to the left you're
going to get a cool little widget here
which here let you control your music
and also set your rotation lock on the
iPad for example you can set it so it
won't auto rotate you can do that here
as well go ahead and click it and it's
going to turn off the accelerometer tap
it again gonna turn it back on hit the
home button and all of your multitasking
options are going to slide right back
down the next sort of nice addition we
have is something called folders which
lets you stack and organize applications
by like whatever you would like to do
with them you can set up by games or
utilities and all you're going to do is
just take an iconic
a little jiggly dance you're going to
drag it right over another icon and it's
going to create a folder it's got to
automatically name it for you but you
can name it whatever you like things
Bloomberg my stock management program is
a game but I can go ahead and name it
whatever you like go ahead and close out
of it and if you want to open a folder
it's pretty self-explanatory you open it
up and there you go if you want to close
that folder get rid of it you can just
drag the icons right out and that folder
just going to have one I come laughing
if you go ahead and drag that when I
come right out of the folder the folder
disappears so the next feature is
something a lot of people have been
asking for including me and that is
threaded emails often times on gmail or
my exchange account I'd go back and
forth with someone and I'd end up have
to go through seven or eight or ten
emails if it's great if I could just
find one threaded message similar to
what you see on the gmail web
application so that is finally here
here's a message that i had with shawn
and go ahead and click through talking
about some fathers days posts on
technobuffalo and if you look there's a
little number right to the right that
says three so there are three in that
thread I can go ahead and open it up and
I can view all the ones that are right
there you're also going to get a
universal inbox and you're going to get
a lot more exchange support including
support for multiple exchange accounts
so they know it's going to be great for
you corporate users also there's a
presence of the game center though I'm
not so sure how functional is going to
be I mean go ahead and play a game
online with other people there was one
feature they didn Lee gun notice or
without much fanfare universal search
has been a part of the iphone operating
systems in three-point oh but now they
added this simple simple ability
something that should have been there
from day one like most these features
the ability to search the web so let's
say i wanted to search the web for candy
the fields in love candy spelled it
wrong jump back candy i can now search
the web and i can get my search results
i'm taking your rights to online right
into google and i can see what I'd like
for searching makes a lot of user
instead of having open up your browser
click in the upper right hand corner tap
what you want search just a lot of
features that are probably should have
been there from day one and this is the
operating system update that I think
really brings apples platform to
competitive parody honest with the
others certainly android and
on webos have had multitasking me and
done it very well and offered a lot of
these features that should have been
there no reason that changing the
background should have been a feature we
had to wait for operating systems to get
but so it is with apple and those things
are finally here so you guys downloading
iOS four point oh you happy with the
deal like it or you're not happy with
are you annoyed with it is it working
