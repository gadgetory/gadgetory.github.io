technobuffalo here it's been a crazy
week for apple news for you Apple fans
out there you've probably been very
excited been enjoying it blows you out
there that maybe aren't the biggest fans
of applets probably been a killer couple
days for you and it's about to get worse
today Apple announced that on april
eight they will be hosting an event to
give a sneak preview at iphone OS four
point oh I know iphone OS four point oh
should be clarified it's not just the
iphone OS anymore it's also the ipod
touch OS and now it's also the ipad OS
so i want to run down some predictions
for i think we're going to see finally
with iphone OS 4.0 from one point out a
2 point 0 is incremental from two to
three added some key features from three
to four i think we're finally going to
see that big jump it does appears in the
past Apple has been listening to the
detractors people were crying when the
iphone his first release that had no cut
copy and paste no mms and those
substance been rectified rectified very
nicely the key features are missing from
the iphone have been fixed save for a
few which we'll talk about so let's go
and get the predictions but i think
we're going to see for iphone OS four
point oh first and foremost in sort of
the biggest gaping hole i think in the
operating system is multitasking i think
we're finally going to see true
multitasking on the iphone ipod touch
and ipad or called the I devices finally
we're going to see true multitask when
we've seen a reference in the kernels of
some of the previous release devices
especially the iPad we've seen even bit
of some pieces reference in the SDK
whether or not Apple completely opens it
up to third party multitasking support
or whether just multitasking for native
apps yet to be seen I'm kind of inclined
to believe that we're not going to see
sort of universal multitasking Apple
tends to lock things down I think we're
finally going to see some sort of
multitasking the other big knock that
I've had enough said this in the past is
the home screen and the layout of the UI
it's gotten very state
they've added features and such but it
hasn't changed since the iphone was
first launched this layout of the range
new grids exactly what looked when the
iphone first launched now you've got
more icons from apps but that's about it
and it's gotten stale and boring and
it's even more apparent how boring it is
on something this large like the iPad um
there's not much information you get a
row of icons and that's about it you get
no additional functionality you're not
getting email notifications on there
you're not getting a ton of features and
other devices offer think we are going
to see a redesigned you I don't think
we're going to completely abandon what
we have right now think we're still
going to see that arrangement of grids
but perhaps that will be segmented
they'll be stacks similar to what we
have in snow leopard then also rumors
perhaps some sort of a widget support so
live widgets similar to the tiles that
Microsoft has on Windows Phone 7 they've
since dropped the series from an to that
and Android and sort of the other rumors
that have been kicking around although I
do think some sort of you I speech are
guaranteed as well as true multitasking
which could be quite nice the next day I
think we're finally going to see and I'm
hoping for this one is better
notifications notifications on the
iPhone or the iDevices is quite quite
poor they're pop-ups that show up and
they stop the application running in the
background I like notifications at pop
out very similar to how webos works I've
never seen one of the new palm devices
they nailed notifications are
unobtrusive they show up at the bottom
you can tap it for information or you
can swipe it away and have it be gone
I've got something that the I devices
are certainly missing another feature
that I think is a guarantee that we're
finally going to see is universal
mailbox on how many of you have multiple
mail accounts on your iPhone and iPad
touch or ipad you got to keep going back
and forth to each account to get your
mail and be great if you could just have
them all in one sort of encompassing
package would be quite nice another
feature that this may be a us thing but
though we haven't heard anything about
tethering other countries been able to
tether since iphone OS 3.1 out almost a
year ago but we don't have that for
18 teeth maybe we'll see some sort of
tethering or iPad tethering people can
use their Wi-Fi device in conjunction
with their iphone certainly would be a
feature that I think would be a welcome
addition to the iDevice line so the next
big question here is hard where are we
going to see new hardware are we going
to see the iphone four point oh are you
going to see a new ipod touch what are
we going to see and how is it going to
affect the ipad i think they're the two
big questions everybody's asking so are
we going to see new hardware i don't
think so i think we're going to see just
the operating system shown on existing
3gs ipod touch and ipad hardware I think
we're not going to see a new iphone
until the june or july time frame seems
to be the general consensus and the path
that Apple has followed in the past so
the question begs why are they showing a
new iphone OS in april when new hardware
is not coming out until june or july and
I think that's due to pressure android
is gaining market share fast and
furiously palm is now going to have the
devices on every major carrier there is
a lot of competition and all that
competition is sort of shouting from the
mountaintops about apple shortcomings on
their devices particularly no
multitasking and i think that's sort of
a way to circumvent that people that are
saying well my contract is up should i
wait for the new iphone i think it's
coming in june or I don't really know
you know what maybe I'll just get a
nexus one or maybe I'll just pick up a
droid I now people are going to think
gonna be saying well all that new cool
stuff is coming it's worth waiting till
june or july and also think people our
apple is doing this for another reason
do with the ipad people are waiting i
think you've know they sold 300,000
units a way to see what a generation to
device might bring these now able to
pick up an ipad saying you know what I
know what the bikes are going to do now
and then come June and July when you
know what oh x4 I know it's coming
they're going to know what the ipad is
going to be capable I what's going to
add multiple features like I mentioned
the home screen ranges glaring on the
iPad with that much screen real estate
not being used you know the lock screen
has no information other than time and
your signal reception and that's about
it and that's things that really really
need updating so guys got to be a bit of
a long winded video I'm very excited
about OS four point oh and of course
we'll be covering all of it in its
entirety Oh what do you think we're
going to see with OS four point oh is
this finally gonna be the operating
system that silence is the Apple critics
or just going to expose sort of more
shortcomings with the platform I like to
hear from you I sound off in the
comments via video response really
curious what you guys have to say all
right jon rettinger from technobuffalo
and i'll see you in the next video bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
