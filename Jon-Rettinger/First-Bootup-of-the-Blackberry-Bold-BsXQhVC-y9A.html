up of the brand new blackberry bold 9000
seema turn this on for the first time
and peel off the plastic on the front
here then I so welcome to start using
your smartphone please really getting
started guide not going to happen
alright screen feels should be much
really nicely so here's the back of the
device with its kind of faux leather
feeling there some more plastic peel
that off see if like there's a latch
down there go ahead and try and take
that off push that in I suppose there
you go all right back comes off now
there's a sim card in there it's not
mine I don't know if it's an active sim
card but we'll see what happens so
here's the battery go ahead and pop it
that bad boy right in close up the
device the back of latch definitely
feels more secure than the old curved it
doesn't feel like this is going to slide
off you put in your pocket it does have
a nice feel to it with the battery in so
put that down zoom it a little bit for
you all right and there goes powering on
and let's see what happens i mean you
can be a little bit on the boring side
and sometimes black where you can take a
little while to turn on there's a little
spinning icon in there I'm guys can see
this with the brightness I can't really
adjust it this device is turned on but
there is a little clock in there that is
spinning and put that back down track
balled it up very exciting stuff the
device keyboard does seem to feel nice
it will be a nice play around with the
phone with a full qwerty keyboard but
using the iphone 3g now for a while I
had the first generation iphone so I've
missed an actual tactile keyboard but it
will see how this is fuels I used a
blackberry pearl before this I play
round of the curve and even had an old
blackberry 8700
the last one with the wheel on the side
and he knows nice so here we go we've
got a AT&amp;amp;T splash screen with some stuff
verifying security software handheld
include software that is proprietary and
confidential blah blah blah setup wizard
we can close that route to abort setup
wizard okay alright so that was the
first boot up of the blackberry bold and
I can't tell you screen is gorgeous on
this but I'll do a full hardware review
on it just wanted you guys to see the
first boot up and the home screen it
would seem you guys like that in a case
you were wondering sim card not work up
to pop in my own sim card and give it a
whirl anyway guys jon rettinger john for
lakers calm be sure to check out that
