TechnoBuffalo here and welcome back to
another edition of ask the buffalo where
you can ask me anything you want tech
personal or somewhere in between you
could ask a question we put a post up on
the site or you could use twitter with
the hashtag asking the be so let's go
ahead and get started
so you're going to see me dylan's this
direction I'm going to read questions
live and I'm going to answer the
questions live none of them are
pre-prepared or at least it's live for
me I guess every video is probably like
four reasons I'm filling it but there's
no scripted business here I'm going to
answer all your questions right up top
of my head and I'm gonna watch the clock
because I do sometimes like to hear
myself talk and I can let these ask the
Buffalo videos get like 45 minutes long
and then you guys would get bored of
that so let's good sign alright the
first question comes from technobuffalo
the post this is from Matthew stove it's
is the pre three keyboard better than
the torches I wasn't Matthew at the palm
event they let us hold the pre three and
he's the keyboard on the pre three but
they hadn't actually hold it while we
were holding it so I did get a chance to
use the keyboard as much as i would have
liked i will tell you my first
impressions that it felt very good they
keep our on the torture i think is
absolutely outstanding as well i'm
inclined to believe the torch keyboards
probably going to be a little bit better
than the pre three but that has yet to
be seen so I don't know all right next
let's jump over to twitter with the
hashtag asked the bee this is from x
nucca JX what is your favorite childhood
memory um it's actually one of my
earliest memories I don't know how old I
was but I was probably like this big you
can't see my hands but this was probably
this big my parents had a little swing
set out in the backyard and distinctly
remember wearing a green izod you know
with a little alligator thing i think it
was called something else back then um
polo shirt and playing on a swing set
with my dad and grandfather just running
around and having having a fun time that
is definitely my best memory from my
childhood if you don't know this about
me um I look up to my dad a tremendous
amount my dad is my hero so I'm i love
the time that I get to spend with him
and still get this done with him
fortunately enough so let's go ahead and
jump on back to the website do you think
apple will be making a mini iPad this
year for this Apple music event nope no
don't even think it I don't think we're
going to see an iPad me or anything i
think the ipad mini is called the iphone
or the ipod touch I think the ten nine
inches that we've got right now is
probably what we're going to see for
ipad sizes for quite a while alright
let's go back to twitter i'm going to
jump around uh this one's going to go to
nicholas leone what time i think what
time a phone you use thank you trying to
say what type of phone you use depending
on my feeling of the day I go back and
forth between actually would have gotten
my pocket right now the iphone force is
the red one that got converted and a HTC
Inspire refused to call it a 4g i've
used the inspire and i've used the atrix
i like the bigger field of the inspire
and I don't like motoblur I know there
are third-party of stuff you can put on
it but I just happen to like the inspire
so I feel like I want to go android
that's what I'm rocking when I feel like
I want to switch back to Apple this is
the phone that I use so i switched
between both of those probably about 50
52 generally i'll use the iphone on the
weekends during the week i will use
Henry okay so let's go jump back to the
website pick another question when do
you think the iphone five will come out
and that one's from Mark Phillips uh
well mark there's been a lot of rumors
of delays but those are just rumors on
rumors no one knows anything until apple
announces it i delay i guess of sorts so
varying from the junior b-cycle what
makes sense i think it would unify the
release cycle of the CDMA and the gsm
iphone if i remember correctly the
brides and iphone came out in February
the iphone 4 was released the previous
june so there's a big gap right there i
think of apple we're to release an
iphone 5 2 jun the folks who bought the
cdma iphone which I believe accounts for
four percent of
of iphone users would probably be a bit
upset that the phone is obsolete in a
shorter period so I don't know nobody
but Apple knows mainly tells you they
know they are lying to you and don't let
them lie to you all right let's switch
back to twitter let's jump around to
Kevin win since phones these days have
many gigabytes of memory do you think in
the near future 10 to 20 years we'll see
as much as a terabyte um it would make
sense it's sort of a Moore's law of
storage i guess that we're going to keep
saying bigger bigger phones of 10 20
years yeah i do they do when should we
expect this is from Steve Claire what
should we expect a John for lakers
junior um I don't know my wife and I am
if you want me talking about this but I
will uh we've talked about having kids
maybe in like two or three years I'm 30
right now and we just got married in
August so we're sort of enjoying our
time together and then you know we'll
think about kids in a few years we both
definitely want them but not right the
second I can barely take care of myself
and I want to see an idea of having kids
kind of frightening to me right now but
I assume I'm not alone on that um all
right so let's go ahead and jump back to
the website what your opinion on
jailbreaking is it worth it from meny
rooster um big as a funny game my first
question was jailbreaking do you think
it's worth it depends like me the phone
cord or whether or not you want to live
outside of apples ecosystem I
jailbreaking is extremely easy to do if
you want things like a better
notification system if you want home
screen notifications the things that I
keep talking about like broke the record
over and over again then by all means
jailbreak I'm simple I don't have any
problem with it it's legal to do I feel
like if you own the phone you also on
the software behind it I don't jailbreak
for the big reason that I
we use my iphone for comparison purposes
with other devices I like to sort of
keep things on an even playing field so
if you were to get an iphone you want to
see how it looks against the inspire I
want to make sure that my phone is as
intended from the factory so at least
it's a very fair match otherwise I could
plan in the comments they might not fair
jailbroken phone and I do read the
comments so that's why I haven't
jailbroken if that helps answer your
question all right let's you're a few
more how long this video is getting I
got bad i said i can't see the cam um
alright should i get the ipad 2 or wait
for the three it's from same difference
90 dude I can't answer for you the ipad
2 just came out if you want a tablet i
would go for the ipad 2 what I generally
tell people not just Apple the tech in
general a good way if you feel the need
to upgrade and certainly there's no need
to upgrade and just spend money but if
you do sort of feel that itch and desire
and you have the means a good way to go
is to sell your last generation hardware
a month or so before the release or
expected release of the new device so
I've had to came out last month a
January would have been awesome time to
sell your ipad 1 and you could use that
money for the next generation device
just a bit of advice actually as a side
story before i got into tech reviewing I
used to try and buy cell phones at
awesome how big a nerd I was I loved
cell phones I've always loved cell
phones and they always want the desert
tried the latest tech which is why my
job is so awesome when I wake up with
the massive smile on my face but I
couldn't really afford to get all the
phones that I wanted to try so I would
buy them on ebay from overseas and then
i would sell i've used them for like a
few weeks and then i'd sell them on
incredulous so you know there are ways
to sort of try and use the tools that
you have available all right i'll go
ahead and try and answer two more
questions i will take this next one from
twitter let's go to if you could build
the perfect smartphone what features
would it have scar boy 669 three that's
an interesting question well i think
that i would take the elegance of iOS
I think I would take the flexibility of
Android i think i would take the
multitasking from webos and i would take
the blackberry messenger BBM from
blackberry match that all together to
get an awesome smartphone I would like
to have my choice of screen size so I
would probably like it 4.3 inch screen
with perhaps a physical keyboard I don't
know it depends what mood I'm in I like
the option of having a physical and
on-screen keyboard those would probably
be my big choices and that's really
breaks down my thoughts on Android and
iOS I love the elegance of iOS I hope
that I can do whatever I want with
Android and I can make it look and feel
however I like and that's sometimes why
I jump on back to the inspire all right
let's go to ask me Buffalo question on
the site we've got a question from Kyle
brewski Kyle says do you think apple
will try to put 3d on their iPhones I
hope not I think this whole stereoscopic
3d thing is a joke maybe I've old eyes
but it kills my eyes I don't think the
3d effect is worth it at all I don't
need to see the little dude look like
it's coming at me to these fine with me
and I'd rather not hurt my eyes or have
the eye strain I hope we don't go
through D although the trend is
everybody's going through these so
certainly will see Apple probably jump
on that bandwagon at least one more time
alright so let's ask one more question
because I I could probably do this for
like six hours I love talking to you
guys I just really do um like it all
right what's the best way to get
subscriptions on the tech channels from
rebeling tech that was from Twitter the
best way is to find your own style and
to show some personality in your videos
don't try and copy you know don't try
and copy mark don't try and copy chris
pirillo chilla frolla ties iphone hell
for me I try and find your own style we
all have our own sort of way that we do
things and that sort of works for us and
the audience response both at five
thing don't try and use anybody else's
voice I guess that's good advice for
life in general find find your voice I'm
like an after-school special um or an
episode of I don't know what has like
the Brady Bunch when I'm going to date
myself alright this one really will be a
last one let's go to Brett Oh stack who
is your favorite youtuber obviously
other than yourself um that's a good
question I watch a lot of tech videos
because I like tech and I enjoy watching
tech in general but my favorite
youtubers the guys that I look forward
to seeing videos every day i love the
vlogbrothers i think they are
outstanding i think their intellectual
and funny and they have heart and they
care about causes so I love watching
them I love the college humor videos as
well they always make me laugh and you
know I'll actually go into my
subscriptions and I will see who I got
there I'll tell you who my favorite are
my wife I know loves Michael Buckley
from what the buck she gets super
excited whatever he posed videos I also
love jamesnintendonerd I forgot about
him I the angry video game nerd he is
awesome definitely check him out so guys
I could talk forever but this video is
going to get to be 90 minutes long I
hope you enjoyed ask the Buffalo and
you've got a chance to ask me the
Buffalo I'm all Buffalo let's Tatanka ah
see you in the next video
