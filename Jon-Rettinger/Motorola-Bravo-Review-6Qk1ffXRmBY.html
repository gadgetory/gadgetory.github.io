technobuffalo here at they for review
for you of the recently unboxed motorola
Bravo for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless let's go ahead
and get started so before i get into the
features of the phone let's talk first
about call quality no matter what the
phone can do or not do it's not going to
make good phone call it's not going to
be much used to you so generally when i
test phones i will do a 20 call test
from various regions where I am in
Southern California of each call in two
minutes in length the test signal
strength call quality and any sort of
dropped calls that we might have so in
my 20 call test actually had to drop
calls with this act on signal strength
to be about medium to acceptable with
other AT&amp;amp;T phones I've generally been
able to pull in about three to four bars
of 3g this was playing in just about two
to three so bad a bar less and certainly
the bars rely on proprietary algorithms
that aren't necessarily the most
accurate reflection of signal strength
but those two drop calls are generally
about two more than I usually had in
other tests I didn't have any sort of
death grip type issues didn't lose
reception when being held call quality
was very good i had no white noise in my
and the color and no white noise on
their end from a speakerphone standpoint
was a little bit tinny and a tad bit
quiet so if we rely on speaker phone to
use while you're in a car or any sort of
loud environment this may not be the
phone for you alright so let's go ahead
and talk about the phone itself let's
run through a bit of the specs very
quickly and then i will talk about what
the phone can do to give you some
perspective on the device so it is an
AT&amp;amp;T phone it's going to set you back
about one hundred and twenty nine
dollars on a two-year contract it's got
a 3.7 inch diagonal screen and LCD
display with a resolution of 480 x 854
so relatively decent resolution it's
gone over a fifteen hundred million
powder our batteries you're going to get
well over seven hours to talk to him and
battery life is actually fantastic on
this device i was easily able to get
through a day and i'm a very heavy user
i use email browsing and sort of
everything else that smartphone can do
and generally i push it very hard that i
don't get through a full day not a
problem with the bravo is running
android 2.1 with Motorola's motoblur
sitting on top of it it's an older
version of motor motoblur that's for
those colored icons will talk about
motoblur a bit more in a minute it's got
a TI OMAP 800 megahertz processor now in
this world of fast processors and
thinking of snapdragon the gigahertz you
might think 800 is going to make this
thing I've been anemic actually it's
very very very quick and I'm going to
show you that in just a few minutes it's
being assisted by 512 megabytes of RAM
it's got a two gig micro SD card
included it's got a 3 megapixel camera
on the back which can take standard
definition video no HD recording here
and this can do a flash content with a
flash of light alright so let's go ahead
and talk about the phone the first thing
i noticed when i unbox this guy and
picked it up was it's very thin form
factor the thing is very very very us
felt if you will and is very light has a
really nice feel in the hand got that
soft touch rubber in the back which
makes it sort of a nice grip to it from
a form factor standpoint I really lied
to the phone it felt good it was light
in the pocket wasn't taking up that much
space in 3.7 inch screen really gave a
lot of screen real estate generally of
lamented about capacitive buttons on the
bottom these were actually very
responsive there the motoblur array of
button so this is going to be your menu
your home in your back there is not a
search button though like we have on
majority of other android devices and
for join so I'm going to keep in mind if
you use the search button I did use that
quite a bit and I was certainly missing
it so with motoblur gonna get a ton of
widgets I am not the biggest fan of
motoblur I tried to turn off a lot of
the widgets but it can do a lot of
things to cloud thinking service and I'm
sort of bring in supposedly amalgamate
all of your social media and all your
contacts or put it all into one place
and upload it to Motorola server so if
you ever changed phones you log into
your motoblur account everything will be
there essentially it's a lot of sort of
widget base you can see that familiar
motoblur
icon to the bottom to show you what
screen you're on I'll show you what the
widgets are here very quickly the
motorola widgets I'm not the biggest fan
but there are some of them are useful
the calendar widgets are pretty nice the
weather widgets other social networking
and to serve Wi-Fi toggle switches
nothing revolutionary here it serves
standard android stuff we just get a bit
more functionality I suppose with
motoblur so one of the things that I
really wanted to talk about and I
mentioned this sort of earlier and
touched on it was there's a lot of talk
about processor speed and whether or not
that's going to translate to a better
experience and I found this faster
processor it's not optimized for the
software isn't going to result in a
faster experience so let me show you
what this TI OMAP 800 megahertz
processor can do I'm actually going to
start doing this all of my Android
device give you a sense of its prowess
so we're going to use something called a
quadrant here essentially it's going to
benchmark the phone now I'm going to do
this live you can see what the full
benchmark is going to be on the phone
well it's running I'll talk about some
other features here so go ahead and run
the full benchmark let's go to test for
CPU memory it's going to test 2d
graphics and 3d graphics let's see what
I can do so if you want to play 3d games
or two key games you want a phone it's
going to be able to handle this as well
as handling a pretty decent amount of
multitasking so let's guy will run the
background I'll talk a bit more about
the phone so I'm a big fan of the
Android stock keyboard clock better than
all my android reviews the keyboard that
comes just with Android I haven't
enjoyed this really that much the
motoblur keyboard that sort of sitting
on top of this so I've actually
transitioned back to using the standard
android keyboard this is not have a
slide-out qwerty keyboards are gonna
relying solely on the screen for txt
enter something to keep in mind effing
Utley recommend trying to keep work
first you can see it now sir running
through some cool looking 3d benchmarks
and it's doing a very nice job it's
pretty smooth here I've seen this on
other devices so I'm going to even a
faster processors I can't quite handle
this 3d graphics test with this much
alacrity so it's doing a bit more here
we got some globe spinning I didn't want
to do this sort of live on camera as you
guys can see if the results weren't
fidgeted with and
and mess with it all so it's one sort of
a DNA sequence here and we are just
about done so it's going to send the
results here and I'll see how it stacks
up against some other Android devices
and this I found very very telling so it
was a clothes at all right so
unfortunately it did not show with this
view today we're going to go ahead and
run this test one more time and I'll cut
back to the results you don't have to
watch it again all right so here is the
final benchmark score of the motorola
Bravo and the results might surprise you
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom in a little
bit more so you can sort of see where we
stand certainly once this is updated to
android 2.2 we should see some even
increased feeds motorola has set a 2.2
update will be coming so let's look at
the bottom here and see where we stand
so if you look we've got the original
motorola droid sony xperia x10 working
our way up from the bottom HTC Desire
there's the nexus one samsung galaxy s
moto droid x there's the bravo evo with
2.2 which is pretty impressive motorola
droid x with 2.2 and then the motorola
droid to sort of leading this charge we
can see that of all these phones here
we're looking at the fourth-best so
these phones are being test and those
are a lot of android devices which is
pretty impressive score there of just
over 1100 i'm going to be doing this
test on again on all android phones i
think it's very telling to see how well
the processor and the software work
together alright so let's go ahead and
check out the browser this is of course
multi-touch as i mentioned that it can
do flash will go ahead and of course got
an accelerometer will jump into
technobuffalo here and show you what
that looks like so we'll do a quick
search you can see that keyboard i was
mentioning earlier of course it rotates
as well but not the biggest fan of the
motoblur keyboard just something to keep
in mind so go ahead and do a quick
search here technobuffalo and i will let
this load there's have been a flash
content here so you can see the speed of
flash using a flashlight not like you
want to light up a room but it's
actually called flashlight it's not
flash 10.1 we can get on android 2.2 it
doesn't work pretty well it's going to
be a bit of a battery draining your
pinch and zooming isn't going to be as
you can turn it off if you want to not
have the Flash content have improved
battery life and have a bit smoother
pinch-to-zoom on other android 2.1
devices that are tested especially on
the TechnoBuffalo website the pinch to
zoom with the flash turned on has not
been very smooth however I was very
impressed with it here on the motorola
Bravo this phone is much faster than I
expected to be when i first tested this
i thought it was going to be mostly a a
mid-range device with moderate
performance turns out and offers
performance comparable of the flagship
devices with the one exception being
it's very anemic 3 megapixel camera so
something to keep in mind here let's go
ahead and jump out so in conclusion the
motorola Bravo really did surprise me
from a feature and performance
standpoint I was really blown away by
what the device can do I think it
represents a really nice sort of mid to
high range a smartphone for 418 team now
you saw this got a higher ranking than
the galaxy s phone if you're sort of
looking at this versus the galaxy s2
galaxy s is going to offer probably a
bitter better package of features with
that super amoled screen however if you
don't want the galaxy FC looking for
something a bit different perhaps
different for a fact or maybe a bit
smaller screen here with the 3.7 inch
green the rubble is going to be a really
fantastic phone on a one-to-five scale I
give it a very strong for loosing Alan
at one point four dimensions it's a very
camera and that dropped call and
speakerphone quality that I experienced
earlier I mentioned in the beginning
