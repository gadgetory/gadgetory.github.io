technobuffalo here with an unboxing of a
very kind of cool green product when I'm
looking forward to taking a look at this
is the solar solar powered seven system
for the ipod and iphone by eaton
corporation let's go ahead and get
started so of course let's start with
the big ol knife this is a solar powered
speaker system for pretty much any
iDevice out there iphone ipod ipod touch
whatever else you can think of odds are
this stuff is going to play it's also
augmented with a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery so if for some
reason you're not near the Sun and you
can't have it outside you can still be
able to charge us and use it as just a
bump and speaker system let's go ahead
and get to the unboxing of course we
will use the obligatory don't slice your
finger off knife cut off the paper here
this is gonna set you back one hundred
and ninety nine dollars i'll put a link
down below case you want to buy it you
can get it right from actually apple's
website or Amazon or a ton of other
places so let's take a look at what is
supporting your xterra lada apple
products so you got your iphones you got
your ipod nanos old ipod nanos ipod
minis how far that goes back ipods i
pause ipod nanos ipod nano so pretty
much any ipod this sucker is going to
play with let's go ahead and open it up
it looks like it slides off before i do
that take a look at the device on the
back so there it is I here are some
specs on it in English so it's a solar
power charging kit compatible with the
ipod or the iphone I rechargeable
lithium-ion battery pack rugged rubber
case and aluminum body ipx4 splash proof
from all angles so it's good thing to
put by the pool together out there get
your pool party on sorry to sound the
full range speaker drivers and bass
boots battery charge indicator AC power
inputs accessory remote control and
protective cover all right great let's
go ahead and see what the sucker looks
like and again will be links down below
in case you are interested I think that
this just comes on
instead of think that that's how this
thing comes off slide the sometime well
maybe we are being inhibited by tape
somewhere is there renegade tape
anywhere on this thing it is not appear
to be renegade tape so this should just
slide out with a little bit of force
perhaps come on there we go go ahead and
pull this thing out nice in theory
tempeaz unboxings are harder than they
look thank you all right you got the
sleeve off kind of a cool lightning bolt
looking logo opens very similar to what
we're seeing on the monster headphones
actually and here we've got the solar
information book great remote control
which is a splash proof remote control
we just talked about look at that in
just a minute here's some protective
cardboard box which is going to cover AC
adapter I think yep so there's your
power brick when you don't have the Sun
to charge it for you and here is the
sole red self it's actually very light
I'm surprised how I did I thought this
is going to be much much much heavier
especially for having solar panels which
generally way a bit let's go ahead and
pull this out so here it is this is the
whole thing okay so we've gotten out of
the box let's take a look at the solar
and I will tell you that right off the
bat it feels much lighter than I
expected to be which is quite nice on
the back we've got a little bit of a
handle if you want to carry it here
you've got your DC input we're going to
plug in and charge and all of the
actions going to happen right here on
the front let's go ahead and open up the
solar panel and take a look at what this
is going to look like when you're using
so you got a big solar panel right there
on top go ahead and zoom out a little
bit so you can see and this is where all
your charging going to come from you
want to push that back and this is where
your iDevice is going to sit go ahead
and plug it right in pop in the classic
keep it safe and splash guarded and
you're going to be good you can benefit
them sound from
usually two rows of speakers I'll test
this to see how that sounds on the top
you've got your controls power or volume
up and down battery check base I've got
playing pause back again and an M button
I'm not sure what that does but i will
try it and let you guys know let's go
ahead and close this thing back up
thing's gonna be a fun probably great
summer pool companion take out with you
don't have to worry about swapping
batteries and plugging things in when
you're by a pool you know plugging
things in electricity not always the
best combo so this may be a really fun
thing take with you again it's going to
set you back 100 99 bucks you can get it
from the apple store stay tuned for a
full review and I'll show you guys how
it works and we'll see if it's worth
while i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
