TechnoBuffalo here at they for review
for you of the Microsoft Surface pro 3
it's Microsoft's third foray into
creating the perfect tablet laptop
hybrid they always envisioned with
Windows 8 I put through phases for the
better part of two weeks to go and see
if it's worth your laptop tablet buying
buck
let me give my disclaimers I do with all
my reviews I use this as my only
computer and tablet at home and I use it
at the office as well as a secondary
device so I really spent some time with
it to get a chance to know it I've been
a big fan of the surface non RT line
since inception about two years ago I
really like what Microsoft is trying to
do here but those first devices had
issues they had sort of a weird screen
size they had poor resolution that kind
of meant
battery life over time they had kind of
questionable utility in value for the
price now though Microsoft has brought
what I think is the absolute best
representation of Windows 8.1 on the
market but is that good enough for you
and what I keep using this thing so it's
into the tablet let's just start with
this thing the screen I love the bigger
size it's now twelve inches and better
than HD at 2160 by 1440 and it looks
friggin awesome pictures video games
everything looks ridiculous on it when I
went back look to the surface pro 2 just
for comparison it looked beyond last gen
they did sort of a move to 3.2 Stech
ratio it seemed kind of odd seeing at
first but now I totally get it it's
really nice middle ground above portrait
and landscape modes no matter how you
want to use the thing this screen can
compete with the best tablet and laptop
screens on the market and for my money
it looks better than a Retina display on
a macbook pro which previously i think
was the benchmark for laptop screens
design at surface pro 3 is like four
leaps forward can print the surface pro
2 it feels a lot like a thicker tablet
not sort of a thin down squeaky computer
you get a full powerful computer in this
thing i'm you can get it with an i7 chip
although for the price my opinion the i5
2056 gig model that we've got right here
is perfect view more storage though you
can bump it up to 512 gigabyte to pick
between 4 and 8 this guy here has
gigs of RAM but those specs you aren't
really compromising that much with a few
caveats the Microsoft engineers did some
super crazy magic here but they aren't
wizards lack of a dedicated video card
is understandable but that does mean if
you want to play games on better than
low setting to do a lot of video editing
and most importantly exporting this
might not be the best choice if that's
not you though then it D you'll dig this
microsoft claims this is a one device
fits all thing it's a tablet it's laptop
it's kind of both but never the complete
package for either so at home I work a
lot on my macbook pro I work with it on
my lap and like most laptops gets hot so
the surface pro 3 does get hot but not
on the back so it's not gonna vent you
from having kids since you've got it
served up this way and got the keyboard
on your lap Spartans getting hot isn't
touching your skin at all which is kind
of nice but in order to use this thing
as a laptop you need 129 dollar type
cover which really just be included
since without it you're left with kind
of a neutered device no offense Duluth
is looking at me over there typing is a
really nice experience so I want to put
this two together the second magnetic
latch is a huge help I can't overstate
how big difference that makes also
speaking of big differences the trackpad
here is way way way better for use the
trackpad and previous tab covers it was
a mess this one actually works really
well they did they'll get rid of the
left click and right click but instead
we're just clicking around happens to be
near the left or right corners you're
going to get the left or right click
actions kind of a small annoyance you
get used to it but be aware itself that
going to happen with that second hinge
o-type you're on your lap is way more
lap talk like but not exactly there well
rigid the keyboard solo some Gibbs when
you're typing so kind of bends a little
bit don't feel like you've got sort of a
thick piece of metal right there so keep
that in mind in order to work on your
lap though you're gonna get to use that
pretty badass new friction hinge instead
of to predetermine angles you can pick
where you want it to be it's really nice
and just works as advertised the surface
patent is a nice touch rich did a whole
video on that put the link down below
the best pen experience I've ever used
but I still won't use it much so recycle
Microsoft once I'm still bringing a pad
of paper to meetings Microsoft clings
about nine hours battery life - that's
pretty close I was brightness set at
normal setting - using just a regular
computer I went seven days without
charging it and all in now it's probably
just shy
seven and a half hours that was playing
video games
if you stretch this thing out and turn
the brightness down you can easily get
to that nine hour mark or more so nice
they did here sister with a thin device
you can probably get the hint that the
more I use this kind of weird device
more I became enamored with it there in
order to enjoy it though you're
obviously gonna have to like Windows 8
and I've learned to appreciate it if I
was looking at a MacBook Air I'd
seriously consider the surface pro 3
instead it's still more expensive than I
liked the range of 800 to 1950 and
that's before that type cover so this is
hands-down the best Windows 8 Windows
8.1 experience I have ever used I can
wholeheartedly recommend this in fact I
would buy this which is best endorsed
but I can only give to a product it gets
a very solid nine on the TechnoBuffalo
score if I'm thinking about an ideal
world which @m ret to be a perfect
device integrated video card would have
been a really nice option and this thing
would have to be included
I mean it's so silly that's an extra
cost put those two together you've got a
really solid device capable doing ever
you want to do it's got USB ports it's
got output to 4k monitors you can do
anything you want including expandable
storage there's an incredible device and
what I really enjoyed using and I'm
excited to keep using it well passes
tests so many guys think do you agree
disagree left hear your thoughts over in
the comments located right down below so
next time I'm John Ranger from Technion
buffle of course check out SATA
TechnoBuffalo calm till then see you
next video bye bye thank you guys for
watching if you haven't yet please
subscribe we'll be the first one to know
and every upload new content we've got
new stuff coming every single day we
want to make sure you see what's new in
