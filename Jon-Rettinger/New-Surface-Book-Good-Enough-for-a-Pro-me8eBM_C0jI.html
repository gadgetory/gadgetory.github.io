from TechnoBuffalo in about a week and a
half ago john reviewed this the
Microsoft Surface book this one is new
and improved mostly on the internals but
he was reviewing it for more of a
regular consumer standpoint from build
quality to hardware to check the emails
browsing the web for me I use my
computers a little bit differently as
you guys know I do a lot of video
editing video creation photo editing a
lot of media creation so I wanted to see
how this would be for a media creator
like myself or a pro user that's we're
going to be testing out today let's go
and get started so in regards to
internals with processing horsepower
what we're looking at here as an Intel
Core i7 processor clocking at 2.6
gigahertz this model we have is SPECT up
with 16 gigs of ram up to one terabyte
of storage and the dedicated nvidia gtx
and 965 m with two gigs of dedicated
memory in actual practice and me using
adobe premiere mainly it was very very
fast we did a rough comparison between
this and a nearly SPECT up brand new
macbook pro and did an export test of
the same project the service book came
in a minute faster at 7 minutes and 10
seconds which took the MacBook Pro 8
minutes in 10 seconds really unofficial
test but just a rough guesstimate for me
to see how long rendering a project and
exporting it would take on both devices
so the surface book is no doubt fast
it'll be able to handle the majority of
what you throw at it and for me it was
more than good enough I was able to
scrub through 4k video with no problem
trimming editing as quickly as I
possibly could the computer was ahead of
my editing brain which is always what
you want you don't want the technology
to hold you back and it definitely
didn't in this case a couple other
things I like from a hardware standpoint
I was a big fan of the keyboard it's
super super clicky I've heard some
people say it's too stiff I really like
it I think it's a very tactile keyboard
and I got used to it super quickly
outside a video editing everything else
I use this laptop for it was blazingly
quick the point here is that if you spec
this computer up it's going to be one of
the fastest laptops you can buy on the
market which is what you should expect
and is definitely what Microsoft has
delivered here a couple issues I had
with this laptop were on the hardware
side now this comes over from the last
gen because the hardware really hasn't
changed and that issue still remains for
me number one being the hand I just
don't think it's strong enough and part
of the issue is that because the surface
book is a convertible between the laptop
and a tablet there are decent number of
components in the screen the tablet part
which makes it a little too heavy for my
liking so it ends up being kind of
heavy sometimes which is a big reason it
probably flops about like that swing
back to the positive side of things I
really liked having an SD card saw here
wink wink and one of my other favorite
features was the trackpad one of the
best on any Windows machine I have used
so credit to Microsoft there for having
a great trackpad and so that's really it
for the surface book from my perspective
I'm a big fan of the upgrades Microsoft
has made they're very minimally Hardware
they are mostly internal but I think it
makes the experience of using the
surface book much more pleasurable to
very powerful pro level machine and so
if you're going to be using this for
graphic design a lot of photoshop a lot
of video editing media creation I can
confirm that it can do the job and it'll
do it well if the hardware was an issue
for you last generation those issues are
still going to be here so you might want
to look elsewhere but that's it for this
