giant 41 megapixel sensors Valley making
its way into Lumia phone the long lines
and left to itself Mac Pro is finally
coming HTC One might be getting a little
brother and finally the BlackBerry a10
black race next flagship supposedly is
coming sometime this year this rumor
roundup i'm jon rettinger go ahead and
start rounding things up
fresh photos of the Nokia EOS have
leaked online showing the rumor device
in two more color options yay getting us
finally our first look at the handsets
ginormous 41-megapixel PureView camera
you heard me correctly 41 megapixels is
a lot of megapixels the first crop of
lead to Nokia EOS images from gsmarena
they also claimed it a source familiar
with Nokia have confirmed that these are
genuine engineering samples no te O's
expected to feature a 41 megapixel
camera with xenon flash well as a 4.5
inch OLED display with 32 gigabytes
that's right I said giggle of storage
after a promising summer of
announcements the Finnish smartphone
makers expected to unveil the EO
sometime in July's of cameras important
to photo quality is important to you the
PureView camera is the creme de la creme
the cream of the crop of the smartphone
world so guys gonna be coming very soon
so according to video professional
Andrew Baird apple is planning on
introducing and I quote something really
different to its Mac Pro line Baird
apparently managed to spend some time
speak good apples Douglas Brooks the Mac
Pro product manager and was assured the
lack of updates the seemingly forgotten
desktop will be worth the wait Baird
said he'd like to just like to see extra
graphics card support memory expansion
among other features Brooke simply
replied that bear would be very glad you
waited to buy a new Mac Pro tower who
knows that maybe they just put a Haswell
in it they're like yay dunzo we updated
it so have fun be funny if they released
it in black like that was the one Mac
model that finally got the black version
of it I used to love the old black
macbooks that's not to be funny if they
did that made available in different
colors to voters have the long-rumored
HTC one mini also known as the m4 have
leaked online a singly confirming that
the upcoming handset is a mid-range
version of HTC one with a 4.3 inch
screen don't need a website delfy has
posted a series of pictures of the HTC
one mini including several prepare the
smartphone to its great big brother and
my favorite phone out right now still
unconfirmed device is expected to
feature two gigs of ram 16gb internal
storage and dual core processor and
similar the less powerful ultrapixel
camera the gallery suggests the phone
will launch with sense for boo instead
of sense 5 although it's
bit of a bummer but maybe they were just
pre production stuff testing on it and
kind of opeing there's no set release
date or price really can set but we took
at the costs obviously less than HTC One
and come in the coming months blackberry
a10 the company's next big flagship is
supposedly coming this november
according to sources speaking with
scenic the upcoming blackberry 810 will
succeed the z10 and occupy the highest
tier meaning the device will go up
against handsets like a galaxy s4 HTC
one among many many other android phones
Sprint is reportedly first in line to
receive the handset but it's highly
unlikely the Carrie will have exclusive
dibs right now so far device is actually
release we don't really know much about
it or about the 810 specs we saw a
roadmap leaked early in the year but no
mention of the a-10 something that was
on there was the u10 but we don't know
those are the two 20 same devices sprint
allegedly skipped out on the z10 because
it liked how well the 810 was shaping up
hopefully it'll be a bigger screen I'm
hoping that would get some 1080p out of
it um that would be pretty sweet I'm
really enjoying blackberry telling it's
got some crazy courts but I think a
bigger screen and 1080p would really
help push it to the next yeah what do
