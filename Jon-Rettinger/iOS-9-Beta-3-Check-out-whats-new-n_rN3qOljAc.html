to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys the markings hangin from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's video we'll
be taking a look at some of the new
features in iOS 9 beta 3 the new beta
went live for developers this morning
and whether it comes Apple music and a
news app let's take a look at what else
this new beta has to offer the biggest
addition to iOS 9 beta 3 would probably
be the new news app announced at WWDC
the news app will essentially offer a
curated list of new stories based on
your preferences and interests inside
the app there are five tabs to choose
from for you favorite explore search and
save for you will show you all of the
articles and news from all the sources
you chose during the setup process and
will update automatically as new
articles are published favorites will
show you a grid view of the news outlets
that you have selected when setting up
news you can also add new sources from
the explore tab which will show you
suggested news outlets and topics and
will also allow you to browse different
categories in case you're looking for
something specific search you'll be able
to search for certain news outlets and
keywords and save is where your save
articles will live and you can also see
some of the articles you have previously
viewed over all the news app looks
beautiful with nice transitions and
animations and I think it's a great app
to catch up on recent news moving on
Apple music finally made its way to iOS
9 it features beats 1 radio which is a
24-7 live radio that features exclusive
interviews hand-picked songs and
features a variety of hoes we also have
Apple Connect which is a way for artists
you connect with their fans and of
course you'll have access to millions of
tracks with Apple music we did a
separate video about Apple music which
launched at the end of last month so if
you guys haven't seen that yet make sure
to check out that video over here on to
the little changes inside the Settings
app in the music section you now have
the option to stream music at the
highest quality while using a cellular
connection Apple has also introduced a
revamped two-factor authentication
system which apparently uses different
methods to trust devices and deliver
verification codes inside the camera app
Apple decided to disable the volume
buttons to be used as a shutter button
now we're not sure if this is permanent
but we're hoping it's not jumping into
the Photos app there are two new folders
dedicated to selfies yes selfies and one
for screenshots inside the mail app
there are new icons for unread flag and
an archive or delete when swiping left
or right on a message which is a nice
Shin that I personally like since I use
a mail app on a daily basis on the iPad
specifically app folders on the iPad now
displays apps in a 4 by 4 grid instead
of the usual 3 by 3 arrangement allowing
users to see more apps in a folder at a
glance lastly Siri no longer makes her
classic sound when activated again we're
not sure if this will be permanent but
as of now there aren't any settings to
toggle the sound back on you'll now also
get Siri app suggestions when swiping
down from the home screen which is
something that was missing in past betas
