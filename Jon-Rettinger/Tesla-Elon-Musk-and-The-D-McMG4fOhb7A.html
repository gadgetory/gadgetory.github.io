to you by the LG g3 what's up everyone
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here
welcome back to the episode of rumor
roundup this is the show where I usually
talk about miscellaneous apple rumors
some samsung rumors we throw in some HTC
some Android L but not this week this
week it's all about the D so earlier
this week Twitter and SpaceX CEO Elon
Musk put out a post that said about time
to unveil the D and something else let
me just get this out of the way I can't
wait to see Elon's d wonder what Elon's
d is going to look like I'm really
excited about the D is the D gonna be
big how much do you can Elon unveil all
right I got that out of my system I feel
a little bit better I giggled for a lot
that we cut off camera everybody giggled
for a lot here because with a funny
tweet in fact it was so funny that Elon
must said LOL internet you got me
laughing out loud literally I'm glad I
didn't say the other letter so the tweet
they initially put out with the D also
had a pretty ominous sort of image on it
it had a letter D going up on a garage
you can see it right here we're sort of
Tesla light coming out from down below
it so the question is what is the D
jokes aside I've got sort of three ideas
what it could be first the model
actually is a very first signature
edition started shipping at the end of
2012 it's been about a year and a half
and so down the road possibly time for a
mid-cycle refresh in fact current
deliveries of the Model S are we
arriving with options that have not been
announced or not available on Tesla's
website including blind spot detection
Laine keep assist as well as adaptive
cruise control so if those items are
shipping on cars that were not ordered
my thought is probably that those are
going to be standard features on all
model s's which could maybe be that
something else that they're talking
about could also be the production
version the Model X which is supposed to
come out this year is now saying
pretends not to start until 2015 we have
not seen into production versions cars
going to look like we've only seen very
very
very early alpha versions of fact we
were at that launch event looks awesome
at the Falco indoors but nobody knows
the car is going to look like yet people
are still plunking down pre-orders in
fact 20,000 pre-orders for the Model X
have already come out which is
absolutely crazy stop the rumors for one
sec to talk about this guy this is
legitimately my favorite phone of 2014
in fact when I have to pick a camera to
go take pictures of my one-year-old just
going out and about I'll pick this up
over my point and shoot it's got laser
focus if it focuses crazy fast the
pictures look awesome it's got a quad HD
display it's available from very much
every major US carrier the phone is
absolutely gorgeous it's almost edge to
edge screen and my estimation it is the
best looking phone out there and as we
said in our review it is the best
android phone I've ever tested looking
for a new device you want something with
Android you just want the best phone
available definitely check out the LG g3
or it could be the gen 3 card the model
3 which Tesla's thing is gonna be on the
road as early as twenty seventeen so
three years early it could be about time
to show a very early concept of that car
that's the 35 to 40 thousand dollar car
it's going to get about 200 plus miles
of range it's going to really be Tesla
sort of mainstream car the Model X and
model s usually come in around
seventy-five thousand dollars or more so
certainly not for the faint of wallet so
it could be any of those sugar maybe
Tesla's just announcing something
totally different like a pickup truck my
bet though is going to be a retweet
Model S with those things we talked
about perhaps all-wheel-drive the model
xican have all go drive it makes sense
to share that drive train with the sedan
version of the cars are both based on
the same underpinnings I think it should
be pretty cool tesla stock has been
going through the roof we're going to
know all of this information come
October knife I cannot wait to see what
tassels going to do the Elon Musk has
also said and follow ups that the next
year's Model S's can ninety percent of
the time drive themselves maybe we'll
see some sort of autonomous drive stuff
thrown in there as well I don't know
what Elon's d is I don't know Elon's d
looks like I'm sorry I promise I was
gonna stop that I don't know what
they're going to announce I don't know
if they're gonna do but it makes for a
pretty awesome rumor and I can't wait to
see what comes out of the company I know
guys thank you for watching the episode
of
rumor roundup this one was just focused
on the D next time I'll get my mind off
the DL talk about some cellular phones
and some mobile tablets in other words
