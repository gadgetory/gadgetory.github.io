smartphone space it offered near
flagship specs the performance but any
budget price the invite system that came
with it was super frustrating the
oneplus 2 was met with incredibly high
expectations but failed to live up to
the promise of his predecessor how they
do on the third attempt I'm John rende
you from TechnoBuffalo let's find out
how good the 1 plus 3 is I'll try answer
the question would I buy it so before
sitting down and writing my notes for
the 1 plus 3 I used it for 12 full days
as my daily drivers I really got to know
it inside and out usually I like to
slowly build up to my conclusion on
phones but honestly I just love the 1
plus 3 so much I'm gonna just just come
out and say it
i straight-up love this phone it checks
almost every flagship spec at a price of
$400 1 plus taking some heat in the past
for subpar screens but they righted the
ship here the 5.5 inch screen is still
1080p but one of the better displays
I've seen it'd be hard for us to see
much of a difference versus a qHD
display but the trade-off is definitely
worth it for the battery savings with
one giant caveat if you plan on using
your phone for VR you'll definitely want
the extra pixels colors are bright black
to black it's not just a good screen
while they miss the classic oneplus
sandstone I do like the new aluminum
body of the three the bezels look almost
non-existent and oh do I love having a
profile switched on Android device but
in all fairness I know I've been tough
on Apple HTC in the past their antenna
bans and yes those are here and I bagged
on Samsung for the camera humps and yep
this thing got humps too so to be fair
let's just say it's a beautiful package
with some room for improvement with the
Snapdragon 820 and an insane 6 gigs of
ram we'd expect this thing to be smooth
and fast even though not all 6 gigs are
all readily available all the time and
the phone is obviously very fast and
just for a second we acknowledge we live
in a world where 60 gigabytes of RAM
isn't a phone everything you want to do
on this phone is blazing fast opening
apps multitasking playing games you are
never gonna notice a stutter a slowdown
a hiccup or any other word I can think
of this phone is going to be incredibly
fast for use when the fastest phones
that I've ever tested and that includes
the flagship from Samsung and LG I was
little bit bummed out with the lack of
NFC on the oneplus 2 and I was really
happy to see it make a return on the 1
plus 3 so if that was a big raise you
didn't pick up the last gen you will be
happy here looking at the elongated
symmetry you'd probably think to
yourself self pretty awesome expandable
storage to add to my 64 gigabytes
built-in and to you all say no you were
wrong it's actually a dual sim tray the
software makes it really easy to pick
what each sim does for like data and
calling and texting
I've admittedly never really needed to
sit ins in one phone but I know a lot of
markets this is a huge must-have this is
important to you and you're on a teen to
your t-mobile you'll be pretty happy but
if you're on Verizon or Sprint be a
little bummed out looking at the
software side of things you think that
it was mostly stock Android it's
actually one plus his own oxygen OS
based on marshmallow it works really
well and doesn't have much bloat they've
taken let's just say a lot of influence
from other OEMs that had some features
that are surprisingly useful like wave
your hand over the screen of some
notifications
there's night mode here and more make
this phone feel very cyanogen ish which
is not surprising considering the
original oneplus one you say engine I
really appreciated the built in dark
mode the ability to change the on-screen
buttons and capacitive ones and remap
them do whatever you want I just wish
they were actual icons they're just dots
I kept forgetting when I set them for
3,000 million power battery is fine
it'll last you all day but what's crazy
to me is the - charging we've seen fast
charging before but oneplus did rather
what they license is pretty unique so to
quote oneplus - charge carries more
current than other fast reading
solutions at lower temperatures normally
heat generated through charging
dissipated through the phone itself
meaning phone gets super warm this
usually causes performance issues during
active charging so if you're trying to
actually use the phone while it's going
on you'll see the CPU or GPU throttling
by shifting the power management system
and the heat dispersion elements to your
- charger very little he's ever gonna
reach your oneplus is 3 so what that
means is you can still use your phone
and slick the fast charging but it also
means you got to carry that - charging
brick round with you to get the benefit
so cameras a big deal for smartphones
nowadays and our own ROM free - did a
whole video comparing the camera on the
oneplus we to some of the best on the
market watch it
but TL DR or I guess this case he'll DW
cameras really really good it holds its
own against some of the best in the
market so the answer here should be
super obvious from beginning yes I'd
absolutely buy this phone not only when
I buy this phone I'd buy this phone for
everybody who wants to get a new phone
there's almost becoming no reason to
spend more than $400 for smartphone that
is very low sacrifice here at all you're
missing out on 2k you're missing out on
expandable storage and expandable memory
and the omission of waterproofing or
some sort of water resistance is a big
one but those things are not paramount
to you there's almost no nothing to
knock this phone for it's well-built
it's fast screen is good battery life is
solid and charges just stupid fast in
about 30 minutes yet sixty-seven percent
charge on your phone so for me buying
the oneplus is a no-brainer in fact I
will be buying one to use as my daily
phone what do you guys think about the
oneplus 3 or any of those things I
mentioned big emissions a reason for you
not to buy it do you have to have water
resistance get expandable storage
expandable battery I've heard people
screaming for years I want to flag your
phone for a lower price and if you've
been in that camp you have to expect
some sort of sacrifices and I think the
ones that oneplus made were
strategically smart so what about you
guys but I'm generally kind of busy
especially in the mornings I sometimes
forget to eat breakfast and when I do
usually my breakfast is too nonfat Greek
yogurts but I've eaten four I mean
probably the better part of five years
here the folks at Soylent reached out
and said hey do you want to try our
products to see if you like it so I said
sure I've heard a lot about it if you
don't know what Soylent is it's kind of
the galaxy's the easiest meal it's a
meal in a bottle at the Soylent 2.0 all
the ingredients are FDA approved it's
convenient healthy alternative to just a
fast food it's vegan in case that's
important to you put in the fridge open
this up and you get a full calories
worth of meals and full meals worth of
vitamins everything else you would need
from an average meal to get you through
your day in just a few seconds or a
minute depending on how fast we want to
drink it it's been my go-to for
breakfast down for the past almost three
and a half weeks and I'm much more full
than I am after having my Greek yogurts
so if you're traveling you're not be
able to eat on an airplane or if you're
too busy to stop and eat food so islands
are really solid healthy alternative it
tastes pretty neutral nuts by design
it's got a neutral flavor profiles you
