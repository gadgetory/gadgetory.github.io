technobuffalo here we can put another
round or rumors to rest the ipad 2 is
official and has been announced let's go
ahead and run through what you can
expect so the app will keynote just
ended vc me look down i got some notes
in front of me there's a lot to run
through so let's go ahead and get
started a keynote began with steve jobs
coming out on stage looking very good i
came with some sort of boring
announcements at the beginning ibooks
update they've sold over a hundred
million I books they've paid developers
just about two billion dollar so app
stores obviously been a huge success for
them 15 million ipads sold in 2010 and
then we got to the good stuff the ipad 2
just named ipad 2 not ipad 2 g.s just
straight-up ipad 2 the number two it's
going to be powered by a new a5 chip
foose you guys that are keeping track
the previous generation ipad is powered
by an a4 chip and then we saw that a4
chip slowly make its way to the iphone 4
so this new a 5 chip will probably make
its way into next-generation iphone as
well it is dual core as is the trend
nowadays it's gonna give you a 2 times
faster cpus it's going to give you nine
times faster graphics which is pretty
nice the ipad tubes got front and rear
facing cameras we'll talk about that in
just a minute in addition to a gyroscope
from a size standpoint it is
thirty-three percent thinner than the
outgoing generation ways one point three
pounds compared to the current or a
first-generation as 1.5 pounds a little
bit lighter it is eight point eight
millimeters thick compared to the iphone
four is nine point three millimeters so
of course that means it is thinner than
the iphone forward is already an
extremely thin device is going to be
available in two colors i know you're
probably laughing homes you've heard
this before it's going to be available
in black and white and the white unit
will be shipping on day one
we made a point to address that and it's
going to be available on verizon and 18
teen both colors will be available is
going to be just 3g evdo rev a on the
verizon cdma side and just standard 3g
on the AT&amp;amp;T sag so it's going to have
the same 10 hour battery life the ipad
certainly has an outstanding battery so
that's going to continue even with the
newer processor the prices are also
going to remain the same that's gonna be
the same scheme for Wi-Fi versions or
Wi-Fi + 3g versions so if you want to
get the 16 gigabyte model it's going to
be 499 with Wi-Fi or it's going to be
629 with Wi-Fi and 3g the 32 gigabyte
model is going to be 5 99 with Wi-Fi and
it's going to jump 27 29 for Wi-Fi + 3g
sir there's a hundred dollar price
increments from each the 64 gigabyte
model is going to be 699 for just the
Wi-Fi and it's going to be 8 29 for the
model with Wi-Fi plus 3G and a bill to
get yours in stores March 11 it's going
to be shipping to a ton of countries and
is going to be coming to probably the
rest of the world later on in March as
well so March 11th is the date to mark
under calendar for you I had two hungry
folks and they got some kind of neat
specs about it accessories there's going
to be an HDMI video out accessory
something that the ipad 2 certainly
needed it'll output up to 1080p content
pretty eyes it'll work with all the
existing apps so you'll be able to use
any application that you want with full
rotation support you won't have any
setup it's going to be a plug-and-play
fig you can charge it while you're using
it and the accessories going to cost you
39 bucks next I talk about something
that was kind of neat up called Smart
Covers it's sort of a case for the ipad
doesn't cover the back it's actually
just goes right on the front of it it's
kind of like a magnetic flap and if
you've ever used a blackberry for
example when you know the cases that
comes with it when you slide it in
there's a magnet turns it off slide it
up it turns it on save contact with a
flap done
similar things that the outgoing case
did for the first generation you can
move it around and prop it up to view
for typing you can prop it up for
watching a movie again it uses all the
magnets it's got a cleaning cloth sort
of in it so a microfiber cleaning cloth
so it'll also clean it as you put it on
and move it you be able to get it in
polyurethane or leather on a ton of
different colors it's going to be 39
bucks for the polyurethane model or $69
to a leather one actually is this sort
of neat idea it's got magnetic hinges
and all kinds of stuff you see the
picture so you know what I'm talking
about so next they talked about iOS 4.3
and as I mentioned in my previous Apple
rant I was hoping for new features in
iOS 5 they did not announce iOS 5
district incremental upgrades for iOS
4.3 you're going to have improve Safari
performance which is always good you're
going to have some airplay improvements
Oh a large announcement that really wet
without much fanfare as iTunes sharing
and they'll be able to access all of
your iTunes content across Wi-Fi which
is kind of neat you'll have now
preferences on the switch on the side
further either mute or rotation lock so
that's coming back you can pick what you
want for the iphone 4 only for iOS 4.3
you'll have personal hotspot access much
be kind of nice they also announced some
new apps for the iPad to a photo booth
is one of the apps they announce if you
use a Mac you're probably familiar with
the photo booth desktop app very similar
functionality you get all kinds of
different effects then you can tweak
images and do it in real time it's photo
book and then it works on the ipad next
day announced facetime not surprisingly
didn't go with the front and rear facing
cameras you can talk any FaceTime
capable device to the ipad ipad to
iphone for mac to ipad or whatever other
combo you can do they also announced
iMovie for the ipad so you have be able
to airplay that content right to your
Apple TV there's a ton of functionality
or a time movie I can get into real
specifics about it but you get movie
editing and some advanced movie editing
right on your iPad you can share to
multiple places including YouTube Vimeo
Facebook and a few others which is kind
of neat do it
right from the device that's also going
to be available March 11 for 499 they
show GarageBand for the ipad 2 its
GarageBand you if you use to the
application on the mac sort of part of
the ilife suite I'd be able to sort of
touch the instruments are going to be
guitar amp effect 250 plus loops you're
going to be able to email your AAC files
Garage Band and they're evidently a very
proud of GarageBand which spent a long
time talking about it let me run through
specs with you of the ipad t just sort
of recap and what you guys know what
suits back me up some notes in front of
me for this so you're going to get the
same 9.7 inch screen to have a
resolution of 1024 x 768 132 pixels per
inch that's going to be 3g capable as i
mentioned this time for verizon as well
so verizon or t AT&amp;amp;T now get a choice
for your data if that's the model by
juice you're going to get the rear
camera with HD video so I'll shoot video
at 720p at 30 frames per second I have a
five times digital zoom the front camera
is vga resolution that also shoot video
at 30 frames per second ipad 2 is very
much an evolutionary step forward they
didn't add anything that we really
weren't expecting it was very
incremental to say the least so there's
a lot of hope that perhaps they know
it's kind of super early even start
talking about this ipad 3 may be the one
that breaks the mold and sort of
continues to innovate i was hoping that
we get some improved iOS stuff we hoping
we might even have a 4G LTE device but
Apple chose not to go that direction or
couldn't go that direction for price or
technology constraints so what do you
guys think about the ipad 2 is a tablet
you've been waiting for do you think
apple is prepared to go up against at
least for probably the next year with
the current generation of tablet so
we're looking at the zoom the GC light
coming out in the ton of android 3.0
honeycomb tablets are you going to go
and pick up an ipad 2 i'm really curious
to hear from you guys what you want to
see and what you think about and of
course will be doing a full battery of
reviews of the ipad 2 on launch day i am
