brought to you by Squarespace welcome
revision3 and technobuffalo fans to
another edition of ask the Buffalo where
you can ask me anything you want from
the wide wide wide world of technology i
am your host jon rettinger on today's
episode we are going to cover recent
acquisitions recent shutdowns tablets
cell phones and everything in between if
it involves just a little bit of
nerdiness we are going to talk about it
this is asked the Buffalo thank you guys
for tuning in to another edition of ask
the Buffalo you could ask questions one
of two ways either send them to me on
twitter at john for lakers or at
TechnoBuffalo use the hashtag ask the
bee and ask away otherwise once a week
you can find the article up on
TechnoBuffalo com soliciting questions
for these ask the Buffalo serious and go
ahead and leave your question down below
in the comments so without further ado
let's go ahead and start answering damn
questions the first question comes to us
from max Kissel who asks hey John I read
in the newspaper today about Google
buying motorola do you think the next
Nexus phone will turn out to be for
Motorola and why well Google announced
their intent to purchase motorola
mobility to the vision of motorola that
makes handset without getting all
legally and business e the deals already
done all parties have signed off on it
now just has to get through regulators
it's gotta go through antitrust lawyers
antitrust governmental agents and a ton
of other in-betweens before it gets
approved what does this mean for the
next Nexus phone well we actually broke
a story recently on technobuffalo calm
talked about the nexus prime we had
sources inside of Verizon and inside of
Samsung that confirmed that verizon will
indeed be getting their next edition
of the Nexus phone dubbed the nexus
prime with we're told larger than a 4.5
inch screen and a 720p display so we're
talking big phone with big specs also
going to be the first phone rocking ice
cream sandwich and we're hearing an
October launch date and it will still be
built by Samsung this deal just went
through or at least is trying to get
through in the middle to late August
certainly a phone that is scheduled for
release in October has been development
for months and months and months prior
so perhaps the next Nexus phone I'm not
the nexus prime perhaps the Nexus
Megatron will indeed be made by motorola
what's that's going to mean for the rest
of the Android industry has yet to be
seen certainly android is still open any
manufacturer can take the top ring
system and put it on their handset so
we're still going to see HTC android
phones so i'm going to see LG android
phones and the rest of the companies we
are still going to see those devices so
don't fret our next question comes to us
from twitter from tree dude 217 who asks
would you ever consider making a
european version of TechnoBuffalo we
actually just brought on a european
writer nikhil Ian Bell who's going to
focus on all kinds of european news so
for all european carrier information
cell phones and tablets we're going to
have a cover now thumbs up for that and
in fact as you guys are watching this
video I am in Europe right now I'm on my
way to the IFA show in berlin to bring
you the latest from the world of
technology so we'll have a ton of
european news being covered little few
little stopovers before i get there but
i am trying to get in touch with my
European friends so our next question
comes for us from Twitter once again
from user Sonic Corp who asks this is
the most asked question of the week John
what are your thoughts on HP
discontinuing the touchpad and webos
devices dumb
web OS is dead a mere 49 days after
launching the touchpad is now obsolete
some would argue might have been
obsolete at launch I like this little
guy I thought it had a lot of potential
I've been a big supporter of webos since
day one I actually waited in line the
night before the original pre launched
on sprint to get a device I've been a
supporter of it I've loved it our own
Noah Kravitz loves it and it's sad what
HP is done to it they discontinued the
webos hardware division the dead so does
that mean we're not going to see any
more web OS devices maybe HP you killed
them certainly makes sense for HP to
license webOS HTC has been rumored to be
interested for quite a bit Samsung
perhaps I wouldn't keep your fingers
crossed I think we've probably seen last
of the web OS devices and even before
the pre three saw an official launch we
saw it on the european store supposedly
getting ready to launch in the US on a
few different carriers but no more no
more webOS so you can now own a piece of
technology history and you can pick up a
noun discontinued HP touchpad for 99
bucks which is a pretty sick deal for
some reason to expect to hardware I love
the browser on here thought it was one
of the best flash implementations that
I've seen and it's sad sad sad what
happened to this poor guy so if you're
lucky enough you can go out and pick up
on HP TouchPad for 99 bucks just don't
expect many new apps for it so I want to
take a few minutes to thank our friends

services alright so our next question
comes to us from nathan l10 who asks
John what do you think is the best
tablet of the to the tmobile G slate or
the samsung galaxy 10.1 what we've
tested both of these guys here at
TechnoBuffalo they're both a bit unique
t-mobile g slate kind of interesting
it's got that 8.9 inch screen it does
have three deal you gotta wear those
glasses and the samsung galaxy 10.1 is
one of the finished tablets i have ever
tested actually probably one of the best
tablets on the market while the t-mobile
g slate is a fantastic tablet it's hard
to beat the galaxy tab 10.1 arguably the
best tablet out there period certainly
in my opinion definitely the best
android tablet out there probably a
little bit ahead of the asus eee pad
transformer so samsung galaxy pad 10.1
is the way to go alright so our last
question comes to us from twitter user
mr. nasty who asked John what is a
coolest phone or prototype you've ever
seen that hasn't been released yet well
I'm glad you asked that question
actually have it right behind me I
haven't shown this to anyone yet I
thought I kind of debuted here in
revision 3 let me go ahead and show you
what it is
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
