TechnoBuffalo here this does not look
like a BlackBerry yet it now has one of
BlackBerry's best features for free and
that is bbm let me give you a hands-on
tour of bbm for Android iOS
all right so BPM is a free application
you can download it from the Google Play
or the App Store I'm showing it here on
Android go ahead and download and
install one thing to notice though
you're gonna get that bbm icon then is
always gonna show up in your app drawer
if you use Android you cannot get rid of
it as long as the app is open which is
really annoying so there is the icon go
ahead and open it up it looks like a
very familiar layout that's what we saw
on BB 10 devices but you've got a grid
of icons across the bottom chats
contacts groups and then settings so
I'll give a quick rundown of what a chat
looks like I've got Brandon Russell here
I sit in the office I'll go ahead and
send him a bbm I will say hi I noticed
that you can send your contact
information you could touch a file ball
you can attach our pictures galleries a
voice notes you can't share screens or
anything quite yet or even video but
hopefully that will be coming very soon
we'll go ahead and hit Send and it goes
off when you get that D next let you
know it's delivered and it'll change to
an R like it just did letting us know
that Brandon has received it presumably
he will reply there we go
hi handsome but you don't get any
medication that he's typing but he'll
see on his screen the D icon turned to
our you've got a ton a smiley faces to
choose from so if you're big into emoji
and stuff you're going to be quite the
happy person if you slide on over you
can see your contact group so there any
updates someone change a picture change
location or any invites you scroll on
over there speaking of invites if you go
into settings here I'll show you how
that works gonna go to pull us off the
side for a quick second you come back in
you get settings invite to bbm start
multi-person chat invite is pretty
familiar to anybody who's used bbm we do
it by a barcode scan this is pin based
right now and download the application
let's get to put in your email address
and then login to your BlackBerry World
account but this is still pin based you
get a brand new pin if you don't already
have one and it is one account per
device so you can't have the same bbm on
several different phones you guys sort
of log out and then relog in again go
ahead and cancel will jump into settings
here I'll show you again what those look
like pushed off to the side will come
right back in you get a ton of options
here to customize what you want save
chat history show
our keyboard contacts layout and all
kinds of other stuff here edit blocked
contacts and the rest of that will go
back then that's a pretty standard chat
application you have to invite your
friends they have to accept the
invitation and come in if you use bbm
for work or on a previous device you're
gonna love this
I can send from Android iOS or vice
versa or to any BlackBerry device
obviously it's now cross-platform it
seems to work very well so it's been a
really quick overview of bbm for not
blackberry what's up everyone its Ashlee
