her from technobuffalo com and i've got
an email that somebody sent me I'm
embarrassed to say this but a while ago
it was in 2011 but not very far into it
so I apologize it's taken me so long to
finally do this I got this email from
Nick and I emailed him back and said you
know this is the kind of thing that I've
been asked a lot and you know John and
and lots of people I know who are tech
journalists tech reviewers youtubers to
do tech stuff it been asked the same
question a bunch and so I'm going to do
a video on it or a series of videos or
something and I've been meaning to do it
it's just taking me till now to finally
start doing it so Nick I apologize but
hopefully better late than never
hopefully everybody else you know I
cannot provide some insight for you and
well just going to read the email mr.
Kravitz no please call me Nick I've been
watching you for years and I loved all
of your videos on phone dawg you always
made that personal connection with your
viewers that I don't get a blowout skip
that part I've also been watching John
for lakers and the soldierknowsbest for
the same amount of time and I've always
loved you and them I'm excited now that
you are all part of the herd yeah me too
and I'm looking forward to seeing more
of your videos I'm a sophomore in high
school and started tech reviewing
YouTube channels my friend right now our
reviews are pretty much just pictures
with our voice over because we can't get
any products my question to you is what
advice do you have for us how can we
expand the number of subscribers we have
how can we get products thanks for
taking the time to read this sign Nick
yeah Nick I took the time to read it I
took the time to email you back but
apparently it took me a long time to
find the time to actually answer the
questions so PS here is the link to my
youtube channel youtube.com slash
trusted tech reviews so there you go
there's a little plug from Nick's site
you can go check that out everybody if
you want to or not
so I might try to start answering this
question obviously you know my
experience is my opinions whatever
different than other people's so
definitely gonna follow up this video or
the other videos definitely going to get
John to lend you know some of his
insights as well because it's something
that that we've been wanting to do in
something that you know whether he's a I
when I left phoneDog back in last
October so you know i was at phoneDog
somebody you don't some of your like why
are you on johnson she have a weird one
over that I'm pretty left phoneDog I
wasn't looking to start up with another
side or anything like that I just I
needed a break from a bunch of different
things but one of the things that
attracted me to taking this gig with
TechnoBuffalo I've known John for a
while I think the world of them but we
talked a lot about wanting to do stuff
not just reviewing products but also
doing more stuff with the audience and
with people who you know are interested
in doing stuff like what we do because
the opportunities for doing this have
just grown enormously with the internet
you know it's so easy to start a blog
start a YouTube channel it's hard to
make a living doing it but it's easy to
start which is really cool so I'll
definitely you know get John on camera
other people as well and get more you
know more information and insight from
other voices if that's interesting to
you guys to hear more about this but for
me to try to answer next question here's
what I would say first off you know how
do you increase your number of
subscribers there are people on YouTube
who know way more about that than I do
with phoneDog we just started doing the
videos it wasn't something a lot of
people were doing back when we start
doing the videos a lot of there are
sites out there other phone sites that
you know had been along around from
longer were better known than we were
obviously other tech blogs and that kind
of thing but not all that many people
doing YouTube videos in phones in
particular and I've always been
interested in video making and it's just
something I wanted to do is actually at
a show at the CTI trade show and they
had a big these big posters up for this
contest they were having them the video
chronicles submit your video journal of
the show and I had a little point and
shoot camera at shot like 30 second peg
clips and I'm the worst photographer
probably in the whole tech blogosphere
and I was taking photos of the
phones the new phones to put them on the
blog and I started shooting some video
clips just for fun there was a guy
dressed up in a big black berry costume
like a life-size you know like a mascot
trussed up like a blackbird so I took
some video of him I thought it was funny
and I saw these signs for the contest
and I kept going I shudder bunch of
video and on the plane ride home I took
out my laptop flying home from Orlando
it was in Orlando that you're back to
California and start editing this video
together and it was just really fun and
so I entered the contest I won the
contest because nobody else entered and
and then we started doing these YouTube
videos and if you go back and look on
the crabby crab channel these first
youtube videos I mean I think they're
all pretty funny you know the first one
is the last one for the first ones
definitely funny i shiny this thing
called phone in 60 seconds and you know
do the whole review in 60 seconds to
give it like a story and a theme and I
quickly learned and here's the
long-winded first part of my answer to
you I quickly learn you know give the
people what you want if you're
interested in in in growing your
subscriber base now that could be
finding your own unique style for doing
things ah maybe you're funny maybe
you're a developer and you have insight
into that kind of stuff maybe you get
all that you know somehow you have a
hook up to get all the hot stuff before
it comes out you know maybe you've got a
camera planted in Google's labs I don't
know but so one thing is you know to
give the people what they want while
still being true to yourself and for me
that turned into finding you know the
best way to talk about these phones
because that's why I got him to do in
this but I thought it was really cool
did all these new phones and you know
back then a few years ago especially the
poser is getting more and more advanced
all the times new features and you know
the industry grew so fast and so that
quickly turned into basically just a
little intro than the phone on camera
and me talking about the phone you know
I never did videos like this was just me
talking into the camera or rarely
sometimes we did but but mostly it was
you know the phone on camera than me
just given my kind of honest opinion
marketing yourself you know learning
youtube search engine optimization how
to use tags all that kind of stuff is
important I'm not an expert on that but
we'll try to get some people in here you
are
you know building your subscriber
following on YouTube again their
strategies for that partnering with
other sites find other channels you like
do things but you where I still phonedog
john and i did a thing or we traded
videos you know i appeared on his
channel and he on ours and that helps
kind of open you up to you know new
subscribers if your video shows up in
somebody else's channel maybe some of
those people will then go subscribe to
you definitely having a website so you
can you know show up in regular Google
and other search engine results
definitely helps because that can drive
traffic back to youtube and then there's
Facebook and Twitter which are huge sort
of you know in themselves and getting
involved in that stuff so it's
definitely more than just you have to
make the videos and whether it's good
because you're great on camera or it's
good because you're great special
effects or it's good because you get
products and people want see the
products whatever it is you have good
content but then you have to know you
have to be doing all these things you
know again youtube search and subscriber
strategies website you know social media
all that different stuff definitely
helps as far as getting the product so
people always ask me if they always ask
Jonathan sabra's how do i get the
products just go get him don't worry
about it don't worry about approaching
the company's it's harder now than it
used to be because there's so many more
sites doing video and reviews who want
products to review and we'll talk about
that a little bit later but the first
thing you need to do is just get
products and review them you know borrow
when I first started with with phoneDog
i would get even before that when i was
writing for a website called powerbook
central and now we didn't do video stuff
then but to get stuff to review you know
sort of two strategies one is contact
the companies and ask them for stuff to
review but that's kind of harder second
is just get it so buy it or borrow it or
trade for it or you know whatever it is
you want to do at phoneDog at the
beginning i would borrow phones from
people and you know i'd have to like
give them my phone so they could use
them we would swap sim cards and
whatever and i play with their phone you
know for a few days so i could write a
review because you can't really
a good review you know just after five
minutes using it or I would buy a phone
and then resell it used either on eBay
or Craigslist or something like that I
would trade phones I went on like
howardforums all the time and traded
phones through the mail with people
sometimes I would buy a phone from a
carrier and you have like that 30-day
window and you can return it and then I
would return it which you can't do too
many times because look at John but you
have to just find a way to do it I'm not
saying go spend all your money go broke
you know whatever don't run up a credit
card bill but you have to you have to
put some effort into it to get started
and then once you have you know
following which you have some
subscribers some views that kind of
thing it's easier when you start
emailing the companies and calling the
companies and asking for review stuff I
would say don't start trying to get
phones from verizon start with
accessories start with apps because
these smaller companies are more likely
to send you stuff they need the
publicity more their products are often
you know less expensive a verizon
sending you a phone especially if it has
service on it is a lot riskier than a
case company sending you a case because
the case is worth less the services you
know there's no service on a case that
kind of thing it's less of a risk so you
also when you approach these companies
you have to be professional you know
write a good email get somebody to help
you with it make sure the spelling and
the grammar is correct you know sell
yourself to them but make it short and
to the point tell them why it is you
know they should send you something and
then when you're done send them a link
to it you know it building these
relationships with people is really
important whether it's viewers or the PR
people at the companies or you know
whoever it is also you know if you're
thinking about getting started on this
just yourself get a partner get a couple
of partners you know partner up with
some other small sites and work together
and post each other stuff and you know
you're really just trying to build
audience and you know you see on the big
blogs we report on on different
companies I mean big bugs bugs bigger
than TechnoBuffalo you having gadgets
and gizmos and cnet's of the world you
know they'll report a story that was on
somebody else's blog and give a link
back because that's how the web works
and you know again you can do that on
YouTube was kind of guest
appearances on different people's
channels and stuff and then you can do
that you know on the web on twitter by
link sharing and all that kind of stuff
as well and that's that's really
important because you know the nice
thing about the web is most of its free
for people to read so yeah technobuffalo
is in competition with you know whoever
with into mobile but also if somebody's
really into phones they can read both of
our sites they can read into mobile you
know and SlashGear whoever because
they're free and so you know it's
competition but it's also working
together sharing links and that kind of
thing and that's why it's called the web
because it's all kind of intertwined
like that what else what else can I tell
you about growing subscribers in that
kind of thing you know if you're really
you're really into this also with your
reviews you you want to make you need to
practice you need to make sure that you
know again whatever it is you're doing
is working for the audience so you know
like i said i first started out trying
to do these things it was like a little
theme and a little story and it was
either i tried to be funny or i was
trying to like you know i would shoot
them in different places the first video
ever did first one review was in my
backyard and then i did one like in
front of the TV with mtv on behind me
because about a music fo and i did these
different things and that was fun but
then i noticed that that didn't affect
the view count what affected the view
count was how interesting and unique was
the content so again sometimes that's
getting a phone first sometimes it's
just reporting on something unique and
maybe it's an app apps or cheaper than
phones easier for you to get a hold of a
bunch of apps to try out you know maybe
it's something about you know routing an
android phone or jailbreaking an iphone
or maybe it's a how-to maybe you can do
a tutorial to help solve some problem
like you know how do i just got a
blackberry for the first time how do i
use it you have to be creative and think
of those kinds of things and and then
promote yourself send the links out
don't spam people but send them go to
sites that you read bigger sites and
oftentimes they'll have a little thing
that says send us tips technobuffalo
does send us the tips and you know odds
are not very many your tips are going to
get published but if one of them does
that could really help that could really
give you a little jolt to traffic that
will really you know help you out to
that end I'll TechnoBuffalo on our
website we have a lane
you know asking for user submitted
content we're really into that we do a
lot more stuff for that in the next
couple of months but you know we're
looking for good stuff all the time so
definitely send your stuff to bigger
sites and see if you know see if they'll
publish it see if somebody will write
back and give you an idea for something
they would publish you know that kind of
thing you really you have to you just
have to keep pounding the pavement as
they say don't get discouraged if you
know you think you've done something
awesome and it gets like five views
because the next thing you do just might
happen to hit on you know what the
public's interested in trying to go to
events if you can especially if you live
near a place like San Francisco or New
York City where there are lots of tech
events shoot video you know different
places go to if there's an apple store
or you have to ask for permission at the
stores but if their tech events or even
if it's not like a huge trade show but
it's like a local tech club or something
interview different people when you
interview people then those people will
come to your site to check out the video
they'll tell their friends that kind of
thing and that's how things start to
grow you know the whole social
networking is through telling other
people so I don't know it's been 14
minutes and be going like that and
talking a lot but I finally wanted to
start answering Nick's question and
wanted to throw this out to everybody
out there watching you know like I said
definitely going to get John on camera
here should I get a few other people I
know both from the mobile tech world but
also just the tech world in general talk
about this stuff yeah how do you grow an
audience video wise and also other you
know otherwise how do you get products
to review all that kind of stuff but
really you just have to start and you
have to start but you have to keep doing
it and if it's something you really want
to do you know you're going to find a
way to do it I'm not saying you know if
you're you know if you're an adult and
you have a job and you have rent to pay
in bills to pay I'm not saying go quit
your job and just start doing YouTube
24-7 because it takes a while it's hard
to make a living doing doing YouTube and
amassing if you're a kid blow off your
homework and just do this what I am
saying you know find a way to do it and
keep doing it and try different things
and just trying to get better and better
at it and you know that's how you get
started so I hope that was helpful at
least a little bit Nick thanks for the
question and out people out there if you
know
their stuff you want you want to know
about specifically about this whole tech
long thing you know put your questions
in the comments put them on the website
and you know we're going to do this with
this for a little while and try to share
some of our experience with it i don't
know if it's wisdom john as wisdom i
don't know if i have wisdom but I'll
sure what we know alright so next time
my name is Noah thanks for watching and
it's almost NBA playoff time go next I
live in California the warriors aren't
going to be in the playoffs but I used
to live in New York always be a Knicks
fan go Knicks till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
