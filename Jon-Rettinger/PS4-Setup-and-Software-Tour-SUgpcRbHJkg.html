already unboxed it and now we're gonna
bring you a UI tour we've got a
PlayStation 4 in office it's great I've
got a DualShock 4 in hand we've already
synced it we've already done all the
things but we do have some updates that
we need to do so let's get started with
the PlayStation 4
ok so we've started our set up and it's
asking us to connect our playstation
camera which we don't have so we're
gonna go ahead and skip that we're gonna
set our date and time so we're gonna
look for our - 8:00 Pacific time and
select date and time all of that looks
right so let's go ahead and hit next I
obviously got your lovely lovely user
agreements I read really fast so I'm
gonna read through this whole thing
really quickly everything looks pretty
good and I'm gonna go ahead and accept
it at the bottom really fast reader I
see and that's it set up your ps4 is
complete it's super easy and then once
you do that we're gonna walk right into
the UI so this is the new home hub for
your PlayStation 4 it's a little
reminiscent of your PlayStation 3 but
there's definitely a lot more sort of
graphics on your screen you don't have
to worry about you know lists and lists
and lists of things which was a little
frustrating in the PlayStation 3 we can
sign in to the PSN which we'll do in a
second here is your screen this
obviously looks very familiar from your
PlayStation 3 menu
here's your friends messages parties
profile trophies and your settings
obviously here's your power button and
the PlayStation Store all the way on the
left so let's head into settings and
just take a look at what we have
available to us they do have a user's
guide available on board which is very
nice your PSN settings data handling
notifications your login settings you
can set up parental controls if you're
buying a ps4 for your kid and what a
lucky kid they are at this holiday
season so good on you for being an
awesome parent application save data
management system storage system
software updates which we are actually
going to do we're gonna get this system
software update going but we have to set
up our
Network first so let's connect to the
Internet so we're gonna do that it's
gonna check for our connection it's
gonna test it there we go it's been
successful so our connection test is now
complete and there is our very first
notification a system software update
that is our day one patch so we're gonna
go back and check that out
so I went back too far so let's go into
settings and the let's hit up that
lovely system software update so here's
your system software update available
one point five we're gonna hit next
and we are going to update that so here
it is three hundred twenty three
megabytes we have a relatively fast
connection here so it's gonna be about
ten minutes and then it's gonna restart
a couple of times so when that's done
it'll probably take about twenty minutes
total maybe a little less to get
everything up and running with the day
one patch us we're gonna do that and
then we're gonna come back and we're
gonna check out the UI all right so
we're back welcome back to PlayStation
at the PS button use the controller it's
wanting to know who's using the
controller we're just gonna say user one
for right now it wants us to sign into
PSN which of course is central to your
PlayStation experience you're gonna want
to download games and all that stuff so
we are going to sign in with our ID and
password but you can't look so we'll be
right back
so as you're logging into everything
with PSN you have some privacy options
you can choose who you want to share
your activity information with you can
choose who you want to share your
friends list with and of course it's
gonna want you to log in with Facebook
so if you have facebook you can log in
but if not you can just choose to do
this later so it also wants you to join
PlayStation Plus but on PlayStation 4
you're gonna need it to have online
multiplayer you're still going to get
those really cool free games that
PlayStation Plus has offered
historically which is great but the good
news is if you get a ps4 right now and
the launch window you're gonna get a
free trial of PlayStation Plus which is
pretty cool so you can sign up for
either 12 3 or 1 month memberships
depending on what you want to do there
are codes to redeem we do have one so
we'll go ahead and sign up for that when
we have our accounts logged in here at
the office but I'm gonna skip it for now
and you can actually activate a system
as your primary ps4 so base
this is the part of the system where if
you activate this particular console as
your primary ps4 every user on this
system is going to have access to the
applications and different things that
you get with PlayStation Plus however if
you log into a system that is not your
primary ps4 so let's say you log in as a
user on your friend's ps4 because you
want to access something you will only
have access to the stuff you've bought
you will not have access to somebody
else's PlayStation Plus all their stuff
you won't have access to that at all so
if you but on PlayStation 4 you're gonna
need it to have online multiplayer
you're still gonna get those really cool
free games that PlayStation Plus has
offered historically which is great but
the good news is if you get a ps4 right
now in the launch window you're gonna
get a free trial of PlayStation Plus
which is pretty cool so you can sign up
for either 12 3 or 1 month memberships
depending on what you want to do there
are codes to redeem we do have one so
we'll go ahead and sign up for that when
we have our accounts logged in here at
the office but I'm gonna skip it for now
and you can actually activate a system
as your primary ps4 so basically this is
the part of the system where if you
activate this particular console as your
primary ps4 every user on this system is
going to have access to the applications
and different things that you get with
PlayStation Plus however if you log into
a system that is not your primary ps4 so
let's say you log in as a user on your
friend's ps4 because you want to access
something you will only have access to
the stuff you've bought you will not
have access to somebody else's
PlayStation Plus all their stuff you
won't have access to that at all so if
you have a multi let's say you're in a
frat house or you have friends you live
with your friends you only want your own
account activity with your PlayStation
Plus then you don't want to make this
your primary ps4 and then every user
will have their own separate memberships
applications benefits all that stuff
alright so we are logged in we're gonna
be able to check out all the great
things now this is this is where it gets
really exciting we've got TV and video
already
you can download pretty much anything
here really like the format of these
these are really nice large icons so you
can see what you're downloading it's not
really really tiny or in any way shape
or form subtle which I actually really
like you can have your videos here
here's where your musics going to be
however you're not going to be able to
put in a CD in the PlayStation 4 that's
one thing that is not available to you
know external media playback so you're
gonna have to get your music from Sony
Music Unlimited although to be fair
Yoshida has said that they are looking
into being able to use external media so
that may come in a later update there's
also the trophy system one of the things
they've added if you want to check out
Dragon Age Origins they've actually
added rarity markers so you can see
right here ultra rare 1.4 percent of
players have completed this particular
trophy which is obviously all of the
other trophies so you can tell why it's
rare this one's common obviously the
human noble origin story from Dragon Age
Origins 56 percent of gamers have
completed this I this game many many
years ago but you can see there are some
rare trophies that have been unlocked
and very rare there's ultra rare so I
really like this sort of rarity system
that they've added they sort of pulled
this in as a feature that other people
have enjoyed on other platforms steam in
particular so very very cool that's it
for our tour if you enjoyed it give us a
thumbs up we are dying to know what you
