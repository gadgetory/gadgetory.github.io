the stars on my content so you won't be
seeing a lot of my face in my videos so
the name is lots of all kiddin I live in
Finland and a background in education in
advertising and video production I've
been making video reviews from my own
site techno review com for a while now
and been having a lot of fun making them
I don't take things too seriously and I
try to have a little fun with my content
finish it fatality
so how'd the story with me and
TechnoBuffalo get started well I was
contacted by Brandon and John during the
summer with the proposition of joining
forces with TechnoBuffalo now this was
an offer I could not refuse I've been a
fan of both of these guys since long
before meeting them and it was nice to
hear that the feeling was mutual so in
short by now part of the TechnoBuffalo
staff i'll be making tech related videos
and reviews on a weekly basis i'll also
be making gaming relative videos from a
tech enthusiast up to come stay tuned
and feel free to ask me any questions if
you have and i'll try to answer the best
I can so catch you later LP signing out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
