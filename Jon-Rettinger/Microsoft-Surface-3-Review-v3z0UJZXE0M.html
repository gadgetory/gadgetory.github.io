TechnoBuffalo here to review for you of
Microsoft's latest tablet that this
little guy is the surface 3 and don't
let its minute of stature fool you it is
a pretty capable computer the model we
are checking out it's got a quad-core
1.6 gigahertz Intel Atom processor 4
gigs of RAM 128 gigs of SSD storage I
did show 110 available it's going to
cost about $600 there are other options
available 64 gigs 2 gigs of ram and LTE
options back and forth for starting
price of just under 500 so there's a lot
to like about this guy let me run
through the specs real quickly and then
we'll jump into the review it weighs
1.37 pounds the iPad air 2 for example
weighs point nine six pounds so not a
big difference at all between those two
when it comes to weight except with this
you are getting a full functioning
version of Windows 8.1 not RT you are
getting the full desktop the full modern
UI absolutely everything Windows can do
you are getting with this and of course
when Windows 10 comes out it's got a ten
point eight inch screen in nineteen
twenty by twelve eighty resolution and a
three by two aspect ratio it does have
surface pen support if you like that
from the surface pro 3 that does not
come include you gotta buy that separate
it's got ports aplenty it's got a full
size USB 3.0 port a mini DisplayPort
microSD card slot for external storage
and one of the cool things I did at this
actually charges now via micro USB so
you can use the same charging cord that
you use for your phone so when you
travel and after brain there's a ton of
cables and power bricks with you that's
also going to come with a full year of
office 365 the first question we had the
Surface three was you know what can it
do it's writing Intel Atom processor is
it as capable as we think it might be is
it just knocked me it'll do anything we
did a full video testing everything I
was capable of we tested gaming we
tested photo editing video editing HD
and 4k playback and multitasking I want
to see that at the link down below but I
will cliff note it for you it actually
handled it all handle it all pretty well
for your professional video editor you
might not want to consider this is a
primary machine but if you do casual
video editing you do casual photo
editing you want to use some casual
minecrafting this is going to be a
really capable computer and actually
much more in I thought it was go
wanna be a few differences here versus
surface pro 3 it's got any three-point
kicks dad now it does it the sweet spots
but I do wish dad the same hinge
mechanism where you can really stop it
anywhere at the surface pro 3 had type
cover is at this point a must-have
accessory it's a really good typing
experience and I will say having used
and owning a macbook it is way better
than the macbook keyboard and again I
want emphasize this is running real
Windows so anything Windows can do this
is going to be able to do for you're not
getting a neutered OS you're not getting
OS it designs just for media consumption
you're getting something that you can
actually work on and enjoy content from
the screen looked really good had a
pretty good viewing angles not so great
though in direct sunlight certainly the
higher resolution screen and the bigger
screen the surface pro 3 is superior but
for the price I had no issues at all
screen on this guy the big question for
me about the surface 3 is is it worth
the cost keep in mind the type cover is
going to cost hundred twenty-nine bucks
the pen if you want to use it section
$50 there's a document for $200 our
whole review kit came in at just under
$1000 if you're wondering what the
surface pro 3 is going to start at
that's about $800 for ni3 so the
question is is this a good value that's
going to depend really on you and what
model you want to get if you're a
college student I could really see
picking on these up taking with you
where you want to go being able to type
getting free office on board playing
some minecraft and some light gaming is
a really good choice you're a frequent
traveler it's a really good choice I
think the biggest competition for the
surface 3 is the surface pro 3 which now
even late into its lifecycle is still a
really good tablet and computer I will
say though I could certainly see myself
picking one of these up for travel
experience not picking one of these up
if I want to have a docking station at
work and take something with me it is
surprisingly capable and worked way
better than expected I've long been a
fan of the surface liner since the
original surface pro and this is a nice
iteration of what that started my nepia
is capable of surface pro 3 but if
you're not doing hardcore editing or
doing sort of hardcore processing it's
going to do what you want it to do you
think your cross your up in with
something like the iPad air to keep in
mind what this can do versus what the
iPad air can do if you want to live
inside of Apple's ecosystem you want to
mostly do media consumption iPad so a
great way to go
if you want to create media you want a
full-fledged OS it's really hard to look
past the surface three if you can deal
with the price and the price is not an
issue for you I can absolutely recommend
at the surface three we should review
this as the surface bro
it's like sup sup hit the bars no
regrets bro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
