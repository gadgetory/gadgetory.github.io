brought to you by audible and my awesome
announcing voice well how's it going
there it's John Q here from
technobuffalo and welcome to what's the
apps i am a movie guy no i'm not but i
do like watching movies today we're
going to be checking out an application
that can stream movies right from your
computer onto your iOS device and this
guy is called VLC streamer hmm you heard
me right VLC that awesome video playing
application with the traffic cone icon
look there it is not too sure if this
application is directly related to VLC
but it's equally as epic in a nutshell
VLC streamer streams movies from your
compy onto your iOS thingy over Wi-Fi
granted if you had a netflix account you
can just stream content right onto your
iphone or ipad but as a Canadian I must
say that our netflix election is pretty
bad i mean it's a little insulting that
i'm paying what 10 bucks a month for
stuff like Dora the Explorer 1994
documentaries about whales and stuff
although whales are pretty cool I must
say no scratch that whales are cool
anyways VLC streamer also comes in handy
if you don't want to use the ball of
your internets kind of big deal here in
canada because you know our data and our
bandwidth is cat but bed that that's
fine that's fine it's fine moving on you
just browse to where you store all of
your movies select it choose the quality
you want and bam we're off you might be
thinking well where did you get all them
movies from pirates of the caribbean
caribbean crew been scandalous nowadays
a lot of movies come with digital copies
which in theory is handy but i've never
done it I've tried but the process is
just stupidly complex I feel like
ripping them has always been the best as
I can play them whenever I want to
without having to pop in the DVD it's
definitely annoying if you're
marathoning harry potter or something
and you just got to keep on popping in
and taking out the DVDs which I did
because I just had a harry potter
marathon and i haven't ripped any of
these guys yet but speaking of harry
potter a big downside of this
application is that you can't stream
dvds loaded onto your computer I don't
blame it though as it does seem a little
complicated I mean just look at these
file names she's another quirk is that
if you've loaded the movie for
the very first time you can't really
fast forward it it's got a buffer and
render but I've never really had a
problem with it just letting it play
something that impressed the heck out of
me with this application would be that
it sync between your iOS devices thanks
to the desktop client by that I mean if
you load up a movie with your iPhone
you'll be able to see it in your iPad's
list and oh yeah PS full iphone and ipad
support and all of the buffering and
rendering and stuff happens on the
desktop so if you load up everything
ahead of time you won't need to wait to
watch your favorite scenes Oh Guido my
goodness I love Guido stay you can also
change the quality of the streams
although you really won't need to over
strong Wi-Fi connection oh my goodness
look at that happy gilmore don't look
too happy right now lalala so cheesy
speaking of happy gilmore audible.com is
the leading provider of downloadable
digital audiobooks and spoken word
entertainment audible has over seventy
five thousand titles to choose from to
be downloaded to your ipod or mp3 player
and played back anywhere anytime choose
from books in every genre science
fiction thrillers dramas comedy business
history and more personally I think
audiobooks are pretty cool for me what
I'm doing work or whatever on my
computer I like playing an audiobook in
the background so it's like I'm reading
indirectly so all the info and all the
content sinks in but i can pay attention
and do something else and it makes you
feel good about myself because you know
it's reading related and i don't read i
mean i can read just choose not to read
just go to audible podcast.com slash
techno that's te chno to get a free
audiobook download of your choice when
you sign up that's right free audiobook
download when you sign up and when you
go to this pretty little URL i have
right now floating on the screen like
this oh yes anyways back to the review
overall this application is amazing and
very very convenient according to their
faq some movies might give you problems
depending on how you rip your DVD or how
you acquire your movie scandalous so for
just 199 this thing is a steal and
that's why I be giving it a 4 out of 5
so if you're a movie person like myself
or if you're a pirate of the Caribbean
fan be sure to pick up VLC streamer it's
pretty awesome hope you guys enjoyed
this review this was john q from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys next
time Johnny Depp so wonderful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
