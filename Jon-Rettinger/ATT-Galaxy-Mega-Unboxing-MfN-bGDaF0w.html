TechnoBuffalo it's an unboxing of the
galaxy mega 418 t as soon as I took this
out of the FedEx box I had no doubt what
phone it was this thing is a six point
three inch phone we had a chance to take
a look at and review it in its unlocked
international form and I'm surprised
that it made two US carriers but indeed
here it is ready for your giant phone
loving hands let's go ahead unbox it and
take a first look so this is a pretty
typical AT&amp;amp;T box they sent us this guy
to review for a couple of weeks Android
4.2 at launch but that's not the big
story here boom that is the big story
this ginormous phone I did just take out
a QuickStart guide before obviously
getting started very quickly it's being
powered by 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
processor take a look at the phone looks
like a larger version of the Galaxy s4
samsung has got a very consistent design
language throughout all their phones so
I'll pull that off and it feels like
there's a battery in there so I'll try
and power it on as we walk through the
rest of the stuff in the box and then
run through specs inside we're gonna
have some paperwork never lose a photo
and looks like we got a manual in here
as well in warranty guy
phone boots up we've got your typical
charging and syncing oh and then there's
a Samsung wall work no headphones or
anything in there what also is in the
box I assume is already installed in the
back cuz it's powered up is a 3200
milliamp hour battery so we've got the
phone all powered up here to run through
everything Android 4.2 at launch being
powered by a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
processor 1.5 gigs of ram either 8 or 16
gigs of internal storage but you can up
that with a microSD card on the back
we've got an 8 megapixel camera there
and a 1.9 megapixel shooter right on the
front 802 11 ABG and and AC live on this
guy in Bluetooth 4.0 and of course NFC
but the big story here is this 6.3 inch
1080p screen it is a gigantic phone and
it looks to behave just like a big
galaxy s4 or perhaps even more accurate
a bigger galaxy
three we look at the spec sheet it's a
pretty impressive phone I use it when an
international version I enjoyed it and
it was able to fit into normal dude
pants and use it just as a regular phone
I stopped using it though because it was
probably a little bit on the big side
but unlike the international version
this guy has LTE that'll work in the
u.s. of course this one on AT&amp;amp;T s
network let's go take a look at the apps
and should be pretty typical Samsung
fair I've got all the Samsung things
they've added their calendar application
is totally proprietary you've got hello
you've got their messages group play
music story album and all kinds of other
Samsung Hubby things and s voice which
unfortunately you cannot uninstall
widgets it's got him some pretty nice
array of what is I like Samsung sort of
customized widgets for their devices go
back to the home screen we've got a menu
button on the left and a back button on
the right and a big nice actual physical
clicky button right in the middle for
going home we've got a volume rocker up
and down on the left side on the right
power and lock button 3.5 millimeter
headset jack noise cancelling mic and a
plastic back which looks to pick up
crazy amount of fingerprints and very
subtle AT&amp;amp;T branding it's nothing giant
you know AT&amp;amp;T right across like we've
seen some other carriers do so I'm not
mentioning pricing right now it one
hundred and forty nine bucks but pricing
changes on a daily basis and pending
where you buy it
so check your local retailer or reseller
to see what this guy is going to cost
when it comes to market or when it's
available by you and anything else you
guys want to see about the 18 T version
versus international version be sure to
let us know I'll annotate and link down
below a full review for the
international version in case you want
to catch up and see what you can expect
with your Samsung Galaxy mega if you're
a big phone love and fan like I am this
is a really nice device i really enjoyed
using it I didn't notice the 720p screen
but then again I was coming from looking
at 1080 but I'm screening this size you
know you might be aware of it at least
take a look at it and store before you
decide if you want to use it
I want other weird thing you notice with
the phone we did our review I mean hold
it up to your face not only do you look
kind of silly but the phone is so BIG's
almost a bit of an echo and the words
come out of your mouth too reflecting
back in so something a little bit odd
but this will fit in your pants
we'll work as a normal phone it will
give you crazy looks and you walk by but
if you want to replace them for a tablet
or just one device that can do
everything this is a really good choice
