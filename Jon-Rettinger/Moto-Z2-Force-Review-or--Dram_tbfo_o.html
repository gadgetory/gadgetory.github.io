right now I am NOT John Ranger
my name is Robert Rosenfeld among the
video team care TechnoBuffalo so you may
also know me as Berto from Facebook or
Twitter or Instagram or snapchat but
this is not the time for self promoting
I've been given the task the honor to
review this Motorola 2017 flagship and
I'm here to make a case for it I'm not
here to say this is the most amazing
phone on the market and that you need to
go out and buy it right now but I'm not
here to bash it and tell you about all
shortcomings and tell you that you
should just completely write it off but
I'm here to make a case on why you
should just consider it I want to give
you the pros the cons share the specs
and share my experiences with this phone
and give you all the information you
need to make an educated decision on
whether or not this is worth your
hard-earned money and at least a few
years in your pocket so let's start
things off with design this phone is
sporting a 7000 series aluminum chassis
and it feels really good in the hand
it feels premium but it's also
lightweight and durable there's a bit of
a chin on the bottom where the
fingerprint sensor sits there's a little
bit of a space of top for the
front-facing camera and the flash so
it's not a completely bezel this phone
but it doesn't have to be
Motorola didn't go the essay route and
it looks just fine I think it's a really
good looking phone so the phone is
comfortable in the hand it's thin and
it's light but all that does come at a
price
last year's moto z4 s had a thirty five
hundred millionth our battery inside and
this year's newest phone that has all
the latest and greatest technology packs
a smaller twenty seven thirty million of
our battery inside and as a significant
battery decrease in capacity and it does
show I use the phone heavily throughout
my four days of testing with replying to
emails and playing games and sending
messages on slack and watching videos
and I got through the day comfortably
with about 10 to 15 percent remaining
though it wasn't as much wiggle room
that I would have liked the phone does
support turbo charging over USB type-c
but if you're going to be away from a
charger or an outlet during the day the
decrease in battery capacity is
something to keep in mind I don't think
it's a deal-breaker but it something to
think about
though the battery on this tone was a
little bit of a disappointment the
screen on this phone is anything but the
z2 force has a quad HD Super AMOLED
display that looks really good colours
pop and they're super vibrant
text is sharp and clear watching
anything on this phone is a real
pleasure and I really like to display I
think
on par with the other flagships
currently on the market besides looking
good Motorola's also built some rugged
technology into the screen called
shatter shield it should keep it
protected from falling on the floor or
falling facedown on concrete but it is a
little bit more susceptible to Nicks and
scratching if the phone displayed did
happen to shatter motorola is backing up
their claim with a 4-year warranty that
will cover it so below the display is
the built-in fingerprint sensor which I
actually really like it's fast
responsive it has some haptic feedback
so it even feels like you're pressing a
button and the big red sensor also is
big enough to double as a gesture pad so
if you want to remove those on-screen
navigation buttons and just use the
gesture pad to navigate your phone you
can do that and it works pretty well on
top the phone has a built-in earpiece
which also doubles as its only speaker
so if you want to listen to music or
watch any YouTube videos it's good it
gets loud enough but it's not going to
give you any kind of 3d sound effect or
carry a lot of bass with it it's okay
for listening to some things but if you
really want to listen to music on your
phone I'd pick up a motor mod one of the
biggest differences between last year's
original motor z4 and this year's phone
is the addition of a new rear shooter
you now have two cameras to work with
both are 12 megapixel both have an f/2
aperture but one shoots color and one
shoots monochromatic which means it's
she's completely black and white and
it's cool for a couple of reasons
Motorola says that this sensor data can
be used to make your colorful images
stand out with deeper blacks and better
color data you can also go back and
after the fact and choose which part of
the picture is black and white in which
part is color it's cool in that sense
but I really don't know anyone who would
rather have that over just throwing a
black-and-white filter over their photo
and getting a different focal length
there's something else that could have
been done with that lens to make it a
little bit more interesting photos the
phone took look really good colors are
sharp and vibrant I thought the camera
was on par with others on the market
currently the front-facing camera is
also pretty cool it has an 85-degree
wide-angle lens which is cool for those
selfies there's also a true tone flash
if you're in a dark situation and all
your friends are crowding around trying
to get a selfie you'll have that flash
to get that natural skin tone and buff
up that selfie game let's talk quickly
about performance this phone is
certainly no slouch and it handled
everything that I threw at it inside the
phone is packed with a snapdragon 835
processor four gigs of RAM 64 GB of
on-board storage so you can expand that
to your heart's content up to 2
terabytes with the inclusion of a micro
SD card slot
throughout my days of testing I play
games watch
videos did a bunch of multitasking and
messaging and the phone handled all of
it quite well it's certainly no slouch
it ran smooth like butter and I think
you're going to be really happy with the
performance you're going to get out of
this phone so the biggest story with
this year's Z 2/4 is actually going to
be the same thing we saw last year with
the original C for us and that is moto
mods it's all about the motor mod and I
think Motorola should be applauded for
that the phone uses smart connectors and
a series of magnets so that these mods
can snap on super easily they're not
intrusive they work right out of the box
and they work really well and it's
pretty cool to both these mods that were
released with this new phone as well as
last year's mods are all compatible so
if you've got new mods this year they'll
work with your old phone and vice versa
now Motorola has some pretty cool motor
mods that'll do just about anything and
actually address a lot of foam
shortcomings there's a battery mod
that'll put all your battery worries to
ease there's a JBL sound mod that sounds
really good there's even a 360-degree
camera mod that we had a ton of fun
using in the office but you have to look
at this with the bigger picture and
understand that these mods are cool but
you are buying into the Motorola
ecosystem take for example the 360
camera it's a lot of fun but it's $300
and it's only going to work on these
moto Z line of phones just take into
consideration that when you buy these
mods you're limiting yourself to just
two the Motorola phones and you are
going to spend probably a considerable
amount of money on these mods though
they can enhance your experience with
this phone it's going to come at a price
so let's get down to it if you're
already invested in the Moto mod
ecosystem and you have a phone that
already supports these mods or you're
really interested in this whole idea of
Motorola's modularity
I think the z2 force is a no-brainer
it's a great phone it's fast it has
really good cameras and there are some
things I don't exactly like like the
battery life but you can forgive that
with how cool the phone is as an overall
package especially with those mods but
if you're someone who's a little bit
skeptical of what Motorola is doing and
if you really want the best value for
your dollar I highly recommend taking a
step back and looking at all the current
flagships currently on the market and
choosing wisely whether or not this
phone is worth your hard-earned money
and at least a few years in your pocket
so what do you guys think is Motorola's
idea of modularity enough to get you to
jump ship over to the Moto mod ecosystem
and there's z-force line of phones or
are you going to stick with your current
flagship are you waiting for something
else to come out leave a comment down
below and let us know what you think of
this phone it's been a real pleasure
thank you guys so much for watching this
video
I'm Robert Rosenthal
Buffalo until next time see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
