from technobuffalo and it's finally
December which means the years about to
end New Year's right around the corner
and so with that being said today I'll
be showing you guys what's on my android
for December 2014 this will be the last
one for quite a while I did a similar
video not too long ago with my 1+1 but
today I have the note for I've been
using this phone for about a couple of
weeks now and change up a few things on
here to make my know for look somewhat
like Android lollipop so let's not waste
any more of your time and jump into the
video for my lockscreen i'm still using
AC display this is my go-to lockscreen
alternative for non motorola devices
it's very similar to Motorola's Moto
display but a more beefed up version
annal disability majority of your recent
notifications in a row and you'll be
able to interact with your notifications
by holding and swiping up or swiping
down it's an awesome lockscreen
alternative and if you're looking for
something different and customizable AC
display is the way to go for my
homescreen i'm using nova launcher prime
and it's probably one of the best
launchers that's available for android
there are other alternatives in a Google
Play Store which we made a video about
not too long ago and if you haven't seen
that video yet and make sure to check
out the links down below now quite
recently actually nova launcher just got
updated to you support a few more
android lollipop animations which look
absolutely beautiful the app animations
the drawer animations it almost looks
like android lollipop now the first
screen essentially shows all of the apps
I use on a daily basis I have my
contacts app the updated google calendar
with material design which by the way it
looks too gorgeous and right next to
that are the stock gallery app and the
camera up next is player FM which is my
go-to podcast app i listened to a few
podcasts when i'm driving or when i'm
going to sleep and the app is perfect it
features a very flat material design
look and it has majority of the podcasts
i listen to now moving right along we
have the netflix app and below that i
have spotify which i also use on a daily
basis right next to that i have after
light and visco cam to edit all of my
photos and we also have the google music
app which i use every now and then if
spotify doesn't have what
looking for just right below that are my
social media apps like Facebook Twitter
Instagram at YouTube and if you guys
have any alternative Twitter apps that
you use make sure to leave them in the
comments section down below I'm curious
on what you guys are using moving
forward we have the phone app hangouts
my app drawer which sports Android
lollipops animations and we have the
gmail app and google chrome swiping to
the right we have my google now widget
which shows me all of my important
sports scores weather and other
miscellaneous information and on the
third page is where I have my games and
other miscellaneous apps for my games I
don't have much I have retry stick hero
traffic racer which is pretty addicting
and clash of clans below those apps we
have Google Maps the google play store
the Settings app the AC display app
where you can customize the lock screen
and right next to that is this new app I
actually just downloaded yesterday
called heads up notifications which
essentially replicates Android lollipops
notification alerts it's a pretty nifty
app and pair that with the latest nova
launcher build you can achieve a
somewhat Android lollipop home screen
the last page of my home screen is just
my google calendar widget it shows me
what i have going on for today and for
the next couple of days and if i click
an event it takes me straight to the app
which is pretty straightforward that's
for the icon pack i'm sure you guys are
curious i'm using moonshine it started
off as a very flat colorful icon pack
that's somewhat inspired by leaks and
rumors of android lollipop before it was
officially released there are over 600
icons included and you can even request
more icons if some of your icons aren't
supported moonshine works for what i'm
going for which if you can already tell
i'm going for the android lollipop
material design look anyways that's it
for this video guys of course everything
i talked about in this video will be in
description down below and if you guys
have any questions or suggestions feel
free to leave your comments down below
or tweet me and as always the m√§rklin
sang in from technobuffalo i'll see you
guys in the next one thank you guys so
much for watching this video and if you
