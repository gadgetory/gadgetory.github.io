brought to you by the folks at Wix you
know I'm you love them you should
probably be using them you've got an
idea for a website Wix can help you
bring it to life
they have incredible easy to use
templates from hosting your site to
creating your domain stay tuned to the
end of the video if you want to learn
more or hit the link down below to get
started so my four-year-old asked me why
I change phones so often he's constantly
trying to steal my phone it gets used to
an OS or a certain length screen layout
that I've got I told it's because I
review them and he asked how many every
viewed over the years so thinks about
insomnia I counted ladies and gentlemen
of the herd I have reviewed 317 phones
and tablets and I'm I'm not even gonna
lie I was shocked and felt old exercise
is to get me thinking what are my
favorite phones and I've ever checked
out and if I've immediately jumped out
and a few I think might surprise you but
do not interpret this list as the best
phone that ever reviewed because some of
these were not great phones but these
are the top five phones that I enjoyed
reviewing for various reasons so let's
go so I told you there'd be some
surprises in 2009 rim they were still
known then was just a mess
wrapped in a total crap show with two
CEOs and virtually no direction but man
the bold 9700 was still some special to
me physical keyboards were still in
demands and nobody did it better than
rim it kind of seems weird to even say
this now but it felt like a modern
blackberry it had wait for it an HTML
browser BlackBerry OS 5 it eventually
got six and quite honestly it kind of
made me feel like a baller I love this
phone for its productivity its battery
life and smooth navigation thanks to the
trackpad my love affair though was
short-lived remember how this phone made
me feel when I used it I kind of made me
long for a simpler time remember back
when all I phone screens were super tiny
well Android was going big Apple was
stubbornly sticking to their 3.5 inch or
4 inch guns until September 2014 winner
finally super-sized to 5.5 inches I
remember the day this thing came out I
was just sitting on my couch staring at
it
it was hard to believe that iOS finally
had a larger home screen I know this
sounds whimsical and maybe kind of silly
but it was a pretty cool feeling to have
I was thinking how bad battery life was
originally because I was just using it
so much for me this is when Apple change
and started hitting Android where it
mattered and for that reason I love the
iPhone 6 plus and it's got a place in my
heart the story of the note for me goes
all the way back to 2011 I was just
recently married at the IFA trade show
in Berlin that year was coming up my
wife and I gloriously pre kids decided
to make a little European adventure out
of it we went to London first and took
the train to Paris it finally settled
into Berlin for the show this was back
when company still announced big
products at trade shows and Samsung took
the stage and announced what seemed
unheard of at the time a 5.3 inch phone
at the Penn I loved and adored this
phone educator Alan didn't show it to
anyone who would ask and where people
stopped to ask you about this phone than
any other device I have ever tested if
the original iPhone represented the
future of mobility and the galaxy note I
think I shouldn't a brand new era of
screen sizes the usability with the same
coupled with the kind of warm fuzzy
feeling from a European trip make the
memory of the notes standout well it's
just let's pour one out for a legend so
now we're really gonna go back to the
early history of smartphones this is the
first Android phone the HTC dream
released in 2008 I'm not even gonna try
to pretend it was a good phone it was
quite honestly just a mess the UI was
slow the browser was subparts even at
multi-touch yet but this was finally the
answer to the iPhone what this
represented was absolutely incredible
I had yet left my marketing job to go to
TechnoBuffalo full-time but I remember
how excited I was I said at my kitchen
table angled the webcam my old
Santa Rosa MacBook Pro down and just
talked about this phone slide-out
keyboard mechanism was awesome the
keyboard was surprisingly solid more
importantly we finally had something to
potentially challenge looking to be the
on
Apple dominance I still actually have
this phone once a year so I'll dust it
off and plug it in for for a stroll down
memory lane now it's time for number one
and it's it's the original iPhone not
gonna be a surprise but reasons I picked
it might be so this phone was clearly
the future and all that this was the
phone that started my entire career and
changed my life I picked it up on launch
day I ran home to film it as fast as I
could
my heart was pounding I was sweaty but I
was so damn excited I love that feeling
it was pure I still remember it I loved
the original iPhone just that feeling
and the abusing a multi-touch device was
incredible and it's really got a soft
spot in my heart because it literally
changed my life so the other thing that
changed my life was creating
TechnoBuffalo calm and if I had Wix
around when I went to do that I would
have saved myself a lot of time hassle
and headache if you have an idea for
creating a website the folks at Wix can
help you make it possible it's
professional its robust for kind of
everything you want to need if you want
an e-commerce site you want to create a
blog you want to have a place to host
your vlogs you want to create a site for
your restaurant Wix has you covered then
give you total creative freedom and
these don't look like normal template
websites you can customize almost every
single aspect of it to make it look
uniquely you and if you do want to pick
a template they've got hundreds of them
to choose from you get your own custom
domain there's a Wix editor it makes
things really easy for drag and drop you
don't have to have any coding knowledge
take a website that looks like you spent
hundreds of thousands of dollars and
paid a professional developer you can do
it all yourself with Wix so want to
learn more
hit the link down below so there were a
ton of phones I could have picked here I
had a lot of honorable mentions to
things like the original Palm Pre
t-mobile Sidekick the trio 650 the
original Motorola Droid and a ton more
but what ask you guys is what phones our
top five or any ones you would have
picked it.our your favourite phones
ought to be the best phones you ever
used but phones that stick out for some
reason in your
something you were going through even
the comments down below it so you can
get a running tally going and see if we
see some consistencies I think we'll see
some early Android phones people see a
lot of iPhones in there maybe the Palm
Pre will show up in your lists get me in
the comments down below good video a
thumbs up we appreciate it
