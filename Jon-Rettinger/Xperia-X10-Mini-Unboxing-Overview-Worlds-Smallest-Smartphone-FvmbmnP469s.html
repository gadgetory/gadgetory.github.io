from TechnoBuffalo here at the first
look at probably the smallest smartphone
on the planet the Sony Ericsson Xperia
x10 mini so once again the folks at
Negri electronics really came through
there was a big time hooked us up with
this incredibly small and miniscule yet
fully featured smartphone this little
guy packs a 5 megapixel camera 3g gps
all the other stuff do you expect in a
full-featured smartphone in a package
that is crazy small but enough of me
talking about it let me go ahead and
show you so here is the Box Xperia x10
mini the folks at Negri are selling this
phone for just about three hundred
eighty bucks in case you're interested
I'll put a link down in the underbar
you've got some pictures of the phone on
the front on the side some specs which
clearly aren't Russian and some sort of
IMEI stuff on the front now the box
looks pretty normal you don't expect to
phone this size to come out of a box
this big but let's go ahead and take a
look and we will use of course the
obligatory hopefully don't cut your
finger off big old knife so we'll go
ahead and cut the plastic all right so
we've got another successful plastic
cutting without any blood pull this off
and here is the box go ahead and slide
it open I think yes slide it open up
there's some plastic there as well we'll
go ahead and break this seal literally
we got one more on this side as well
alright now we will slide this off we
can see that it's got a 2.6 inch
diameter screen 3.5 millimeter headset
jack 5 megapixel camera 3G speeds for
European brands and the processor is a
pretty robust actually 600 megahertz but
you'll see why that's so robust you see
the size of this phone we'll go ahead
and pull this out
and it almost looks like a toy there's a
phone I'm going to show you what this
looks like some other phones in just a
minute
AB let's see what else you're going to
get in the box from Sony Ericsson so
you've got a different back color
choices you got green pink and I assume
something less offensive there's a black
one already on there you've got your
wall charger micro USB charging port
stereo headphones and some user
information but enough of that let's
take a look at this phone because this
seriously if you guys ever seen
Zoolander this looks like the
Zoolander's phone it will go great with
your orange mocha frappuccino it's going
to take it out of the out of package if
you look at this thing it is just
unbelievably small I mean look at it
next to here's an iPhone 4 for example I
mean the thing is crazy here's like a
normal-sized finger I mean the phone is
just tiny here is its Big Brother the
Xperia x10 you can see that there is
just some difference here so let's go
ahead and look at the phone and I will
power it on and show you how it works
I'm really excited actually to take a
look at this thing so you've got sort of
the standard array of sony ericsson
Android buttons it is running a skinny
version of Android 1.6 called time
scheme with sort of Mediascape in there
as well it's another way for you to
manage all your contacts manage your
media so you've got a menu button home
button and a back button on the
left-hand side of the phone you have
nothing on the right-hand side of the
phone you've got a volume rocker and a
power button similar to what we have on
the x10 there's your 5 megapixel camera
with LED flash Xperia branding there is
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack it looks
like the microUSB charging ports on the
bottom and on the top is your power and
lock button so I'm really excited to
power this thing on if you guys are
going out and you don't want to carry a
big phone with you this thing is going
to be fantastic you're hardly even going
to notice it let's go ahead and see if
there is any sort of battery actually
before we do that see if you can check
out the size of the battery how this
does take microSD storage you forgot a
way to pull off the back it's like it
just sort of prized off and again you
can pick the color that you want a lot
and go stay with the
a bit more understated black so SIM card
slot the GSM phone and the battery I
assume is in there somewhere it comes
with a 2 gigabyte micro SD card let's
see we can figure out where the battery
is on this guy it looks like that is
just foam perhaps the battery is
internal and non removable that would
certainly make sense for a phone
this small somebody put that back on so
we're learning as we go let's go ahead
and power it on and see if we have any
juice to show you what this guy looks
like I'm curious how you're going to
type on a screen this is small I've
really never seen a phone this miniscule
before I'm not sure if it has this up
there goes Sony Ericsson and sort of
just as a reminder this is a 2.6 inch
screen which is obviously very very
small battery life you are going to be
getting about 4 hours of talktime about
360 hours of standby time and it is a
pretty nice 13 20 milliamp hour battery
a resolution on the screen is 240 by 320
on is a capacitive touch screen so here
we are let's go ahead and hit this to
unlock we'll go ahead and select English
save insert your SIM card and restart
your phone cancel if we don't have a SIM
card to pop in here right now and I
think we should be bout in the operating
system of the phone which is sort of
interesting it's a different take on the
media scape that we saw on the exterior
x10 since the phone is so small you
can't really have a row of icons across
the bottom so I'm sort of arranging them
now in the corners with a menu button in
the middle
I'm sure pulls up all of your
applications now 600 megahertz processor
is actually very fast certainly not a
Snapdragon or another 1 gigahertz
processor but is more than enough to
power device of this size so you can go
through and sort of pick all your
options there's your menu of any
conversations here let's go ahead and
open a new message let's see what this
keyboard looks like ok so here we have
the keyboard on the x10 sort of your
standard t9 looking keyboard either you
can enable some sort of multi tap if
you'd like as well we're going to have a
very simple message and see how this
works for smart phone
reminiscent of a keyboard you've seen on
standard flip phone although because
it's Android
assuming you can download sort of other
waste input text I think something like
swipe would probably be a perfect fit
for this I'm going to go ahead and try
and type something here three different
blink
so not the most accurate going to take
time to input text but the phone does
work and the keyboard certainly is going
to take some getting used to
they hit this button here on the side
you get some other options you can get
all of your shortcuts you get some happy
faces a lot of happy faces and sort of
your other things and go back and you
are back at the keyboard let's go ahead
and check out the operating system a
little bit more and see what we have so
we'll go back jump out of this and go
home so look at the date certain you can
hook up the Wi-Fi your Android
notifications are still there you've got
you can scroll through all your contacts
if you had any or if I had any in here
search having things in the corners
actually works pretty well there's your
dialog that goes into the mail which is
where we just were go ahead and just
delete that go back home once again sort
of jump into your meat it's got a pretty
nice-looking media you can go ahead and
play music if you like or jump around
shuffle songs tell me right now playing
online content about the currently
playing artists so it'll actually will
find online content about the artists
that's playing which is kind of neat go
ahead and exit out of this so overall
you get a pretty standard Android
experience on a phone that is just
absolutely tiny and miniscule and just
for fun let's bring in one of the larger
smartphones now on the market the Evo 4G
and just take a look what these two
things look like next to each other I
mean it really looks like a Evo extra
memory just looks so small does it look
like a phone but the fact that it is is
really impressive I'm shocked actually
about the size of the x10 mini I review
many many phones and there's not that
much out there that really surprises me
anymore
but for when packing this sort of punch
kind of screen that size is very
impressive there's also a pro version
coming out which is going to have a full
slide-out QWERTY keyboard after hoping
to get my hands on near future
anyway guys I'm John Retton chick from
TechnoBuffalo is sort of your first look
at the Xperia x10 mini hope you enjoyed
I'll see you the next video
buh-bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
