here with an unboxing for you of the
Nexus One this is the much-hyped HTC
built a Google phone that we've seen spy
shots of and reports up for probably the
past few weeks so I'm very excited to
dig in without further ado let's go
ahead and jump into the box this is how
it's going to come if you buy it from
the Google store which you can find this
at google.com slash phone you get a
lithium ion battery warning right there
big box you can feel it sort of shaking
around in there go ahead and dig in now
this is only going to run on t-mobile of
3G bands and will not run on 18 G 3G but
will run with ATT on edge so you've got
some shipping information in there there
packing stuff in a very small box go
ahead and push that off to the side and
let's take a look at the Nexus One box
itself carrier on brandon's this is a
unlock device a Nexus One there's the
Google web server got the Nexus One logo
in the X nothing on the side nothing on
the other side and then some SKU and all
the information on the back see how this
opens up it's like the top just comes
right off
no sort of padding there just a lot of
hard cardboard here is the Nexus One I'm
very excited to see what this looks like
good as we can get it out of here
give it a shake all right feels very
thin and light in the hand but certainly
that's probably because the battery is
on in there let's go ahead and keep
digging in and see what else we have got
a little neoprene Android sleeve with
the Android mascot and I doubt anyone's
going to use this you've got some your
getting started guides insert the
battery charger phone two lights green
warranty statements and some info on the
phone let's go ahead and keep digging in
and see what else we have take that out
assume somewhere in here is the charger
so here we've got the u.s. wall charger
it looks like this is using microUSB and
just a pretty simple wall charger got a
pair of stereo headphones so I don't
take them out you can see I'll see I can
thing I've scooped the microphone on him
or anything just standard headphones 3.5
millimeter not appear to be any sort of
microphone on there and there's a few
extra what year cushions let's put that
back
we've got a USB cable for syncing and
then of course we have the battery let's
see if we can get a size on this thing
this would be a pretty substantial
obviously HTC built battery let's go
ahead and push all this off and take a
look at the phone itself this is what
everybody's here to see when I'm
personally very excited to see so here
we've got the Nexus One quite large
looking phone so the 3.7 inch am LED
screen looks really nice so far 3.7
inches is quite large but and zoom in
just a little bit more on the device and
some of the specs there resolution on
its 480 by 800 it's got a gigahertz
Snapdragon Qualcomm built processor it's
got multi color notifications on the
trackball there which I don't think
people really gonna need to use and of
course it's got your light proximity
sensors it's eleven point five
millimeters thick and weighs just 100
and 30 grams it's actually thinner than
number 2 pencil I've got a 5 megapixel
camera on the back let's go ahead and do
a quick device tour as long as you're
running through some special peel off
the plastic this satisfying new device
noise that screen is really big curious
to how it looks once it's powered on so
we've got your typical Android buttons
and your just touch sensitive get your
back buttons your menu your home your
search and your trackball the screen
here just looks very large on the left
hand side of the device we've got a
volume up and down rocker on the right
side we have nothing on the bottom we've
got your USB connector and these three
little sensors that people aren't really
sure what they're about there's one of
the two microphones on the bottom as
well this does have a ambient noise
reduction technology so if your walk
down the street a lot of car noises
people won't hear it
on the back there's your 5 megapixel
sensor with your LED flash another
microphone right there and speak report
on top you've got your 3.5 milimeter
headset jack and probably a lock and
possibly power button as well and that
is about it let's run through a size
comparison again for all your nexus one
info be sure to stay tuned to
TechnoBuffalo or the youtube channel
we're going to having a ton of coverage
so here are some other devices you may
be familiar with from a size perspective
here is the iPhone 3GS pull it camera
out just a bit you can see the screen on
the Nexus One definitely looks larger
although not by much but it is
definitely a little bit bigger and stack
them from a thickness standpoint you can
see the thickness they look we're
relatively close olenek this one
definitely looks a little bit thinner as
other devices may be familiar with since
this will be coming to Verizon in the
spring here is the initial or the first
blackberry storm big difference there
and for those of you that are fans of
unlock devices like the nexus one here
is the sony xperia
x1 this one does have of course a
slide-out keyboard so it will be a bit
thicker big difference so I'm going to
pop in the battery and sort of begin the
test and once again be sure to stay
tuned to the channel for a ton of
indexes one coverage Ellie I'm John rent
