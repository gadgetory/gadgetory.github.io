technobuffalo here I've got the Apple
watch and it's sport model this is the
42 millimeter version why don't you
quickly what it looks like around it the
sensors on the back and what the sport
bands are going to look like if you want
to see a full you I tour we've got that
up on the channel as well on the right
inside got digital crown is a very fluid
motion you don't have little stomps on
there I'm not supposed to use it like
this just sort of use your finger on it
and it works very gradually you've got a
multifunction button right down below
left hand side you've got some
microphone sensors and says have
speakers as well built in for taking
calls on the bottom this is where the
magnetic charger is going to live as
well as all the heart rate monitors and
such again available in two different
sizes you're going to have a 42 and 38
I'll show you what looks like on my
wrist will go ahead and sort of hold
that on there I don't have giant wrist
got sort of I guess normal dude wrist
and you can see the 42 looks pretty
normal doesn't look giant doesn't look
huge it's sort of move it around you can
see exactly what that's going to look
like they go ahead and move it around
the band is pretty simple goes ahead and
just snaps right on find decides it's
right for you let's say right there and
the band will just tuck away on your
wrist right down below so it's not going
to get cotton anything if you were on a
bike or lifting weights it's just a real
quick first look at the Apple watch
