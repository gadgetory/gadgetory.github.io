here from TechnoBuffalo and today we're
gonna take our first look at Microsoft's
new web browser project Spartan now a
few months back we actually did a video
on Windows 10 and show you most of the
new stuff that's gonna be included in
Microsoft's newest OS now project
Spartan unfortunately wasn't one of them
but the latest build of Windows 10 now
includes project Spartan so let's go
ahead and see what it's all about so the
first thing we notice about project
Spartan is how basic and minimalistic it
looks you can access your favorites your
reading view reading lists inking and
sending feedback to Microsoft
now performance at the moment is a bit
sluggish but then again this is an early
build so a lot of what you're seeing
right now is probably gonna get a lot
better one of the new features in
project Spartan is the ability to enable
a new mode called reading view now this
mode essentially strips down a page and
provides you with a distraction-free
environment unfortunately not every page
is gonna work but you know what sites
working TechnoBuffalo yep you can read
some tips and tricks on the galaxy s6
right now and a ton more katana is also
available inside project Spartan and the
cool thing about Crotona is if for
example you're looking at a restaurant
online katana can give you more details
about the restaurant by giving you
directions hours and you can even book a
table by using open table unfortunately
there's not a whole lot of sites and
restaurants that Crotona will have
access to but hopefully in the future
we'll see more so probably the coolest
feature in project Spartan is the
ability to annotate websites now
annotating or inking allows you to write
or type directly on the page you're
looking at you can say the annotated
site in your favorites reading list one
note or send it off to a friend if you'd
like but is right now it's a bit buggy
saving web notes but hopefully in the
future build this bug will be fixed it's
a really fun tool and I think this will
change the way we share sites to friends
and family so the other features that we
notice in project Spartan was the
ability to quickly check the weather by
typing in weather inside the address bar
and Microsoft also mentioned a new
rendering engine built inside project
Spartan to load pages quicker though we
haven't really noticed a difference in
that area just yet so of course with a
name like project Spartan it sounds
intense though this won't be the final
name for the browser but we should find
that out once windows 10 is right around
the corner we should also expect
sentience support for the browser if it
wants to compete with Google Chrome and
for Microsoft to adapt its new rendering
engine and provide updates to consumers
running Windows 10 anyways thank you
guys so much for watching if you guys
like this video make sure to give it a
thumbs up and if you guys haven't
subscribed yet make sure to hit the
subscribe button and I will see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
