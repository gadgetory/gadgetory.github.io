to you by Linda welcome back to the
episode of wrenches rant I'm your host
Jon regice the show we rant and rave on
anything from the world technology and
sometimes outside of it and last week
was one of those instances I ranted on
cell phone addiction and are just
dependent on consumer electronics and I
am totally hooked so I issued a
challenge next time you go out with your
friends put your cell phones on a table
and say whoever picks there's up first
has to pay the tab and a lot of you took
me up on it's been awesome to see not
been making a better effort to be more
conscious in social interactions and not
pull out my cell phone and ignore the
phantom vibration in my pocket something
happened earlier today that made me want
to take that a step further so this
video is being filmed on the fifteenth
of April it's gonna air on the 17 so far
time you watches more information might
already have come out on what happens
but just a few hours ago the Boston
Marathon when people were crossing the
finish line two bombs exploded we only
just recently learned that they were
bombs and already we're hearing a live
updates and video that are coming out
from it it got me kind of thinking it's
personal experience that now whenever
there's a tragedy oftentimes people
instead of trying to help reach for
their cell phones first and try and
record what's going on you know you see
it the tragedies when there are
shootings on you see the tragedies all
the time and not saying that not helping
to the people's first instincts but it's
why information is being shared via cell
phones often times we learned about
things from social media before
attritional news reports on it all this
stuff going on all the tragedy in the
world and the white information is being
shared and people on their cellphones
sort of reminded me of a psychology case
i read about when i was in college and i
know this is not a usual topic that we
discussed by figures out what crazy
things going on in the world let's may
be appropriate so it's a story it's a
true story of woman by the name of kitty
Genovese and that name might sound
familiar to you she's a woman she lived
in New York City and she was
unfortunately murdered and when the
police came and interviewed all of her
neighbors a lot of them reported hearing
her scream and yell for help yet none of
them did anything about it when the
police asked why they always assumed and
the answer that they gave was we figured
somebody else was gonna call the police
and serve got me thinking about things
going on now with social media I
see accidents when car is getting car at
people autumn after taking pictures but
I'm wondering how many people are
actually calling the police make sure
everybody is okay are calling an
ambulance to come and help the cell
phones have changed this world and it
continued to do so over the next three
five ten years and as a technology gets
even better as people start using smart
watches as products like Google glass
become more prevalent and I'm wondering
how much we're actually going to do to
help our fellow man and how much we're
going to do just for the sake of sharing
information now I'm not belittling the
importance of sharing information think
alike as i mentioned that's the way a
lot of people learn about news police
get a lot of evidence from pet pictures
people take but how many people are
actually calling for help when things
happen and ike remember a personal
example i witnessed and this is about
four years ago and i was living on a
different place someone get hit by a car
an actual person I get it by a card
really tragic experience and I remember
I swerved my car over I pulled off to
the side and I ran to help I left you
the first person on the scene I knew a
little bit of CPR I knew enough to know
to not touch the person I called the
ambulance and I waited for help people
start to gather and gather and Gavin
everybody had their cell phones out and
I kept hearing people just talking
normally I didn't hear anybody else call
for help and not to say that I did
anything different than they might not
have done I was very interesting to see
the first reaction people have two
things so i challenge you guys in
another challenge if you ever see
something happened before you share it
on social media make sure you but he's
okay if you need to call the police if
you need to call a fire truck me to call
Amos ever might be do that first don't
assume ever that somebody else is going
to do it because you only get one chance
at life and if you miss helping someone
out its life or death situation and if
you disagree let me know maybe I'm Way
off and maybe I'm old and out of touch
but I really want to hear your thoughts
I like to have a dialogue about this and
what we can do to maybe use the tools we
have to help people and to try and make
sure that those that need help actually
get it suppose for the sake of you know
being the first one to share a story be
a second person to share your story it
be the first one to offer help so they
