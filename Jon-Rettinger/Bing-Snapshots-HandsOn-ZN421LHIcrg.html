it from TechnoBuffalo and Microsoft
updated its Bing after Android that
includes a very cool feature called Bing
snapshots snapshots intelligently reads
your screen to pull up relevant
information based on whatever you're
looking at it's very similar to Google's
own now on tap which is being added to
Android marshmallow now just as a little
disclaimer bings new feature is still in
beta so don't expect it to pull up
information everywhere you try it so far
however it's pretty impressive so here's
how bings new update works say I'm
reading an article about the new Captain
America movie civil war and headline
says black panther joins the action in
new Captain America Civil War set photos
since I don't follow Marvel Comics that
often and I don't know who Black Panther
is I can just long press my device's
home button or swipe up from the bottom
of the screen if I have on screen
navigation and a snapshot will pop up
with all the information I need for the
famous character pretty easy right I can
do the same thing for places too if I
search for u cemani National Park
snapshots will come up with relevant
information I need along with associated
actions I can read reviews and even book
tickets to get there four locations Ving
will even show me points of interest in
the case of Yosemite it points out Half
Dome I'll copy ta'en and you somebody
Falls allowing you to better plan my
trip it also works for movies say you're
watching a movie trailer for the hateful
eight and you want to learn more about
it just activate snapshots and it'll
offer up more details about the movie
including cast info plot synopsis and
more the entire concept is very similar
to Google is now on tap which will be a
part of the upcoming Android 6.0 update
it looks like Microsoft beat Google to
the punch
Bing snapshot feature works with any
device running Android 4.0 and up making
it available for quite a few people Bing
snapshot feature isn't perfect by any
means but it's a great start and works
very well so far now just as a note Bing
requires permission to androids
accessibility feature for snapshots on
tap to work so you ultimately have
control if you simply can't wait for
Android marshmallow and want to try
something similar to Google's contextual
search feature definitely give Bing a
try anybody's thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
