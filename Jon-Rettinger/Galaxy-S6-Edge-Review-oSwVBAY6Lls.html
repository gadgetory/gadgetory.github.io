light and Samsung built smartphone would
have seemed like a fantasy on the same
note so the one that didn't have
removable battery expandable storage but
as a beauty of the galaxy s6 edge+ more
than skin-deep is defined by more what
it has than what it doesn't and the
question I try to answer in all my
reviews would I buy it I'm John renter
from TechnoBuffalo this is our review of
the galaxy s6 edge+ as I do with all my
reviews let me start with the disclaimer
the unit we tested was provided by
Samsung and it was international and
unlocked I use it for four days and
Brandon who did the written portion of
this use it for seven I use AT&amp;amp;T he used
t-mobile if you want to know more on
anything I'm going to talk about or see
camera sample hit the link down below
and check out his full written review
when the s6 edge launched earlier this
year the reaction was generally
Universal boom use meant there was no
data against aesthetic appeal and beyond
that the melted screen feature provided
really next to no utility Samsung has
thrown out a few neat ideas but his
execution left a lot to be desired it
basically meant consumers were buying
the dual LED display for no other reason
then it looked unlike anything we'd ever
seen that's pretty much the same idea
with the edge Plus which features one of
the most beautiful designs of any phone
on the market like the s6 edge the
device sports of pronounce do ledges
play which is great to look at even more
enjoyable to use when swiping and
scrolling through content the curse
screen lends itself perfectly to a touch
environment somehow creates a deeper
immersion between the user and what's on
screen perhaps just a serendipitous
byproduct to the curved trend but no
less appreciated particularly in Android
lollipop where men using conduct can be
interacted by swiping from left and
right the cascading displays a fun and
excellent way to journey through
Google's operating system but and excuse
my horrible pun here it's a double-edged
sword like the s6 edge the edge Plus
features slimmer edges make the phone a
bit uncomfortable to hold you're
constantly aware of the slim aluminum
bezels and it always seemed like a phone
that might just slip out of my hand I
got pretty big mitts exacerbating the
issue is devices larger footprint which
requires a firm one-handed grip more
often than not two hands for comfortable
make sure you don't drop it operation
content can also look little strange
when it bleeds over to the devices
curved edge while watch a YouTube video
a landscape for example contact can
appear a little bit distorted at the top
and the bottom melting into the s6 edge+
is sloping screen on websites when text
and picture span the entire screen
left to right it's definitely noticeable
sometimes be a little off-putting even
worse when there's a little tiny button
you gotta press this it's inside of the
edge display all the times you got to
punch at it a few times to get it to
register so before you guys yell at me
having said that you can't help but
forgive the device because it's just so
pretty to look at even if it isn't the
most practical design out there the
aluminum frame is a major improvement
over anything else Samsung's put out in
the past years and the glass back will
not ideal as an extra touch of elegance
I also really want to highlight a review
units gold color option which turns the
edge plots from ordinary phone into a
spectacular piece of jewelry this is
hands-down the most beautiful color
option I have ever seen on a phone and
I've seen a lot of phones for thinking
about picking one up do yourself a favor
and just just order the gold very
beneath that attractive sheen are some
of the best specs ever appear in a
mobile device a 5.7 inch quad HD screen
Exynos 7420 processor android 5.1.1
fingerprint sensor 32 or 64 gigs of
storage four gigs of ram which still
sounds crazy to say in a 3,000 million
power battery
it also supports qi &amp;amp; PMA wireless
charging standards which samsung says is
quicker this time around that
fingerprint sensor that i just mentioned
by the way is incredibly accurate and
device itself is blazing fast with
normal usage and by normal usage I mean
some YouTube social media emails using
cloud magic and web browsing and the few
phone calls run in there here and there
as you'd expect those specs things here
are really fast for emphasis you guys
always say say this a lot really really
fast
no stutter slowdown because I know you
guys love benchmarks here we go
34972 on quadrant 60 3821
on n2 to 571 1479 on Geekbench 3 single
core and 4811
on multi-core so on the topic of normal
human usage I did find the s6 edge+ to
be lacking in the battery department and
lacking is the nice way I could describe
it the 3000 milliamp hour unit is larger
that was offered in the smaller s6 edge
but have to say the two were about on
par with each other which is to say did
not great if you're an obsessive who
checks their phone every 10 minutes only
to mindlessly scroll through Twitter
Instagram and the like
like I am your battery will take a hit
especially since the displays
pushing so many pixels but if you temper
your usage show some restraint
you'll get to the end of the day with
some battery life to spare but probably
not much Samsung is touting faster
wireless charging and quick charge which
are all great they require you to always
be thinking about your battery here's an
example last week go into a baseball
game dens of workday had about 60%
battery life left and I was worried that
if I want to take a lot of pictures and
run out of juice so I plugged into my
car on the way home when I got home I
put on the quick charger I got back in
the car again Ted to the game I plugged
in yet again I had to be constantly
thinking about my battery instead of
just using the phone at first I thought
my battery life was being affected by
using international unit where I only
had one bar of service maybe device was
looking for a network causing premature
battery drain that was squashed though
and Brandon's tests he used Timo won't
always had a strong signal and his
battery life tests were almost identical
to mine so none of this is deal-breaker
but it does require you to adjust how
often you use your phone and how do you
think about your battery or how often
you think about it so I'm happy to say
the software doesn't slow performance
down at all Samsung has been rapidly
working towards a much more optimized
version of TouchWiz over the past few
months and it really shows what this
means for users is significantly less
bloat smoother experience and just
overall better usage
no more stuttering no unnecessary
add-ons and no more software suffocation
if you've had a chance to use the s6
edge or even the Galaxy s6 the software
is pretty much the same you still get
plenty of mostly useless edge features
such as edge lighting edge people
information screen and night clock along
with the new additions known as apps
edge with just a quick way to access
your favorite apps what's kind of
disappointing though you don't actually
need an edge device for any these
features to be useful at all Samsung
just allowed it apps edge and people
edge could be just easily utilized on a
smartphone with this flat display but if
I'm being honest the swiping motion
definitely wouldn't be as satisfying but
Samsung did need some ways to
differentiate the edge design beyond
really look so I can understand the
decision one really cool software tweak
that I use quite a bit being able to tap
the flash take a selfie it seems silly
but really helpful when you want to have
a picture of a fast-moving toddler one
less software touch the ability to
started live broadcasts on YouTube which
may or not get more people streaming in
their everyday lives as it is smartphone
owners already have options like
periscope and meerkat which become crazy
popular the past several months I know
often you're going to use both
contribute to YouTube but it's there so
another great thing with
device if you use the Google now
launcher like I do you'll get six rows
down including the dock instead of the
normal five that I see on most let the
Galaxy s6 and the s6 edge the s6 edge+
aside from being a mouthful features the
same 60 megapixel sensor an optical
metabolization a combo it offers
arguably the best camera experience in
mobile samsung smartphones have always
been above average in the camera
department and the s6 edge+ further
cements the company's growing stature as
a photography king while samsung's new
weirdo phone is a sight to behold we're
still left waiting for that killer use
case it's like getting a Lambo but
limiting it to top feet at 40 miles per
hour there's plenty of unfulfilled
potential its overall much like the s6
edge I really like this phone the edge
screen really adds very little utility
but it adds a ton of beauty and that
means something to me the question I
asked the beginning would I buy this
phone the answer should probably be
obvious here but yes absolutely I would
but that a doubt I get in gold/black of
expandable storage is an issue for me
but if it is for you think about how
you'll manage your own storage while
battery life leaves a ton to be desired
I know that I wouldn't carry an extra
one so in the end some extra thickness
and some more milliamp hours would have
made this phone even better and probably
closing you're perfect it gets an eight
point five on the TechnoBuffalo scale so
what'd you guys think - agree disagree
with our review as we way off on points
up - your thoughts on it did this sway
you one way or another - maybe pick up a
note 5 or an s6 edge up to your thoughts
