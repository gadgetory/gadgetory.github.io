brought to you by full sail university
well hello there how's it going it's
junk to hear from TechnoBuffalo and
welcome to what's the apps in the last
fantastic fun-filled episode a few
people have asked me to check out voice
actions for android OS i have never used
a voice command kind of thingy before so
this was quite the experience so sit
tight relax and number share with you
guys my experiences with voice actions
for android OS with the release of Siri
on the iphone 4s I'm not surprised that
a few people have asked me to check out
this voice command app thingy and I
haven't tried cereal yet because you
know the iphone for US isn't out yet and
I'm probably not gonna get one yeah I
said it loud and proud proud of what I
don't know so I can't really compare my
experiences between the two voice
actions on Android pretty much does the
exact same thing ask your phone a
question or tell your phone to do
something and it'll do it like magic
think of it as an app to transform your
mobile internet device cellular phone
call thingy into a portable robotic
slave with a female monotone microsoft
sam kind of voice and her name is genies
like we can change that no no change
your name to Jenny what's my name damn
right it is what you saw there was
basically how you'd use the application
activated by tapping the icon or search
button and talk to your phone hey Jenny
set alarm for 630 a.m. tomorrow morning
no you shall not they can do basic tasks
okay like opening applications locating
things in google maps google searching
opening youtube videos and all that fun
stuff it can even tell you the weather
in Fahrenheit or Celsius fancy fancy hi
Jenny what is the weather like today
Thank You Jenny but what is the weather
like today but in Celsius that's not the
answer I was looking for Jenny Ethiopian
childhood looking for Jenny thank you
that's not what I wanted what is the
weather like today but in Celsius it
worked before I swear give me a second
what is the temperature today in Celsius
Thank You Jenny and for some reason I
was really really impressed with this
what is Macaulay Culkin's birthday oh my
God look at look at the picture look at
the victor the only thing that's kind of
if you with would be contact names email
is the worst okay I can never get it to
email the person I'd want to email and
if I could it chose the wrong email
address so it's kind of like a you lose
all the time situation kind of situation
email jon rettinger no you should not
calling people sort of hit and miss
although locating businesses worked
pretty well speaking of whatever I just
said I'm gonna do a random transition
into thanking our friends and sponsors
at full sail university you guys know
okay that the mobile app industry is on
fire right now Full Sail University's
online mobile development bachelor's
degree program should give you the skill
sets you need to take advantages of
those emerging opportunities in this
degree you learn both the programming
and business sides of mobile development
so that you can concept developed deploy
and market an application from start to
finish you'll explore advanced
programming languages visual frameworks
usability principles and app development
for iOS and Android operating systems
through full sales project launch box
program okay students receive a macbook
pro preloaded with industry software
plus iOS and Android devices courses are
delivered through full sails immersive
online education platform which
maximizes the capabilities of the Mac
giving you a learning experience unlike
any other 15 billion okay billion
applications have been downloaded from
Iowa 15 billion ok Billy an application
type Adele
from Apple's App Store and android
market share is expected to grow six
hundred percent by next year of 2012 so
if you're ready to master the technology
and software to compete in this rapidly
growing industry visit Full Sail de ed
you / TechnoBuffalo that's full sail edu
/ TechnoBuffalo to learn more about this
online degree program back to voice
actions okay I had to do this I had to
put this thing to the test so I did a
few tests using a really corny fake
accent like hey what's going on here I
talking to the microphone so my voice
that sound good okay I go wash them now
that's my Chinese Ashton right there and
alice is it a few tests with really
exaggerated like super insanely
exaggerated speech issues like slurring
and lists which is kind of what I have
10 it is exactly what I have so it's
like show hey guys can you wash Superman
episode number seven and you know what
it worked pretty well I'm shocked okay
I'm shocked at how well it worked voice
actions does have a pro version and it's
said to be ad free give clearer
responses and cleverer answers I have
both and I haven't noticed any ads on
the free version and I don't see the
differences between the answers they
both suck at names overall voice actions
is pretty neat and fun to play with if
you want your hands for you to do
something else or if you just kind of
want to talk to your phone that's why
I'd give it a 3 out of 5 I couldn't
really give it to work well with
anything that has to do with my contacts
so that kind of killed it for me but
assuming that this application works one
hundred percent of the time then baby
girl I have no problem giving it a solid
five out of five so if you're down with
the whole voice control thingy give the
free version to try I'd skip the pro
version as I didn't notice difference
and plus you can save them money and go
buy candy or something make yourself
really happy and if there are any
applications out there that you would
like me to check out let me know by
commenting in the sandbox down there and
this was john q from TechnoBuffalo thank
you very much for tuning in and give me
a second gonna unlock the phone repeat
after me goodbye
hey Jenny set alarm for 630 a.m.
tomorrow morning I didn't even turn it
on hey Jenny what is 24 / to you are
very good at mathematics Jenny it's a
google searching that what's my name
again damn right I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
