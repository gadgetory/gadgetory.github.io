Buffalo show I'm live your to host for
this week Shaun ani editor-in-chief of
the site and i'm joined by a deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
are you doing today Todd I'm good you
and I are both just like shocked that
this week is ending yeah it's been a
crazy week I mean I i know we say that a
lot but this week especially um just
busy you know we didn't have events or
anything like that really is just a busy
week yeah well even though the holiday
falls on a Saturday for those of you not
in the US the saturdays the fourth of
July the celebration of the forming of
the United States but even though it's
on the weekend we're trying to get all
this content ready so that we can all
leave early on friday yeah so we can uh
try it well you guys can enjoy your
weekend I'm going to be on a plane
you're yes you're going out to everyone
whoa love flying my favorite pastime
actually flying to me anymore is just
this is when Sean gets to watch a movie
yeah yep the disconnects period yeah
when t-mobile and LC oh hey we're
letting you do text messages on a plane
I'm like nope nope I don't want that not
happening it's true it's like when I
catch up on all my mobile games and
stuff like that when I can yeah well all
the times when the longer flights what
I'm going to Berlin and stuff we still
have so many posts to prep for that so I
do work on those flights but the you
know the ones in the United States and
they don't have Wi-Fi that much but you
know I still gotta prep posted the only
long-haul flight I do is my vacation one
so I watch like a movie and then sleep
yeah wait which I always feel bad i
always take an aisle seat and at least
on my flights to England it's always a
to and to set up there's no somebody on
the windows somebody on the aisle and
I'm always like look if you guys get up
just poke me shake me do something climb
over me is a good luck good luck with
that since I've laid out flat good I I
wouldn't envy that person but anyway on
to the news for the week of course the
big one being Apple music
finally launched yeah I'm not overly
impressed yeah I wasn't at first and I'm
still getting used to it i've written a
couple posts and in our hands on it said
the same thing i really like the sharing
aspect of spotify you know my friends
can create playlists i was saying my
college buddies have playlist of songs
we listened to in college and I said can
subscribe to that and see it updated and
stuff like that and Apple music so far
doesn't have any of that even though you
have to create a user name and account
and all that that's only for commenting
and liking stuff in the Connect feature
which is sort of like I like to consider
sort of an Instagram inside of Apple
music for artists but they can really
post anything they want I think yeah but
there's also a ton of digging like I
bring out my iphone but in the new tab I
think it is you could go through that
and there's music videos and playlists
and everything just sort of like it's
it's like the catch-all tab for
everything else inside fact full music
which i think is really confusing at
first but I like it I actually people
were saying playlists are hard to create
and stuff I found it actually really
really easy to create playlists I do
wish there were the controls at spotify
offers so you know if I'm playing music
on my computer through itunes apple
music i'd like to be able to control
that from my phone the way spotify lets
you control it from anything it's like
keep playing on this device but you can
control from any device apple TV doesn't
have apple music yet which i think is
weird so last night i was playing beats
radio from my phone and i had to use
whatever it airplay to the apple TV
there's no like apple TV yet that does
it that does seem very odd and the other
thing was that actually it kind of
motivated me to finally check out itunes
match especially since they went to the
25,000 song when I was like you know
maybe maybe I'll finally try itunes
match so I fired it up and you know as
you know there's a limit of 25,000 well
I have 30,000 songs well it's moving to
100,000 with iOS 9 except everything
well that's good because the stupid
thing was it just went yeah more than
25,000 songs nope hey how about you let
me
pick which ones I want to move in and
said I've been sitting here deleting
albums I haven't listened to in several
years yeah it doesn't make pots yeah
nope you you have over 25,000 we don't
want you yeah okay i guess i won't hand
you my money yeah exactly and it's what
2499 a year I subscribe to it too and
I'm not even sure why because I didn't
even have that big of a library but i
think it was because I just wanted to
use Apple music to use itunes in the
cloud and stuff and then just not worry
about that which is one of the big
things now with um i guess it's the
itunes 12.2 bug these people that had
these huge libraries and did use
libraries as key melech library yeah
they did you know use itunes with these
big libraries now they're using iCloud
backup and it's mixing everything right
so they go into one album safe for bc
boys and scott like taylor swift in it
and the album arts all crazy now i
haven't seen that but i had worked it up
that that would be super annoying i I
thought I'm like one album I saw the
wrong album art but that's happened to
me for ages yeah forever they vote yeah
got an album art and especially if you
know depending on where you got your
music back in the day if you are using
you know cos am and it's from there I've
seen that kind of know those old songs
they have on my hard drive so going back
to to Apple music for just a second
beats one what have you got so far I
really like the idea of it and i've seen
some reports are saying like this is are
you know a huge breakthrough and stuff
when it's really not it's just sort of
like ham radio station yeah it's like
one twenty-four seven though they did
you repeat the shows i mean the the djs
have said you know like if you miss the
show come back from 12 hours it will
replay so nothing new there but they you
know it's neat it's like a free station
sort of like having one satellite radio
station right before the show we were
talking know the one thing i don't like
is especially like last night it doesn't
seem to cater to like it definitely
doesn't like where you are or what you
want to listen to you or anything like
it went from rolling stones like
hardcore rap and then to like british
rap and then to taylor swift and just
like it's all over the place where as
you know a standard radio station or
even
satellite radio you're like on one
station you kind of get that genre of
music it's nice when they play like what
they feel are the biggest hits are the
new hits and stuff like that because I
think the songs are pretty good but you
know like i said in our in our chat I
think they play Taylor Swift's bad blood
like 12 times a day yeah I start to
wonder like what's up part of the 1989
agreement so they can get that album or
what a great question from bridge and
Franco is betrayal going to be just
about pop music or how i like to call it
trashy auto-tune music nice for my gut
feeling is the beats one name pretty
much implies we're going to get more
channels and I think we're going to see
them start to drill down into there
probably will be a rock station a pop
station and so on the this is just the
first of what I imagine is going to be
multiple stations my biggest thing I
can't stand listening to djs which is
hilarious since I wanted to be a DJ when
I was younger most DJ's though annoy me
to no end yeah so yeah I tried lit I
listened through like one song break I
was like nope done yeah it's not even
like the song breaks to the other day
they were just like talking over the
album which I know is popular you know
on some radio stations and you're used
to that or when it's the only station or
like uh huh that's not what I want you
know I kind of like just not hearing a
DJ talk but you know I do like like I
said I like when they say you know like
this is a new song like an exclusive new
song or you might not have heard this
and then you hear it's pretty good and
you can discover music which is you know
the whole value to me to Spotify and all
these things the subscription services
for me is to discover new music i like
having an endless library and
recommendations exactly a question from
shawn the man 34 have you found any way
an apple music to put songs offline all
at once not individual i haven't played
with it that much you can do albums and
playlists and stuff offline but i don't
think you can I don't know how you could
do like all but the way to do what an
album is to go into the like you know
say you want this one song but you go
into the album each there's
the menu button on the top right of it I
think and you could hit add to library
and then keep offline or you could hit
keep offline it automatically as your
library I think so that's the best way
to do it but you know one of those
things I found two is the sink has been
slow at least it was on the first day
between my computer and my phone so like
my library's weren't add up and I don't
think my playlists have transferred
either as of last night one playlist i
made up my phone wasn't on my itunes
which was annoying you know should be
seamless like spotify makes it so easy
and again that's why I kind of like
Spotify but for Apple music I mean it's
free right now if you why not yeah
exactly well the other topic we wanted
to touch i do see we have a ton of apple
music questions we will be getting to
all those in that in the Q&amp;amp;A session but
the other topic we wanted to touch on
this week was the one plus two hmm now
of course the AO it's exciting that it's
coming out later this month but can we
talk about this bizarre announcement
system they're using yeah it's been like
I get it and they've said that they're
doing it this way but they're just
building hype around the phone by
revealing a new feature here and there
oh no i'm at the vr part oh yeah yeah
the press conference they're having
isn't a physical press conference at
least that's they've told me it's what
they've said it's just virtual reality
so like everybody can tune in from
wherever they are and where they're
they're gonna hand out or mail out I
guess if you sign up the google
cardboard er actually it's 1 plus
cardboard you know for free you just
have to pay shipping and then you can
tune in but i assume you could tune in
with any set of cardboard and i'm sure
they'll stream it so now to right there
should be just a regular video yesterday
I I would hope there's a regular stream
but yes as to the the piecemeal method
by which we're getting these
announcements uh you know they're there
is something in the news world and I
thought I know you know this but I'm
going to explain to our listeners
there's something in the world known as
the news cycle and what basically a new
cycle is considered every 24 hours yo
from midnight to midnight if you're good
at your job you're going to control
multiple news cycles and
that is exactly what 1 plus is doing by
telling us about this one part they get
a set of post during one news cycle then
they wait a couple days they make
another announcement they get another
news cycle so instead of getting one big
news cycle on the day of announcement
they're getting little news cycles
throughout the time leading up hmm hats
off till I mean it's working certainly
you just building a lot of expectations
yeah it is that that is where I think
this could end up backfiring if this
phone does not knock our socks off this
could end up being a backfire on them
yeah and they've said it like look
they've promised or not promised but
they've revealed that it's going to cost
more than last year's models so you know
but I think there they have a huge fan
base that that liked last year's model
because it wasn't too expensive and so
all these fans are hearing these new
parts that are coming like that the
fingerprint reader us bc and all this
stuff now if one plus comes out on july
27th i think it is and says like oh it's
600 bucks and i don't think it will be I
don't think lurgan really yeah but
people would be like what you know and
yet they've they've teased all these
parts leading up to then so you know
maybe it's 400 boxer which is still I
think a really good price or depending
on the model one is more the other today
we saw a leak that pointed to four gigs
of ram maybe in one model so Casey yeah
yeah the thing is i I'm I'm measuring my
expectations on this the one plus one
for me start off fantastic it's battery
life went to garbage on me ooh yo and so
I'm her I'm hesitant about where I'm how
I'm going to land on the the 1+2 me too
yeah I just the camera was never people
praised the camera I didn't find that
awesome and like you said the battery
life for me always for me I have mine
right here from the get-go was not very
good so I use this as an unlocked phone
and i think it was Berlin last year
actually which is coming up in September
and it was just dead all the time this
isn't good well we do have a question
from such a ball will any of you be
getting a 1 + 2 why or why not the
company of course will get one you know
so we can do review and videos and
everything else as for me personally I
just don't know yeah I'm going to wait
and see you know the fingerprint reader
that stuff's cool and they're saying
it's gonna be faster than touch ID which
is impressive because touch ID is pretty
quick yeah but yeah it's gonna come down
to the price and what it offers over
other stuff I do like buying new unlock
phones and it's sometimes returning them
actually let my brother use this for a
while so it was kind of nice to add uh
well speaking of returns right up from
Sean the man 34 Todd any returns nope
nope not this week okay because I
haven't made any purchases really
recently okay we're kind of in that low
ya know I really I haven't been buying a
whole lot either you know I I'm getting
ready for my what's become my annual
trip to the UK and I'm trying to decide
which phone i'm going to take as my
unlocked I mean my my mega 6.3 which
actually is sitting right here has
served me well for the last several
years but it is starting to get long in
the tooth yeah has that been updated to
lollipop or anything fun hasn't though
but what was funny was it turns out that
I used 3 as my carrier when I'm over
there well it turns out that if you
don't use your phone number for six
months they'll turn it off oh so I
actually I i contacted Killian our
writer in the UK and he went bought me a
top-up card ooh and so currently this is
working just so I wouldn't have to go
get a new sim card yeah you know at the
end of the year but uh you know thanks
Gillian that that was a big help but uh
yeah it's I don't know I'm gonna have to
see what else in the 1+2 you know for me
I with you the battery problems showed
up immediately for me it didn't show up
for like six seven months yo so I'm
going to have to make a decision of
course before then because at that point
then
why not just wait for the one plus three
exactly you know but I don't know it's
gonna be interesting to see how the one
plus two plays out I'm hopeful it's a
great phone but I do have some
trepidations for sure yeah me too i am
excited for us bc though and i want to
see you know what that's like especially
for data transfers and all that I mean
that's really should be a lot faster
yeah well to me I hate sitting around
waiting for movies to transfer my phone
Oh tell me about it the other I'm dying
to get a 64 gig ipad I just loaded up
homes for this trip I'm like 32 not good
no at most I get three movies on there
which I don't watch three movies but in
case one doesn't hit me you know in the
first five minutes I want to be able to
switch to a different movie right yeah
no but I don't know so we've got a ton
of questions coming in so let's start
piling through some of these from Sean
the man 34 do you think we will see the
apple TV at the iphone or ipad keynote I
think we're going to see it at the ipad
keynote so later probably right iPads
usually knocked over i think yeah I
think it's going to be with the ipad in
October because the iphone can sustain
an event on itself the ipad which I
can't believe people still are saying
how sales are lackluster for the ipad
you never mind we sold 20-some million
yeah slower than before because the
upgrades there's an exact time we're
seeing big reasons upgrade although I
gotta say I've been using the ipad mini
again and i miss having touch ID like I
keep touching it them like oh wait I
don't have that model same with my ipad
air you know i have an iphone 6 plus and
an ipad air which doesn't have touch ID
and everyone's while i'm like why isn't
oh yeah forgot but yeah the iphone can
sustain its own event the ipad could
probably use a little booster and so it
makes more sense to me through the apple
TV end of the ipad event that beans add
do we really think we're going to see a
new Apple TV this year we are well
better yeah and it's it's time it's
definitely time
the apple TV I mean song felt boring to
me but it's pretty boring yeah like when
you load it up I just feel like I'm like
what else can I do like why honor now
from brazen Franco how did it meizu and
I can I know usually it's every one of
us still even after that video
pronounces a different oh I managed to
make cheap metal phones was starting to
think that metal was Akron synonym for
with uber expensive there's different
here's the thing about metal just
because someone says this is metal there
are different grades of metal ooh a lot
of times back in say the 50s or so a lot
of metal toys and I'm using air quotes
were made with a type of metal called
pop metal and it looked like metal but
it was mentally could bend right so it's
Kathy 1010 was also big back then so
until you know specifically what type of
metal it is don't think that it's like
ultra strong this yes this is stuff is
metal it just depends on what grade of
metal it is yeah and also I think it
depends on the phone they're releasing
and I don't know how they do it
specifically but you have to consider
they might be doing you know they might
be releasing these phones and not making
much off them and making more off the
other ones and so that's why they're
cheap sort of the one plus mod up things
like 1 plus doesn't make much money off
of each phone sold but it's popular
because they sell them at a lower price
yeah uh from also from Breslin Franco
have you guys ordered the oneplus
cardboard I have not I don't remember if
I I might have tried to reserve it or
something but yeah no I would also hope
they would just send them to the press
but yeah I'm sure we'll get that one in
the office or something yeah but our
development live blog that right it
really cover the event like how am I
guitar right the nice thing here is like
I don't know if you can see it but I
have a monitor to my left a martyr in
front of me and then my laptop here on a
stand that's connected to both of them
so during an event I have the video
stream up on one and I'm writing and
covering it I can't do that with VR on
it I guess I could just use the audio in
which case you know I'm on the cardboard
yeah I know I i I'm with you I'm not
quite sure how they think we're going to
do then like how do you get screenshots
or images or whatever I know yeah it's
tough for the press so that's why I hope
there's a live stream to you and they
should have from mr. McBee TV do you
think Apple music will do well on
Android that is the question I've been
wondering yeah i'm curious to you
especially because Google Play musics
right there yeah and a lot not all but a
lot of Android users are going to be
idle I thing up all on my phone yeah
exactly it's more I think for like the
folks that are still using iTunes which
like I don't know how many people were I
just went back to itunes because of
Apple music Brian touched it and forever
I still use one of those apps i didn't
even updates hey I use it a lot but
mainly for podcasts okay yeah but so I
hadn't but um I don't know maybe folks
it's still use itunes and happen to have
an android fungal do it now from Shaun
the man 34 being beats one may expand to
other genres and maybe talk shows should
Apple just by sirius radio um it's an
interesting idea as Sirius XM is not
that financially healthy so it probably
wouldn't be a super expensive purchase
for them and then there's the scary
concept of Apple having its own
satellites yeah that's always just
thinking cuz this is totally different
snot satellite basically saying like
satellite yeah yeah um I don't know it's
an interesting question it would it
would let them ramp up a lot faster
that's for sure yeah I don't know it's a
very interesting question Jon I yeah if
they want to go that route it would make
sense but maybe they don't maybe the
only one you know like five stations or
something
now lets Apple they want everything from
Sean the man 34 as well not sure if this
has ever been asked what computers do
you guys use wait what do you want to
let me start I have in front of me i
have a macbook pro 2015 auto with uh
horse touch and then i have this windows
netbook that i use from time to time and
then i have under my desk a pc but it's
still on a core i3 processor it was just
getting too slow so it's in desperate
need of an upgrade like all around
though so I haven't really messed with
it that much recently but those are my
those are my big go tubes so windows and
I I'm strictly 00 s10 at this point this
is a imac 27-inch and with the modders
on either side of it and then my travel
computer is a 15-inch MacBook Pro which
I can't I'd want to say it's 2014 it's
actually jon rettinger Zolt macbook pro
aside i don't remember which year was i
think i was 2014 but uh yeah i used to
be a Windows user for years and years
and like 20-some years and then I went
all Mac because I went over to the dark
side I love a lot of foot windows offers
and I'm excited for Windows 10 that's
what actually was running on my desktop
here but it was just too sluggish so
we're now launches I'll probably look at
at you know maybe another sort of laptop
it's a little bit more powerful than my
netbook but not as expensive or feature
riches as my work computer here the
macbook pro yeah uh from President
Franco what are the odds that one of the
big three Microsoft Google and Apple
decide to buy out sound him for their
hound AI i would say extremely high yeah
it seems like i mean if it's easy to mix
that tech into what they have I mean
Apple I'm looking at you cuz Siri still
isn't good unless you ask her about 0 /
0 yes
that was pretty funny yeah uh-huh she
goes into a cookie monster rant by the
way if anybody hasn't done that yet yes
sirree what is 0 / 0 and ask her if she
has a boyfriend or girlfriend oh I
haven't done that yet hope to god that
that one's it's not as long but it's
still pretty funny flying um yeah but I
mean soundhound I think so far right it
just called Hound um that that app it's
just Android I think right so I don't
know I mean I guess Apple could take
that technology and build it into Syria
I don't know how all that works now but
even in iOS 9 I was using that Siri was
still thumb which was up you know
upsetting maybe she'll get smarter yeah
sir Sir he needs some definite adult
from morning glory 95 are you guys
signed up for the free copy windows 10
and are you planning to try windows 10
mobile when it debuts we will definitely
try windows 10 mobile when it debuts
yeah I've been actually testing that on
the fast track playing with it it's not
ready for prime time not ready for your
primary device at all but it's still
pretty cool again it's still they said
it's there's a big app situation there
and I'm I'm really interested to see the
new hardware I want you know another
phone with a good camera I want us bc
which i assume is going to be included
because they have that continuum feature
that we've talked about where you can
blow up an appt to really use a full
screen on it with like an hdmi cable or
something but in this case it'll be a
USB USB see cable to a display I assume
that South are going to do instead of a
small us are uh hdmi port so new
hardware i think is most important and
then we'll see how the software runs on
that because you're gonna want the new
hardware for all the features it offers
iris scanning i think we've seen in
rumors and I think that was actually
confirmed what's it called windows hello
or something it's not the like well yeah
a very odd from Benjamin McDonald hey I
remember when Todd went to Stockholm
very sad I couldn't come are you going
here again sometime wasn't that one of
the car yeah I was there with volvo for
to watch an accident
I don't think I'll be that was like a 12
time kind of thing I don't think I'll be
back soon but I'd love to go back maybe
for vacation that was such an awesome
way to describe that trip watching car
accident what he needs folks is that it
was a planned car accident to
demonstrate hey i love it amazes me
sometimes with the car companies are
like hey let us fly you to Sweden so you
can just watch us crash a car right yeah
bad news my audacity had stopped
recording on its own oh awesome well
that's why we do the YouTube as well
because then I can strip the audio out
of the video so not a problem okay you
mean oh well it's a hassle but we'll
figure it out uh from Sean the man 34
will we see spot if I do live radio I
don't sound like I don't know if they're
gonna do it but it seems like it would
be an interesting you know bonus to
catch up and in some ways I'm not saying
they need to catch up at all but I if
they want to offer similar features to
what Apple music said it would be cool
cuz i really do like that part of apple
music beats 1 yeah I don't know it'll be
interesting to see if they ever do it uh
from suction be Hall is it better to get
a pebble time or wait for one of the
newer Android wear devices that are
coming out later this year um and wait
honestly I mean you like double time but
I have fan of it yeah I i I'm enjoying
it but yeah I I just don't know I'm
still not an Android wear fan I'm not
either yet but the latest update made a
little better and i think it's worth
waiting to see what the new hardware is
like that's what I would do speaking of
the pebble time we have a question from
bruising Franco how's the pebble time
Sean I'm really interested by if it
wasn't for those huge bezels around it
um the bezels honestly the pebble time
yes it does have huge bezels but it's no
where's past original pebble
um and also you don't really even see
them via when you're looking at the
phone I I like the pebble time I'm very
happy with it so do with that as you
will yeah I mean I still and I see a
question from Sean the man 34 there I
still have the the Apple watch still
liking it and actually I forgot to
charge it last night right I put on the
charger but it wasn't plugged in and
it's a 25-percent from yesterday at
seven in the morning so it's really not
that bad for battery life at least for
me from Benjamin mcdonald and 2016 the
EU is going to bring out a law that all
phones have to be USB do you think this
is why the macbook 2015 is USBC yes Boy
Wonder I thought that was a law to for
micro USB I might be around it is a law
firm micro USB at this time that's why
Apple had to come out with the adapters
doctor here yeah so I hace I don't know
if they do go USBC on the iPhones then
yeah they that might be I'm just trying
to test that water and see what happens
but uh I don't know we'll see what
happens let's see here from such a Mahal
what is the main purpose of itune match
for those who don't use it it allows you
to match your offline collection with
apples online collection and then they
will let you upload any tracks that they
don't have then you can access it from
your phone your Apple TV and so on it's
kind of like a cloud version of itunes
sharing right with a really stupid name
yeah that's why i did for a long time
because the name just made no sense yeah
in 24 99 a year yeah which is not
horrible right also from such a mahal
what is the benefit of subscribing those
streaming music service like Apple music
spotify google play music all access
radio etc ability to listen to music
anytime anywhere you want I you
is Pandora personally and you know so
like when I'm out irvine I don't wanna
listen to terrestrial radio you know
once every in a blue moon I get a car
with siriusxm Anna but I don't want to
listen to terrestrial radio so I listen
to pandora you know when i'm driving
around i listened to pandora before i go
to bed it's just a great way for me to
uh you know find new music that I'm not
familiar with right and I like it
because um I know you were sending you
3000 songs and somewhere on some hard
drive somewhere I have all my songs that
I had when I was younger that I ripped
from CDs and stuff like that but I don't
know where that is so for me these
provide you know the endless library
seemingly depending on who's you know
available but that's why i like them
from the crafting turtles do you think
the Play Store app store will come to
Windows Phone or neither i heard a rumor
about it ah what do I think the Play
Store oh I don't think so I don't think
so either no I think Microsoft wants to
control their own domain I saw that
rumor that they were looking at android
but that I don't know it seems like they
put a lot into Windows 10 I think you're
gonna keep doing that yeah i agree but i
don't think we even covered that rumors
it seemed kind of way out there yeah
it's oh no from such a mahal off topic
more perfect than question tomorrow is
the 30th anniversary back to the future
the first one well good because i love
that movie and that also makes me feel
old because i can remember singing it in
the theater opening week say that oh
that movies as old as I am I guess oh
thanks for an older Todd since I Darren
44 this month uh wait heater when was
your birthday would you birth it a July
twentieth Oh from Brisbane Franco I just
hope the 1+2 comes with the SD card slot
this time you and me both yeah I don't
think so
I don't think so yer i agree with you i
like having that still too that's why i
like the g4 it's why i like to want him
nine but i don't i don't know yeah I
just uh I don't know I hope it does but
not all of my breath yeah I wouldn't
also from the crafting turtles do you
think the iphone 7 will have a home
button or the concept of touch sensor I
don't know I don't yeah we've seen
actually I think patents that have shown
that the output fingerprints into this
screen or fingerprint identification so
it'd be cool but I feel like everybody's
so used to the home button no no I guess
it would work yeah I think I remembered
back when the first iphone was out
people showing like a touchscreen
concept with that and i was like wow
that's crazy wouldn't it be funny if it
actually came true yeah don't and it
would be interesting but that is
definitely a year or more or wave for
sure let's see here from Sean the man 34
heading to college I want to get a
macbook pros Apple going to do the
back-to-school promotions your gift
Kotter gift card or iPod I can't see
that why they wouldn't yeah I think they
usually do that so you're waiting I
would wait for it although it centro
saying it hasn't started yet yeah it
should it should start soon right like
mid July August because that's going
everybody's starting to either
back-to-school stuff yeah from Benjamin
McDonald i'm using the Moto G first gen
and is in need of an upgrade though I
don't have so much money should i wait
for the oneplus 2 by a 1 plus 1 or wait
for the next Nexus Nexus is gonna be way
expensive yeah I wouldn't wait for that
it's probably not to like October right
I think that's when the Nexus actually
right for some this is a tough color no
we just leaked pictures of the Moto G
3rd gen and that looks like it's pretty
sweet phone maybe now and it should be
affordable I i think i would look at
another Moto G if you've been happy with
it yeah I don't know when it's coming
you soon from birds and Franco do you
think boo two phones should stick to
debian its current state or become an
Android fork like Amazon's fire or less
um I like it in the current state
because of their if they can still
execute on the on the desktop you know
plug in and get a real desktop that'd be
awesome but if they need android if they
want to go more powerful I'd like to see
more powerful want two phones um and if
that's the way they want to do it then
they should go android but I like the
idea of what they've sort of been
working with so I don't want to see them
ditch it now post an emerg Forks I mean
Amazons fire OS at least on you know the
phone didn't do well you don't get
google play services so you have to have
your own app store I don't know from
such and baja were any of you
subscribers of beats music before it
became Apple music her to go even
further back mod music which was before
beats nope um I subscribe to beats music
for like a monster's to try it and then
I stopped is there any music service you
haven't subscribed to I've never done
our do I've never paid for Pandora I
used songs a lot that was free lehigh
food fer I still actually paid for Xbox
music because again i was playing with
the new windows 10 for phones build i
gotta cancel laughs because now it's
like apple musics you know here in three
months gonna cost money i play pay for
google play music spotify it's kind of a
waste of money from such an bahala do
you think the Moto 360 second gen will
release in September just like the did
last year alongside the Moto X probably
it seems likely yeah uh that's from the
crafting turtles we listen to the
dubstep radio channel on beats 1 radio
from iOS 8.4 no have it that dub dub
step is not about my not my style but I
think beats one is just its own channel
I mean and then there's like all the
playlist channels right the genres
they're not live radio
a little bit of housecleaning here folks
before we close out for the week we will
be taking next week off because I will
as Todd stayed beyond irvine i will be
out there to work for the week as well
as attending San Diego comic-con so i
will be bringing you lots of interesting
photos and information from the show and
although i'm not trying to get into Hall
H I'm not insane elite Hall H is their
biggest room and so that's where like
marble although they're not there this
year that's where like marble has their
presentation Warner Brothers but the
thing is it I think it holds 5,000 but
press is not guaranteed entry so you
have to line up like everybody else and
largely the line for like Thursday's
panels will start Wednesday night
Friday's panels will start Thursday
night I'm not staying overnight yes they
i I've been my 40s folks I don't sleep
outside four panels Hall H is actually
where famously a thing was like three
four years ago somebody stabbed somebody
else in the I first see whoa yeah the
pencil it was ya know as a pin it was a
pin but yes there was a I stabbing going
on Wow yeah speak a comics a question
from morning glory 95 I know Sean isn't
really up on current comics but is he
reading or interested in secret wars
basically its ultimate versus prime
marble universes and it's awesome I'm
haven't read them I'm familiar with
what's going on I still not sure how I
feel about them using the name Secret
Wars akin uh you know because what's
next contest of Champions this is all
going right over Todd's head yeah it's
making me laugh yes sir actually though
they are going to release a game called
contest of Champions which I looks like
pleased really you can't come up with
another name but yeah I know they're
merging their universes and it's
basically just to bring everything in
line with the film's add
more power to them it's working form but
I'll probably read at some playing
tempted to subscribe to their unlimited
reading app I'd forgive what it's called
but uh you have to wait like six months
for that months books but there's like
forty seven thousand books in the app oh
wow yeah so why not uh from Sean the man
34 speaking of waiting line have you
ever camped out for weight or waiting in
line for a product I the closest I ever
came to waiting in line I I went and sat
outside the theater here in kirksville
for tickets for episode 1 and after two
and a half hours of me being the only
person sitting out there the manager
just when sold me my tickets but uh
small head Living God but I've never
came that for a product of you tub no
now the irvine crew did was for the
iphone 6 and 6 plus yeah yep they sat
outside all night of the irvine spectrum
