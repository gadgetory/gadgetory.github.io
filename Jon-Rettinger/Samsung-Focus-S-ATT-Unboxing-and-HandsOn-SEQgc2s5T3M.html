Thanksgiving is over Christmas isn't
here yet
what about Hanukkah Kwanzaa and Boxing
Day I'm Noah from TechnoBuffalo and this
is the Samsung Focus s
all right it's the focus s from Samsung
and AT&amp;amp;T the first 4G Windows Phone
device in AT&amp;amp;T is lineup except that LTE
is coming rd here in parts of the
country so really one is 4G not 4G 4G is
not 40 when it's not 4G LTE because
there's already 4G LTE even though this
says 4G are you confused yet so my but
that's how fast marketing speak goes the
focus s from Samsung and AT&amp;amp;T thanks to
the folks at Samsung for sending us this
one to review on loan otherwise known as
the I 937 this is selling right now for
$99.99 on contract a new two-year
contract from AT&amp;amp;T
although it's been seen for as little as
absolutely nothing around the web during
the madness that is known as Black
Friday Cyber Monday cyber week even just
saying lately I've seen it for free
online but at 9999 the official price
from AT&amp;amp;T which it in just
underneath the ginormous HTC Titan ooh
there I am the in the velocity
reflection what's up slots it in just
underneath the HTC Titan which is the
most expensive not to mention the
largest displayed Windows Phone 7 device
in 1880's lamp the 4.7 inch display on
the HTC 4.3 inches on the focus s who
ever would have thought that a 4.3 inch
display phone would seem small but I
mean seriously look at it next to the
Titan Titan is ginormous anyway we're
not talking about the Titan we're
talking about the focus s and here it is
Windows Phone 7.5 it's got that
foreplane 4.3 inch display that I
mentioned it's a Super AMOLED plus
capacitive touchscreen 800 by 480 480 by
800 480 by 800 W VGA cuz that's what
Windows Phone 7 maxes out at right now
it is a thin light phone eight and a
half millimeters thin a little bit
thinner than the Titan I just showed you
which is nine point nine millimeters and
it is available now on this device so
take a little tour around on the front
you've got the capacitive touchscreen
the three Windows Phone buttons back
windows search
on the top you've got a front-facing
camera this one collects in 1.3
megapixels on the back 8 megapixel main
camera with flash and capable of 720p HD
video and also you've got this sticker
not anymore a little bit of a WikiWiki
back panel there the texture also on the
back you've got little speaker grille on
the right spine you've got your power
lock switch and then also your dedicated
camera button on the bottom you've got
the micro USB port and the microphone on
the other side you've got a rocker
switch for volume and other sundry
things what doesn't make sense on the
top you've got your 3 9 millimeter audio
jack and then you little sticker that
says Qualcomm HSPA+ again its 4G HSPA+
it's not 4G LTE just getting more and
more confusing all the time I said that
already sorry and there you go the phone
itself
Windows Phone 7.5 you've got a Qualcomm
processor in the device it's a 1.4
gigahertz processor and otherwise you
know Windows Phone is pretty much
Windows Phone a couple of AT&amp;amp;T extras
bloatware if you will
you've got your u-verse mobile and your
Navigator your 18 - radio daily briefing
is a Samsung app xviii your family map
my wireless u-verse mobile we showed you
that was pinned to the start page yellow
page is mobile otherwise not too much
that's different from your standard
Windows Phone install I've been using
the Titan for several days now I got
that before I got the focus s and I've
just really been enjoying it I just I'm
a big fan of Windows on right now
there's some things still that it can't
do some apps that aren't available yet
you know depending on your specific
needs
maybe the apps are available maybe
they're not for me Spotify is available
there's not an official Sonos Controller
so you know that's kind of my big thing
right now cuz I have a Sonos at home and
I use a cell phone
or an iPad to control it but you know a
lot that it can do I'm really enjoying
the messaging really enjoying the people
app I like the way social media is
integrated into the phone the Xbox Live
stuffs kind of need a met a big enough
gamer to really know if it's a lame or
awesome let's take a look at now because
that's a proprietary thing so Sam saying
you see the copy right at the bottom
it's a Samsung app well I've got to get
Wi-Fi go on there's no SIM card in this
and so if you've never used Windows
Phone before you should definitely go
back check out some of the other videos
and posts we've done on the recent
Windows Phone 7.5 devices couldn't a
mango let's go to add a city we're gonna
add Oakland California all right
it's Pleasant 60 clouds of the Sun the
news has not been updated so it's kind
of like Samsung's daily briefing on the
TouchWiz foams stocks weather news top
tweeds there you go but if you've never
used Windows Phone you know it's this
whole live tile system where you've got
these tiles pinned to the homepage or
the start page if you will Internet
Explorer not the best mobile browser but
it works okay one's got an accelerometer
so you can use in widescreen mode and
the keyboard are really nice the Windows
Phone keyboard so good a TechnoBuffalo
comm you've got the mobile version
loading up right now
pinch and zoom all that stuff from you
know for my money the the web browsers
are not quite as smooth as the one on
the iPhone but but it's pretty nice I
preferred a little bit over Android
myself
you've got multitasking you hold down
the back button and then you can go
through your your recent applications we
can go back to the weather or to the now
app there you've got the search key
which links into Bing and has voice
activation so you can do voice you know
hit the search button in voice search
allow search voice except I want some
Thai food and so there's web here's
local no local results for I want some
Thai food but can we go Thai food what
happened all right maybe it's not so
good
Thai food there we go local Thai food
yeah there we go
it's a boy said boy that's good stuff if
you like fish sauce then you can also
hold down the windows phone button find
Thai food in Indianapolis oh I have to
hit speak first hop fine Thai food in
Indianapolis right so you know tell me
Siri I don't know it just doesn't matter

jasmine thai indianapolis indiana there
you go
we can go back suit again open calendar
that's great good right oh nothing on my
calendar switch the camera mode there I
like the way the animation zoom in and
out anyway this is supposed to be an
unboxing got a full review of Windows
Phone 7.5 but like I said I've been
having a little Renaissance with it
having received the Titan the unlock
Titan on now having the focus s a little
bit smaller a little bit lighter you
know it's typical Samsung vs. HTC the
Samsung kind of the plastic build but
very very light weight
the HTC kind of that heavier duty
aluminum construction but you know I'm
psyched to be playing with Windows Phone
7.5 I only wish that I had access to
u-verse where I live to try that out and
I'm psyched for CES because I hear tell
there's gonna be some interesting
Windows Phone related announcements
coming up at CES in just over a month
but for the meantime it's not even
boxing day yet so let's slow down it's
the it's the Samsung Focus s from 18 to
you Windows Phone device again $99.99
contract with two-year contract
officially through AT&amp;amp;T although I've
seen it for as little as absolutely
nothing free on contract during these
crazy pre and post Thanksgiving sales
online so if you're interested in this
phone check it out
we'll be back we'll have us some
comparisons John did an unboxing of the
Titan already we'll do a review of this
one and some comparisons that kind of
stuff but so far dig in the phone which
really is a reflection
the operating system more than anything
but are they like a lightweight wait
this is thanks again to the folks at
Samsung and AT&amp;amp;T for lending us this
device much much more on all the new
Windows Phone devices all the new
