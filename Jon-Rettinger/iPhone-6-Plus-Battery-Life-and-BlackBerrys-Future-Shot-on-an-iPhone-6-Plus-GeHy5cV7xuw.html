to you by t-mobile that makes sense
what's up everyone welcome back there
episode of acid buffalos to show you can
ask me any question you've got from or
the technology and sometimes outside
this week's episode of ask the buff was
being filmed entirely with iphone
six-plus as ron is sitting right across
from the filming me we got mark shooting
b-roll of him and all of the audio is
going directly into an iphone 6 just a
sense of what it would look like what
you could do with an iphone six-plus so
up this week we're going to talk a lot
about iphones we're going to talk some
about blackberry to bring back with some
more questions about whether or not the
phones are just too big or too
influenced by samsung this is that's the
Buffalo it's going to get started so our
first question comes from at Fir phone
tech who asks at John for lakers how
long does a battery life in the iphone 6
6 plus well good question first I would
never gauge phone usage based on battery
life the first weeks usually are using
it weigh heavier so I think said that
saturday i was using my iphone six-plus
pretty hard at screen on I usually I
don't set for auto brightness I had it
set to about 75% I was testing
absolutely everything I hadn't plugged
my phone in twice after about 10 hours i
was down to about twenty twenty-five
percent but sunday was my son's birthday
and i couldn't be on the phone all the
time i took it off the charger around
eight the time i plugged it back in at
night around the love and i still had
forty six percent battery life left so
the real battery usage is probably
somewhere in between Bob looks to be
certainly better than we saw on the
iphone 5s nothing it's gonna totally
blow you away i'm still doing tests
though on the iphone 6 so stay tuned to
afford you on both those to see if how
much better we're better at all they
might be next question comes from a-z
many ice who asks at john for lakers
what is the future of blackberry after
able to run android apps listen i'm
going to say this I'm gonna go on the
record of saying this blackberry 10.3 is
really really good I comes with Amazon's
app store built in you can sideload
pretty much every android app got
blackberries own app store on there it
doesn't really solid operating system
the NOC used to be and i was 112
knocking was that it just didn't have
at all but it got super good between 10
and 10.3 keyboards got way better black
braids awesome mail service got more
intuitive if you haven't considered
going to black where you might want to
try to get kind of the best of Android I
think with their app stores but also you
get sort of the best of blackberry now
too with their incredible email the
passports coming to keep we're on that
looks absolutely awesome give them
another shot at least go ahead and check
them out at a store and see if something
you think you might want to use because
they are really up and coming and I
think the black bracelets and wife left
take a quick sec to thank our friends at
ting if you've got a cell phone you got
a cell phone plan chances are you over
paying for stuff that you just don't
need with ting there are no plans you
aren't forced to pick one based on what
you think you might use that month which
means are we way less waste which means
less money coming out of your pocket you
simply pay for service you use leave the
summers whenever you want and there are
no fees at all there are no hidden admin
fees no sketchy charges in t-bills are
super simple to understand they only
charge you for the usage plus six
dollars per device plus tax each month
to make it be Lee simple if you're ready
to get started use promo code
technobuffalo tank calm and save $25 on
your device purchase or get twenty-five
dollars and ting service credit to use
towards your monthly bill again that's
technobuffalo ting calm next question
comes from at Red Sox 2009 who asks at
John for Lakers hashtag ask the Buffalo
does a larger iPhone level the playing
field with Android or Apple still behind
at all this way it usually goes with
Android and Apple almost always Android
is one that put out new features first
and then to refine it live Apple takes
the other approach usually wait
sometimes way longer than i would like
I'm sure you as well to get the new
features out on phone take NFC for
example androids have NFC for the better
part of three and a half years apple
just put it out for Apple pay on the
iphone 6 and 6 plus but it's totally
neutered you can't do anything else with
that other than use it for mobile
payments when it comes to the screen
certainly I don't think we'd have knives
on 6 plus if it wasn't for samsung
screens are now going to K and apples
just finally releasing a 1080p screen
now it's a great 1080p screen by all
accounts one of the best
p screens on there but resolutions
getting better Apple hasn't really
played that much to the spec race we're
gonna look in a spec sheet side-by-side
with layers from apple and weight is
firm from Android certainly the Android
device has the iphones beat on specs
we're sort of it gets sort of up to par
I was with the experience if you like an
experience going to work and be elegant
and have a great app store than iOS is a
great way to go especially if you're an
apples ecosystem if you want
customization and you want cutting-edge
features androids great way to go and I
said for consumers it's good when you
have choice so you can they pick which I
have the fence you were on last question
comes from GATS Gary the gamer 88 who
asks does reach ability actually make
the iphone 6 plus a one-handed phone so
I will say this and I think a lot of
people are in this boat they didn't try
the iphone 6 bus before their order that
or bought it and they got it on there
like this thing is just way too big even
our own Brendan Russell swapped his for
an iphone 6 my brother-in-law swapped
his for an iphone 6 it's big so reach
ability essentially what that lets you
do is you double tap on touch ID and it
drops the phone down just a little bit
so you can reach things I have pretty
large hands like an Impala basketballs
relative ease and it's a big phone even
for me to reach on so I imagine for a
lot of people it's going to be really
difficult definitely to hated device
reach ability helps if you want to serve
access the maybe right three rows or
columns of apps but anything all we on
the left you're still going to have to
use two hands for it so be very aware
that if you haven't tried or seen the
six plus in person before you order
before you buy go to an apple store and
give it a shot because you might find
it's just too big 30 for iOS users
who've using iPhones forever it's a
really jarring jump from four inches of
5.5 inches inch and a half on the phone
is a lot and the bezels are huge on top
and bottom so it's even larger than just
the screen size so definitely go and
give it a shot with a help enter
questions thank you guys for watching
episode of ask the Buffalo once again
all the video that you see here is being
shot with iphone 6 plus is the audio is
going directly into an iphone 6 on my
lap we got Ron filling we got mark doing
b-roll all up their respective phones so
it's kind of fun will do other videos
using the device as you can see what
video looks like on it until next time
I'm genre in Japan technobuffalo guys
