is the face of a man recovering from a
super bad flu but I'm here talking about
surface book and the MacBook Pro because
I love this stuff and I want to talk
about technology with you so you
couldn't guess it topic is videos all
about your questions on the updated
surface book with performance base and
the new MacBook Pro with touch bar of
which we went on more coverage coming up
let's go ahead and jump right into the
question so as a touch bar really useful
for editing if you edit right now in
Premiere Pro the note because nobody
hasn't done anything with it but if you
edit in Final Cut surprisingly useful
you can change audio levels in track you
can scrub actually found myself using it
a lot but the caveat is if you dock your
computer like I usually do whenever I do
some editing then the touch bar is not
that useful for me but if you use your
laptop to edit with the screen open the
touch bar is surprisingly helpful
there's a lot to like about the MacBook
Pro I think the touch bar certainly is a
highlight
I would love to say battery life is
outstanding but mine has has not been
but I think aside from the touch bar the
new screen looks really nice resolution
hasn't changed the color gamut way
better I like to do thinner bezels the
screen is really nice outdoors as well
it's way less reflective so screen and
touch bar so you get two for two for the
price of one oh man build quality these
are probably some of the two best made
laptops that I have ever tested I think
if I'm relying solely on build quality I
think I'm gonna give it to the MacBook
Pro but probably for a backhanded reason
because it doesn't have to have gaps
where the screen will pop off which is a
benefit of the surface book so I don't
want a knock knock it for having that I
have to pick one though I think the
Apple MacBook Pro really has build
quality down pat so Windows and I think
rightfully so got kind of a bad
reputation for not really smooth
scrolling especially on a trackpad I
don't know that the case with other
Windows laptops but on the surface book
is really good the glass trackpad
really responsive I had no issues with
scrolling multi-touch gestures worked
well it works as well as anything I've
tested from Apple so don't worry about
that at all as far as the hinge it does
have a little bit of
floppy flashiness in it that's been a
knock that I had on both generations of
surface book but I do like how the hinge
kind of unrolls and when you hold it to
us to feel like you're holding kind of a
spiral notebook and it does kind of it's
got a cool factor we have to deal with
the gap in there so it's kind of
give-and-take with the hinge whether or
not you're sort of pro or con I think I
like the way it looks but I wish it was
a little more stable so a kind of
interesting question and sort of boils
down to is Windows or any OS need a
touchscreen and I think if you haven't
used a touchscreen OS like Windows 10
it's a very valid question to ask
I found myself very often just scrolling
with my finger through a website that
was really the only time that I used
touch when it was docked like a laptop
but he was like a tablet certainly I
used touch a lot more so yeah for me it
was very useful isn't necessarily no it
is absolutely not necessary you can do
everything you want with the keyboard
and a mouse but I like having that added
flexibility when I need it it was there
when I didn't need it I didn't have to
use it I think Apple doe is onto
something with the touch bar and I said
this in review I was very dubious with a
touch bar but it works very well and I
think it's got a lot of potential
developers get on board with what it can
do so it's kind of different approaches
to the same means I wish that you had
the option to do everything you could
touch the screen all over use a touch
bar apples made it very clear that
touchscreen os's are not coming to Mac
OS so I recommend trying both and see
which one you prefer probably the
simplest one for me is scrubbing your
videos when I'm watching YouTube it's
really helpful be able just to scrub the
video go to a certain time frame doing
what I do and my constant watching a lot
of videos and going back and watching
some borrowed videos making notes being
able to scrub is really really helpful
and it's not any easier than using a
mouse or keyboard but it does feel way
cooler the cool thing about ting is that
you only pay for the data that you're
using you're not paying 70 bucks a month
for a six gig bucket maybe use half of
it you only pay for the data you use
starting at just $10 per gigabyte
looking to save a few bucks and also get
a really killer service visit
TechnoBuffalo ting comm and see how much
you could save and on top of that you
also get 25 bucks toward your first
device in ting service also makes really
good gift
so check out again at TechnoBuffalo ting
accom that's T ing
so that was MacBook Pro and surface book
we're have a ton more coverage bashing
these two behemoths head-to-head but I
wanted to sort of answer your questions
about it let you know we have more
coverage coming and also we can help
direct our coverage in the future for
what you guys want to see save that
comments down below what else you want
to see these two computers do and we
will do it to you because we love this
stuff thanks for giving us the
opportunity to do it the next time John
right in here from TechnoBuffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
