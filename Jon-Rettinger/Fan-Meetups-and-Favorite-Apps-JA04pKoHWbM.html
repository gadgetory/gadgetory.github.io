to you by Linda calm hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me actually skip that any question you
might have for the wide world of
technology every Tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo calm
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise said unto me at any
time of the day or night on twitter at
TechnoBuffalo or at ashley ask evan just
use the hashtag ask me so i can see it
usually i answer between three and five
questions every episode so let's get
answering because this is ask the
Buffalo
I shahroz mutt on twitter asks hey
technobuffalo is amazing and has earned
its YouTube subscribers thank you do you
guys ever plan on doing an event to meet
fans this is a question we've actually
been getting more and more as we get
closer to a million subscribers which is
really exciting for us on YouTube
there's nothing definitive but I do know
for a fact that we have been discussing
that as something we would really like
to do and we really like to set up one
event or maybe even more next year in
2014 to meet you guys and throw a big
party and have a great time so that is
definitely something we have been
talking about Josh asks hey Ashley what
are some of your favorite apps on your
phone or tablet which apps do you use
most often so on my phone I have an
iPhone and every now and again I also
use an HTC One so on iphone I really
like tweetbot obviously social media big
deal for me the tweet bot and Google+ I
use a lot on the iphone and then on the
HTC One I use plume that's my twitter
app of choice for android i am very very
organized when it comes to my apps and
on my iphone everything is in folder so
i use yelp a lot i really really like
using all of my banking apps thank for
like credit cards and my bank account
and everything like that's really great
I really enjoy games like games are my
big thing I love it right now I'm really
enjoying the wolf among us on my iPad
Mini probably pocket casts would be I
listen to a lot of podcasts so I would
say a handful of social media apps and
then um podcasting Harry new door for 18
on twitter says if you could create any
phone what size would it be the specs
and details of it this is an awesome
question and i love these sort of
hypotheticals where I can kind of mix
everything together I would love the
body of a Lumia iOS as an operating
system with the widgets of Android and I
would like the notification system of
webos and the app ecosystem of iOS so
all it took way too much to ask is crazy
I think a phone for me the sweet spot on
screen size would be four and a half to
five inches of screen I would say the
things would be my perfect chimera if
you will of phones at Tech X central
says with phones like the Moto G do you
think other companies will produce
unlocked phones with costs in mind this
is also a really good question that I
think the answer to this kind of lays
where Google is going with the Nexus so
I think at first only really hard core
android fans knew about nexus devices
and developers and then as we've kind of
moved along into the Nexus 5 even my dad
is asking me about the Nexus and so I
think it's finally starting to sort of
hit the mainstream that there are great
great phones out there whether its
mid-range like the Moto G or higher end
like the Nexus 5 that are really
affordable and you don't need a contract
with so I think that now we're going to
start seeing these kind of mid-range to
mid high range phones released with
costs in mind because I do think that
emerging markets are huge huge
competition right now between all of the
phone manufacturers and OEMs and I think
we're actually gonna see kind of this
sort of middle ground go away this kind
of milk last phone go away which is sort
of weird I think you're gonna see the
flagships get flagship e'er you're gonna
get crazier and crazier with specs and
maybe not more expensive but maybe a
little more expensive also you're gonna
be seeing these sort of entry-level
phones get better and better and better
um but still cost very very little which
will be super awesome for people who
can't afford flagships we got to take a
