from TechnoBuffalo and today we have
this bad boy right here the Nvidia
shield tablet and we're here to unbox it
for you guys and see what's inside
so let's cut this piece off and see
what's inside let's see the game on we
have the video shield wireless
controller an empty box another empty
box and we have the shield tablet cover
right here so the other thing that's
included in the box is actually a mini
HDMI to HDMI cable which is actually
really nice for them to actually include
an HDMI cable finally we have the Nvidia
shield tablet so it says Nvidia shield
the ultimate tablet for gamers so let's
try and pull this off right here looks
like we got the wall port right here got
the USB cable guessing it's just a micro
USB looks like we got some packaging
right here safety information card this
is I guess the US variant for the wall
charger yeah
yep there we go doesn't seem to be
anything else in the box wow that
actually feels really nice reminds me a
lot of the Nexus 7 the old quality-wise
has that nice matte material so let's
run down the specs for you guys real
quick so the shield tablet is built as
the ultimate tablet for gamers and it
has a powerful NVIDIA Tegra k1 Kepler
GPU as 2.2 gigahertz ARM Cortex
815 CPU but 2 gigabytes of RAM it has 16
gigabytes of internal storage but
expandable to 128 gigabytes to be a
microSD slot has a beautiful 8 inch full
HD screen resolution of 1920 by 1200
it's an IPS LCD display it has dual
front-facing speakers just like the HTC
One and we're really excited to test
that out for you guys and it runs in
videos game stream tech which streams
full PC games to the tablet it can also
stream out to twitch without an app and
has Wi-Fi direct for an ultra-low
latency wireless gamepad connectivity
which we have right here and it also
runs Android and does all the normal
stuff you'd expect from Android tablet
of course let's unbox this as well this
is the Nvidia shield controller there
you go
taking a closer look at this controller
it actually feels really nice it reminds
me of the Xbox ones controller we have
some capacitive buttons here they're not
clickable I believe they are capacitive
and they will glow if they are turned on
the buttons are really clicky and
has a nice tactile feel to it and the
overall like grip Ness it feels great
so this is the Nvidia shield tablet
cover and it actually reminds me a lot
of the iPad Mini Smart Cover but this
one actually has a nice rubbery texture
to it and felt material on the inside
nice metal frame right here and it
actually is connected via two magnets
right here see it'll just connect in
there and
voila it turns on the screen
automatically just like the Smart Cover
but I really like this you can position
this into three different layouts just
like the Smart Cover but we are not
going to do that today
because we will review this and we're
gonna show you what it's all about and
that's it for this video guys if you
guys have any other questions let us
know in the comments down below I'm mark
