from TechnoBuffalo and I've got the
Nokia n8 here and I'm gonna share with
you guys my experiences with it the
Nokia n8 is a Symbian powered all
touchy-touchy phone has made out of
metal and glass with the 12 megapixel
camera I've been a Symbian user for
maybe about three or four years before I
started using devices like the
blackberry and now the iPhone and I'm
gonna approach this review through the
eyes of an average user you know like
the average Joe or Jane actually don't
know anybody named Joe or Jane you know
just like a regular person who wants to
do simple things like texting email web
browsing watch videos mobile gaming and
so on because honestly you shouldn't
need three to four years of experience
with a mobile OS to use the darn thing
the hardware on the m8 is fantastic it's
probably one of the most solid feeling
devices I've ever held the slim profile
is definitely very welcome compared to
other Nokia devices like the Nokia n97
and the Nokia n900 the downside to the
slimmer profile would be a smaller
battery but it's not too bad it should
get you through the day with regular
media and data usage you know 3G Wi-Fi
making phone calls and listen in to your
jammie-jams or music I think that's
about all the pros that I can say about
the Nokia n8 the software on this thing
sorry to say but terrible my opinion
Symbian is very outdated compared to
other mobile OS is like iOS and Android
OS the UI is bla settings are a little
confusing and folders look like
applications so sometimes apps can be
within a folder within a folder and you
can never tell unless of course you're
used to the operating system sure you're
gonna load up a theme with folder icons
but seriously why would you need to do
that things like social networking and
texting feel like a calculation anything
that involves text entry on the Nokia n8
is while Achor in portrait mode you're
presented with the traditional dial pad
layout no important recorded keyboard
here yeah Scott t9 predictive texting
but I'd much rather have a portrait
quartic keyboard the landscape keyboard
could have been a lot better
autocorrect isn't available and I find
the placement of the left and right
arrow keys very annoying not only
doesn't make the spacebar unnecessarily
smaller but I always find myself
accidentally pressing either left or
right which screws up whatever I'm
typing which is definitely not
the face on top of that even though the
Nokia n8 supports multi-touch the area
where I feel like multi-touch is needed
the most you know the on-screen chord
keyboard it's not there this requires
you to fully lift off your finger before
trying to type another key or the
previous key that you entered doesn't
show up once you get used to the
keyboard it's not that big of a deal but
it definitely shows you down not to
mention you always have to be
consciously aware of how you're typing
on top what you're typing I mean I just
want to respond to my friend telling him
that I like balloons is it that hard
I mean gah texting is definitely
improved compared to other high-end
Symbian devices like the Nokia n97 the
integration of threaded text messaging
definitely makes the flow of
conversation a lot more organic but it's
not as pretty as that on the iPhone but
hey at least it works
next would be email on my mobile device
email is how you just I do a lot of work
via email and the Nokia n8 emailing
system it's terrible it's is PO there is
no unified inbox it's not that big of a
deal but it would be great for me as I
have seven accounts fetching at one time
basic things like scrolling through an
inbox is dreadful I mean look at this
what is this it lags is like crazy and
you always accidentally open emails
while you try to scroll ok the Nokia n8
is fully capable of smooth kinetic
scrolling as you can see from this photo
application but why I tend to do it with
emails I have absolutely no idea
opening emails of course is just a first
half replying is the second half and
it's really really tough if you need to
write out long emails on big Nokia n8
it's about this point we're just kind of
opt to just reading emails on the n8 and
use my computer to reply to everything
or just not use the NA for email at all
I feel like this happens a lot with a
Nokia n8 and any Symbian device that
I've ever used
whether it's emailing web browsing and
watching YouTube videos whatever
I always just opt to just doing it on my
computer well it's a phone you're just
supposed to make phone calls I'm sure
we've all heard that plenty of times and
yes the Nokia n8 is a phone and it's
great and making phone calls but then
why have all of those features in the
phone in the first place with a Symbian
devices I feel like they have a lot of
features and they can do a lot of things
but they can't do those things very well
sort of like a jack of all trades master
of none kind of thing I think that's the
first time I said that in front of
camera you know that phrase feels
great at this point in the mobile game I
definitely don't think it's good enough
anymore especially if your competition
is the iPhone or the latest Android
smartphone one of the huge selling
points of the Nokia n8
would be the camera it's a 12 megapixel
camera loaded with the xenon flash that
can autofocus and record 720p HD videos
the camera works as you would expect it
to and it's nice to be able to control
certain things like white balance
exposure ISO and so on and that's
something that's missing from the iPhone
4 ah like the iPhone you can also record
videos from the front-facing camera this
is a personal thing but as a youtuber a
huge huge plus would be able to have a
solid mobile YouTube experience bn8 is
mediocre at this the videos play with
the flash supported web browser but the
video quality is pretty bad even over a
strong Wi-Fi connection and the video
quality is terrible compared to that of
the iPhone 4s the Symbian application
store or ovie store is dreadful I think
I'm running out of adjectives here is
terrible dreadful who who's not an
adjective who's a noun first of all it
doesn't come pre-installed in the Nokia
n8 there's an icon but it takes you to a
website that asks you if you want to
install it after you do I personally
don't think that there's a lot of useful
applications out there but that's
totally a personal thing as for example
I've only installed a handful of
applications on my iPhone you know out
of the bajillion amount of apps out
there that involve farting or taking a
picture your face and making you look
chubby for laughs
haha I honestly can't help but compare
the nokia n8 to say the iPhone or the
latest Android smartphone because as a
user you're pretty much choosing your
mobile smartphone and then your mobile
operating system plus the iPhone is sort
of like the only non simian touch phone
that I have so I physically can't
compare the n8 to anything else and
because these phones are around the $500
a price range the last thing you want to
feel is buyer's remorse so for you I
highly recommend you do your research
watch videos each pure vegetables and
try the phones out in real life if you
can borrow your friends phone but make
sure you let them know or else that'd be
stealing overall I personally don't like
the n8 it's a lot better than say the
Nokia n97 or the Nokia 5800 the camera
and hardware is fantastic on this thing
but that's about it for me at least if
you're into either
with a very pretty and organic looking
you I definitely go for the iPhone or
something Android loaded but if you are
diehard Symbian fan then I recommend you
skip the Nokia n8 and get the Nokia c7
it's pretty much the same phone but the
hardware keyboard that's the key that'll
keep your anxiety levels low when you
need to you know do type @e type a day
well I hope you found this review
helpful this was John from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
