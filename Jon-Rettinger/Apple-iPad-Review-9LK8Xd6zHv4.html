TechnoBuffalo here is a full review for
you of the much-hyped
and much anticipated apple ipad 2
subject to this review is a 32 gigabyte
Wi-Fi only model very few devices have
caused a fervor of press and consumer
excitement like the iPad once you get
past all the excitement and the
enthusiasm is left with an actual
product we're gonna cover how this
actual product fits into your daily life
and how it fits into mine so I've
covered the iPad really quite a bit I've
got everything covered in from the
browser to the e-book reader to typing
so I'm going to put all those videos
together into one and start to see how
the package actually works so most
important for me with the iPad is mobile
browsing now that's why the iPhone is my
daily driver of choice I'll do a lot of
work on the mobile web let's make create
content send emails lets me respond to
videos and update my website that's why
the mobile web is really one of the
things I was looking forward to most
with the iPad I was hoping to get a
desktop esque experience on a mobile
device and as far as web browsing the
iPad does not disappoint I've used many
many netbooks I've tried the HP Mini 311
the Lenovo s10 one two and three
including the tablet and I've tried the
dell mini 10min ein so I've got sort of
a wide spectrum to pull from and this is
hands down the best browsing experience
that I've had on a mobile device
scrolling is smooth pinching and zooming
works great the accelerometer is quick
and responds well the inline video that
is of course html5 capable plays right
in the browser
certainly no flash something we'll talk
about a little bit but from a browser
standpoint it is fantastic next your
screen real estate gives you features
that you're not gonna get on the other
iDevices being the iPhone or the iPod
Touch you've got a full bookmark bar
across the top you've got almost a
three-dimensional tabs page it opens up
there's a lot more that you can do now
that one of the big knots on the device
is that it's nothing more than a big
iPod touch why do I need it
I heard that for many people and the
fact that it may look like a big iPod
Touch or a big iPhone because it
certainly does you to put them side by
side may not be a bad thing extra screen
real estate letting itself to a lot of
new additional features for example the
male is one of the place where you see a
lot of these new features you get a
preview in text pane that you don't have
on the other eye device lets you scroll
through when you rotate it you get even
more options and that sort of theme
falls through through all of the native
applications on the device that your
screen real estate lets you do just so
much more so as I mentioned I do a lot
of work on the mobile web and I do a lot
of work on the device so text entry is a
big thing to me I've been a fan of the
virtual keyboards in the past on the
Nexus One on the iPhone and I was a bit
skeptical of how I was gonna feel about
a larger virtual keyboard that I
couldn't necessarily thumbtack on at
least I thought that I couldn't so I did
a video covering the keyboard but I want
to sort of recap back so think text
entry is a really important feature the
device and a lot of one of the things
that people may be worried about so you
get to keyboard options here you've got
a portrait keyboard which you can touch
type quite well and much to my surprise
I've got a little bit larger hands you
actually hold it like I could an iPhone
and thumb type now if you turn it into
landscape you get almost a full size
keyboard
of course it's virtual here if you take
for example Apple's wireless bluetooth
keyboard you can see size for size
there's not that much a difference and
if you want to sort of a further
breakdown at keyboards check out a
previous video I did on typing now if
this isn't going to work for you you
have other options Apple is going to be
releasing a doc with a keyword rate
similar to what I just showed you and
this iPad it will actually pair itself
with any Bluetooth keyboard so if you go
to the Apple Store you pick up their
Bluetooth keyboard it'll work or any
other Bluetooth keyboard that you like
compare it and start typing external
mouse won't work it's still stuck to
finger input but for device like this I
think that works quite nicely you know
there are built-in productivity apps or
ones you can download
notes and mail and particularly pages
which is Apple's version of Microsoft
Word it's a very full feature and
surprisingly full-featured I should say
we're positing program so let's talk
about some of the other features of
device
and this is where I think the iPad
starts to distinguish itself you may
have heard people ask you or maybe you
haven't why do I need an iPad when is it
gonna do it for me how it's gonna add
value and that question can be a bit
hard to answer but somebody who does a
lot of reading I think that's where the
iPad starts separate itself from the
pack I have a Kindle too that I've done
all of my reading on for the past well
probably almost a year and the iPad has
so many choices for reading it really is
impressive it's got its own iBooks
application which is quite fun and
pretty to look at you can see it right
here is a virtual bookshelf Winnie the
Pooh comes pre-loaded and you've got a
full book store that you can choose from
for more on that check out the iPad
versus Kindle 2 video what people are
worried about how reading on the LED
display is going to be well I can tell
you that actually works quite well it
doesn't hurt my eyes quite yet I stir
add I just play all the time so maybe
I'm used to it in 30 years what I'm
probably completely blind it may be a
different story but right now it doesn't
bother me at all and being able to read
books in sort of a large vibrant format
with colors and pictures I really the
lens today's experience we are for
example we've got a Winnie the Pooh book
like after you take the page and turn it
and you get sort of the full page
turning experience and you actually got
the pictures that show up right in there
which is nice and if you think about it
for a free kids book for example if I
wanted to read a story to my child if I
had one and say I'm just reading text I
can actually show them pictures and have
videos that are right inside of the book
move around for a very immersive
experience which makes to be a fun
reading experience and then as if Amazon
wasn't getting killed enough with the
iPad they actually put the bullet in the
gun that's gonna shoot them there is a
Kindle application for the iPad which
really made the Kindle lease for me
obsolete to do access to all of your
Kindle content access to the whisper
sync network and avoid the download and
read books right from inside that
application so if books are a big thing
for you
there's really no more qualified device
than the iPad
so also I do a lot of periodical reading
I love The Wall Street Journal and New
York Times and this year they offers the
best of everything as far as periodicals
are concerned it gives a very immersive
experience for newspapers and even
magazines so some of the magazines are
running on a subscription base there are
many free periodical services out there
so here's for example the New York Times
you can scroll through pick an article
you like tap on it and you get sir the
pictures that are in there scroll
through to the next page it really is a
very very nice and pleasant experience
and you're able to get all the
information that you could just at once
used to be I'd have to carry my kindle
up to go outside to get my newspaper and
read the magazine later then have to
come back to my computer to browse the
web I can now do all of that from one
very very thin device I would happen to
have a gorgeous screen oh it's really is
a nice transition to my next topic of
video a video on this is unbelievable
and it's really only augmented by
applications like Netflix and the ABC
player both of which are free downloads
you can access good chunk of ABC of
content review an HD your right on your
device and if you have a Netflix account
you have access to all of their on
demand content right on your iPad which
turns it now I'm from not only a mobile
Internet device not only an e-book
reader but now it's really a personal
media player and there's been talks I
mean Hulu app coming perhaps on
subscription basis but this thing I
haven't killed on my TV since I've had
it I've had a meet so I'm able to watch
all of my content that I like right on
the device so it's not all rosy and
positive applications that are one of
the strongest points of Apple's iDevices
and we're also one of the biggest
selling points of the iPad but you're
going to pay a significant price premium
for them devices that are applications
rather that run on an iPad or an iPhone
and iPod Touch there's extreme price
parity we're talking double triple or
quadruple the price for what they're
calling HD applications for the iPad
definitely be aware of that it's gonna
be a tough print on your wallet now if
you have an iPhone or iPod Touch and you
think well I can just
upscale all the applications that I have
since the iPad actually doubles the
pixel
on your iPhone or iPod Touch
applications you're going to be
disappointed because let me tell you
that looks really really crappy text is
extremely hard to read on it the pixels
look blurry and makes the application is
very hard to use then you can shrink it
down to the original size of your iPhone
or iPod touch then you really lose the
reason for having one of these so until
Apple fixes that or developers start
putting out more applications or cross
applications that work on both devices
you're going to be a bit limited
developers haven't had access to the
iPad 2 it was released on Saturday so I
think we're going to start seeing an
influx of new applications that sort of
work on all our devices and hopefully
you'll also see a decrease in price the
price standpoint is another thing to be
concerned about it starts at $4.99 and
with free deal work is all the way up to
around the $800 price points it's
something to keep in mind this does not
ship with any sort of earphones which is
something I was a bit surprised about
the back of the device it's sort of
Apple's industrial design it's got the
brushed aluminum with the Apple logo
which is not shiny mirror format
something to keep in mind the Wi-Fi
radio actually located right behind that
not flicking off just pointing right
behind that Apple logo right there so
the pin some reports about poor Wi-Fi
issues there for using the device and
you're holding your hand here you may
have some Wi-Fi issues I haven't
experienced that but others have looking
at photos on the iPad is another thing
that I really enjoyed doing with a nine
point seven inch screen the built-in
photos application really makes for a
really very impressive
viewing I can give you a quick example
what the photo application looks like on
here so you can see all I have covered
it in other videos I'll go ahead and
open up photos if I can find it if you
take a look that you gets heard about a
grid format really is a nice layout you
can pinch and zoom your way it's any of
these albums I'm gonna do without
looking you grab one there we go you can
sort of open them up or close them it's
actually sort of neat
take it Phantom out phantom close and
it's mostly eye candy doesn't add any
sort of additional functionality it got
with the iPhone of the iPod Touch but it
is just fun and also the screen rotates
every direction that you want it's got a
locking mechanism to turn off the
accelerometer but it's nice I'm going to
taint it to a friend and let them look
at content now there's also sort of a
very big elephant in the room now with
the iPad and that is iPhone OS 4.0 the
specter of which we don't know what it's
going to do what is going to get out as
relatively soon the ipad is going to get
a lot of additional functionality I've
been saying for much much time that the
iPhone OS has gotten very stale and
boring and it's even more apparent on a
larger screen I mean look at that wasted
space it's just a row of iPhones even
worse look at the space on the
lockscreen
I get a picture the time the date and a
slide to unlock and that is about it on
a nine point seven inch screen I have no
other information I can't see email I
can't see notifications I can't see
anything and that's when the
shortcomings not prints to them itself
in addition to multitasking on a
processor really this powerful it's got
a built-in a4 chip clocking at one
gigahertz people are going to be saying
well we say the Nexus One is a 1
gigahertz chip it's not necessarily the
clock speed of the processor it's how
well it's optimized and it's optimized
really really well for the iPad it
handles everything that could start at
it with just tremendous performance and
a lot of performance doesn't come at a
battery drain apple claims the ipad is
going to get 10 hours of battery life I
can tell you that is absolutely true
yesterday using the device probably for
Hunab hours of video viewing probably
four hours of web browsing and text
reading I had it down to about 55 60
percent and I'm have not been able to
drain the battery completely and I've
actually used it for over 10 hours so if
you're flying on a long flight and you
want to watch a video trying to brighten
this down you'll easily be able to watch
three or four full feature-length films
on the iPad which is something that you
just can't do on other more
devices no flash is also sort of a big
negative and another big sort of monkey
on the back of the iPad does not play
Flash content Apple this for some reason
wages to war against flash they're not
going to get sort of the real web as you
would on other devices a lot of these
websites are retooling their pages to
support html5 which the iPad does
support definitely something to keep in
mind
overall the iPad has met or exceeded my
expectations it's a device that's just
fun to use I'm having a very hard time
putting it down again I recommend you go
to your local Apple Store or retailer
and pick one up is it for yourself and
experience sort of what you can do with
the device is something that you need or
have to have no certainly not but it's
very very shortly and it eloquently
fills that gap between mobile phones and
laptop but I'm going out now on the road
I saw you take with me when I just need
the web
I just need access to email this is the
perfect device and a very thin light
package I don't have to carry around my
laptop and a backup battery anymore so I
recommend the iPad to anyone out there
who's interested in those things that I
mentioned on a one to five star scale I
give it a solid five I knew what
shortcut was going in I knew with this
for multitasking yet and I know that
doesn't have flash but everything I
wanted to do and everything I needed to
do it does very well whether you love
Apple or hate Apple there's no doubt
that the iPad is going to drive the
tablet market forward it's going to
force companies like HP and Microsoft
innovate companies like juju and other
tablets are going to be coming out are
going to innovate and are going to put
out better products because of the iPad
for the abductors never buying one you
can use appreciate its mark that it's
going to make on this very very new
category so guys for more information
