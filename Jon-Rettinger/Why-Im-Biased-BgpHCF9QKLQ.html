years and I had the distinct privilege
of starting at the very beginning of a
smartphone revolution and during that
time like every reviewer I've been
accused of pretty much every single bias
into the Sun I love Apple I hate Apple
only like Android in a ton more and
honestly it bothers me I tried really
hard to keep all OS preferences out of
our reviews but as hard as I might try
some biases do inevitably creep up and
after almost nine years of making videos
and writing articles I think it's time
to come clean so I split my time pretty
evenly each year between iOS and Android
whatever I test a new phone regardless
of operating system a few things creep
up in my mind I start to come to my
conclusions what matters most to me in a
phone are two things that I just can't
seem to get past the quality of this
play if it's got a crappy screen and I
got a hard time just looking past that
it wouldn't the rest of the phone is
incredible and the second one is a build
quality of the device how it feels in my
hand out of everything that goes into a
phone the screen is our portal into it
it's it's our everything yoe ms put
horrible panels on expensive devices is
beyond me it's not always have to be the
highest resolution it's just how images
texts and videos in this play look in
direct sunlight so for example before
the iPhone 10 Apple screen started to
look bad especially we got to the iPhone
6 generation when you hold him up to the
competition
well technically HD resolution of 720p
or 1080p depending on which size you got
they were fine but you looked at him
next to Samsung there were really clear
differences colors weren't as vibrant
blacks weren't as dark and the IPS LCD
was starting to become antiquated I
think it's that point when I started to
be accused of an anti Apple bias and it
wasn't an iOS thing it was just a
display thing I honestly believe that's
why I've been accused of having an ample
bias I was never a fan of iPhone
displays and that was difficult for me
to get past so the last factor that
really plays into my opinions and
obviously all this is totally subjective
it's how the phone feels in my hand I
tried to get past shoddy build quality
to see the experience beneath but if a
phone just doesn't feel good I have a
really hard time forgiving it I think
that's why I've been more drawn to
recent generation Samsung devices they
feel awesome
I was admittedly hard on some
like the LGG six not because it wasn't a
good phone but cuz it didn't feel like
the premium phone that it was I think
this is why something like the iPhone 10
that Mary is an incredible display of
super premium build quality immediately
earned my affection and it had nothing
to do with the OS and everything to do
with the screen and the awesome build
quality and this isn't something I've
been consciously hiding from you guys
but something I finally realized in the
Epiphany a few months ago I'm not sure
if realizing this is gonna let me put
those biases aside and review my next
devices but I do promise I'll try and
please don't interpret this is me saying
that only expensive phones are gonna get
good reviews there are plenty of
lower-cost options with amazing designs
and solid screens and build quality
things like oneplus honor and Motorola
and before you judge me I hope you can
least appreciate or the very least
echnology honesty here everyone no
matter what they tell you has some sort
of bias now at least you know mine
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
