to you by AMD what's up everyone walk
back there pisode of rumor roundup I'm
Hearst John Rangers the show we take all
the tech rumors from the week and I
serve them up to you in one video
student have to worry about falling all
the tech news you know exactly what you
missed of this week like you're like
technology coming to apple giant iPads
the iWatch and connect by Apple it's an
all Apple rumor roundup go ahead get
started begin with what I consider to be
one of the biggest stories of the week
is Apple getting some light row like
technology stop was recently granted a
patent for a camera system that allow
users to snap a picture and then adjust
the focus after with snap so imagine
this you're out the beach with your
family take a picture you realize your
mom's out of focus your dad's out of
focus you just tap on them after he took
the picture and the focus will adjust
it's crazy voting technology of this
from Lytro we reviewed that camera last
year it was pretty awesome they presume
apple systems gonna work a little bit
differently but on the same level as
Nokia's new refocus app which we also
really really liked it's just a really
fun kind of a flake you're living in the
future and it would be great that were
to make it to eventual apple iphones
although i wouldn't cross your fingers
for that coming to the iphone 6 probably
more 6s iphone 7 time giant freaky and
ipads are coming manufacturer quantum
computers reportedly been tapped by
Apple to begin mass production of the
crazy giant 12.9 inch iPad the
ever-reliable friends at digit times
said Monday manufacturing of the largest
iff to begin the second quarter of 2014
jeans we could see a spring or summer
announced that those rumors hold to be
true so giant iPad to WWDC yeah i watch
is still coming I think the i watch from
those rumors like if you stand outside
and you tell people it's gonna rain
eventually you're gonna be right so
eventually didja x is gonna have some
truth to it but supposedly digit times
the claiming other manufacturers are
currently trying to secure a deal with
Apple to manufacturer the crazy groomer
and I watch Apple has not confirmed that
it's working on advice though although
cell reports have suggested the company
is ready to jump into the fray
a bit of ice designed to complement iOS
quanta fox com in vet tech we're almost
at as possible suitors for the iWatch
manufacturing fracture that device
expected to be in the second quarter of
next year so it looks like it could be a
very busy 2014 4 friends at advil and
lastly Apple bot the makers of the
Kinect primeSense the original folks
that solder technology to Microsoft's so
what does that mean crazy motions or
voice controls work their way into an
IFO and perhaps for an unannounced
product there's kind of fun to speculate
when Apple could be doing Tim Cook is
dead they want to get into new product
lines 2014 and forward a new product
might be an add-on for the iphone
perhaps a new Apple TV that relies
solely on motion perhaps the apple
television set might get a rumor refresh
that could have crazy cool voice in
motion technology i'm really curious to
see what they're gonna do with this
thing but it's nice to see the
technology jump from microsoft and now
to apple i want to take a second to
thank our friends and sponsors at AMD
