to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
John Breton Gherkin TechnoBuffalo it's
an unboxing for you of one of the latest
from Amazon this is the Kindle Fire 6
kids edition so if you got a kid at home
like I do you know they are crazy for
anything with the screens we also know
if they love to play the game of drop
this and then you go pick it up and then
they drop it again which is not so good
for screen Laden technology Amazon's
like hey we know what happens we've got
you covered it's thing offers way more
than just a really nice case let's go
ahead and unbox it and take a first look
so here is the box for the Kindle Fire
kids edition it's bright colors you got
Disney pictures on the front letting you
know this is not your regular Kindle
you're gonna get met for ages three and
over it's got some kind of cool stuff on
the front of it including letting you
know that it's got a two-year worryfree
guarantee and kid proof case as I
mentioned the intro I got a kid at home
and he drops everything something like
this would probably have a better chance
of surviving let's go ahead and cut the
plastic here and it was already cut and
we'll see what is inside it sent to us
from our friends at Amazon there we go
this is gonna be available in 6 or 7
inches depending on which one you want
to get us we've got the green case I
thought the case was part of the tablet
looks like it's something additional
this looks like indestructible and also
you could probably feed on it and be
okay it seems like a burly case we've
got this little orange box which holds
nothing and this looks more like our
typical fire case here going to bring
back that knife
open this sucker up and take a look at
this t2 Tanic little tablet it is
definitely teeny tiny we already unboxed
the fire 6 so it should be a little bit
different on the UI front and also kind
of some other cool stuff that it does an
Amazon gives you just a charge and sync
cable micro USB and a wall wart and that
is about it pull that stuff off to the
side open the sucker up I know quick at
that we should always that I like but
it'll do how to plastic break the
plastic I just like beefs moated myself
through that let's go ahead and turn it
on and before I put it in the case just
a quick look at the back it just says
Amazon on it and there is a rear facing
camera but because it's the kids version
you're probably gonna want it to live
inside of here so it's go ahead and drop
inside of this just behemoth of a case
which I suppose is what it's meant to be
in there we go let's thing could be just
dropped and thrown and you will be okay
so a lot of stuff here let me stop the
unboxing just real quick to thank our

back to the unboxing first its gonna
start at 149 bucks and kind of go up
from there as I mentioned either in 6 or
7 inch configurations this is a 6 inch
both have the same no 1280 by 800
resolution so well it might be a tablet
meant for kids it's also sort of a
really full functional fully spec
tablets got a quad core processors in
here it's got 2 1.5 gigahertz and 2 1.2
gigahertz also has 1 gig of ram ah so
it's meant for ages 3 and up it's also
kind of parent friendly teeth and set
screen time limits so if you want your
kid to maybe have to read for 30 minutes
before it'll play games you can go ahead
and set that here you can set
educational goals and with coolest
things at least for me is if a kid
breaks it Amazon is going to replace it
which is really nice kids break a lot of
stuff you also get kid profiles and
stuff here as well so let's go ahead and
take a look it looks like so you
probably look at this thinking it looked
just like a regular six inch Kindle Fire
any Kindle Fire all the yet child stuff
I was going to live inside of the app
and you can choose once you're inside of
that app what you want to share with
them you can set up your own kids
profile even a profile for teens
you can choose what's in your library
also the apps there in the cloud you can
download make sure their child has
access to whatever you need then other
than that if you take that kid app out
it's a regular you know Kindle Fire that
you could use you know if you want to
set your own time limits and you could
do that you can be like hey John you
need to read before you can browse the
Internet then like I could set that for
myself anyway guys again this starts at
149 bucks and comes with this just
beastly case with a ton of different
colors available which is sort of drop
proof and teeth proof and all kinds of
other stuff until next time I am John
