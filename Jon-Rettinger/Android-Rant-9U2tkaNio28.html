technobuffalo here i got my bad lighting
in my opinion ated hoodie on it's time
for a rant let's go ahead and get
started
I'm generally a pretty light-hearted
happy guy but I can be a bit of a
curmudgeon I have curmudgeon any
symptoms and syndromes and opinions and
I test a lot of mobile phones and often
times that curmudgeon meanness can come
out you might remember a few months ago
my Apple iOS ramp I talked about iOS
becoming stale how the notification
systems were incredibly annoying and the
lockscreen borderline useless well with
google i/o upon us it's time to focus in
on android and talk about what they're
doing well what they're not doing well
what I think they can do to improve let
me know whether or not you agree or
disagree first android and iOS are
always going to be entwined it's hard as
a consumer electronics journalist or the
consumer in general to not compare the
two I love that Android exists just like
I love that iOS exists I think a company
has only driven to succeed and innovate
as far as your competition will take
them when you don't have competition the
mobile marketplace you stagnate like we
had with the original windows mobile not
talking windows phone 7 i'm talking to
old school windows mobile with a stylus
and start menu a little scroll bars you
have scroll through and the old palm
operating system which was fresh when it
first came out but the decade later was
still the same so I think that Apple and
I think that Google push each other to
be better and whether or not you're an
Android fannin or an apple fan doesn't
matter competition is great for the
consumer whenever companies compete the
consumers definitely win so as long as
Apple exists Google's going to continue
to innovate with their mobile platform
and as long as the reverse is true i
would say what it was going to get
confused with what i just said that
would be true as well but android is not
infallible just like apples not
infallible and there are a lot of things
that Android could do to improve one of
the biggest complaints and problems I
have with Android isn't necessarily
google's fault perhaps a lot of the
carrier's its fragmentation I'm looking
over there you guys can't see
but I have a few phones all of which are
running very different versions of
Android some are running a tablet bran
system sun or running Gingerbread some
Froyo some are running older versions of
Claire and all kinds of desert themed
deliciousness but there is that
fragmentation occurring in android now
that may be because Google's continuing
to innovate so quickly they're coming
out through operating system about every
six months or so I've got one of the
newer devices here which is just
released but surprisingly isn't running
the newest version of google's phone OS
gingerbread this is running froyo
although the screen is pretty awesome
and large on it kind of just like to
look at okay but that aside it's getting
very tough for developers to katina
support new birth to the operating
system and also support older versions
of the operating system certainly new
API as you're paying off for new screen
resolutions are coming out and sizes and
all kinds of business I believe was
rovio the makers of Angry Birds I
thought it was getting more and more
difficult to support Android certainly
the newer versions of google's operating
systems are sexually going to prevail
and be more prevalent and other fancy p
words but people are still going to have
those older versions of Android I got my
mom for example perfect example an
android phone she's not the most
technologically advanced person in the
world she likes to learn she's trying
but she's not gonna know how to update
her phone even now granted she's got a
version that's not even gonna be updated
to froyo the phone she's got but she has
an older version of Android she likes to
try and download apps but she's never
going to upgrade her phone speech
doesn't know how and there are a lot of
folks out there that are like that they
get a phone they figure the phone when
they pick it up day one is the same
phone that they're going to have same ah
princess but they're going to have two
years later when the contract is up now
a lot of people out there have more
knowledge about their phones they're
more educated consumers they know when
over-the-air updates come out they know
how to root they know how to jailbreak
you know how to customize you know it
had tweaked packages which is kind of
funny to say and all the rest of that
but a lot of people don't and as long as
there are the carriers rather offering
older version
in phones and they aren't pushing these
updates and getting them right in front
of you you can have a hard time
supporting multiple operating systems
and legacy then this video is a bit long
winded I probably could have just said
fragmentation is a big problem with
Android and put my hands together and it
is a big problem of Android that's all
I'm going to say about that
fragmentation is annoying I don't like
it in cake I don't like my cake comes in
fragments I don't like when my outbreaks
ism to come to fragments and it's very
tough support and that's sort of the
windows versus Pete's pc thank to or
windows vs mac thing rather now you have
a platform like google which is not
vertically integrated google mix the
outbreaks that some companies can build
on top of it customize it tweak it they
make the hardware and google says we
just made the software or something like
Apple they control the hardware all the
way through when you get a very limited
product choice so you've got just an
iphone whether that's for 3gs doesn't
really matter whereas on google you can
pick up 4.5 inch screen now which is
kind of awesome you can pick a 4.3 inch
screen you can get a 3.7 inch screen in
3.5 inch screen at four inch screen you
put I different choices you can get dual
core processor single core processors
made from a mere two different
manufacturers you've got a little bit of
choice in there but with that choice
comes variants and the balance becomes
harder and harder to support so a bit
rambly do you agree disagree if you
think fragmentation is overrated
inflated and should I shut my pays hole
if you guys are still watching just
curious what you guys have to say i'm
jon rettinger technobuffalo I'll see in
the next video
