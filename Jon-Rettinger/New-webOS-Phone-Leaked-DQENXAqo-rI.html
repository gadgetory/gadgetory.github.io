TechnoBuffalo here there are a few
things that I love in the morning a good
cup of coffee a few newspapers sometimes
a bowel movement if I'm lucky but what I
love more than anything is a good phone
exclusive rumor or leak or really
anything electronic that's fun and new
and the folks at precentral.net have
come through big time with what appears
to be the first images of a keyboard
less web OS device of those of you that
have been watching the videos for a few
years you'll know that when the initial
pre launched I was a huge fan of webos i
love the operating system i thought it
handled multitasking wonderfully well
browsing was a breeze i lamented a small
screen size and the awful typing
experience on the pre keyboard on a palm
and now HP is certainly improved that
with the upcoming pre 3 with a larger
screen size and a bigger keyboard but
what we never had was an on-screen
physical keyboard and it looks like we
are finally going to have that that's
exactly what you're looking at right now
so details are a little bit thin the
focus of precentral.net are speculating
that it's going to have a resolution of
480 x 800 which is the same screen
resolution as dupree 3 which leads you
to probably believe the screen is going
to be about 3.5 to 3.7 inches other also
appears to be a front-facing camera
although there's potentiality that we
just a proximity sensor however for the
modern smartphones now in order to
compete you figure a front-facing camera
would definitely be a necessity so there
were a few webOS code names that were
floating around a little while ago there
was one called mansion stingray in
Windsor precentral.net peg the mansion
as the 480 x 800 slightly I'll device so
that could possibly be what we're
looking at right now in case you sort of
heard that floating around manta ray was
pre 3 case you guys are keeping track at
home we don't really know whether danse
is going to be GSN
or cdma although of late it looks like
HP's early phones are gsm with a cdma so
verizon or possibly spritz coming in bit
later the folks of precentral.net also
released images of a pre three running
on verizon's network so for those you
they're hoping to get your web OS on on
the Big B looks like you're going to get
a chance to do that I am quite excited
actually about this light device and
this might be one of the most
anticipated phones for me personally I
really like webos I really didn't like
the keyboard on the pre hopefully the
folks at palm have done a nice job with
the on-screen keyboard I look to see
what it looks like I like to have a
really robust autocorrect something the
vein of what Android has or what iOS has
I think it's something that webos hasn't
really been missing so hopefully they're
going to do a nice job with this
hopefully it's going to have a pretty
decent processor I would assume a
minimum 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
something HP has been trending the
Snapdragon way hopefully we'll see some
dual core action here and most
importantly hopefully we will see
software take advantage of the hardware
we've sort of seen this dual core power
house phones and tablets of the software
hasn't taken advantage of a quite yet
hopefully we'll see something a bit more
robust from the folks at HP and palm I
am very much looking forward to it in
the past the web OS devices have been
plagued by poor hardware and awesome
software store the reverse that we've
seen with some other phones and tablets
so I'm very excited I'm getting a little
bit rambling I want to know what you
guys think is this something that you're
excited about not excited about if your
web OS fan would this pull you away from
the upcoming pre 3 or are you more in
the iOS or Android camp I love to hear
your civil comments about what you guys
think this guy though however might be
my next must-have device anyway guys i'm
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i
will see you or you'll see me or it's
very least we can chat in the next video
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
