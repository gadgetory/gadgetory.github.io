sponsoring this smart home video you
know the announcements at CES it's
generally like dominated by like brand
new TVs new phones all that stuff that
like dominates you know our videos but
also the news but there's a lot of
things that come out at CES that you're
gonna use on a daily basis things that
are in your house so I'm here at the
Samsung booth and Samsung's trying to
make the entire home smart and try think
the entire home connected and it's kind
of been the vision for years a lot of
companies but now that's heard of the
process and technology is cut up exactly
something that you can I really do and
you can do it all by mostly just using
your voice let me show you so the center
of my house Elise is generally the
kitchen because that's where I spend
majority of my time so you've seen
Samsung's family hub before it's their
refrigerator with the screen you can
interact with and it does a lot of cool
things but what's new for 2019 is a
family board and it's kind of like a a
whiteboard it's a catch-all for all your
things you can upload pictures from
either iOS or Android devices you can
add stickers you can annotate them
pretty much what you can do on your
phone you can now do on your fridge you
can leave notes for your kids whatever
you want you can also kind of peek
inside of the fridge and it's gonna
automatically know using AI what
ingredients are there it can recommend
recipes for you my wife is a glutton
afraid I'll pick up gluten-free recipes
just for her you can customize it for
each person but kind of taking it that
one step further just kind of what 2019
has been about at least here at the
Samsung booth is connecting with other
stuff so if you pick a recipes then you
need to pre-heat your oven if you have a
samsung oven you can set it to preheat
right from your fridge and it will talk
to your of it instead it's a pre in your
of then talk to the hood above it and it
knows it's got to start venting out the
steam you see the theme here things are
starting to talk to each other and
literally you can now talk to your
refrigerator or talk to your oven and
tell it to preheat itself if you don't
want to you know tell your refrigerator
to do it if you want to step up your own
with smart
home game Samsung's actually giving away
one of their new robotic vacuums which
is kind of cool it's on our Instagram
page link to it down below but go over
there leave a comment and win yourself a
robot vacuum I'm gonna paint a least
gross picture that I can so I've got two
kids at home I got a third one coming
I'm using my washer and dryers a lot for
things did expect with little children
at home so the 2019 Samsung's there
they're front-loading great you've seen
front loading washing drives before
these are fast we'll do a quick cycle in
30 minutes to clean it'll make brown
things not brown so they're keeping with
the theme of using the new big speed
using your voice you could set your
voice to have the dryer set at certain
times to always have warm towels you can
set the washer to go at a set time when
you're coming back home it's just making
things more connected but next to it is
the air dresser but essentially it's
like a like a dry cleaning cabinet it
takes all the like the dry cleaning out
of stuff it'll clean your clothes it'll
do wrinkle your clothes it'll deodorize
your clothes and it'll do it just by
scanning your shirt and other stuff it
just really cool some obviously still a
fan of all these crazy announcements
that come out of CES but as a dad of two
and a new one coming the stuff that's in
my house I don't get out as much as I
used to so things that are work for me
are especially important and this is a
bunch of new stuff that I could
legitimately see myself using there's
got a perfect storm of like obviously
everything in your house being smart but
it's up to you how much intelligence you
want in your house how much you want to
use your voice that's kind of the
question that I want to ask are you
gonna want to talk to your fridge or you
know want to talk to your washer and
dryer let me know in the comments down
below because we are on the cusp the
precipice of a new era of connected
things and kind of excited for it
until next time Jon Ranger I'll see you
guys next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
