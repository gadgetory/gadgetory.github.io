to you by netflix welcome back to
another episode of rettinger francis to
show or i rant and rave and talk about
anything on my mind through all the
technology and sometimes a little bit
outside of it up this week we're going
to talk about the rumor mill we helped
perpetuate but now there's no more
surprises left with device and software
announcements the leaks always turn out
weeks advance and we always know exactly
what's coming which can be a little bit
disappointing but also kind of exciting
so let's go ahead get ranting so I was
thinking about a topic for this week's
renters rants and I was writing some
notes for upcoming blackberry 10
announcement and an HTC tuned down an
invite for their m7 announcement and I
thought we already know what's coming
we've already seen the BlackBerry
devices already seen leaks to the m7
there's no more surprises you don't know
what things are gonna be you don't have
that one more thing giant announcement
that has gone away used to be Apple was
the best at secrecy had no idea was
gonna come there was speculation you
didn't know and then Steve Jobs got up
on stage and said one more thing
everybody was floored you know we could
speculate that a phone was coming her
new imac was coming but really we hadn't
seen pictures we hadn't seen parts
leaked out there was sort of that wonder
that was there we saw with the first few
Android devices as well the first few
next devices the nexus one we really
didn't know everything and it was really
exciting as a geek and a fan there
journalist it was really kind of cool to
have that surprise and that almost like
wonder about what's coming but those are
the good old days and they are long
since gone Apple supply chain has gotten
super leaky recently we saw of course
the iphone 4 before as announced we knew
the iphone 4s we saw the parts for the
iphone 5 we've seen the HTC m7 the
BlackBerry devices might be the most
elite devices ever we've seen full
walkthroughs out of Vietnam we've seen
parts we've seen renders we know the
colors we already know the price there
is no more wonder anymore now this is a
bit tough for me to say because as a
journalist it's great for us to have
these leaks you know we get a ton of
traffic something to talk about and it's
a lot of fun but as a geek I still hate
it I love that excitement
it's like seeing the ending of a movie
for the first time it's like seeing
sixth sense if you haven't seen that
movie earmuffs because I'm gonna spoiler
alert it for you it's like when they
said I see dead people and you found
that Bruce Willis was dead it was super
exciting they don't have that one or
anymore and I miss it I wish there was a
way that we could do that I wish he
could turn off the rumor mill for just a
little bit even at the detriment of some
traffic on TechnoBuffalo I am a geek
first and foremost I'm a nerd first and
foremost and I'm kind of a journalist
almost secondary but I missed that I
wish we could bring it back you know
part of me sometimes wishes that people
would just keep quiet and let the Wonder
still be there I know having the leaks
can sometimes help to figure out what
device you want to get there you could
see a new iphone being leaked months in
the van to know it's time to wait you
can see renders the next Nexus device
coming a few weeks or month on the road
and you know what to do but the Wonder
is not there anymore even from a
sophomore announced when it's really
hard to surprise the audience you know
rims for example has been showing beta
builds alpha build of their software for
a while so there isn't that much
excitement for what's going to happen
I'm hopeful that we're gonna something
exciting hopefully the next version of
android is going to be exciting I'm
calling a key lime pie i'm hoping iOS 7
we might not know what its gonna have
before they release the beta you know
next version of Windows Phone I just
wanted to be something new and I want
that wonder to come back do you guys
agree or disagree with me I want to hear
your thoughts on it would you rather
have the rumors so that comes so you
know would you rather be surprised
follow along with the live blog or
looking at TechnoBuffalo for the first
time and seeing those pictures and and
being serviced down did or you know
disappointed being able to make those
opinions right on the spot was a lot of
fun for me and I kind of miss those days
