John for lakers calm with a new unboxing
for you this time as you can see in the
title it is the me know flip video it is
a tiny little outside digital camera
sighs video recorder with the built-in
USB port for a quick upload to youtube
myspace video all that stuff just really
great camera to carry around just for
very quick uploads it's got flash memory
record up to 60 minutes it's just a very
basic camera but it's really nice for
when you just want to record something
get it up to youtube so that's why I got
it got it for you guys and we're going
to do an unboxing for you see there's
picture of it on the front on the side
to the 14 day return policy picture of
it on the back the back some text right
there shows how easy it is go ahead and
open this bad boy up you know we need to
open this up then ice so let's go ahead
and get the same opener there we go
alright let's see how do I tear the flap
there Wow very nice hard box feels
almost like fake leather you know looks
about the same size box I'd say is the
iphone box which actually i have i'll
show you guys buy a t-shirt all curious
this actually is pretty close to the
same size this is the iphone 3g box put
that aside flip video on the front me no
see what's inside opens right up top
like that here's the camera itself does
have a very a polish presentation with
the device right on top very shiny black
much like the iphone
so here's the device itself i'm going to
go and put this aside i'll show you guys
that in just a minute let's see what
else is in the box here slides right out
again still very high polish turn that's
where they got their inspiration from
some documentation like some more
documentation little bag for it to what
else looks like a little lanyard and
prepare to be some cables in here of
some sort so we can get those out video
cables want to hook up to your
television so I'm going to put those
back in the box put the box off to the
side and I'll show you guys the device a
little bit so here it is the meaning of
me know flip video very tiny I'll show
you guys in comparison to the iPhone
sides line is taking really see how
small it in so here's the iphone see
it's a little less why does the iphone
and a little thicker so there it is on
the front it's got a record button a
pause button right there and they play
button in the delete button and these
are all touch sensitive buttons here
that'll light up there's the lens on the
back it's getting it a screen on the
front and what makes this camera is so
nice and easy as you can never have to
worry about carrying chords if you can
upload it anywhere you're at plugged
right into USB mediate upload that's
reason I got it it's not the best video
camera in our world certainly but it's
going to make it a lot easier to record
youtube videos for for you guys it's got
a little port in the back for a tripod
do the tripod behind me there so just a
nice real tiny camera can carry with me
60 minutes of video just use it and go
I'm gonna I'll try it for a while and do
a review for you guys again jon

the amino flip video and be sure to
