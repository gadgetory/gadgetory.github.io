technobuffalo calm here at Google i/o
2011 make sure to get the Android
backdrop over my shoulder there it's day
one keynote this morning focusing a lot
on Android talking about Android 301
honeycomb coming out today for zoom
owners ice cream sandwich coming out for
for google music beta google movies all
that kind of stuff tomorrow a second
keynote probably going to talk about
chrome we'll see but in the meantime
walking around the show here it's not
really a show so much as developers
conference so it's not like a full-on
tradeshow environment but in but there
are a bunch of vendors here hardware
vendor software vendors and then just
some kind of neat interesting stuff so
let's go walk around take a look so we
can find
alright so here's one of the more
eye-catching things they demoed this
when we came into the keynote this
morning this area was all covered by a
big tarp but now it's open they demoed
it during the keynote pretty cool it's a
giant labyrinth I mean this thing is
probably about Oh bad with these things
but you know there's a person there's a
panel five six panels so I don't know 30
feet by 30 feet something like that and
it's giant wooden labyrinth there's a
little ball on it rolling around and
it's being controlled via the Android
adk so somewhere somebody's got a tablet
marry that person up there on the
michalak i'm not sure if somebody's got
a tablet controlling this thing trying
to roll the ball around to get some of
the whole
showing what you can do you know the
whole Android accessory thing that
talked about this morning and Google
opening up the ways that you can use
Android not just on a device but using
it from one device to control another
device whether that would be you know a
hook into the exercise bike at the gym
or I your home automation system with
your lights or a giant wooden labyrinth
all we need now is for David Bowie to
come out of the catwalk and walk around
the labyrinth all right so here's some
stuff going on from Hasbro I've got some
robots robots conceived a robot imagine
if you know and this is a snap developed
for the filling head towards the robotic
cradle into a cute little character in
bed with their stores you can fire made
it looks for people and interact that's
why we work on the software side of the
app is utilizing around from google
cloud service prototypes so things like
face recognition object detection this
is another program to the chapter
various objects and respond roadway we
need an android is important or we have
we need
well don't walk off little buddy all
right and here's the company called a
farm box and they've got a smartphone
control develop a plan factory I you can
have anywhere and your refrigerator to
TN document your roof data in the cloud
check it out pitched the other hand we
go to the supermarket to get safe and
cheap vegetables by car even if it's too
far all right here's something else that
was shut off during the keynote today
lifefitness they've got a prototype of
an android based game you hook your
smartphone into the life cycle here and
this reminds me a lot of the older
arcade games scramble except instead of
trying to blow up enemy bases and
rockets and stuff you're just trying to
pull your way to healthy glory
so it's all synced in with your
smartphone and your life cycle there one
of the things that seems very
interesting we'll see where it goes is
the accessory development starter kit
the whole accessory kit protocol that
Google was talking about in the keynote
today that will allow companies to build
and possibly home hobbyist Santa to go
around and build accessories to work
with Android devices to connect via
looks like via USB so you know things
like the life cycle we saw but all kinds
of other things possible and this is one
of the whole open source nature of
Android could become really cool kind of
a throwback to the days of you know
building the first home computers and
home radios in that kind of stuff and
red robots enough said
lighting science showing a web-based pro
motivation lighting control being
controlled from an Android device thank
you did if we saw the keynote this
morning said they did a demo where they
had an android device controlling and
lighting all over the stage and in the
theater all kinds of android games being
shown off here it's kind of cool they
have these little hubs the Android
robots they did a really nice job this
year making the making the whole
conference a little more yeah that the
presentation side of things the keynote
I thought was the best google it wasn't
a press only event but the best kind of
presentation big you know keynote
address your president thing I've seen
Google do in a while is very
entertaining still you know Google geeky
Google at heart which it should be but a
little more kind of slicked up which was
nice great but a whole bunch of gaming
demos going on over here why can't see
so they kind of like turns around
there's glue hi whos da shown off
Scrabble Oh
SPV showing off their their shell for
android alternate user interface Zen
studios they make some very cool pinball
games you see it running here on a zoom
gameloft
and then a bunch of other app demos
madness not definitely not all games all
kinds of stuff I to it make a lot of
business software like to feel ya
evernote very popular in for business
coupons com I'm just walking around some
random stuff over here to the developer
sandbox area I've got some little
lounges set up so here's a NBA digital I
may have to hang out here for a while
why some clips of the Lakers getting
bounced from the playoffs but as John
said you know my warriors didn't even
make it in and the Knicks got got swept
in the first round so but here is this
last night's game this was an epic game
this is last night's game triple
overtime thriller
yeah yep yep that was a great game NBA
gametime on the Google TV platform there
there's the ESPN well I hop all kinds of
stuff just give me a little bit of
flavor of google i/o 2011 in case you
couldn't be here we'll go over here to
the wallet device it's pretty cool they
had this last year this is just a whole
slew of Android devices in a nice little
green case with a mantra Tory robots
phones you've seen tablets you've seen
some you may never have seen
and then of course that you're probably
wearing shouldn't be a cool little droid
robots and the devices you've seen all
the devices
like in the style that one with the are
a gal that one's pretty cool with the
Android behind the roulette wheel the
driving wheel cupcake
chattanooga
noogler sorry about here with
so there you go a little bit of the
flavor kind of mellow up here they they
opened up the third floor last year it
was only a two floor event this year the
third floor so things are a little more
spread out it's actually kind of nice
not super crowded over the place also
it's lunchtime so most of the devs are
down getting their lunch on so there you
go with the big will end with the big
the big lineup here of android robot
showing off all the apps live from
google i/o 2011 in san francisco
get myself back on camera wish you were
here what can i say i'm known from
technobuffalo calm lots of coverage all
week long what's going on the google
world right here on TechnoBuffalo see
