TechnoBuffalo here there's a lot of
under-the-hood differences between this
generation iPhone the 6s the 6s plus and
the last generation if you want to know
everything that's new about this current
Jena phones watch this video right here
but today I'm going to focus on 3d touch
or more commonly referred to as force
touch show you what it can do and what
it can't do in the most current
iteration of iOS 9 so the first thing
you could have your wallpaper come to
life you can use a live photo to make it
do some things we got Brandon right here
you can see Brando walking around I'm
gonna go ahead and swap in an iPhone 6s
plus real fast I can walk you guys
through what it's like to use 3d touch
on what it does or doesn't do so the
first thing this difference between just
tapping the screen and getting the
little icon to jiggle and rearrange them
there's actually doing a force touch and
a force touch you really have to put
pressure in to make it register and when
you do it you get a little bit of
vibration haptic feedback so right now
the apps that are working are primarily
Apple's first party app so hopefully
third parties will get access to this
API is and start developing new features
and karlie see some of those apps like
Instagram for example takes advantage
other we show you on the phone app for
example it's the one that I'm gonna use
the most often so if I go ahead and push
all the way down I can take my finger
off you don't have to keep your finger
on the screen and drag three people that
I call most and I can create a new
contact right from there if you want to
get out of it you can just tap it Apple
calls all these things you can do inside
of force touch peek and pop so you can
peek inside of an app and if you want to
you can pop right into it so may give
you feel other examples of things that
you can do at least right now with it
let's jump into photos for example if I
go ahead and do a force touch there I
can see my most recent favorites
or one year ago first search as I
mentioned third-party apps are starting
to work so if I go ahead and go to
Instagram for example do a little force
touch action I can get a quick view of
what I can do so new pose for your
activity search or send a direct message
and one of the things that's hard to
show on video is how much pressure I'm
pushing down you really gotta play
adduce amount of pressure to make the
forest touch work and the screen does
recognize and recognizes it almost
perfectly each time so apples in
language for 3d touch is peak and pop go
ahead open a message for example I do
one force touch I can peek and see a map
and if I push a little
I can pop right in to maps any time you
get an address and I look up a word you
can do things like that and it jumps you
right in so again it's going to open up
an address and you want to just see it
real quickly the quick tap and you can
hold it down and you push harder and go
ahead and jump right into the Maps
application it's definitely new once a
little bit of getting used to and to
figure out how much pressure or not
pressure to apply but it does work and
work pretty well they go through a touch
is almost giving you another button
without having to put a physical button
on the screen if I was in the camera app
for example and I want to add something
new I can just push that down you can't
see maybe where the feature is going
perhaps that touch ID button is gonna go
away in favor of maybe a totally touch
sensitive halo that can also detect
fingerprints in next-generation the
iPhone or maybe a few generations away
but right now it's an exciting albeit
not overly useful addition to the phone
hopefully over the next weeks and months
that can change that was a real quick
demonstration of what exists right now
with 3d touch gaming's have been really
excited about with 3d touch be able to
zoom in with a scope by doing a harder
press something that could be pretty
cool maybe take this platform to the
next level as far as mobile gaming goes
anyway what do you guys think up to your
thoughts on it leave the comments down
below till next time Jon render from
TechnoBuffalo see you next video
