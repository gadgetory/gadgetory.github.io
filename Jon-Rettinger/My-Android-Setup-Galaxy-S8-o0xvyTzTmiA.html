that I'm using right now we had a lot of
questions to show what's on my home
screen how I set up my android phone
stop school opportunity to show you
what's on my galaxy si plus before I
jump in and show you how I tweet didn't
minimalized it up I want to thank our
sponsor Verve for making this video
possible you might not know this our
editor-in-chief shot on it he's trying
to come up with chopped before it became
officially a tech nerd you gotta got me
into anime the past three years so Verve
is an app made by the people over a
crunchy roll we can watch all your
favorite anime like attack on Titan
season 2 subs on crunchyroll or dubs on
Funimation pretty cool option app so you
can download the Verve app pretty much
every platform Xbox Playstation iOS or
Android put a link down below if you
want to check it out plus I got some
more of my favorites there things I'm
watching right now like roosterteeth
Ruby cartoon hangovers be in pussycat
and you're also supporting your favorite
creators as you watch if you guys like
what you see and you want to sign up for
the combo pack you can check out all the
content totally ad-free link to it down
below to get a free 7-day trial so
getting past the verb app you'll notice
it looks like for the most part like I
have color turned off on my screen kind
of on a bit of a minimalistic kicker
right now it's why I'm actually using
Nova
I got a dig the default Samsung launch
if I go back and forth but it seems to
always come back to no but just for
customization I'm using it for years on
Android you should try it if you haven't
checked it out but I'm going for that
sort of simple look as I'm using the min
icon pack which is also free it looks
really nice it's not the easiest to find
like apps for example the app drawer
kind of looks like notification straight
from Android but I can get tax ID with
my stuff that I use right on the home
screen starting from the top of the
phone I'm using Nova's persistent search
bar I have a ton of fun options you can
pick from
I picked the black one because kind of
match the theme you can search obviously
you can hit the microphone to talk and
do your search mostly I use it just to
tap the Google icon I pulled up Google
now for me sort of eliminates the need
to have the Google now launcher or the
pixel launcher sort of have that all the
way on your left home screen so below
that is my favorite weather widget it
comes from weather timeline we actually
featured it in the 5 apps video you can
look at if obvious reasons I know it
looks like I'm a huge
Brooklyn Nets and by seeing the color
scheme here it just simple clean and
looks really nice and breaking up my
nice color scheme I know I'm going to
get some crap for I've got the Google
News widget and I've got the weather
there as well in yellow just like
knowing your news I don't go take a
chance to read up and what's going on so
that's a quick glance I can see the
stories that are happening to the right
of all that there's a test laughs we're
kind of helping me control my car
I'm trying to up my smart home game I
moved a few months ago that's where my
main Smart Home app in their nest let's
be control my nest cams I'm not using a
thermostat right now gets that a minute
I've got a ton of nest cams in there let
me see what my kids are doing I've got a
nest down door cam and I've got one
serve in the main room like a sort of
watch what's going on during the day or
even talked to my wife or kids I'm
currently using the Eco v3 so I've got
two of those went upstairs and
downstairs I'm using that instead of the
nastiest right now you got room centers
lets you sort of get unified temperature
but it doesn't learn like the nest does
kind of a trade-off
I had a nest my previous place and
service trying something new and then
ring I've got the ring doorbell Pro
which is absolutely awesome I think we
reviewed it a while back let you see
who's at door gives you alerts and
somebody crosses a field you can talk to
them truly nights for security gives you
a little peace of mind
oh and on traveling I can sort of see
what's going on outside of my house the
other stuff you're obviously aware of
it's like Google photos and camera I've
got a messaging soldiers that I use got
a load duo messenger and what's that
been there got a YouTube folder for
YouTube studio and then YouTube kids
because I let my kids play with that and
below that I've got TechnoBuffalo
shortcut and the verve app the dog is
pretty simple I've had my dog set up the
same way for years almost on any
platform that I'm on with our iOS or
Android my dialer is all weight on the
left
I got chrome I've got a folder in the
middle now for social icons Facebook
Instagram LinkedIn and Twitter and then
I've got the easily do email apps talk
about that also in our five apps video I
absolutely love it for iOS or Android
and then just a default messaging app
I'd also say I'm using G board instead
of Samsung's default keyboard I like the
way it looks and I've got the number row
turned off I tried to keep it with a
minimal fee
try and keep my number of home screens
down I've got the persistent search bar
again at the top and then below that
I've got calendars agenda widget again
for a really simple elegant look and
feel so show me what I've got going on
during the day so obviously a ton of
other apps I've got here I want to kind
of give a highlight so the things that
I'm using the most if you like this kind
of videos you want to see us do more the
thumbs up to let us know and if you want
to see us do more maybe of your setup
featured go ahead and tweet it at me or
TechnoBuffalo and use the hashtag TV

and can show to know why your setup is
boss the ball or the King and you guys
