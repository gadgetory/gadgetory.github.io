came out apples flashback phone the
iPhone se every time I moved in this
chair it sounds like I'm farting so I
promise I did not just need a giant
plate of beans before I sat here so we
did our for review of the iPhone se
which you should check out well link it
here and down below and all the usual
linking parts but since then I've been
using it but more importantly I got one
for my mom and that kind of got me
thinking about who the target
demographic for the iPhone se is I did
my full review I was very just like me
you know exactly what it is before you
got it I appreciated Apple put in the a9
I appreciate it they put in their newest
camera I did not appreciate the really
not overly awesome screen that goes in
it and something to be said for a
smaller size but admittedly I am NOT
that demographic in the Apple world I'm
the 6s plus demographic the note size
galaxy s7 edge that's sort of where I've
gotten used to after reviewing film for
so many years going back to something
that's diminutive of 4 inches was a bit
of a tough change my mom was coming from
an older iPhone 4s and she wanted a new
phone so I got her one of these and
she's been absolutely thrilled and maybe
she's thrilled because she doesn't know
any better but there are a lot of people
out there who for better or worse either
don't know any better or just don't care
like we do about phones and I think
that's probably who this phone is for if
you follow the phone industry a lot and
he really in the tech I don't think
anybody's drooling for the iPhone se on
big people like waiting in line and
can't be at the Apple store in fact when
we went to the Apple Store they had
launched there was there was nobody
loitering about so it change my
perspective a little bit on the phone
there are a lot of people I think would
want the iPhone se boy I think where
Apple is gonna be success for this
device is not my mom and Susan had the
phone after my mom when she gets a new
phone whatever that might be she's gonna
return this phone she's gonna sell it
back to Apple or to get sold somewhere
Apple is gonna refurbish it they're
gonna sell it again for Paul with 50% of
the price that we paid for it and then
someone's gonna use it so it back
applique furbish it again the same
phone's gonna have three separate
lifespans that's where Apple starts to
make the profit year over year over year
so this is standpoint they're gonna make
a ton of money from a phone and Roybal
standpoint
I'm still mad on it but I've realized
more it's just not for me but the phone
is for you tell me why you appreciate a
smaller screen size you want to say an
apple ecosystem it's the lowest price
point you can get in we feel comfortable
within relatively new phones your
familiar looking hardware or are you
just like Apple what happened man you
used to be so cool used to be friends
then you've got a girlfriend things got
weird out see anymore which can for you
guys I'd love to your thoughts on it 50
video a thumbs up it was appreciate it
until next time I'm driver interim
TechnoBuffalo doc to you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
