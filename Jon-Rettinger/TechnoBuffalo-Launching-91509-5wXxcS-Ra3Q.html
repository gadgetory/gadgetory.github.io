like years ago that we finally started
talking about technobuffalo we began
with sort of some screenshots and some
hints progressed to a slew of beta
testers and now I'm so proud and so
excited to finally share a launch date
with you we will be opening our virtual
doors this coming Tuesday September 15th
in the morning on pacific standard time
it's a day that's really representative
of better part of a year of hard work
with brandon myself developers and
graphic designers and staff and writers
it's been a very long time coming i am
thrilled excited hugely nervous to share
it with everybody so in case you missed
what TechnoBuffalo is let me give you a
real quick rundown on the front end what
you're going to see is a gadgets blog
it's going to focus on editorial and
original content we're not trying to
duplicate other sites we're not going to
be posting late-breaking news you can
get that elsewhere we are going to be
posting is original content that adds
value to you so if a new phone is
announced we're not just going to say
hang a new phones announced you can pick
it up at AT&amp;amp;T for 199 I'll go over the
features and see how those features
actually help you every post on our site
we want to have value to the reader so
we're really looking forward to being
able to share this with you we've got a
staff of professional fantastic writers
who are itching to get their opinions
out there in addition to just sort of
the standard text and pictures you may
have seen elsewhere we're going to be
very video focused obviously since I got
my start doing video so we're gonna have
a lot of video we're going to have
regular shows why shows and a lot of 360
product reviews and analyses so look for
that on the other end of technobuffalo
we also created a new social network
that we've dubbed buffalo net which is
going to let you interact and talk with
other no tech related folks so if you
want to find more information about an
iphone you can search for who's got an
iphone if you want to talk about the
best programs for your windows mobile
phone you
ahead and do that as well what this is
going to give you it's a bit of
anonymity as opposed to some of the
other social networks out there so you'd
have to give people your Facebook
address if you want to talk to them so
you can't see the pictures of what you
did over the weekend you can create a
technobuffalo profile and talk to people
and interact and use the built-in
instant messenger to talk to your
technobuffalo friends also in one of the
things that I'm really most excited
about is this new sub blog platform when
you sign up for a technobuffalo username
you're going to have the option to
create your own sub log and texts about
that's going to be is a URL off of the
main site so TechnoBuffalo com /
whatever username is going to be and you
will have full wordpress content
management to create your own site
really on whatever you want certainly we
prefer if you give a technology related
but if your site it's your blank canvas
do with it what you will the only
regulations that were given out is just
that it's really nothing obscene and is
age-appropriate for everyone other than
than that it is yours to do with what
you like and since it is your content
we're also giving you the ability to
monetize your site as well we're giving
you full control over the banner ad so
you can put in your own adsense code or
ever other ad code you have you can put
there and that becomes yours your hard
work should be rewarded also for the
tech sites that are created if there's
something that's especially good we're
going to be featuring that content on
the main site to getting a lot of
exposure as well that you wouldn't get
elsewhere if you're a tech reviewer on
YouTube and you're struggling you're
only getting you know 100 200 views if
you're lucky you know putting those
videos on technobuffalo and sharing them
with everybody's it gets you a lot more
exposure it's also going to make you a
few bucks through monetization so we're
really excited about the platform I am
so thrilled to be opening his doors to
you guys so next tuesday September 15 go
to TechnoBuffalo com you'll no longer
see the landing page you'll see the real
live site we can go ahead and log in and
start learning and reading about tech
anyway guys I hope you enjoy the site
really hope
site very excited about it and it
represents really just countless hours
of hard work from a lot of people so to
those people thank you and to you guys
thank you for your support and I hope
you like the site see the next video
