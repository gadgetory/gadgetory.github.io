to you by carbonite hp's first webos
tablet the touchpad hit the streets
earlier today but are they already in
talks to license their software out to
the likes of Samsung blackberry may have
had plans for a 10 inch version of their
playbook tablet and it may have been
killed off but this guy seems to still
have blackberries pocket anyway why and
are there big trucks full of really thin
laptops made by apple just sitting in
warehouses waiting to roll out to a
store near you all that more its room
around it what's going on everybody and
welcome to rumor roundup for today
Friday July first 2011 I'm noak rabbits
from TechnoBuffalo i'm jon rettinger and
i apologize in advance for all the bad
jokes it's we're in the same room all
bets are off we got a lot of rumors we
got two people on camera let's just get
through them first off touchpad you've
got in your hands I'm actually touching
the touch bed that's good I like it see
doing it up there's chemistry all kinds
of coverage of the touchpad on techno
Buffalo calm so we won't get into any
kind of review right now but instead
rumors that HP is already talking about
licensing webos out to other companies
jean-marie think it's been confirmed
that they're in talks with other
companies the CEO of HP Leo abdominal
massacres last night okay let's just
calling CEO Leo a has been in talked
with other companies to license web OS
rumor is that it's Samsung not to
talking to you know it makes sense
Samsung apparels get a little fed up
with Android maybe limitations maybe not
but then you know the Android fanboys
retire but not another supplementation's
what's going on what I mean Samsung's
huge they can churn out phones by the
bushel yeah there have been rumors that
Google may be limiting what carriers can
do or manufacturers can do as far as
skinning future versions of Android so I
think perhaps Samsung's looking ahead
their bet with maybe some webos action I
just I don't know I just want more with
a webos phones what I want to know how
to say web OS and Leo a and I want them
now but 4.5 inch webos phone with a
super amoled plus extra awesomesauce
display sign me up it's too big for me
I'm not that strong moving on blackberry
what's the deal this thing tablet
playbook 7-inch first of all here's the
email client second of all 10 inch
version may have been scrapped in favor
of a superphone although it might be a
single core super phone I don't know
they go court running the qnx software
which for all my Greg's about clay book
not having an email client qnx is pretty
sweet I like it I don't know John you've
been using a blackberry lately I am I
have been rocking a blackberry bold with
my dedicated phone and if rim is smart
and actually wrote a long editorial on
what rim needs to do to succeed and
their conclusion was q NX q NX q NX q NX
q NX they say that again q + X which is
the operating system that's running on
the play book they need it in phone and
he did in the phones as quickly as
possible if they have to move resources
away from a 10-inch tablet to get it on
a phone do it I'm in favor of and QX
supports eat and put email on it too ah
HTC status the facebook phone which is
really just a phone with a facebook
button I don't know you meet the UM the
carrier version 2 cha cha cha cha cha do
it do it the cha-cha-cha 2 cha-cha-cha
sore from my cotillion days yeah I'm not
even gonna my wife is gonna watch us and
get very embarrassed oh well as a loss
for words right there AT&amp;amp;T announced
that the cha cha cha I mean the status
is coming out sometime this summer we
don't know when we don't know how much
we do know that Google just launched
plus 1 so our nose are going to be a
Google cha cha cha so we could say that
you don't know what the status is of the
treasure oh look at that so that's why
no I'm just I'm just happy to be here
folks speaking of things that are
unrelated but related to status Justin
Timberlake this is one of those truth is
stranger than fiction things he was in
the movie social network he played that
Sean Parker guy in the movie now
apparently he's a stakeholder in my
space
which was just sold to a company that's
right around here somewhere in southern
california 35 million dollar sale worth
it um myspace were 35 million dollars um
Tom doesn't have that many friends
anymore tom is sitting there all by
himself asking for anyone to be his
friend certainly there's a lot of
intellectual property that myspace has
in a lot of information you've gathered
about us before we ever started using
Facebook 35 million dollars haven't seen
evaluation that high since microsoft
bought skype no zing or senza
livingsocial was came out saying they
want to go public for 15 billion dollars
everyone's go quiet you know where my
ring technobuffalo we're going to go
public for 1.5 gazillion speaking of
government agencies being hacked are we
talking about that I don't know we are
now losec everybody's a favorite Love
Boat of hackers doing all kinds of stuff
all over the world of the Internet
delivered a parting gift earlier this
week in the form of a little tiny bit of
malware bundled in with some supposed
documents from AT&amp;amp;T talking about a 4G
LTE version of the ipad coming possibly
in early 2012john when you think yeah
we're certainly going to see an LTE
version of the ipad coming AT&amp;amp;T is
announced an LTE network is going to be
coming soon verizon already has a pretty
awesome LTE network are in existence so
yeah it makes perfect sense although I
personally think that the next iPad
we're going to see won't be released
until next year it'll probably be
packing LTE although i know mr. Kravitz
here has either you know what I'm going
to stick with this opinion even if I
think it's false but i do think it's
true new ipad this fall somebody out
there you know who you are you're an
editor in chief you're going to be
singing and dancing on the internet
televisions that's all I'm saying wait
did you hear that crack out in the
distance Oh is the sound of 18 T's
network breaking under the weight of the
rumor of an LTE iPad sorry had to
connect all right so last week we
brought you news of Nokia's new n9 phone
and rumors about their first windows
mobile phone now we all know one thing
about nokia they make awesome cameras in
their camera phones they really
top-notch cameras this week press
release came out t-mobile HTC and now
the next generation of their mytouch
slide for the mytouch slide 4g and the
press release was almost entirely about
how awesome sauce flavored the cameras
going to be I don't know John a few in
Tibet right now and let's take the
status cha-cha-cha Heather thing here
cameras HTC nokia i take note yet
heartbeat entertainment say what you
will about nokia their cameras are
awesome HTC put out some amazing
hardware the cameras maybe a little bit
less on the awesome scale I love HTC
hardware I love that they named their
phones after dances but I gotta go with
you on this one yeah so I expecting the
camera to be quite incredible the press
release certainly said how awesome it
was best camera that ever kamerad on the
face of this camera we don't expect it
to do generally put out some awesome
pictures it's got some great hardware
there as well as HTC is really known
absolutely and speaking of cameras
shameless plug our own Mike Pearlman as
the new olympus pen and he likes it a
lot so go read the review on the website
i just want to take a second to think
our friends and sponsors at Carbonite
computer disasters eventually happened

get a virus you could drop your machine
and might get stolen you never know what
might happen but if you get carbonite

you don't need to worry your files will
be backed up automatically and safely
off site and the best thing is it's
really easy to get them back you get
anytime anywhere access to your backed
up files from any computer on a
smartphone or on an ipad with the free
Carbonite out with carbonite unlimited

what could be better than that
and last but certainly not least yeah
it's time for an apple rumor new MacBook
Airs a little birdie told me well no
they told John but then i like to say
they told me cuz on Ivan demon you hear
more things than I do yeah people like
there may be some trucks they may be
full of MacBook Airs they may be already
deployed sitting in securely guard
locations just waiting to roll out to a
store near you and these MacBook Airs
maybe they may have the new version of
OS 10 lion pre-installed on them but are
they just man who cares are there more
computers so this is something that we
haven't published its is the first time
we're announcing it you guys come close
we'll keep it a secret we are hearing
from a very reliable source who's
involved with the shipping it's not me
it's a reliable source involving the
shipping and the security that
accompanies Apple computers that there
are shipments and route to Apple stores
for an expected delivery date of next
week so after watching us on the first
which is a friday so the following week
following up the fourth of July so
probably the fifth of July would be when
we expect to see these new computers and
it would make sense that if apple is
releasing new laptops right now those
new laptops would have y infringe el
absolute lion is blind as Y all accounts
you know ready to go just about ready to
go they've already said it's going to be
a downloadable only thing if you want to
upgrade not shipping physical media
obviously new MacBook Airs you know that
it's time for a refresh time for the mac
mini refresh time for a mac pro refresh
there was no hardware now to wwc sure
hello and the macbook the plastic
macbook and rumors that we might see a
this color which is black if the cameras
bad macbook air is finally a glare off
the John's head investissement talking
my head off your head that's Rob so we
might actually see some black macbook
airs although that we have him get
confirmation on but we were able to
confirm the two separate sources that
shipments are and routes to Apple stores
all right we're we've taken up way way
too much room no we haven't we could
talk all day but we're going to stop
it's the rumor roundup fragile Ida first
