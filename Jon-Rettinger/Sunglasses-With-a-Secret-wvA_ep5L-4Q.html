did an unboxing of these the bows frames
the totally new product category that
I've never tried before they are
sunglasses with speakers built-in that
do a lot more than that so these are
made a bunch of different scenarios I
think you guys probably would and I've
got some dots on them let's talk about
the frames so your hundred 99 bucks
didn't get you a pair of boasts frame
come in two different sizes these are
the also it's kind of more angular and
then there's called the Rondo a little
more circular I don't realize how tiny
shrunk my head was these are the larger
versions and even though they're bigger
than my head is they still fit pretty
comfortably I actually had surgery on my
ears when I was a kid so I think
generally tend to cause me pain if I'm
wearing them for a long time these are
having issues at all and I was surprised
they're pretty lightweight considering
electronics that are packed inside so
it's a bose product you figure the
sounds got to be good and I do want to
give a shout-out to thank you to Bose
for sponsoring this video these are
unlike any other sort of sound headsets
that I've ever worn there's no bone
conducting technology with Bose did it
was kind of neat
they have speakers actually built into
the frames that shoot the audio directly
into your ear so once I got over kind of
the weirdness of appearing to be a crazy
person by talking myself and having
conversations I got really used to what
they can do the sound quality for me was
about two separate things so how music
sounded and then how phone calls sounded
so on the music side it actually sounded
really good then you have giant
expectations coming from a product so
small but the way the speakers are
aligned interwar they set on your ear
the audio really does go right and it
sounds better at anything I ever tried
that used like an older bone conducting
technology a few caveats so if you are
indoors and you have your audio at about
mid volume people around you will be
able to hear either your music or your
conversation but when you go outside and
there's ambient noise you turn the
volume up almost all the way to full and
people can't really hear you all the way
around so at least bear that in mind if
privacy is important to you so
controlling the frames is pretty simple
there's one button it'll work seamlessly
with either iOS or Android pulling up
Siri and Google assistant the button let
you do a lot of controls for nd
accepting phone calls you can control
the songs you're listening to they did a
pretty nice job with it you can
obviously just pair these with Bluetooth
as you would any other Bluetooth headset
Bose recommends though that you set up
the Bose Connect app either an iOS or
Android gonna give you things like
software updates and also let you sort
of more easily control the volume I wish
I could have controlled the volume from
the headset themselves but I didn't mind
having used my phone I got used to it
pretty quickly I think I got sunglasses
to look good and feel good and Bose
didn't disappear to cut any corners when
it comes to design and materials they
feel really premium while still kind of
being light the Altos here have more of
an angular design which I kind of dig
suppose I get about three and half hours
of the music streaming battery life on
the frames that's pretty close accurate
I got just about three hours trying to
charge the frames gonna take you about 2
hours from empty to full and the
connector is a proprietary magnetic
connector and it does attach easily and
pretty strongly but I would have liked
maybe USBC on here just about to carry
another cable with me when I'm not about
my sites not the best I would have liked
if there was a prescription option I
imagine that will hopefully be coming at
some point also some sort of water
resistance would have been nice to have
here if you're kind of stuck out in the
rain but if you don't want to go for a
run and get a light sweat on you're not
gonna have any sort of issues or if you
go full dad mode and want to mow your
lawn you're fine probably the biggest
surprise that Bose frames it was
actually the utility while driving if
you drive an older car that maybe
doesn't have Bluetooth or one of the
people that drive with headphones in
it's super unsafe so the Bose frames by
design are perfect for you know the
driving environment you can still hear
the cars around you you could have phone
calls it will teach your music or
podcasts and still be safe and be aware
of any sounds or horns honking you know
to potentially avoid collision so pretty
nice for that so those are the Bose
frames mostly good some stuff I would
have liked to seen change but for the
most part they do exactly what both set
out for them to do it's a new product
category for Bose a new product category
that I've ever tried but would you guys
try something like this what's what's
your use case would it be in the car
would it be at home would it be just out
and about let us know in the comments
down below give video a thumbs up we
appreciate it until next time John
