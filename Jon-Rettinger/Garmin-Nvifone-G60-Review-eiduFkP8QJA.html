for you of the garmin nuvi phone g60
just released for AT&amp;amp;T wireless this is
going to run you to 99 after a hundred
dollar mail-in rebate if you watch my
channel you'll see me unbox the device
give you a tour of the operating system
and give you a demonstration of the
indycar and navigation features of the
g60 it touts navigation as really its
killer feature since it is built by
garmin before we get into all that let's
start with the phone itself since it is
a phone it's got to make phone calls
phone quality is actually very high I
could hear people very clearly on mind
and they reported no white noise on
there and in fact most people thought I
was even on a landline a 3g radio is a
little bit weak put side by side with
other 3g phones like the iphone 3g nand
unlock treo pro had about one bar less
of 3g something to keep in mind if
you're in a fringe area you may have
some problems with reception built
quality of the device is fantastic it's
got a really nice solid bill to it it is
a little bit on the thick side but i
guess that's to be expected since it is
a standalone gps unit so let's talk
about God Briggs isn't for a minute like
I said I did a full tour of the
operating system but as a new phone it
already feels a little bit dated garmin
first revealed this a little over 20
months ago and had it been releasing
then it probably would have felt like a
modern OS but in the days of android and
iphone OS something like this really
feels behind the eight ball it's
functional don't get me wrong it's
certainly not elegant and it's
definitely not pretty but it is usable
so if you want something that's just a
usable feature phone OS the nuvi phone
OS is going to be okay for you does
offer features like an HTML browser no
multi-touch it does have email
capabilities although it's not rich HTML
this sort of your standard pop/imap
email application no exchange support
and of course text messaging from the
design standpoint I found a little bit
weird that there really aren't any
physical buttons on a device used for
navigation the only real buttons that
you use regularly is the power and
standby button right on the top of the
phone all the navigation is done on
screen yeah a resistive touchscreen and
for those are not familiar with
resistive essentially what it is is two
layers of film on top of each other and
I make a connection when you push them
together so that's why you can use
things like a stylist really anything to
push on the screen whereas a capacitive
touch screen like the iphone or
blackberry storm t-mobile g1 is used by
a transfer of electrons that's why you
can only use your finger I'm admittedly
not a fan of resistive touchscreens I
think garmin did a decent job
implementing one of those in this
instance the OS does feel zippy with
resistive touch brand afflicts rolling
does work quite well surprisingly that
being said since it is resisted the
screen is actually in late a little bit
there's a lip around the device you're
going to get a lot of dust cut in there
from the navigation standpoint so this
is what the phones really known for it
is a fantastic navigator all the maps
are loaded locally on the device so use
no need for a data connection to use it
as a gps unit close you that are
familiar with garment have used a newbie
in the past this is going to behave
exactly like one of those standalone
units it comes with a ton of accessories
including a car mount and charger so you
put it right up on your dash and it's
just like any other gps it does text to
speech they'll tell you which way to
turn and i'll say the street name it is
a fantastic navigator now let's talk
about the price point 2 99's a little
bit steep if you looking to buy a car
you're going to compare cars that are in
the same price range I think phones are
no exception at that 299 price point you
really have a lot of comparisons you've
got the iphone on ATT you've got the
blackberry bold you've got the new HTC
pure and upcoming tilts to there are a
lot of phones a sort of fall in that
price point I think you're going to be
hard pressed to justify three hundred
dollars for
to buy especially when all those other
phones offer navigation options take
something like the iphone for example I
know it's sort of unfair to always come
back to the iphone something like that
it does offer standalone navigation
options companies like navigon and
tomtom offer full-blown navigation for
just about a hundred dollars so the cost
of an iphone 3g or 3gs about two hundred
and another hundred dollars for the
navigation Program and you are to equal
the price of the newbie phone it's a
very hard sell just from a price
perspective however taking price out the
phone is very functional and it does
what it's advertised to do it doesn't do
anything more you're not going to get a
fantastic web experience or email
program but you're going to get a phone
that works so it's really going to come
down to you and what's important if you
get lost a lot like I do sometimes they
got a hard time even finding my way home
you're going to appreciate having the
gps functionality it does work quite
well and they're really in my opinion is
nothing better than garment so it's
going to be a trade-off for what you can
live with or not live with back to give
this phone on a one-to-five scale based
just on features i'm going to give it a
solid three it's a little bit thick for
my taste and the resistive touchscreen
immediately takes a star away so what do
you guys think is this a phone you're
interested in if you want to go to AT&amp;amp;T
store and check it out they've got a few
on display there be a video or tech
response and curious what you guys think
