Sangan from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
video we'll be talking about five Apple
watch apps we think are worth checking
out
third-party apps on the Apple watch are
basically more simplified versions of
what you'd find on an iPhone what you're
used to using on an iOS app won't
necessarily make it on the Apple watch
app Twitter for example on iOS has all
the proper UI elements from timeline
mentions and direct messages whereas the
Apple watch app only allows users to
view their timeline compose a new tweet
and what's trending it's similar app
overall but missing some features from
iOS and this will be the case for most
Apple watch apps so the number one on
our list is deliveries which is going
for $4.99 this is probably my favorite
package tracker app on iOS as it does
everything that I need on the Apple
watch the app shows you what packages
you're still waiting for and what's been
delivered you don't have to constantly
pick up your phone to check when your
packages are arriving unfortunately
you're not able to add packages through
the app just yet you're still going to
have to rely on your iPhone to do that
however having the delivery's app on the
Apple watch makes it so much easier to
track packages on-the-go instead of
pulling out my iPhone and launching the
app to see what ship or what's been
delivered I can quickly look at my
glances or deliveries app on my Apple
watch and see all my information on my
wrist number 2 on our list is Shazam
which is free from the App Store now
whenever I hear a song on a radio that I
really like I usually use Shazam to you
figure out what's playing
Shazam on the Apple watch is very
similar to the iPhone app you'll be able
to figure out what song is playing on a
radio in about 5 or so seconds and on
the Apple watch specifically you have
two options to choose from once it
figures out what song was playing you
can either read the lyrics directly on
your watch or buy the song directly on
iTunes right from your phone it's a neat
way to figure out what song is playing
however there is a slight caveat to this
the Shazam app actually uses the iPhones
microphone instead of using the Apple
watch's microphone so don't expect to
tag a song using just your Apple watch
if your iPhone isn't close by number 3
on our list is Yahoo weather which is
also free from the App Store the app and
glance card for Yahoo weather it looks
great on the Apple watch I think it's
much better than the stock weather app
that came pre-installed on the Apple
watch in terms of visuals but the app
itself will show a bunch of information
like the highs and lows for the day wind
speed and
when the Sun will rise and set however
it is a bit slow to load which seems to
be a trend on the Apple watch but
nonetheless it's an app that looks
visually appealing and is an upgrade
over the stock app Apple Offers number
four on our list is clear which is going
for $4.99 in the App Store clear is one
of the most minimalistic and elegant to
do apps I've ever used and it's the same
here on the Apple watch you can view
your to-do lists and check off completed
tasks along with creating new ones by
using force touch and dictation you can
also add a reminder for each task for
example if I want to be reminded in an
hour to buy fruits it'll buzz my wrists
to remind me to buy fruits I can also
add clear to glances and easily see
what's on my to-do list which is super
convenient the last one on our list is
Evernote now with Evernote on the Apple
watch you'll be able to dictate view and
add notes right from your wrist of
course all new edited notes will sync
back to your iPhone so you don't need to
re-enter the same note twice and all
your notes on the Apple watch will sync
back to your iPhone almost instantly
unfortunately can only dictate add in
search for notes on the Apple watch you
can view your notebooks tags and work
chat directly from your watch but
hopefully this is something we'll see in
future versions of Evernote for the
Apple watch most of the apps we
mentioned today are free with the
exception of two apps clear and
deliveries which are both going for
$4.99 I personally use these apps on a
daily basis and having them on my wrist
makes it so much easier for me to access
them if I were to step away from my desk
and forget my iPhone and I want to
quickly check my deliveries or add a
note through Evernote I can just use my
Apple watch to do those things it's
super helpful and more convenient for me
because I'm wearing the Apple watch at
all times where as if I didn't have the
Apple watch and I forget my iPhone at my
desk I wouldn't be able to do those
tasks right away if you guys have any
cool apps that you enjoy using on a
daily basis on your Apple watch let us
know in the comments down below as we
would love to check them out if you guys
enjoy this video make sure to give it a
thumbs up and we will see you guys in
the next one
