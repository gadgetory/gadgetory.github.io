reimagined on touchpad to really take
advantage of the big screen
alright so you see here an email that
takes up the whole screen I zoomed in so
that I could just concentrate on this
one email i can forward four ply do all
the things that you normally do with
emails but that's not just what what I
want webos lets me work the way i want
to so if i want to see not just one
email but my entire email inbox all i do
is drag this handle and i can see my
entire exchange inbox I can tap through
it I can pick other emails
I can pick other emails or I can go all
the way out here and see all my mixes
totally do that for you again so I'm
going to tech this bring it all the way
in and I'm going to drag this handle
back out see first my inbox and then all
my mail what is that feature called so
this feature is called panels and these
things we're pulling handles so I can
drag the handles in and out or I can tap
them to make them collapse and I can
leave the view however i want i want to
i want three it will remain as i switch
between different applications and for
me that's really so the other really
cool thing about email is multi-select
so i get a lot of email a couple hundred
emails a day and this is what helps me
really deal with it quick tap on this
check box button and now i can grab as
many emails as i work hit the delete
button or the move left and they're gone
a really simple way instead of swiping
through everything I can just multi some
really great and powerful way to deal
with your email all right so let's say I
want to to reply to
so in to reply button an upcoming
achieving keyboard is great a really
easy to type on Vulcan portrait and in
landscape and the other cool thing about
the keyboard is it resizes so if I hold
down on the keyboard button here I get
options I can make it large or small
depending on line typing preferences how
I will as I said I want to do extra
small that's great I can still type on
it and you also notice that it's got all
the number keys here so I don't have to
go hunting around and simple venues or
anything like that so I'm going to make
a little bit bigger I prefer medium come
but let me also show you real quick at
the keyboard works just as well on or
through and it resizes the same way too
so if i wanted to see four of the email
or if i want to look at an email that
went better in portrait this is easy
Ellis is this big elephants biggest
they are shorter this way obviously i
think they are as tall i have measured
it definitely seems very title i've been
using it in portrait as I took notes I
had I held it in one hand and and type
isn't like this that was really easy and
was also really easy to kind of put it
on with flat surface and type like this
so I really enjoy playing with the
keyboard here the other cool thing off
just point out is this next button
allows me to move through all the
different fields we don't have to go to
tap and keep going up and all right so
that's email other cool thing about
email is that it's staffed each email is
its own car so if I don't want to deal
with this email right now I can hold it
and I can move it anywhere else may be
off to the side here and deal with it
later I don't have to close it I don't
have to remember that it's a giraffe
it's just there in my workspace and I
can come back I can have as many only
put email since I war
but I can also go through so I've got
that opengl i can go cross references
with another email or anything else very
simple communications
alright so that's like email</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
