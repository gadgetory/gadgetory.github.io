TechnoBuffalo here the duo cameras
probably one of the biggest flagship
features on an already flagship phone so
I thought I'd give you guys
demonstration as to what it can do and
why having two lenses on the back and
might actually be better than just one
so I've lined up for Android guys at
various depths here I'll go ahead and
snap a picture everything set to auto I
do like just as a side note the UI here
it's very simple to pick what you want
to use to shoot with I'm so go ahead and
stamp a picture you can see how quick
the shutter speed is - boom picture
taken go ahead and jump into the image
I'll go to edit and under effects you'll
see one called unfocus so now you can
tap anywhere to focus we sort of solve
this with the light stroke cameras so
right now that sort of orange guy at the
top hats in focus what if I really want
to see what that al guy and the back
looks like I just go ahead and select
him suddenly he becomes the focus
everything else blurs I'm like eh what
about that pink little rabbit Android
looks kind of neat and suddenly that's
in focus or what about my little barista
Android guy and suddenly he becomes in
focus really cool what you can do here
and imagine the possibilities for just a
be a quick picture of a kid I keep
coming back to that or sporting event
you just want to focus on your kid or a
family picture you want to focus on one
family members face there's a lot of
cool uses for this I'm gonna go ahead
and go back here another one called
foreground er just kind of neat I'll go
ahead and do whatever you want to the
foreground so right now I've got a
sketch if god zoom blurs all kinds of
other options you can do cartoon and
they work really really well and very
cool so if you want you know have any
typical picture of the red rose on the
black and white background and you can
do that here as well seasons is kinda
neat a little bit gimmicky but it sort
of moves around and you can make it look
like you know you're in different
seasons you can see dandelions flying or
fall what maple leaves or if you live
where it snows you can see that there to
kind of need a Phat it makes it look
like it's moving a little bit and then
there's dimension plus this is kind of a
weird one this one would be similar
I guess to what we've got on on iOS but
we take a picture you can sort of move
it around the image will sort of move
with it and sort of looks distorted as
you move around and this is not a
picture this isn't sort of live I can
move these guys try on it because I move
there but you can see you can sort of
get around there
it's a neat trick I don't know how often
I would use it but it is there these are
all sort of built right in to what
you've got on the camera of course
you've got filters and frames and some
other cropping stuff but there's a lot
of neat features sort of the unfocus I
think is one of the coolest features of
the duo Cameron might be reason to pick
up the HTC one just for that the
practical applications of that I think
are really significant so what do you
guys think duo camera a reason to
upgrade and get the all-new HTC One is
that enough the selling point is a nice
addition to an already awesome phone or
do you have no interest in it whatsoever
