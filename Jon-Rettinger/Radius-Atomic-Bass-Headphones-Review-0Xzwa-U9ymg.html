view for you the atomic bass headphones
by radius so radius was nice enough to
send these to me and a couple months ago
that heard me complaining about the
in-ear Apple headphones that shipped
with all the iPods
so these radius headphones are $39.99
and what they are are in ear noise
reducing economic headphones so the
couple cool things about these and
before I get into review let me show you
a little bit about them they're actually
angled so let me zoom in here so you
guys can see that angle that's what
actually makes them very unique you
check it out and on my big mug right
there but notice that there is a bit of
a tilt to those tilt in so you put it me
in your ear
put one in there and one right in there
they sit in very nicely it actually
angled right into your ear canal so you
get the noise going straight in and I'm
probably screaming so I've got these
heads got these headphones in so bass
quality is fantastic and actually since
they're not the officially noise
reduction they do do a lot of noise
reducing I've used them on a jog and
they stayed in my ears nice and
comfortably and in fact they blocked out
so much noise I didn't even hear my
phone ring usually when I'm jogging at
the Apple ones I can hear the phone
ringing not a problem so there's
something to keep in mind if you're
looking for these headphones sound
fidelity was great noise quality was
fantastic and overall they're just a
great pair of headphones you come to the
very long cords you have plenty of room
with of course a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack on the bottom the one complaint I
do have with the headphones these little
earbud things that attach to the top of
it they come with different sizes small
medium large and if you want to replace
them it's quite a hassle it takes a
little bit of finagling a little
know-how it order to get those on it
took me a good almost five minutes per
something to keep in mind
so overall guys I could really recommend
these headphones there's really not that
much to say about headphones other than
they sound great probably sound about
three to four times better than the
Apple in ear ones that they ship for
free with all iPods and iPhones
you know leader buds the white ones so
ubiquitous you see them everywhere these
are so much better and $39.99
actually a pretty reasonable price these
are now my de facto headsets I use them
everywhere I go of them flying or
running or walking around I'm always
kind of listening to music on the iPhone
so these I always carry with me and like
I said it guys for keep in mind that
they are completely organic so the folks
at radius also hooked everybody up with
a 10% discount so thank you that you
want I'll throw a link in the sidebar if
you want these headphones or want to
check out some of the other products
type in John for Lakers to check out and
get 10% off which is kind of cool if
you're interested in headphones and I
guys just want to give you a real quick
review an overview of me
atomic base radius headphones definitely
recommend it guys for not that much
money you really get and I think
probably five times that value I've
listened to three hundred four hundred
five hundred dollar
Sony noise canceling headphones and
certainly those cancel noise better but
as far as just sound fidelity I think
these are definitely on par with them so
definitely hats off to radius for put
together great products and I guys hope
you enjoyed for exclusive content you
should have follow me on twitter
twitter.com slash John for Lakers and I
will see you in the next video I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
