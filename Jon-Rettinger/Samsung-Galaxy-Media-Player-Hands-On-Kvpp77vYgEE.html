John rhett interpret TechnoBuffalo here
we're taking a first look at the Samsung
and Galaxy player it is a full
touchscreen Android media device so this
is not a phone try and run through the
specs with it quickly of this guy it's
got a very nice-looking definitely non
Super AMOLED or Super AMOLED plus
display it's four inches that WVGA
resolution
it's got Wireless of course you can see
a whole array of Android apps got full
access to the Android Market the
wireless is done with 802 11 BTN hand
it's fully optimized for voice over IP
you can see Skype right there you can
get your video chat on with the
front-facing camera right there or the
3.2 megapixel camera on
back on seven come into configuration
size-wise of either 8 or 16 and it looks
sort of Samsung's familiar TouchWiz
interface I'll emphasize here the screen
is definitely again not super amoled but
it's actually pretty nice I'll go ahead
and hit the home button and it's a
physical home button and go ahead and
push it in then you've got your menu and
back buttons so it's a go Android you've
seen this you know many times before you
seen Samsung's TouchWiz many times
before but this is a dedicated media
player so let's go ahead and take a look
at how media is gonna go up here on it
let's go ahead and jump into video so
you've got a video see if we can go back
and see it's a video player do look like
you've got your all your video libraries
gonna show up here go ahead and hit play
presumably it's gonna tie in with some
in Samsung's online downloadable media
options so the video player is nice
decent found a Blair inflection to it
but it definitely looks good you could
literally watch a music video a movie or
whatever it is or want to watch on your
device so I'll go ahead and exit out
and take a look at what the music player
is going to look like here it looks very
pretty samsung's done a nice job at
skinnier
so you can go ahead and open up the menu
here and go ahead and choose some
options for your sound rest go ahead and
go back see whales we have a go ahead
you list this is going to pull up all
your music oh it's very similar will be
seen and advice in the past I have an
Android device most litigated bilities
that you've been to see here on the
Galaxy player but if you are a regular
feature phone user and you want some
smart phone function on a smart phone
you want the multi touch browser and
service and and reaction they're gonna
get with the Android Marketplace this is
gonna be a decent device to check out I
will say audio fidelity in testing it
right here is actually pretty decent so
this is John rancor TechnoBuffalo the
first look at the Samsung Galaxy Player
I'll see you guys next video
what's up everyone john retinue
TechnoBuffalo here we're taking a first
look at the Samsung and Galaxy player it
is a full touchscreen Android media
device this is not a phone go ahead and
run through the specs really quickly of
this guy it's not a very nice-looking
definitely non Super AMOLED or Super
AMOLED plus display it's four inches
that WVGA
resolution Scott Wireless of course you
can see a whole array of andreas got
full access to the Android Market the
wireless is done with 802 11 B G and n
it's fully optimized for voice over IP
you can see Skype right there you can
get your video chat on with the
front-facing camera right there or the
3.2 megapixel camera on the back on
center come in two configurations
size-wise up near 8 or 16 and it looks
sort of Samsung's familiar TouchWiz
interface I'll emphasize here the screen
is definitely again not super amoled but
it's pretty nice I'll go ahead and hit
the home button it's a physical home
button and go ahead and push it in then
you've got your menu and back buttons so
it's a go Andrew you've seen this you
know many times before you seen
Samsung's TouchWiz many times before but
this is a dedicated media player let's
go ahead and take a look how media is
gonna go up here on it so I can jump
into video so you've got a B on C we can
go back it seems to be a player doing
but you've got your all your video
libraries going to show up here
and go ahead and hit play and presumably
isn't gonna time
songs online downloadable media options
so the video plays nice decent found of
glare inflection - but it definitely
looks good you could literally watch a
music video a movie or whatever it is
you're one to watch on your device
look go ahead and exit out
and take a look at what the music
players might look like here it looks
pretty pretty Samsung's done a nice job
at Cydia
so you can go ahead and open the menu
here go ahead and choose some options
for sound choices go ahead and go back
see what else we have
alright go ahead if you Alysa want to
pull up all your music oh it's very
similar we'll be seeing on android
device in the past if you have an
Android device mostly the capabilities
I've been to see here on the Galaxy
player but if you are a regular feature
phone user and you want some smart phone
function on a smart phone you want the
multi touch browser and service an
Android action you're going to get with
the Android Marketplace this is gonna be
a decent device to check out I will say
audio fidelity and testing it right here
is actually pretty decent so this is
John rank your peg no Buffalo to first
