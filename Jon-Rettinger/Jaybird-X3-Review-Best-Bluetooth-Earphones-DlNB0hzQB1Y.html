from TechnoBuffalo and I'm so excited
today because we have an awesome review
for you guys of the j-bird x3 wireless
earphones let's go ahead and get started
so the first thing you're going to
notice picking up these earphones and
the big credit I really want to give to
j-bird is you have a lot of options and
the build quality is amazing which are
two really big things when it comes to
your phone when you have options what I
mean is with the tips you have foam tips
you have gel tips you have the year fins
many many options so that you can get
the perfect fit for your year one thing
to note is that without the year fins
they didn't really stay in my years when
running so if you are going to use these
as work out your phones you should be
using the fins but that was just my
experience maybe you have different
years than I do and I got to say I like
it when my while your phones are
connected to each other it prevents me
from losing them which is just a problem
I seem to deal with on a regular basis
when using Bluetooth earbuds moving on
to some technical stuff you have six
millimeter drivers here in response to
bandwidth of 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz so
that's a pretty good response range not
something super flat but definitely good
enough for most listeners especially
with compressed streams like Spotify
Apple music Google play music but the
most impressive part about the listening
experience for me and what really
dictates the sound quality is Jaybirds
app and I give them a lot of credit here
I think it's a fantastic app the presets
and customization you can get with EQ is
going to allow you to get the exact
perfect type of sound profile you want
from these headphones again these are
not for audio files but these are more
than good enough for 90% of us out there
who are using these streaming services
to get music the custome cueing is going
to allow you to sort of optimize the
genre and style of music that you're
listening to having the flexibility
within the app is just such a luxury I
can't give jaybird enough props battery
life was pretty solid as advertised to
last about 8 hours so throughout the
span of a day of listening to music and
then turning them off and on and putting
them back on and off it'll get you
through about a whole workday without
too much of a problem and that brings me
onto one of my gripes with these
headphones the charging it has a little
dock with four pins that it connects to
via USB and to be honest I don't really
love this dock it takes too much
fiddling in my usage and very often I'm
sort of missing
pins and it just was too much of a
hassle the charger comes with a little
rubber tie attached to it which
sometimes gets in the way for me and
keeps the earphones from docking
properly so for a while there when it
kept getting in the way I thought my
headphones just weren't charging I
thought something was wrong it would
have been much better to see some sort
of MagSafe or magnetic charging dock
applied here and my last little
complaint is the pouch that it comes
with is a small leather pouch that has a
sort of stiff top that you can flex to
open it up and then like going a little
snap shut together I like this over
having a little rope so it's very well
designed but I don't understand why the
pouch is so small the pouch is really
only big enough to carry all the extra
ear tips and the extra year Finn but
it's not big enough to really put the
charger and the headphones in together
kind of jam it all in there and so those
are really my opinions on the J board x3
I think they're really really good
wireless headphones I love using them
for working out or just walking around
there's certain luxury that comes with
wireless earphones and I think Jaber
does it really really well if you liked
