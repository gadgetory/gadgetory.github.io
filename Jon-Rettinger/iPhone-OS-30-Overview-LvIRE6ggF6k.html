here and I want to give you just a short
overview of iPhone OS 3.0 currently
running on the iPhone 3G this is a free
upgrade for all iPhone owners original
iPhone and 3G and a $9.99 upgrade for
iPod Touch owners so let's get right
into it and show you the highlights of
the device and the highlights in the
operating system particularly the first
thing that I want to show you is the
landscape keyboard which for me is just
a dramatic update I was always a little
bit inaccurate with a portrait keyboard
but right now there's a landscape
keyboard available through all
applications this makes typing so much
easier and surprisingly more accurate
and while we're talking about typing in
text one of the highlights of OS 3.0 in
addition to this keyboard is now cut
copy and paste so let me show you how
that works let's say I want to copy that
bunch of gibberish I just typed if I
hold it down let go I'll get a select
select all or paste button so right now
we'll hit select and I get these two
blue bars and I can move it all along
and you see the magnifying glass shows
me what I'm highlighting let's say I
want to highlight it all now I've got
cut copy and paste so right now we will
copy it and let's say I wanted to paste
that into a new text message so I'll go
ahead and open up my messaging
application I'm gonna put my hand right
over the top here and we're gonna open
up a new one there we go and let's say I
want to paste that right in so I'll go
to text let go and I have that paste
button I hit paste and there it is and
that cut copy and paste will really work
on any text on the phone it'll work on
text and email it'll work on text in SMS
it'll work on text in your browser or
the anywhere you have a text you now can
cut copy and paste and Apple did a
really good job implementing this
throughout so while I'm here on the SMS
screen I should say that OS 3.0 is very
capable of MMS if you're watching this
in a country other than the US you will
be able to send MMS
right now which are multimedia messaging
so that's video messaging or picture
messaging but right now in Kinki does
not support that so unfortunately I
can't show you another thing I can't
show you that OS 3.0 supports is
tethering meaning using your phone as a
modem once again because 18 T's not
supporting it but they will later on in
the summer and if you're in another
country using the iPhone 3G or soon to
be the iPhone 3GS
you can take advantage of the tethering
so go back to the home screen here and
it looks very similar to really all the
other homes you're familiar with but
there is a big difference if I scroll
that over to the right I now have
Universal Search and you can see how
it's playing along here so let's show
you Universal Search it does essentially
this will search for contacts calendar
iTunes think of it as spotlight for your
iPhone so let's say I want to look up
contact information let's say I want to
look up Brandon Mini Mini as I start
typing you'll see Brandon's show up and
I get all of Brandon's information right
there I get his name and I keep going
anything with B I've got some emails
from Priceline just because it's got
that B R in it and it really does make
it nice and easy for searching go ahead
and hit close and it'll go right back to
it and if you want to launch it from
another screen hit the home button again
and it'll pull it up when you're there
you want to get rid of it push the home
button and it's gone so OS 3.0 will also
introduce some new built-in applications
namely voice memos and voice memos is
really simple you can probably tell what
it does just by looking at it it records
your voice to go ahead and hit record
you start talking lets you know you're
recording when you're done recording you
pushed up and you can view all of your
recordings it really is pretty simple
and relatively straightforward and as I
showed earlier there is a landscape
keyboard but really all the native
iPhone apps and the ones that come
bundled now support landscape and that's
highlighted by let's say the new stocks
application so you're a few stocks that
I have and
the old iPhone it was just pretty static
when he turned it landscape nothing
happened but now let me show you what
happens turn the landscape and you've
got your chart for your equity you can
go ahead and scroll through and you can
pretty much view your portfolio straight
through here
the landscape actually is very handy and
as you follow the chart you'll see it'll
tell you what the price was and the
corresponding day right there kinda neat
so we will go back to the home screen
there are a lot of tweaks to OS 3.0 that
I can show you but I really want to keep
this sort of a short highlight of what
OS 3.0 can do when the iPhone 3GS launch
isn't by the time you're watching this
and they have already launched there's
gonna be a lot of new functionality
built in such as built-in compass and a
few other features that the iPhone 3G
will not have but since this is a free
upgrade it is quite nice be able to have
the ability to do all of these little
things one other thing that I should
mention is I'm not gonna demonstrate
here if you now have the ability to
download TV shows and movies right on
your phone the I'll show you I'll show
you right there via iTunes on the device
you can see I just have a ton of
applications here and that again is one
of the nice things about the iPhone 3G
and really one of the final features
that I want to talk about is the YouTube
application you know I have the ability
to sign in and comment on YouTube videos
which is fantastic you can also write
them 1 2 3 4 or 5 stars
really is just a nice added feature I'll
show you what that looks like real
quickly I don't believe I'm signed in on
my iPhone but if you go to more you have
the ability to sign in so my videos in
my history I am signed in let's go ahead
and we'll take a look on the most viewed
videos real quick and we'll just pretend
that when you finished watching it we'll
head end and now you get a description
more videos by that particular producer
you get all the comments and if you hit
back again you're right back to
your homescreen that you saw previously
with older versions of the software
overall up in beta testing 3.0 for a
couple months now and it's been great
I've seen it get better and better with
each iteration of the beta software and
finally with the gold release it really
seems to be a very solid operating
system and one that I definitely
recommend you all get downloading if you
want to download it plug your iPod Touch
or iPhone into your computer go to
iTunes and hit update and you'll be good
to go
and one thing I also want to mention so
now I'm going to get a lot of questions
on it is what that little icon is right
there and that just indicates call
forwarding that's all and I just wanted
to give a short overview of iPhone OS
3.0 hope you enjoyed for exclusive
