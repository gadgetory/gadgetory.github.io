TechnoBuffalo Here I am unboxing the
first of its kind this is the iPhone 5c
the colorful brother to the iPhone 5s
we've got it obviously done here in blue
to go to open it up see how it does
alright so here is the box for the
iPhone 5c looking kind of iPod like
proudly displayed on top of this white
shell with some plastic covering it
iPhone 5c you've got 16 or 32 gig
options available we've got the 16 and
you can get in ton of bright colors
including the blue we have here green
pink white or yellow let's go ahead and
open it up it's like there's a tab here
to go ahead and pull plastic all the way
around it push all that off to the Sun
this should come right off and there is
the phone securely being secured in its
plastic push that off to the side for
just one second
hello iPhone let's see else you're going
to have inside we've got about your
iPhone 5c and some Apple stickers
nothing else are really exciting letting
us know it was designed by Apple in
California probably manufactured in
China
I've got your ear pod headphones
Wallwork same thing that we've seen on
the iPhone 5 or iPhone 5s and a
lightning cable so here is the iPhone 5c
it's actually the same specs as the
iPhone 5 save for a little better
front-facing FaceTime HD camera so let's
take it out of its plastic shell if I go
ahead and do this to be a minute to
figure that out and then I can pull it
out and I can come with me into its new
home also known as my hand so here is
the iPhone 5c I gotta say first
impression it feels really nice the
plastic feels very solid the phone's got
a nice weight to it
it doesn't feel like a cheap phone but
certainly it's not a cheap phone inspite
people thought it might be looking at
the same Retina display that we've got
on the iPhone 5 the iPhone 5s and of
course now the 5c is a 4-inch display
resolution of 1136 by 644 326 PPI iOS 7
obviously at launch being powered by a
sick chick I
yeah available in 16 or 32gb
configurations 8 megapixel camera on the
back single LED flash as I mentioned
that new fancy 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera weighs 4.65 ounces
or 132 grams 802 11 a B G and N no AC to
be found on this phone or the iPhone 5s
let's do our tour we've got two distinct
volume buttons up and down it's on sort
of one button with two different contact
points and you've got a profile switch
in the familiar location the left-hand
side so your SIM tray is going to live
up top power and lock and on bottom
lightning speaker microphone 3.5
millimeter headset jack let's go ahead
and bring in just real quickly for
comparison here is the iPhone 5s CU same
screen size big difference here touch ID
integrated to the home button not here
in the iPhone 5 but you have that little
sort of square and the home button that
we've known to love the cameras on the
back obviously are a little bit
different both megapixel edge and
quality-wise and of course the LED flash
you can see difference here between
space gray and the blue feels really
nice much nicer than I expected it to
feel all built so of course we'll have a
ton more content coming on the iPhone 5c
and obviously the 5s as well so be sure
