and technobuffalo here an apple just
wrapped up their spring forward event
what you thought was going to be all
about the Apple watch and it was but
also present was the revival of the
brand new MacBook and it's gotten thin
light it's got a couple cool new
features let's start with why we were
all here and that was what's gonna live
on your wrist the Apple watch so we've
gone through that you can do but I first
chance really get it on my wrist and try
it and I noticed a few interesting
things you guys might want to know I
decide whether or not you want to pick
one up so navigation is done relatively
simply through your finger through the
digital crown and through a regular
button which are used to when you use
the crown on a normal watch you use two
fingers to go and turn it to go where
you want to go I hear when you use two
fingers the tip of your finger actually
almost sits on top on the screen picking
up some that very precious real estate
so you're going to want to use it almost
just with one finger to do a very
gradual roll it works well and it works
pretty intuitively but you don't get any
sort of digital click as you go through
this for the menus it's a completely
seamless scroll took a little bit while
to get used to of once I did it became
relatively easy to do I tried to 38 and
the 41 there's sort of a feminine in a
masculine version oh there's different
sizes of the same watch I tried all
three versions will start with the
aluminum Apple watch sport I really like
the way the band felt it wasn't too
thick on my wrist I have normal sort of
risk thicknesses and of course you want
to see any of the hands-on videos that
we did let's link down below and go to
the main youtube channel or
technobuffalo calm to see all of that so
as you go and scroll through the apps on
your watch it's a very smooth experience
not jittery at all but you have a lot of
little circles they are trying to tap so
you can zoom in using that digital crown
or you can just try and select the right
app it's a bit difficult to do I found
myself missed selecting and having to
zoom in a lots instead of just tapping
like you would on a phone it some more
of a steps to go through it the screen
that looks absolutely gorgeous there
definitely are bezels to be seen there
but it's not giant and the black screen
the bezels kind of fade into the
background we saw a ton of apps support
as well it's kind of cool to sales
notifications pop up if you can get on
your phone you'll also get on your wrist
apps support from day one you got things
like Instagram built didn't show those
an uber app and they showed us some code
of other cool ways that you can
communicate using your watch if you've
got a friend that also has an Apple
watch
you can send them picture send your
heart rate and I'll know what you guys
are going to draw pictures of mushrooms
to your friends and of course you can
send all kinds of other things that you
want to draw we saw examples of that
from watch to watch and that works
really well if you want to step up from
the Apple watch sport you can go to the
steel just regular apple once we get a
ton of variety in band support and get
different metal options different
colored options and they all worked very
well and if you want to step up to just
sit extreme levels of the apple watch
edition starts at ten thousand dollars
out with 18 karat gold that can be
available to local apple store you got a
good special retailers to try it and see
if you want to pick one up but if you do
want to try like a regular apple watch
like you and I are might consider
picking up you can go to an apple store
to do that cell reservation system to
actually try on all different bands to
find the right one for you watches are
very personalized more just a phone so I
make sure you get the right watch right
size and right strap to suit you and if
that wasn't enough of an event apple
also unveiled a brand new MacBook and
this thing got super skinny we now have
a 12-inch MacBook in the apple line of
completely fanless it is as wide as the
keyboard apples claiming it's a
full-size keyboard I'll tell you a
secret not but it's close the width of
the computer is examples exactly the
size of the keyboard Apple made a lot of
talk about the mechanism the keys using
a butterfly mechanism and it works well
you've got less throw than you have on a
normal keyboard but it does feel nice
want an actual quickie clack pneus that
you get on a larger laptop getting even
want to try this in the store first
powering it is an intel core m processor
cuz it comes standard eight gigs of ram
or 256 gig solid-state you can up the
processor speed a little bit and also up
the storage of 512 but that's going to
get for right now it's also has a Retina
display and it looks really nice and
light in person at just two pounds it's
going to be available starting around 12
99 and both the max book and the apple
watch will be shipping in April the
macbook in early April and then the
Apple watch in later April and I think
