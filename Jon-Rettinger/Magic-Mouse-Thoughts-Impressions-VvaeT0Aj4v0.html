initial impressions an overview for you
of Apple's new multi touch magic mouse
there's no magic going on here just a
single multi-touch surface with a soul
click button frame gone is from last
generation are the two side pressure
buttons on the side of the outgoing
Mighty Mouse and everybody's favorite
little nipple ball that you could push
in and this thing you've ever used it
probably worked for a few weeks and then
got clogged with dirt and became almost
unusable so it's been a welcome change
to apple mouse fans that finally there's
something new but with the new also
comes the bed and magic mouse definitely
has some bad with it before we get to
that let's talk about some of the
positives it's got a novelty factor to
it scrolling up and down the web pages
with your finger like this is a kind of
fun i'm enjoying using the mouse
pointing is very accurate the single
click is very accurate you can
right-click just like you can any other
mouse just use your right finger it set
that up in the preferences but it works
and it works quite well I'm actually
finding myself more and more using the
two fingers swiping to go to and from
web pages instead of having a mouse up
to the arrow and hit it it's a very nice
feature infos you that use a macbook or
macbook pro if a glass trackpad probably
sort of a bug Valley that you were
familiar with those of us that have been
using physical mice on an imac or
something else it's a new change so down
to some of the negatives and things that
I don't like about the device well gone
like I said before are the two pressure
sensor buttons on the outside of the
mouse i sees that all the time for
activating expose and of course i can no
longer do that also on that little
nipple off if you push that and that was
also a button and i would use that to
hide the desktop and fortunately that's
gone as well so i went to apple and ask
them what they're telling people to do
how are you going to get around loss of
two functionalities on mls with really
no service and their response was use
hot corners and I've never used hot
corners before but essentially what that
means is you swipe your mouse up to one
of the quarters your mom
and it activates something so now I've
got mine set every time I swipe it up to
the upper right it activates expose my
spy for down to the bottom right it
shows desktop it's not nearly as elegant
and it's easy as it was on the Mighty
Mouse I definitely miss having those
buttons but I think that I'm going to
get used to it have you only had this
for just a little over a day and I'll
think it's fair to make a judgment call
on it quite yet but after you guys to
have the information so seeing as this
is shipping with all new imacs and new
imacs you support boot camp I'm going to
go out on the limb and say that the
drivers to support the magic mouse
actually are included on your install
cds that came with your computer so i
believe this will work with windows but
only if you have the proper drivers it's
a question I've been getting quite a bit
I would have go out and buy it just for
Windows but if you're using bootcamp on
your Mac certainly want to use your
original mouse you know go ahead you may
have limited functionality but at least
use it as a point device it's a little
bit low profile compared to the magic
mouse if you look so there's a big
difference there so it means me have
your wrist on it you have to sort of
lift your wrist up to do your clicking
and I'm not sure that's gonna become a
comfortable or not this time will tell
but something to keep in mind i'm not so
sure how organ our kiss is because it's
so low pro but i am enjoying it I'm
liking using it has a little bit of a
novelty on it that hasn't worked out yet
so i'll keep you guys posted let you
know what i think when i do a full
review in a few days are you guys going
to jump out and get the magic mouse is
it worth it for you are you excited to
get it with your new imac or you just
want to go out and pick one up sixty
nine bucks it's really going to come
down to you know what you like something
there are many more mics out there for
the same credits that do much more but
there aren't that many that have sort of
the apple style and that cool
multi-touch trackpad on the top which
actually works from top all the way down
to the bottom anyway guys this is jon
