TechnoBuffalo and I want you to say
hello to my little friend this is the
sony cybershot DSC TX 66 one of the
smallest digital cameras in existence
how did this wafer thin little rascal do
in my full review let's find out after
this awesome TechnoBuffalo intro
hello and welcome to my review of the
sony cybershot DSC TX 66 this thing is
one of the smallest digital cameras I've
ever reviewed Sony touts it as being
about as thick as a double-a battery
we'll just jump right into it with
design check it out next to an iPhone
it's a little thicker than an iPhone but
the iPhone towers over it now check it
out next to a stack of business cards
it's about the same size
how about Vincent van Gogh it's even
smaller than Vincent van Gogh I got one
more test here Don Mattingly Don
Mattingly golden globe-winning Don
Mattingly smaller than Don Mattingly the
TX 66 is very swanky because it has this
faceplate on the front that could be
shoved downward and it powers the camera
right on the other nice thing about the
TX 66 is that the back houses a 3.3 inch
o le d touchscreen capacitive
touchscreen LCD with a resolution that's
over a million pixels so this thing is
just really really refined beautiful the
only other external controls to speak of
there's an on/off button but you'll
never use that because you'll take
advantage of this nice sliding faceplate
action there's also a shutter button and
there's a small awkward rigid zoom
toggle which is not very great
another note is that this camera has a
very small battery pack so expect
limited battery life and it runs on
micro SD cards it records images and
videos to micro SD cards they're a pain
in the Kiester but with a camera this
small what do you expect
now perhaps one of the best things about
the cyber-shot TX 66 is its features the
technology of this camera far surpasses
most cameras in its price range and its
menus are far superior first off there
are two separate auto modes there's an
intelligent auto mode which recognizes
up to 36 scenes and then there's the
superior auto mode which actually takes
up to 6 images in different scene modes
and at different shooting parameters the
TX 66 also has a nice sweep panorama
mode however with Sony's you've got to
be careful
because if you don't pan fast enough it
won't record all of the image and
they'll get this black portion at the
end so you really have to twirl quickly
even though that's gonna make you dizzy
and you might fall off a cliff I was
really impressed with the scene
selection there are things like
backlight correction and HDR there's
night scene there's handheld twilight
there's pet the TX 66 has excellent auto
focus and it's blazingly fast face
recognition is awesome because the
prioritizes adults and children and the
TX 66 has one of the best playback modes
on any digital camera zooming in on an
image is so smooth you can also swipe
from side to side you can tap you can
drag and you can also apply effects and
fun filters in playback mode the menu
system and the touch screen sensitivity
is fantastic with the TX 66 this is what
a menu on a digital camera should be but
one of my favorite modes on this camera
was the picture effect mode now here you
could do things like HDR painting
illustration there was watercolor you
could do miniature as far as features go
the only hang-ups I had with the TX 66
is that it's a little bit slow
especially when you power the camera on
and sometimes rifling through menu
options it's a bit slow also some of the
scene modes are a bit gimmicky so you're
going to want to stick with auto or
program or if you want to do some
picture effects now while the design is
really nifty and the camera features
technology out the wazoo I wasn't that
crazy about the image quality but
there's a caveat here this camera has an
18 point 2 megapixel sensor those are
some big-ass pictures and obviously most
owners of this camera are not going to
be blowing up 18 point two megapixel
posters you're gonna be throwing
pictures on Facebook and Flickr and
things like that so that's why I think
Sony went with this giant pixel count
when you size these images down they
look really good especially on the O LED
screen they look amazing now the
cybershot DSC TX 66 has AVC HD video
1080 60 i that means interlaced it's
going to output as 30 P so while I would
have liked to have seen 60 p on this
camera the quality of the video is
pretty impressive you can also shoot in
mp4 as well the only downside to the
Tx 66 is that it's low-light performance
and video mode is really not great while
we're talking about low-light quality
with still images you're gonna have to
rely on the flash a lot and the high ISO
scene modes for night so overall image
quality with the TX 66 is good I've seen
better in this price range but because
of that big pixel count when you size
them down they're gonna look fine for
most shooters so what's the buffalo call
with this 18 megapixel stack of business
cards I really love this camera for its
diminutive size
I love the technologies involved in this
camera the menus are awesome it even
comes with a freaking stylus the image
quality is not the best at full
resolution but like I said most people
are going to be sizing these images down
to a fraction of what they are they're
gonna look fine I think the cyber-shot
TX 66 is going to be a very popular
camera if you could find a TX 55 from
last year you should be fine as well
because not much has changed for the
entire sony cybershot DSC TX 66 review
go to TechnoBuffalo comm I'm Mike
Pearlman and I'll see you guys later
blimey it's even smaller than
tinky-winky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
