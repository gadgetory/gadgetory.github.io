TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor and chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton hey
everybody are you doing today Todd I'm
good yeah someday people are going to go
g to not talk before the show how do you
not know how he's doing now it's just
you know it's it's a nicety formalities
yeah formalities exactly so yes it is a
the quiet time of the year we're in the
holidays and leading up to CES which
means companies are not announcing
anything yeah just dead really dead yes
a tumbleweed blew through my office
earlier kind of sad you know but uh
there are a couple things we can discuss
a cursor there's some I don't know if
you've heard of it some little movie I
think was done independently Star Wars
the farce I I run about that somewhere
somewhere I don't know I and supposedly
it's doing okay at the theaters I mean
oh it's making a little bit of money
yeah it was like an indie film right
yeah I was an indie film which a lot of
people don't realize actually their
original Star Wars was an indie film was
it really yes that's pretty funny yes it
was picked up for distribution by 20th
century fox but it was an indie film
that's amazing I didn't know that good
it a lead yeah it's the most successful
indie film ever um but no of course
we're talking about star wars the force
awakens which came out last week has
continued to break box office records
just before the show started I looked up
the Tuesday box office numbers it's at
the highest Tuesday ever and it also
crossed 300 million domestic in only
five days which is a new record the old
record was Jurassic world from the
summer with eight days so it's doing
unbelievable box office and now what's
the record that avatar holds again
what's what's that that is worldwide
global all-time 2.78 billion oh it's an
all-time record that's an all-time
record that's the record everyone and
such from the halls and the questions
already asked
about that you know can star wars the
force awakens beat avatar the whole
thing people need to remember about
avatar is that it was built upon repeat
viewings it was also the fact that it
was unlike anything we had seen before
you know it really was the launch of the
new 3d movement right you know it was
really the first use of motion capture I
mean there had been motion capture but
he really took it up to a new level all
that being said I hate that movie I
really do not like that movie I thought
it was like entertaining but you know it
up you know as well I guess it's one
I've never thought about again so yeah
well go watch Dances with Wolves then
watch avatar and go hey look it's the
same movie really it's almost beat for
beat the same movie wow that's bad yeah
it's really and there had been other
movies that done the same story over the
years it's kind of amazing but um we'll
see I mean all that being said you know
I'm thinking about going back and saying
Star Wars again and I haven't done
multiple viewings in a theater in years
but you know it for everyone's knowledge
yes I have seen I once on Monday night
todd has not seen it yet nope yeah
because Todd yo wants to be all yo I'm
not going with the crowd uh no I
probably would but um you know the
theaters are crowd and stuff honestly oh
yeah and that's why I wait till Monday
night I mean everyone was amazed that I
did not go opening night but I was just
like look I want to be able to sit there
and actually enjoy it yeah I don't want
yo beer and in the middle yeah exactly
as it was is I I got sure this little
story about my my little town theater we
do have an eight Plex it opened I think
around two thousand or so so I got there
early enough to you know get the back
row which I always want the back row so
i can see as much of the screen as
possible and there was a group of two
seats by themselves right in the middle
and like yes so I go and sit down the
first one I almost sink to the floor the
seats so busted Mike oh great so I moved
to the sea
the left that one no problem it's going
to see me fine except half the left arm
is gone because people have torn off
it's like a like movie Peter I know man
i know and you feet are sticking to the
floor I know and in my town this is the
only theater so what choice do you have
but yes I've seen it yes I wrote it up
on I I don't usually like promoting my
own personal site but if you want to see
you know all my thoughts you can go Sean
piane calm and I wrote up all my
personal thoughts on it there but all
that being said it you know such a ball
is asking to live up to my expectations
I really i think i have i have to see it
multiple times before i can really say
that i'll say this i mean it definitely
was not the Phantom Menace um which you
loved as much as I defend the prequels
even I can't defend the fan of me nobody
can defend the Phantom Menace I'm sorry
you just can't um but as it stands right
now it's in my top three star wars films
for sure I I was really pleasantly
surprised by the amount of humor in that
all the humor worked which is not I mean
yes there's always been some humor in
the Star Wars films but this one had
some truly laugh out loud moments I was
like okay that's new and I'm fine with
it yes my question that i've had that I
had a problem with and I think I guess
it was the three newer ones where I just
sort of like felt like I was just
sitting there almost like Lord of the
Rings just like ok did you ever have
that kind of experience or was it more
like the first three where there was
always something sort of going on it
wasn't just sort of chatter among you
know what seemed like diplomats and
stuff like that there was always
something going on see that I think I
would like that a lot better and there
was maybe like one shatter scene and but
it's like this long it really needed to
happen okay yeah yeah it was a i won't i
won't say what it was about but yeah it
was an essential scene 2
setting up what's going to come and
that's that's one thing I've seen a lot
of people saying you know oh they didn't
explain this and they didn't explain
that and you know how could they not do
it'll explain that most stories are
built on a three-act structure this is
the first of three acts right yes the
force awakens has 3x within it but the
force awakens is the first part of new
trilogy so that's like saying I want you
to give me a book in three parts but I
want to know everything in part one of
the book and part two and three are then
what right right like you have to leave
it sort of open-ended and stuff and
build that story arc right exactly you
know and that's what they're doing they
set up a lot of stuff that's going to
continue in two episodes eight and nine
you know so it's just that folks calm
down hey now i will say this there were
a lot of times where Lucas premises
things that never explained it you know
he promised us for ages before the
prequels came out you know I'm going to
explain force ghosts you never explained
force ghosts never explained why some
Jedi became force ghost some didn't you
know you got a little brief thing about
Yoda had been talking with qui gonn you
know and that was it as great a
midi-chlorians were mentioned that never
mentioned again you know so yes there
are some people out there I mean yeah
that was Lucas though this is Disney who
Disney's going we spent over four
billion dollars on those we got to make
this good right right yeah but president
I'll get to your question I just read it
I yeah well I mean normally we save
questions for them but i'll go ahead and
jump to the so brazen Franco asked
wasn't really amazed by Star Wars was
kind of disappointed actually not trying
to spoil and does this mean that that's
certain someone without training is
better than Anakim i'm going to assume
you're meaning the one who wins the
fight and i'm going to say that i think
we're going to learn there's a lot more
are going on there a lot more going on
so hey I just here let me communicate in
hand signals and hope but I I get that
some people were at this point I think a
lot of people went in just like I went
into the prequels with super high
expectations the problem there was that
you know we had been since 1977 there
had been this mention of you know you
fought beside my father in the Clone
Wars and every kid that I would you know
I was six when it came out yo and at
school we were all talking about well
worth the Clone Wars what were the clone
wars and we all came up with their own
little theories of what the clone wars
were and what they meant and so we had
years and years I me by the time episode
one came out we had had 22 years to
think about what the clone wars were we
we were kind of our own worst enemies
going into the prequels and then he
delivered the phantom menace and well he
was his own worst enemy at that point
but you know so I I'm very hopeful for
you know this trilogy I think I had a
good start we'll see where it goes I
mean I as i said in my own personal
review you know there's absolutely
nothing I can say at this point that
will stop anyone from seeing this movie
I I could tell you that you know I I
think the movie gave me cancer and
people would still be going to see this
movie yeah you know a more power to
everyone I I hope everyone enjoys it i
think you know and again i hate keep
bringing this up I as I explained in my
own review that I have a very very deep
connection to start wars I you know I
saw it in 1977 in the theater I without
question know that it set me on some of
the things that have happened in my life
you know it sent me on the course of
becoming a complete geek and you know
becoming a toy journalist for many years
and you know it led to me having a comic
book store for 15 years you know it star
wars without doubt shaped my life in a
lot of ways so I have a very very
different connection with Star Wars than
a lot of people
so if people are disappointed by it hey
it's movie you know it's going to appeal
to different people right but we will
come back to a lot of these questions
during the Q&amp;amp;A section it the other
topic we wanted to touch on this week
was of course apparently apples going to
be doing something in March well March
or April depending on where you're
looking but I know the it's rumors folks
yeah it's um I guess what we'll call it
the 4-inch iphone it's it's funny all
these sites like or people close to the
supply chain etc etc are saying you know
either iphone 6c which i think makes the
most sense or yesterday it was called
the iphone 7 c which doesn't make sense
me but yesterday i groomed oh man so
i'll just go over the rumor real quick
for people that aren't familiar
yesterday's rumor sort of like china
mobile leaked its carrier in china a
leak slide sort of like with its roadmap
this is the same slide that a day before
on monday reference the galaxy s7 for
march release so now this one is saying
it said i think it was in chinese so
like i can't read it but it was iphone 7
see April and that's sort of basically
it right so that's like the four-inch
iphone that has been referenced by lots
of people they expected to sort of have
the same body as the iphone 5s touch ID
sort of but with upgrades internal so
hopefully a nine processor that you have
in the iphone 6s and 6s plus so
basically just like this 4-inch phone
that's hopefully a little a little bit
more affordable that was I think the
goal of Apple but also appealing to the
people that want the smaller phones who
still forever reason think the success
is too big um so a couple interesting
things about that that I'm kind of
curious to see is a that the iphone 6s
battery life is not great right and
that's already kind of a small phone so
I mean they just released that battery
pack so how do they fix that and be like
our there's still that many people who
think that the 5s is too or the 6s is
too big like for me I'm
I'm kind of used to that size now like
it feels about right then the other
thing I want to talk about briefly in
the rumor was the naming where you know
the 7c i said this in the post it makes
more sense to me that it would be the 60
because we have the word or just six
mini or success money or something but
because we already have the success plus
in the success and then the sevens not
going to be something we're going to see
until September so why would they start
the seven moniker you know I ever in
April this there's absolutely no way
they're gonna starts a seven moniker
before the seven and 7's there just is
no way yeah so that's why that's the
hard thing though because this slide the
the dates for the galaxy s7 in March
like that makes a lot of sense because
you have galaxy s6 typically in the
galaxy s series in general just sort of
unveiled in the world congress in either
late februari early March it you know
March is probably pretty much locked in
for me for the galaxy s7 link I very
much see that happening and so I kind of
trusted the the China Mobile slide and
then it also then references the new
iphone and so piling all those rumors
together it makes a lot of sense that
maybe Apple really is the first time
going to introduce another phone sort of
mid-year for them but i also have a hard
time i'm also i'm also curious that
maybe china mobile because i don't know
the context of this slide could be
predicting the same way that everybody
else is right like going off of analyst
reports and saying well it seems about
right if these analysts are true that
that's when it's going to launch so
we're gonna put it in this slider than
all of a sudden now you know going from
china to here to whatever it's just take
out of context no and it's merely just a
prediction and not going to happen so i
don't know but it seems pretty plausible
at this point i mean there's so many
people that have referenced this device
then i have to wonder anyway why would
it exists if it's not going to happen in
some form well even not so much speaking
to that china mobile slide you know
we've also heard the rumors of an ipad
air three March and I exactly sorry i
know i really i'm not sure how
I can believe that I mean would Apple
first off yo we know they're trying to
get the ipad pro in two more hands but
would they launched a major tablet
upgrade in that point in the cycle to
the holiday sales that's where I'm
getting confused on that one I'm
certainly confused too like why wouldn't
you have had it out now or you know I
don't know maybe because they're worried
about it cannibalizing sales of the you
know the earlier iPads like the ipad air
2 which i still if I was going to buy an
ipad today just based on the price I
would still go with the ipad air 2 I
mean to me this is getting in there like
a whole nother conversation but the ipad
pro at its price point just doesn't make
any sense once you add that keyboard
stuff like I just can't figure out why
you would spend that much vs I don't a
macbook air or macbook or whatever I
mean a macbook air I guess you're losing
the retina display but you have a lot
more power I mean you're moving into
core i3 i5 and i7 processors so I don't
know but the air three then you have to
figure you're like what are the upgrades
for that I imagine the e9x processor
that's in the ipad pro so you know if
that had that if it had that process
area would it seems to me sort of
cannibalized sales of the lower price
point of the ipad pro and maybe that's
why it's not out for the holiday season
but i don't know yeah I i don't know i
just i don't know if it really felt to
me like Apple was going to take a whole
year off on the iPad error and that we
would see something next holiday season
I just don't I all of a sudden
everyone's pinning a whole lot of hopes
on march you know because you know we've
also heard Apple watch to as the
possibility you know and I such a
Bohol's asking you know do you think
we'll see the ipad or not the ipad I'm
sorry the Apple watch to in 2016 2017 I
definitely think we'll see it in 2016 I
think so too and I think wasn't marched
last year when they announced the first
one thing it was around there hey I
honestly can't remember when it was
first announced yeah so I i would say
more than likely that the
of all the devices we've heard rumor
died I do believe the Apple watch
chooses the most likely I would say the
iphone 6c not 7c is the second most
likely and I would put the biggest
question mark next to the ipad air three
yeah you know now of course you know we
are coming up on CES which means apples
got to say something about something
during that week I'm i know i don't i
feel like apple yeah i know that happens
but i feel like they also just sort of
like there were whatever cesi I don't
feel like to Apple the competition's
there any more like what's at CES that
they have to worry about like tabloids
aren't it's not a big show for tablets
not a big show for phones it's not even
really that big of a show for computers
anymore so it's more like smart home
stuff that actually supports you know I
bet we're gonna see a lot of stuff that
has home kid integration stuff like that
so i don't know if it's gonna you know
do something during CES but my world
congress where we've sort of seen around
it i don't think i think last year was
the year that it actually didn't make an
announcement during mobile cottage but i
forget and i think it was right around
it like maybe shortly after so well i am
I do you know every year that I've been
going to see us which this is gonna be
my 6 i've kept saying this is the air
smart homes gonna take off and i never
really materialized ease it kisses mine
OAS degrees yeah okay so she doesn't eat
I don't remember them oh good good grief
so but yesterday yo we ran that story
about webos three for the LG televisions
and the idea you know that now your
television could become a notification
centre from your smart home devices you
know and the example given was like you
a message pops up that your wash load is
done right I think that is a really
interesting new aspect too smart homes
now I think you've got a good point i
think maybe apple will be trying to push
home kit more because it does seem like
smart homes are finally coming at us
fine here
it's just taking forever and I of course
right now the cost is also extremely
high I mean my house was built in the
80s you know if I want I I barely can
run ethernet cables through it hey oh so
the idea of trying to retrofit it for
smart home is a daunting one to be sure
but moving forward with new home
construction and apartment construction
and all that yeah I think we're going to
start seeing more and more home stuff so
maybe that will be apple's foray into co
co or announcement during CS like hey
everyone's taking on home kit you know I
or I or you'll just see sort of Apple
don't doesn't have to do anything just
like these companies will probably like
oh and it supports a blanket and yeah
that's how we'll sort of it there but
not really okay it must be nice to be
Apple not have to show up to things yeah
hold your own show yeah I know it's
always amazing but it's going to be
interesting i'm sure we'll hear more
about the potential march or april
announcement as we draw closer and
closer yeah i mean we still have to see
you know there was that rumor the other
day which i still it was a 60 minutes
leaked or you know was that a new laptop
on 60 minutes y le I I right away I was
like that looks like a space grey
macbook to me that's how we wrote the
post but that there were people out
there on other sites and stuff that
thought it looked like a brand new
computer so possibly that just brings up
the topic that you know possibly this
spring is the macbook air with retina
unless Apple just sort of replaces it
goes back to macbook and macbook pro and
just upgrades the macbook from the core
m processor 2 cor I which I think needs
to happen but the benefit of the core m
was that it it's fanless but we'll see
yeah I don't know macbook air definitely
needs a refresh the display compared to
everything else is just it's kind of
blurry to look at I guess when you go
back to it yeah I know that I agree with
okay so let's go ahead and jump into the
questions we have a bunch of them here
is we're wrapping up 2015 from such and
Bohol is the Moto 360 2015 worth getting
um I actually haven't used it neither I
i I'm sorry special someone I saw it
like when I was announced that I haven't
used it does it tell time yeah my thing
is um I just actually I'm not wearing a
SmartWatch at all right now and I
usually have the Apple watch three go
you're still pebble I Android wear is
okay and then I just I get annoyed with
it like the notifications to me or just
kind of useless same with seen with
Apple watch though it's not that so it's
just both I guess I'm just not really on
board with either of them Jeff ki did
you see your question about the ipad pro
could you provide some clarification on
it I'm a little confused by which mean
um let's see here so jumping on down
we've got a lot of questions coming in
here to do we answered that one already
22 sue just a moment from such a ball
should I wait until after the holidays
to get a spear obviate do you think it
will come down price in a couple of
months um I don't think is it doesn't
strike me as the type of product that
will get a price cut I think you'll just
have to find a sale um yeah those fears
are always expensive right yeah there
always are but I also think that it's
you know it's been one of the hottest
products for the Christmas season I
don't think it's going to come down for
quite a while I mean kind of like I why
I do I dare admit those yes I have a
large collection of the fancy metal
light up light sabers yeah so I don't
have kylo Ren's yet and by golly I can't
find 1a you know list price at the
moment so I'm waiting
until the the fervor dies down before I
pick up my kylo Ren saber but uh nice so
they make like high-end lightsabers
uh-huh okay I'll show you I'll show you
one after the show they're here my
office I think that's pretty cool I I
don't dare light it up during the show
because everyone listening to the audio
version would go ah oh yes I'm a giant
nerd in I admit it and proud of it Oh
see here from Matt music why doesn't say
gen mod make a version for 1 plus X oh I
think there's a lot of reasons yeah i'm
not sure what the answer to that is
except for it sounds like their
partnership was kind of uh died out yeah
I think they just I I think part of the
problem would be that if they did make a
version it would almost seem like an
endorsement of 1 plus and well they did
the original yeah for the original but I
think if they do it now after the
partnership ended I think it would come
across as like an endorsement and I I
get the feeling this is pure speculation
folks pure speculation that that
relationship did not end well yeah I got
that feeling too that's why I was
calling and at end of the day I think
one plus was trying to say look we want
to get the software updates out there
quicker than side engine auditor sign
she was getting them so I think that's
why they stuck to their own software
this time ok ok so what Jeff k was
saying was he said that the the the
computer or whatever it was in the 60
minutes video looked to him to be like
an iPad pro with a keyboard that we had
not seen yet and he was wondering if we
thought they did that on purpose I think
apple is a canoe whatever that item was
believe me Apple was well aware it was
sitting there yeah I don't know yeah it
was either it was either a prototype
week on purpose and then they're gonna
make a joke about it like
you know because that's how the new
Apple seems to me like when they're
joking around you know but i honestly
think and I think that's just you know
going a little too far i honestly think
it was just a space grey macbook yeah
just a different angle than you know hey
believe me eh I have a feeling that
anytime apples got filming going on in
their offices i am sure there is a team
of people that come in and scan that
room with their eyes oh yeah going is
why is that there why is that there that
needs to be put away you know just like
when they went into jony ive's lab and
you know and there were tables covered
with grey sheets right absolutely they
were well aware of what was in the shins
yeah without question the only thing
like and I said again i firmly believe
it as a macbook the only thing i could
see is like say the unveil the new
macbook air with retina display or
whatever in march or something and
they're like remember this like as a
joke and it had been in the background
but i just don't see it happening i
think it was just a macbook no I I tend
to agree uh from session be hall first
of all do you guys like the Beatles also
what do you guys think of the Beatles
music coming to streaming music services
at midnight also known as December 24th
let me share a really quick funny story
for my recent trip to England so I took
the train from manchester to Liverpool
to go visit you've seen the pictures
Todd the the Tudor house had a place
called speak hall so I go to this very
little train station and because it's
the closest to speak all I call for a
cab cab comes gets me he's like oh where
am I taking I go speak hall as we're
driving out of the train station not a
word has been said about the Beatles not
a word but I am in Liverpool their their
home city and we get to the exit for the
parking lot and we're about to turn onto
the road egos yeah Paul McCartney and
John Lennon lived right over there it's
only a few minutes well I like that's
awesome why did I need to know that
I didn't say the last part of my head I
like is that all you people could talk
about maybe figure to the extra Ferris I
know I fast I think that but he and I
had a very very pleasant drive to speak
all I was explained to him how we pay
for for football stadiums and baseball
stadiums here in the States compared to
how they do it and he was explained to
me that if they ever tried to pass a tax
to pay for a stadium that there would be
riots and so we actually had a very very
pleasant drive but I was just like I
have not said a word about the Beatles I
do I I personally look I respect what
the Beatles did for music their music to
me isn't is enjoyable but I don't go
bonkers for them I like them but yeah
the same way yeah I'm I I respect their
their place in music history without
question but they're just not a hundred
percent my taste but now saying that
coming to the streaming services that's
awesome i think tomorrow music that's on
streaming services the better yeah i
love how it's all of them at wants to is
exactly yeah an exclusive somewhere for
you know yeah remember when uh when
steve jobs got so excited they were
finally gonna be able to sell Beatles
music yeah yeah itunes yeah that was
crazy but ya know it's great I more
music on streaming services the better I
actually I had a talk with an old friend
the other day via text and he was
telling me about how many CDs he
currently owns I'm like why in the yes I
know you know there's compression and
all that sort of stuff but really if you
want to listen to a bunch of music
either mp3s or streaming whatever well I
I crowd your life anymore with CDs I
mean I used to have thousands of cds
I've sold them all yeah it's just too
much of a pain link put a CD and you
listen to this on you
oh but I want to listen that one the NIA
take it out go find the other one when I
was in high school ideo and my my big
cruise on the weekends phase I had a
past days I had an ad cassette tape case
I carried with me whoa yeah I had 80
cassette tapes with me every weekend
around every week it was like oh do I
take that one with me ooh that's a lot
of tapes to carry around yeah no
actually it said on the I had a bench
front see it say on the front seat in
between the two see place yeah all those
almost always Guns and Roses Appetite
for Destruction on the tape deck so I
don't know why anything else with me I I
went through three copies of that
cassette really oh yeah I I was really
into that album listen to that for the
show uh you can skip most upside to
anyone moving on so I speaking of music
services such a bahal asked what music
streaming services are you guys
subscribe to we've gone over this before
I I'm the oddball now I'm only subscribe
to pandora because I like to explore for
music otherwise I primarily have
everything on mp3 and just listen to you
know whatever i'm in the mood for Todd
however on the other hand yeah I have
too many music streaming services i'm
actually on google play music now so I
can play Appetite for Destruction next
which I realize I know most all of these
songs anyway but i'll listen to them in
order oh i also have this let's google
play music i also have spotify apple
music and I don't pay for whatever
Microsoft's is true these days anymore
and then I actually do use pandora I
just I don't pay for it like you do yeah
I I just don't want to listen to
commercials but yeah i don't know why i
have three it doesn't make any sense but
you know there's no there's things that
like to bother me about one that I
like about the other so yesterday for
example like um like I was just messing
around with some Elvis and I don't know
like a lot of old elvet I mean I don't
know like a lot of unpopular Elvis so I
was just looking for like his greatest
hits or something and that exists in
Apple music and google play music but
not on Spotify and most of the time I'd
say ninety percent of time I want
Spotify but then when there's something
like that I'm like okay I got to go to
something else and switch it off him uh
from just not worth the additional money
but I'm doing from Jeff k we already
answered the first part of his question
about which which music streaming
services but he asked have you seen the
latest Apple iPhone video leaked looks
similar to the back of the leaked Moto X
coming out this next year with its metal
flat back finish I assume you're talking
about the video that came out yesterday
which we're calling bogus too yeah I
just couldn't buy that I just couldn't
yes we ran it and I think you explained
it well in the post it was like it the
fact that the supervisor air called
supervisor yells hey yeah it would the
supervisor have not grabbed the guy's
phone deleted the video absolutely like
that guy would be in a river somewhere
yeah I mean there's no way that real
there's no way I don't know what I did
it was convincing like it looked like
the foxconn logo kind of like a period
on the shirt and like I don't know but
like I know that that's crazy like Fox
coming too aren't those factor like I'm
pretty sure it's like a campus like can
you imagine the risk you'd be going
through filming that like I know yeah I
did whatever yeah yeah oh good grief i I
just whatever uh from such a baja are
you guys more excited for episode 89 or
the Star Wars story films IE console
about fed origin films in rogue one well
I i would assume this is more me yeah I
am
really super excited for rogue one
because that is the type of story I've
been looking for since the original star
wars in 77 when they once they got to
the oven for base and we saw all the
troops there and then during the medal
ceremony you saw the troops lined up I
even at six years old I want to know the
stories of your average everyday rebel
and that's kind of what rogue one's
going to be uh Han stay up real rebel
housewives yeah Real Housewives of Yavin
4 my husband they seized an x-wing pilot
but I'm the one that flies this ship I
cannot believe I just thought that off
the top of my head anyway wow I have
never watched it up so drill has was I
either I just however i watch the parody
show on hulu the Real Housewives were
Ledo the Real Housewives of Las Vegas Oh
Perry's yeah those are parodies they're
hilarious the Han Solo origin film
concerns me greatly because you're
you're doing something with potentially
one of the most iconic characters in
cinematic history yes so that is going
to be really really risky how they
handle that that being said I would love
to see the story of Han and Chewie
meeting each other yes we we've heard
rumors and speculation on how they met
for years and that there was stuff and
they expand universe but all that's been
thrown out with the last cannon reset so
they really can go anywhere with it Boba
Fett origin story ok this is this is
where people are going to wonder what
exactly I'm on I've never been that
fascinated by Boba Fett has a lot of
other people I think he served a purpose
yes his armor was cool I never said I
ran go and wow I really want to know
more about boba fett yeah it just never
did much for me I am super excited for
episode 89 so i would say in my order
he'd go rogue 189 han Solo Boba Fett
yes I just ranked movies that don't even
exist yet two thumbs up uh from Jeff k
are you saying foxconn kills their
employees no nothing else documented
they kill themselves that is that is
documented that there are suicides you
know I although we haven't heard that in
quite a while so hopefully that was a
anomaly um let's see here from also from
jeff k awesome Todd are you guys going
to cover the development of the video
app services working on for stern shows
I knew they were doing something with
Stern shows I didn't know it was going
to be a nap yeah me neither off to look
into that thanks we will look into that
Jeff I don't know why I suspect he's a
stern fan maybe it's his icon yay uh
moving on down the road from such an
Mahal what is the number one tech tip
for this holiday you know I really don't
think there was one be all end all this
year yeah well were you saying you
thought the Sphero would be well I know
and this girl has done well but seek to
me I I count that is more on why yeah I
to me he's more of a toy than a tech
gift but I mean if you're speaking
traditional tech you'll be it tablets
phones computers and all that I really
haven't heard of anything being the hot
gift this year yeah it's like I mean
it's like we talked about time but like
sales numbers of tablets you know like
those are kind of wanted to climb
because people don't need new ones that
much so like I feel like tablets aren't
hot I mean I'm sure they'll sell ball
but I feel like it's not like Oh
everybody's getting a tablet this
Christmas and then you know like there
aren't what's the new major phones I
mean there's been a couple you got the
v10 the Lumia 950 1 plus X and stuff
like that but if you like those aren't
you know gonna fly off shelves for
Christmas so I'm not sure what's like
what's gonna be I wonder if it's things
like
amazon echo and stuff like that which I
love and I I feel like that's one of
those things where it's kind of
expensive and you're like I don't really
want to buy it but I don't mind asking
for it someone else buys it so I wonder
if that's going to be a popular holiday
gift Wow right I just looked over at the
clock I cannot believe how time has
flown by here let's blow through a
couple more questions real quick from
Jeff k why doesn't anyone sit in on the
videos I like watching you two just
curious as to why we don't see anyone
else contribute I'd love to see what joy
has to say I mainly it's because choice
has nothing yeah we're just sits there
and Reuters one you'd be great for the
show the whole problem is of course the
end of the show and I'm getting a phone
call the whole problem is with time
differences because I'm in central time
Todd's and Eastern those guys are in
Pacific's you know so right now they're
just getting into the office well
they've been in for 40 minutes so we'd
have to move the show so much later in
the day we actually when we set the show
up we did have the idea of rotating
house but it's just been a time issue
you know maybe at some point we will
move the show a little bit later so I
can rotate in Roy and John and you know
whoever else wants to sit in but it is
not that uh Todd and I just want to
dominate the show but it's just
unfortunately we have the best time
zones yeah Eastern sort of rule uh from
met music uh your subscribe to all those
why not deezer I've actually not heard
of Deezer Deezer I just I subscribe to
the main ones and I don't even know why
i've subscribed to this many so it's
sort of like i need to cut back not look
for more hey oh why not uh yeah come on
Todd one more what morning I mean I had
one of these mornings days I just got to
switch to I guess I'm waiting for like a
Spotify family plan that makes sense but
uh yeah I probably switch like my wife
and I to one of them and stick with it
super geeky question here from Branson
Franco I always wondered could the
commandos resist order 66 I just can't
imagine that
elsa squad attempting to kill OB if you
watch the clone wars cartoon there was
an episode where one of the commandos
figured out the the chip that was in
their head that would have forced them
to do order 66 and he removed it some of
them were able to resist as we've seen
in rebels but the vast majority could
not resist it because it was hardwired
into their brains and there are people
going right now but he just speak
English just did they over my head uh
from jeff k what did you guys get your
others for christmas well since i'm
completely single still are they I
didn't do tech gifts for people i don't
usually it i don't usually get them for
myself um how did i get people like
clothes and stuff shoes I'll sue your
boring yeah okay I mean from wife like
all the tech that we have in the Hat she
take like for her phone she takes my
hand me downs like she has my iphone 6
plus right now and then the rest of the
house is stuff i buy so it's not like a
tech gift with you dads well i mean my
family and I are kinda like honestly
what we do any more Christmases we say
what one project are you dying to get
done oh yeah we have enough stuff in our
lives so you know it's like I I think
this weekend I think I've got to build a
kitchen table nice enough fun actually
no no it's really not it's from Ikea

it together I thought you're gonna cut
the wooden stone owe no duty nursing now
