from TechnoBuffalo here I'm gonna
unboxing for you of the Samsung Galaxy
mega 6.3 there aren't that many phones
that come through our desks and I'm just
grinning from ear to ear to take a look
at just from sheer curiosity this is a
six point three inch phone let's go
ahead dig in and see what it looks like
have you ever looked at the 5.5 inch
Galaxy Note 2 Optimus G pro and just
thought you know what this phone is too
small if that is you I've got your
answer this is the 6.3 inch Samsung
Galaxy mega phone
it really is stretching the borders
behind what qualifies a phone a tablet
or even a phablet and I'm super excited
to take a look at it I love giant phones
but I'm not sure this guy is gonna be
too big or not I have not seen this yet
in person so I'm kind of giddy to take a
look at it
our friends at Negri electronics with us
up with this guy check them out for all
your electronic phones needs actually I
know the owner Ryan Negri is a friend of
mine who lives like 10 minutes away so I
can vouch for them for all of your
unlocked phones so give them a check out
Negri electronics calm let's go ahead
and open this sucker up do a little that
action will do some of that action
and even because I'm feeling spry we'll
do a little bit actually
and we'll peel off the plastic I still
end up working it so the same box what
we saw with the Galaxy Note 4 is sort of
fake wood grain there picture the device
in the front in Spanish oh that is a
giant phone and nice of them but the
spectators I don't have to remember that
oh I thought people looked at me funny
when I use the Galaxy Note 2 out in
public I am really dying to see what
people think when I bust this sucker out
to make a phone call I'm going to be
grudgingly put off to the side for a
quick second then I will try and pick
that sucker up and we'll run through the
round well it's got in it so what are
you gonna have in the box we're gonna
have some guides and that kind of stuff
but that's blah we're going to have an
adapter that's kind of nice and a micro
SD card 2 4 gig card I'll run through
all the specs but there's 8 gigs of
storage in the model I have 16 gig
models also available
we've got headphones with volume control
and inline
Mike we've got a charging cable nothing
exciting here it's a microUSB I got some
ear gels we got a wall wart and we got
the battery looking at this battery
you'd be like wow that's gigantic John
that must be a five thousand milliamp
hour battery if you said that you'd be
wrong it's only 3200 milliamp hours so
let's take a look at this behemoth of a
phone you guys can't see if I've got a
ridiculous smile on my face looking at
this thing so it does have support for
LTE but not in the US yet that models
not here this is HSPA+ Android 4.2 at
launch it's an HD TFT screen I one point
second three right here a 1.7 gigahertz
a dual core processor 1.5 gigs ramped
and that quite - again there's
expandable storage our model is 8 gig
you can get that to 16 it's got an 8
megapixel I looks like everything on
this phone just looks like comically
large a megapixel sensor on the back and
turns an odd megapixel Ã¤j-- a 1.9 on the
front I was that support for LTE 150
megabits per second so it should be
pretty fast but I don't think it going
to work here in the US 802 11 ABG and an
AC so that's kind of nice thirty-two
hundred million power battery alright so
let's talk about the height this is six
point six zero inches or a hundred and
sixty seven point six millimeters by
three point four six inches or 88
millimeters eight millimeters thin or
0.3 one inches and it weighs one hundred
99 grams but enough of me talking let's
pop in the bat meet this sucker it looks
like and compare it next other phones
cuz my oh my this is a gigantic phone so
let's peel off all this stuff I am
pretty big hands
I could palm a basketball no problem at
my hands look like I am a toddler I next
to this thing so pull this off I am
super excited to use this let's go ahead
and put in the battery and while it's
booting up we'll do SAS compare what
kind of other phones the battery is
almost the size of like an iPhone 4s um
go ahead and pop this sucker in and see
how it works
um am I the only one that's excited for
this phone I don't know why since I saw
it announced I just kept thinking it's
legs like a novelty phone no I'll check
- it fits in
like regular you know dude jeans phones
can't get any bigger right I'm gonna
carry around like a 10-inch iPad
sort of phone dialer on it and see how
that works
so we'll put on this gigantic back it's
the same sort of plastic back that we've
seen on previous Samsung devices here
nothing new or exciting from a build
quality standpoint and it's so big it's
hard to even see where it lines up snap
there we go um nothing really that
notable from the design standpoint
you've got a giant home button
capacitive back and menu buttons right
there volume up or down and you've got a
power button right there so I'm going to
try and boot the sucker on and I'll come
right back
alright I got this guy pretty much all
booted up and as I was going through the
setup I saw that it's got a ton of
Samsung Galaxy s4 features including air
view svm and all that kind of other
goodness so let you know that suckers
here we'll go ahead and go to next john
rhett and your galaxy finish and let's
see what Android 4.2 looks like on a six
point three inch screen so just for
example here's my hand next to it I mean
this it is gigantic but I don't know
it's kind of usable so let's do the
first thing I want to do is I want to
see a size comparison so let's bring in
the note 2 which is admittedly a phone
that's too big for most people there's
the note 2 it looks like a tiny little
nothing of the phone and the dimensions
here are almost all the same you can see
all that next to each other I just crazy
that this thing is that big I'm really
excited to to use it let's bring in a
few others here is the optimus G pro 5.5
inches so you can see what that sucker
looks like how about the kid brother
here the Samsung party here's a Galaxy
s4 which looks like it's got a lot of
growing up to do you can see really can
see the design similar between these two
I will say the mega though does not have
a stylus like the note line does let's
bring in a few other favorites here
here's the HTC One which is by no means
a small phone see what that looks like
let's bring in the iPhone 5 look at that
so small like what what give me money
give your money it's been a long couple
days um so here is the Samsung Galaxy
mega and this is all the way described
at other than
holy crap it's huge so if you want a
just ginormous phone um this is going to
work for you let's do a test and see how
it fits in there's like dude pants what
it looks like up next to your head
because I'm super curious about that as
well and all the stuff you loved or
hated about TouchWiz from the galaxy s4
is here as well so it's just a giant
little less power of powered galaxy s4
I'm going to use this phone I'm gonna
see if I can count on people look at me
like I have two heads
