with technobuffalo and we have got the
Moto 360 and this is the as you can see
here this is the men's model it's the
slightly bigger one of the three this is
the or homs depending on where you come
from this is the box is super similar to
the the old one except it's got a kind
of clear plastic top which is really
kind of nice and you can see it a little
bit information what is inside here I
was excited to use sing or savvy today
but I don't think that's gonna do it
because I'm not there's a whole little
pull tab here so I suppose we'll just
get to work on that here we go look at
that nice and easy all right I'm really
really excited to open this thing up I
as you guys can tell and have seen in
videos i am a moto 360 loyalists and so
I'm very excited for this new model this
is the 46 millimeter model this is like
I said the larger men's one who hi oh
how do I get you out of here I don't
want to break you there we go all right
we got a little soft goober here and of
course let's just take a quick look at
the device itself we've got a little
sticker right here which we can go ahead
and peel off assuming I can get my
fingernails under here at some point in
my life there we go let's go and power
this on with buttons up on the top right
now and it's got a nice little firm
motor in there too I'm going to let this
boot up right here well I'll leave it
right here with me for now and we'll see
what else is in the box and that's a
very familiar-looking doc this is the
same doc that comes with or a similar
doc anyway that comes with the first
generation 360 so I have one of those at
home very familiar and then an AC
charger as well and this is one of
things that i hate about these there's
there's it's ultimately it's the same as
USB but they don't give you a port here
at all alright so this suckers already
booted up while it's while we start
going through some of this stuff let's
talk a little bit about the specs so
this is like I said the 46 millimeter
model the these things are going to
start at three hundred bucks the screen
on this one is a 360 by three-thirty
display for a ppi of two
33 so inside this thing under the hood
you're gonna see a will not see because
you're not going to crack it open
hopefully but there's a Snapdragon 400
in here it's a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
CPU that that GPU is an Audrina 305
clocked at 4 50 megahertz one of the
major things that's changed with this is
not just the outside but that battery on
the inside as well is up from 300
million of hours on the smaller model
this one is 400 million of hours and
motorola says this should last you about
a day and a half with ambient mode
turned off and about a full day with
ambient mode turned on it's got four
gigs of storage right here on the device
and it's also got half a gig of ram
obviously you've also got all the rest
of the bells and whistles like Wi-Fi
Bluetooth you've got your little mic
here on the side as well you can also
see the the changes in hardware here why
don't we do this I'll just go ahead and
take my watch off here so that you guys
can see a little bit more clearly where
the differences are where this is a firm
band so you can see here the the frame
is a little bit different so we went
from a mount on the band that kind of
sticks right into the device without any
kind of arms to some arms here on the
side I'm not like a watch guy so I don't
know what these would be called but I'm
sure someone will tell me in the
comments so this this has a few benefits
associated with it a kind of just swings
a little bit more easily easier to
replace these are much easier to replace
these bands and this one and then also
if you're familiar with the first 360
there was an issue with cracking on the
back of it if you were wearing it a
little bit too tight this back panel
would start cracking so this should
mitigate that moving forward super super
excited to get this thing on my wrist
and start playing around with it it's
much faster the screen already looks
much much crisper than my old one
sitting right here which also happened
to it's taken a bit of a beating taking
a bit of a beating over the months so I
can't wait to take this thing for a full
trip over the weekend this weekend see
how it performs I'm a big big fan of the
Moto line so thank you guys so much for
watching if you guys have any questions
about the 360 anything you want
make sure that I test on it in the
review let me know in the comments
otherwise thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll catch you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
