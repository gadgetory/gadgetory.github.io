TechnoBuffalo and today I'm gonna get my
game on with a little game called Tiki
totem for the iPhone here's the main
menu for tiki totems pretty standard
stuff let's check out the classic levels
so it's a really really simple game to
play just tap on the screen to get rid
of a certain amount of rocks per level
the refresh button also changes the
faces of the tiki totems serious happy
happy again surprised if you break the
tiki totem like so the volcano on the
background will explode fire falls from
the sky avoid slabs not you and the
window pops up saying you lost okay
let's get serious BAM
see that's how it's done victory I am
victorious alright alright let's check
out the harder levels some rocks are
special the purple ones vanish when they
touch each other and the green ones are
kind of bouncing so you got to use your
mind a little when you play Tiki totem
it's a mind game exercises your mono hmm
okay and uh stupid bouncy rock and oh
the music is also very very cool very as
techie and funky like okay okay and no
man that volcanoes relentless dang it I
hate this game okay one more time this
one is for the prize and yes I love this
game look at that victory this team
definitely has that cut the rope or
Angry Birds kind of feels one of those
short simple and sweet but highly highly
addictive games and best of all it's
actually free right now if you're up to
it you can pick up Tiki Toto's part 2
from the Apple App Store for $0.99 which
is ranked number 2 in the top paid app
charts by the way and I hope you guys
like this video if there are any other
applications you would like me to review
let me know by commenting below this was
John Q from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see
you guys next time
