to you by carbonite welcome back to the
episode of ER Moran up just to show we
take all the tech rumors from the week
and we smash um bash them and serve them
to you on a silver platter of rumor
awesomeness we got a lot of great stuff
to talk about this week let's start with
Microsoft's SmartWatch evidently they
don't want to be left behind the
smartphone world they might even have a
head start Samsung allegedly is in a bit
of hot water for hiring students opposed
negative comments about HTC Motorola's
got a pure Android experience smartphone
launching soon and all kinds of other
tech goodness come and write your way
I'm John render the room around it I
probably Microsoft SmartWatch spin
development for over a year so they
might not just be talking about the idea
of building a SmartWatch they might
already be well along development
process Wall Street Journal said earlier
in the week that Microsoft is working on
a SmartWatch with a 1.5 inch display now
the verge did learn that Microsoft Xbox
team has already spent a year developing
a prototype the watch is allegedly gonna
employ a wristband that attaches to the
watch face using a magnetic mechanism
give all of transmitting power and data
although the ultimate question remains
though smartwatches serve only as
notification for Windows and our
smartphones or they can provide a unique
experience that's gonna add real value
to our wrists and that's the big
question so I'm really curious to see
what Microsoft Google and Apple do to
see how they can create these products
that add value to what we already have
and perhaps there's something crazy we
haven't even thought of yet so I'm kind
of excited Taiwan's fair trade
commission is allegedly investigating
Samsung over allegations the company
hired people to post negative comments
about their rival high tech computers
better known as HTC if found guilty the
company is liable for fines 25 million
Taiwanese dollars which equates to eight
hundred and thirty-five thousand so not
a giant sum of money here at risk the
Korean company has responded by saying
the unfortunate incident goes against
its fundamental principles however
though documents published online
reportedly proof Saints like has been
recruiting students to post praise for
samsung while criticizing HTC all
anonymously of course Samsung was
previously fined by the Taiwanese FTC
earlier this year because a mislead
consumers about the camera and its
galaxy y duos
the company is found guilty though it's
pretty gutless act on Samsung's part and
if anything it shows a Korean company
feels threatened by HTC they're pretty
awesome HTC One so allegedly moto is
working with Google and Google of course
owns motorola mobility develop pure
Android smartphones that means no extra
skins on top of Android just an
unfiltered version of Google's latest
mobile operating system it also suggests
so that Google and Motorola are going
out to new phones during Google's annual
developers conference in may so there's
good news to be had if you're sick of
massive Android smartphones to moto is
under the impression that bigger isn't
always better and with cell phones that
are just about right when it comes to
the green size our guests though that's
gonna mean something in the sub 4.5 inch
area so all you giant galaxy note fans
might be bit disappointed motorola is
going to work to launch multiple devices
across multiple carriers instead of one
flagship phone on a single carrier which
is obviously awesome so motorola Google
working together kissy kissy Kissy in
the corner to release some hopefully
awesome flagship phones what do you guys
think could you pick up one of those or
a separate Nexus device or maybe those
are even gonna be the next I we've been
hearing so much about I'm super curious
and Google i/o is coming up in just a
few weeks in may anyway well the iPhone
5s is rumored to pack age hmm hmm oh
sure there's a boring report cites
sources claimed to be from Vietnamese
company wonderful Saigon electrics maker
of iphone camera modules yeah iphone 5
clearly sports a megapixel camera
similar to the one found in the four
exit generally the new s phones in the
series improve the camera sensors and
really just some other hardware chin to
DN is also reported correctly though on
alpha rumors in the past like the view
of the new earpods so despite the site's
accuracy in the past we're still marking
this one as a rumor clearly I'll apples
expect this released a phone this summer
and Foxconn its main iphone manufacturer
reportedly is ramping up hiring
anticipation of mass production so we
step aside from the rumors for a minute
