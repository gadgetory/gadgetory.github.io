figured you guys probably know my
predictions but I wanted to go to the
source the Apple expert superfan and
also generally good human being I'm
learning which is new it's the first
time we've actually met in person you're
right that's weird I didn't even realize
it strange this is crazy I just seen
here yay thanks for coming over this is
this is my office studio whatever you
wanna call it
so we came to say hi and to share our
thoughts and predictions for WWDC so I
feel like the next question is what are
your thoughts and predictions for WWDC I
printed out a document oh you got
official I do because I'm really excited
note somewhere in my pocket okay so my
wish list obviously I'm a huge home pod
fan I think most of my comments were
people saying Justine you're the one
that bought all the home pods that's the
entire market there was a stack of home
pod boxes and we came in that was like
my height yeah there's a lot for that
but I would love to see a home pod mini
I know it's a potential thing that could
happen but I do feel like the price
point right now for the home pod is a
little bit expensive for what you're
sort of getting do you think it'll be
beats branded I'm not a big beats fan
I've been very vocal about that since
the beginning so I would hope that it's
not beats branded so what's your sweet
spot for home pod size impressive I
absolutely love those I love everything
I love their design so this is a
beautiful little so this would be like
home pod mini style something like this
but Apple if I'd I think would be really
cool so just like white hopeful thinking
how cool would be to have a home pod
with the screen on it
I love the Alexis show the Alexa dot
like those things I mean I have them
back here or I have one in the kitchen
and I love making calls to other people
that have them so that would be
something that I think is probably not
gonna happen now but it is my wish list
anything echo show is my alarm clock I
love being a hoarder stuff me I'm gonna
be nice to be able to control actually
see stuff I make FaceTime calls instead
of Alexa time calls is what I call over
okay so aside from a mini what else was
I just seems wish list if like Tim Cook
Johnny I ever watch in there they're
taking notes
really what else need to do I mean I
have a huge game of the Apple watch so I
think whatever they do next is something
gonna be really interested in we're not
the design any any design changes for
app launch I do like the design I think
that it could be a little bit thinner I
do feel like sometimes it has been a
little bit slower lately so sometimes
I'll just randomly like reset it and
then everything is good I'm still not a
huge fan of this sort of icon layout I
feel like there's got to be a better
system than that so rooms get better so
faster apps yeah I definitely think a
little bit faster I think thinner
there's also been some people that have
been hoping for a round watchface would
be nice which would be kind of cool so
having that sort of as an option I
actually do like the square one also
would be cool to be able to test like
oxygen levels glucose levels yes
all right so what about the most popular
Apple product like a phone what do you
think oh boy so you think we'll see a
new iPhone at WABC probably the SE se to
the se was wonderful that never actually
even got or even saw or try it out what
did you see it yeah you had an iPhone 5
or 5s oh yes so is that it wasn't I bet
it had NFC and it was less expensive I
think maybe wireless charging I feel
like that's sort of the new one should
standard so guess a glass back you come
up a notch I mean if it does go edge to
edge then it probably would have a notch
and then it's got a half face ID so
maybe it's not gonna be as like cheap as
people think
no maybe won't have a ID then no not
then no not will it still have a button
oh it's gotta have a button if no knotch
hmmm there's a lot of variables here I
think not no button no face ID so how's
it gonna unlock you're right let me
retract ok so then it's gonna have to
have face ID if it does have a knotch
because there won't be a button yeah
because whatever the next iPhone 10 is
what if iPhone iPhone 11 I mean maybe
that will be the one where there's no
knotch but I still feel like the se I
mean maybe it's just gonna be the same
just faster maybe they make it look
still like the iPhone 5 and they're like
we just sped up the processor and
there's a head
Jack they're so and glass back charging
so that's that's sort of an update I
still really people are a little bit
skeptical with face ideas so not
everyone is completely sold I'm sold but
I really like I really like face ID also
but maybe if that's the iPhone people
want a headphone jack they're like well
by the se that's your it's still there
okay so what else air power
oh that's a thing man doesn't exist no
but everyone keeps forgetting about it
and I have not forgot because I want to
be able to charge my ear pods my phone
and my watch at the same time because
right now I'm just using one of those
docks and yes not it is not as efficient
as it could be so that's two things
Apple said was coming that hasn't come
yet so the power and then the case the
wireless charging case for the air pods
the air pods - so then they would have
the case and then the second version of
their pods so air pods - are coming
we've decided what do you think maybe in
black
maybe air pods - might not be a thing
maybe they'll just melt the case cuz I
feel like they're not ready for like the
all-new whatever the air pauses they
came in black I would be probably buying
a pair and I think I hate to admit that
publicly but I would I loved like all
the color where yes you could do so
great okay so ear pods maybe - Wireless
case air-powered definitely coming past
you
it's got to some version of iPhone se
with the notch or no notch
what with you home pod maybe home pod we
gotta talk about iOS 12 because like
that like that we know is a thing one of
the biggest things I think that they
were really focusing on so I think they
said they wanted to do a redesign
originally yeah but they're like we need
to focus on stability also I use the
camera a lot being able to easily switch
from like 4k 60 to 4k 30 to 24 or even
to like you know whatever I just feel
like that's such a process and in most
Android phones it's so easy to do
yeah that's a simple software request
I've been hoping for more custom like
everybody more customizable iOS I mean
that was what like what like what do you
want to customize let's talk about it
okay
let's chat let's chat I would love the
ability to just like put an icon at the
bottom of my screen and like maybe not
have to have rows
rose and rose above it like that that's
a simple I got simple I would like to
have like a quick dial on my home screen
to style my wife like that that's fair
I'm not I'm not going crazy yeah that's
good simple a dark mode yes that's all
my list too I'd always go with me to
list it's okay what's green supposed to
be would be nice I would love what's
green does the aspect ratio have to
change of the phone to get to what's
moving well I mean even in Android 2 you
can change how much the slip ring is so
yeah it's about maybe something that you
can control it up the ability to
remotely unlock given the choice to do
it the user control to unlock when
you're in a secure Wi-Fi or in a secure
location I think would be awesome or
like think it's your car like it knows
like I've been Justine's car like it's
probably cool to just unlock true I just
feel like I mean that would definitely
be an option to turn on Iran yeah
because what if somebody kidnapped me um
I guess that's and then you can make it
I'm fine when on vacation
don't ask questions also send three
million dollars I was also thinking to
like biometric specific apps true that
you can have access to so if I wanted to
I don't know give my sister my fellow
and be like oh oh I don't want you to
have access to my messages or something
like that yeah so even like for kids to
which can be great because you can lock
them out of specific things so what
about notifications do you like how
Apple handles them I think they need to
be grouped because yes I have group the
amount of notifications that I get at me
because I have notifications on for a
lot of stuff and it was so funny I even
thought Casey and I stat tweet ones that
he has all notifications turned off but
like that's the only way that I actually
am able to take gender information and a
see if like my real life friends are
liking my posts or things like that so I
have those on okay so what else for iOS
12 is on your wish list I really do like
always on displays
oh that would be nice but if it kills
the battery then I don't want it but
it's also so easy just a tab and it
turns on yeah that's totally fine so I
really have enjoyed even like on the
pixel like it so it's always open I
could just look it's great I love it
even the Samsung have it on as well
helpful um let's see what else more an
emojis you still use them no but I think
they're so cool so what else is on your
iOS 12 wish list so this is so random
but so I love the rock he's the absolute
best he's done a bunch of commercials
with them yes and then I'm pretty sure
originally when you asked Siri you know
what was gonna be happening at WTC she
was still saying for last year she said
something about she was getting a new
voice so I was like oh this is
interesting
who could it be and the only person that
I could think of and even asked
everybody on like on my channel she was
like there was one voice that you would
want to be your Syriac who would it be
I'm like well I would like it to be the
rock future president yes I really wanna
be so perfect
speaking of Siri maybe I'm gonna say
this nicely but maybe Siri could go for
some improvement I'm hoping that that's
something that they have just sort of
been working on behind the scenes for
the last seven oh three long time
actually it's been a long time
Siri improving would be tremendous at
least some closed on par with Google
assistant I think it's one of those
things to where if they've rolled out a
slow update it wouldn't be as I don't
know astonishing so maybe this is the
WTC which I think sometimes people
forget about that
this is usually a conference for
developers software so we get hyped up
about them potentially mentioning things
about hardware but it is a software
thing so maybe this is the WWC where
Siri gets a new voice she gets some
attitude Oh new tube for Siri
oh so dub WDC so weird I'm gonna wrap on
a wrap and wrap it up so we're at home
smaller Mumbai mini smaller company with
maybe with the screen if we're if we get
our dream it's not gonna happen but I
think in the future it will so air pots
may be getting the wireless case maybe
our puds too but definitely being
charged by air power yes oh please which
should be a thing that will exist iOS 12
some more customization options dark
mode split screen maybe the rock doing
Siri oh my gosh I'll cry this is a
prediction I will cry Group
notifications probably not an iPad pro
and probably nothing on like laptop or
hardware and that is double WTC so they
even have to worry about watching watch
distance coverage but other than that
you already know what's gonna happen
