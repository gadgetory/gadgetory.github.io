to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone welcome back their pursuit of
rented riffs I'm Marisa John rain just
to show right talking about anything
that's going on in my mind over the past
maybe two to three years even up and
doing advice videos kind of sporadically
every maybe three to four months I'll
put out a new video store trying to help
the next generation tech reviewers or
people much older than me don't want to
get into this industry so I'm back with
another episode and this question I get
probably twice a week is and I'm middle
school I'm in high school I'm going to
college what should I study to try and
get to online journalism so I'm going to
try into that question style topic of
this video might not be for everyone but
if you've ever had an inkling a little
tingling in your baby toe that you want
to get into the online world and
definitely give this video a watch I've
answered ton of questions in the past
about how to get gadgets to review our
gadgets come from how to start off and
tech reviewing that kind of stuff I'll
put a link to the playlist down below
we've got it up on the main youtube
channel trying to go back and check out
those old videos and see how young I
used to look before we had a baby and
that stopped sleeping so I still read
every single question that comes in
every single comment that comes in it's
the TechnoBuffalo mail address in the
contact us page on the forum I can't
reply to all of them but I read every
single one and overwhelmingly especially
recently other than hearing something
along these lines of John I'm in school
I want to get into online journalism or
the technology or something else what do
I study how do I do it it's a new career
so doesn't really sort of a set path for
it I know some universities are surf
starting to have online journalism
classes but it's still really really new
so for somebody who kind of just guessed
it what to do let me tell you what
worked and what didn't work so first the
idea that you don't need school to be
successful at least in my opinion is
very very very false people always quote
guys like Steve Jobs Bill Gates further
success stories but what you don't hear
us are the people I didn't you know
become successful we always hear the
successful ones but the thousands of
thousand thousands that didn't you know
go to high school or didn't finish
middle school that kind of stuff you
very rarely hear about or dropped out of
college so I'm a big fan of education
big proponent of education so the first
thing I would say you don't have to get
journalism degree study anything that's
writing intensive creative writings can
get you thinking it's and get your mind
working teach you how to sort of
interpret things differently to sort of
look at everyday situation object news
story and interpret it on your own
this is this if you want to get into the
writing setting we talked about video in
a minute so anything that's very sort of
creative writing heavy or writing heavy
is a great way to go some of the liberal
arts degree is like religion classics
like I majored in I do history you can
pick in journalism if you want I in
glish is always a good one it's made you
anything that sort of emphasizes
creative writing also a hone your
grammatical skills is a really good way
to go you stop the advice for one quick
SEC to give you some more advice if your
dude or even a lady you know the buying
razor just kind of sucks dicks got to go
to the store you got to ask the person
open the thing up for you or you got to
get a little piece of paper and they go
in the back key the razor just a whole
giant pain in the ass and I hate pains
in the asses so the folks at Dollar
Shave Club have you covered and they
made it way way way easier for you after
all my razor works fine at that all this
crazy rage of technology have gotten
there now like laser pointers and little
Baldy rollers so fortunately Dollar
Shave Club made it way easier and it
couldn't be simpler for just a few bucks
a month Dollar Shave Club ships amazing
quality razors and other bathroom things
wrecked your house their blades are just
as good as a big shape companies at just
a fraction of the price so saving money
is always good they've also got dr.
Carver's easy shave butter to make your
shade even more buttery smooth so shave
time shave money join now with
dollarshaveclub.com slash TechnoBuffalo
if you want to get on the video side and
if your serve in high school or younger
try and join a speech in debate team a
big part of video at least been for me
it's where to think very quickly on your
feet you always get a time to read a
script sometimes things get thrown at
you for doing a live TV thing you don't
expect to happen we have a sort of
ad-lib as you go is really really
important in fact this whole video I've
got nothing in front of me that I'm
looking at this is just me talking and I
did Speech and Debate I loved it I
really enjoyed it give that a shot if
you have some sort of mock government
try that as well it's gonna help you
sort of think creatively be I take a
stand you necessarily agree with but you
have to present is a great way to go and
then start recording yourself try to be
aware of your mannerisms I know like for
me for example when I talk on videos
always tilt my head back
I've been trying to sort of correct that
and move that down I had a lot of us and
um likes in my earlier videos I've tried
really hard try and work on that you
don't really know what you're saying
until you go back and watch it again you
don't need a great camera you have to
spend thousands of dollars just hold out
your phone put it on the table make a
cheap tripod out of toilet paper holder
and record yourself and you can sort of
see what your mannerisms are what works
and doesn't work for you and be very
very aware of them
forget exponent get on line don't
naturally try and emulate somebody
else's style trying to find your own
style what worked for me or somebody
else might not work for you just be
honest it sort of the best advice I can
give so those are kind of two paths any
chance writing-intensive and be aware of
your manners and the things that you're
saying think are really really important
to getting kids industry again ton more
we can talk about goichi got field
plato's for all of our devices come from
how long we keep devices and all that
kind of stuff hopefully that'll help
spur get you guys on your way I had a
lot of help when I first started I kind
of feel an obligation to help you know
those that want to do what we do I'm
serve of the school that you know the
rising tide raises all ships so if you
get successful then it makes second of
all for online journalism sort of seem
more accepted that kind of thing so I
really love the opportunity to to help I
feel like it's my job and if you get
successful or a modicum success help
others oh it should be a good rule in
general always try and help others and
you guys hope you enjoyed till next time
