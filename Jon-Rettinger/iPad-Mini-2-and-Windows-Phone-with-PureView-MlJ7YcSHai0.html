to you by carbonite welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup just a show we
round up all the tech rumors from the
week and condense them into one can of
rumor awesomeness we got a ton of stuff
to talk about this week we're gonna talk
about the ipad mini 2 getting amongst
other things an updated screen a
brand-new 41-megapixel PureView sensors
hopefully coming to Windows Phone very
soon Facebook is supposedly developing a
kind of creepy app is gonna tell you and
all your friends are nearby and evidence
is finally mounting that Apple is
getting ready to unveil a streaming
music service this rumor roundup let's
go and get started the ipad mini hasn't
been out for all that long but of course
with an apple product rumors of its
sequel are coming fast and furious so we
already assume Apple's iPad Mini 2 is
gonna offer Retina display that much is
basically a given at this point however
new reports from my driver is suggesting
at the teeny tiny little tablets also
going on for a screen with a 324 PPI
which is way way way sharper than the
2048 x 1536 pixels rendering on the
current fourth-generation ipad which is
the sharpest ipad to date so my drivers
doesn't really provide much more
information on the screen other than
that it will also offer a 2048 x 1536
pixel resolution combine that with the
smaller 7.9 inch display the pixel
density makes perfect sense one thing is
for sure though watching movies reading
text browsing the web certainly gonna be
way more enjoyable within the experience
of the display that's just a hair
sharper than the current generation ipad
mini screens the ipad mini 2 is expected
during the third quarter of this year
according to recent rumor so it's not
gonna be that much longer until you can
get some extra buin pixels on your eyes
I've actually got used to the ipad mini
I don't use a regular Retina Display
ipad anymore so it doesn't leave on me
that much but certainly when I see a
third or fourth generation ipad you can
totally notice a difference Evan
suggest apple music streaming service is
imminent so according to 9to5 mac deep
beneath the ipad a music app is an iOS 6
radio button files containing the word
by a similar radio logo button briefly
appeared in itunes for mac actually
suggesting that Apple is quietly
inputting assets into its products a
number of reputable outlets have claimed
that the iphone maker has a Pandora and
Spotify competitor in the works so
perhaps we're seeing evidence of that
service finally starting to come to the
surface Apple loves to overshadow these
big keynotes we see invites come at CES
and other large events so it wouldn't be
that surprising to see one come in a
couple weeks at Mobile World Congress
Nokia's true PureView windows phone
isn't just a myth or what if scenario
according to the Guardian which is
connected with industry insiders finnish
company is definitely preparing a Lumia
device they censor comparable to was
inside the company's pretty easily 808
PureView internally known as the EOS the
device should arrive sometime the summer
an exact month really wasn't shared if
anything the likeliest scenario would be
that Nokia announces something and
Mobile World Congress later this month
followed shortly by an actual product
release date while PureView technology
including the Lumia 920 was decent it
really wasn't spectacular still it's a
taste of what's hopefully to come and
what's to come means a 41 megapixel
sensors heading the windows phone or
whatever operates the Nokia sides to use
it would be absolutely tremendous it
would be odd though for nokia develop
such an incredible technology only to
send it off in the sunset on the 808
PureView hopefully it's making a
comeback facebook is no stranger to do
with some kind of creeper things i don't
like they're about to get even more
creepy with an app that's going to tell
you when your friends are literally near
by so Bloomberg's report is to be true
this creepy new service could be coming
very soon actually Facebook's own terms
of service allow for this Facebook's
Terms reserve the right to collect your
information quote we may put together
your current city with gps on their
location information we have about you
too for example tell you about your
friends about people events the year by
or offer deals that you might be
interested in that's all according to
facebook i could not imagine anything
creepier than that so no more King a
ditch friend to go see
a movie because they might be there with
you get a buzz on your phone one and
you'll be called out as a liar
personally I like facebook to check my
french streams I don't want to know
where they're at fo know where they're
at and if they choose to check in and I
can look at Foursquare I can look at
places and all tons of other options
doing it in real time seems very very
odd and really invasive to me hopefully
though if they do implement that you can
flick that switch off to make sure that
they can't happen all the time it just
seems a little too invasive and too much
