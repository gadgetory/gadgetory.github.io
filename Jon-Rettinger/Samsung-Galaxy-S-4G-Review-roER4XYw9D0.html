membership today sovereign John Rhett
injure in TechnoBuffalo here at the full
review for you of the Samsung Galaxy S
4G it is the newest member of the Galaxy
S line of phones and this one's got an
extra G for all of you t-mobile fans out
there so let me run through the specs
very quickly and then we'll get into all
the review goodness so it's got a four
inch Super AMOLED screen with a
resolution of 480 by 800 it's being
powered by Android 2.2 with Samsung's
own touch wits
plenty more on that coming up on the
back it's got a 5 megapixel camera with
autofocus which can shoot video at 1280
by 720 so that's 720p for all your folks
keeping track at home at 30 frames per
second for its Wi-Fi NISS it's got 802
11 be GNN all being powered by a 1
gigahertz very familiar now Humminbird
processor batteries been upped a little
bit to 1650 milliamp hours so all the
specs are great the phone does quite a
lot but browser and all the rest sets
suffer and talk about are no use if the
thing can't make phone calls so let's
first talk about call quality I do a 20
call test sort of test the phone acumen
of these devices I do it in various
areas throughout my community places
where I know cell signal is degraded to
get a sense of how it sounds and whether
or not we have any drop calls now
certainly it's going to vary depending
on where you are and signal strength
where I am right now I generally get
about 2 to 4 bars of t-mobile 4G service
you can see right now it is showing 2
bars up there call quality is
outstanding on the Galaxy S 4G it was
crystal clear
people had no problem hearing me at all
they couldn't even tell
was on my cellphone I did test a Wi-Fi
calling as well and that worked just as
nicely there was any popping or white
noise I did however experience a few
dropped calls on the device speakerphone
is just average so if rely on
speakerphone while you're in a car or in
a meeting for an allowed boardroom you
might want to look to a Bluetooth
headset I found that to be a little bit
disappointing I was able to bring in a
pretty strong signal strength number 4G
wasn't present I dropped back down to
about five bars of 3G which has been
just about on par with other key mobile
devices so the radio in here seems to be
just as strong as the other phones and
again certainly that's going to vary
depending on where you are okay so now
let's get to the fun stuff and the phone
review and let's start with the skin
that is sitting on top of Android 2.2
not Android 2.3 Gingerbread this is a
scoop of Froyo so I've talked in the
past about not being the biggest fan of
TouchWiz and that still holds true but
Samsung has made some improvements that
have a dress on my concerns so one of
the improvements and things actually I'm
starting to like about TouchWiz and this
is very familiar if you guys that have
used an HTC device to sort of do that
you can get access now to your home
screens and further you can now
rearrange them which certainly puts it
on par with other skins that we've seen
in the past I do like the addition to
TouchWiz pull down the tray here you get
shortcuts for Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS silent
so you can change your profile silent
and vibrate and autorotation
to understand why more manufactured in
stock Android don't do that make it
really easy to change your profiles if
you're like me and you're in a lot of
meetings or you don't want your phone to
ring or keep it quiet it's really nice
sort of have that setting experiment you
can add a widget that'll do it to the
homescreen but it's very nice to have it
on every screen or just by pulling down
the tray the applications here are the
same as we've seen on other TouchWiz
devices it's sort of laid out in this
icon the horizontal scrolling I don't
like that I don't like that each one is
sort of encapsulated into its square but
I do understand that that is just
personal preference
one of the nice things about Android
however is if you don't like TouchWiz
you don't like the way the launcher
works here you can go ahead and put on
your own launcher I just did a clean
restore the device but when I was
testing it I was using launcher Pro
which completely redesigns and redoes
how look so that is definitely one of
the positives of Android the web browser
here is pretty standard what you'd
expect from an Android web browser go
ahead and take a look all your pinch to
zoom functionality is there it works
pretty quickly there wasn't much of a
lag scrolling I didn't getting that
checkerboard pattern the hummingbird
processor definitely keeps up with what
you need to do flash was not so
watchable was definitely a bit Sutter II
I'd probably recommend unless you need
it for a particular reason a turning
flash off not only because it's not the
most usable that's also going to be a
big battery drain so the screen here is
Super AMOLED which means it's absolutely
beautiful - gorgeous screen but it still
is first generation of Super AMOLED and
as we've seen with other samsung galaxy
s devices there is a bit of a tint to
the screen it's a little bit of a bluish
gray tint and it's nothing that
certainly you can't get by and if you
don't look at it next to another device
you don't notice it but if you pull in
something that doesn't have that tint
here's an iPhone 4 it becomes a little
bit more apparent now I got very used to
it and I'm willing to sacrifice that
tint to have the outstanding visibility
in direct sunlight the really dark
blacks and the very rich and beautiful
colors so Super AMOLED for me is a huge
huge huge addition but if you think you
might be bothered by that little tint
definitely go and check it out in stores
you can look at any of the galaxy s
devices they all have the same screen
let's go ahead and hit home here one
sort of issue that I had with the galaxy
s devices and some have them some don't
if we flip this guy on its rear end
no flash that seems to be a really
common feature now on pretty much every
smartphone there's some sort of LED
flash we don't have that here on the
Galaxy S 4G and while we have this thing
turned over and we're looking at its
butt and let's talk about this back it
looks like there's some texture on there
with that
gray but that is just an illusion it is
completely hard plastic that's one of
the issues that I had with the phone the
build quality doesn't feel that well
let's just say high quality it's got a
nice feel to it it's got a nice look it
feels a little bit flimsy though so when
I say nice feel it's solidly it was
rather fuel solid but you can definitely
the sense it if you drop the phone the
back is completely going to fall off
from a design standpoint it's going to
come down to personal preference what
you like it's got sort of that chrome
ring around it which looks very
reminiscent of another device that we've
seen these two definitely look like they
are distant cousins iPhone 3GS right
here go ahead and push that off oh and
all the package comes together very
nicely and things work as you'd expect
from a modern Android device being a 4G
phone I was very impressed with the
download speeds from t-mobile's HSPA+
network certainly I got nowhere near the
21 plus that they advertised but I was
definitely getting about three to four
sometimes I got five or six speeds on
the down thats megabits per second and
on the up as you can see right here I
was very strong on the up polian
sometimes even as fast as 3 megabits per
second up so if he uses for hotspot
capabilities you're going to be very
very nicely set go ahead and hit home I
haven't always been the biggest fan of
capacitive buttons sometimes I find them
unresponsive very good here on the
Galaxy S 4G camera quality is fine it
looks about as it expected the year
resolution front camera works just about
as you'd expect the VGA front camera to
work and it does use the quick software
for video chat so all in all if you're
in the market for a pretty capable
pretty robust Android smartphone and
you're on Team moat when you want to
make sure it can do for G this is going
to be a very very good option and for
those of you folks that may have a
vibrant which was the previous I suppose
generation version of the galaxy s on
t-mobile this definitely represents a
nice upgrade
just for the battery but for the
additions to TouchWiz and those 4G
speeds so on a one to five scale it gets
a very very solid actually four and a
half however there is a new generation
of smartphones coming out very quickly
that are going to be using a dual core
processor chipset and are going to have
improved amount of RAM so while this is
a very capable phone for now I'll
certainly serve you throughout the
course of your two-year contract if
you're in the market for a phone right
now you may want to wait for another two
to three months to see what's coming
