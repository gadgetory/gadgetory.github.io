Hazleton from technobuffalo we just got
our hands on the galaxy s6 here at
Mobile World Congress and I wanted to
show you how it stacks up to the note 4
which for a while now has been Samsung's
pretty much most powerful most premium
smartphone on the market still a great
device but some differences here
especially in design so i want to show
you how they stack up probably sleee 5.1
inch display quad HD on this quad HD on
the note 4 as well and some similarities
although Samsung beefed up the cameras a
little bit the home button now has a
built-in fingerprint reader this did too
but this one lets you tap on it instead
of swype as you do on the Galaxy Note 4
you'll notice some changes around the
body too well the note 4 has metal
etching around the sides this actually
has a unibody aluminum unibody design
you'll see the speaker there on the
bottom is a new placement not there on
the note 4 micro USB on the bottom of
the galaxy s6 but not on the note 4
obviously therefore has the s pen as
well which is nice touch you can see the
side panel there volume keys a little
different in design on the back similar
camera modules although samsung says it
actually boosted the software
performance for low-light and other
areas on the galaxy s6 to
power button on the right hand side
there up top that's where the IR blaster
is on the note 4 obviously still there
too on the galaxy s6 you also have a
little bit watered down version of
TouchWiz on this which is nice Sampson
said they removed about forty percent of
the bloat so things are a little bit
different here and you can see more of
that in our hands on but wanted to give
you a quick look at just how the phone
stacks up especially if you're
considering another four or galaxy s6
