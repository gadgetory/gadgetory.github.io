surface to steamos Tokyo Game Show in an
interview with the team behind hyper
light drifter it's Buffalo bullets in
time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we have five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story we talked about on
the show click the description for links
or you can click on the graphics for
every story if you have annotations
available and toggle on I'm Ashley sceva
here your top stories already a huge
week in tech news with Apple reporting a
combined 9 million iphone 5s and 5c
units sold this weekend that's right not
shipped sold it seems Tim Cook's
prediction was right and the iphone 5s
came out on top with over seventy
percent of those sales obviously this is
a clear indication that Apple is doomed
and we should all just pack it up and go
home just like the last iPhone lunch and
the one before that and the one before
that speaking of doomed blackberry made
some drastic moves early this week
agreeing to a 4.7 billion dollar buyout
offer by fairfax financial holdings
limited fairfax is offering a nine
dollars cash for each share and stocks
didn't get a boost from the agreement
meaning the stock market doesn't exactly
think blackberry will get a better offer
so ouch blackberry will likely be taken
private but there's no word yet on the
future of BlackBerry's patents hardware
or software bonus news this episode with
Microsoft unveiling the surface 2 and
surface pro 2 yesterday the surface 2
drops the RT from its name but it still
runs an RT version of Windows 8.1 while
the surface pro 2 has an upgraded
Haswell chip a better screen tons of new
accessories and more pre-orders start
today and the surface 2 starts at 449
while the surface pro 2 starts at eight
ninety-nine in gaming valve made a huge
play for the living room and announced
steamos it's a Linux based OS designed
for gaming on a big screen it will be
free to download and use and it will
work on any living room machine
according to valve oh and it'll stream
your pc games to whatever device is
running steamos in your living room so
good any guesses on Valve's phase 2
announcement tomorrow the fabled steam
box perhaps if you didn't know Tokyo
Game Show happened and came to a close
this weekend

directly from the show floor in Japan
photos hands on demos previews and even

4 right around the corner our wild card
for the week is also from gaming our
very own joey davidson spent some time
interviewing the team behind hyper light
drifter a 2d action RPG heading to pc
ps4 and playstation vita they're in the
midst of a successful Kickstarter
