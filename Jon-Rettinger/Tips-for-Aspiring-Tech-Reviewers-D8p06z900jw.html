the past few months I've been doing a
video series on advice for aspiring tech
reviewers and advice for youtubers in
general i like to continue that with
some more advice for you guys and for
those of you that are looking to expand
your audience or maybe start making
YouTube videos I've got a few bits and
pieces that I've learned over the past
couple years that I'd like to share with
you guys certainly there's much more
that I need to learn but as I kind of
get a sense of what works and what
doesn't you know maybe you guys can be
the beneficiaries of my experience so
you can check out the past videos for
some of the old device that have offer
but I've got sort of some new advice
with a little bit of a different take
than I had in the past so one of the big
questions I get is I want to review
things I want to review technology but I
don't have a big enough audience for
companies to send me products or I don't
have enough money to buy products to
review and that's okay you don't need to
be rich or have any money or even have
any subscribers to review technology
there are a few ways you can go about it
inexpensively while you're building on
it so let me tell you guys the few
things that have worked for me the first
is give your take on a device so for
instance when I did a few days ago with
the palm pre I don't have a palm pre in
hand I just gave my take on it what I
thought about it what I thought it was
going to do the industry and how it was
going to shape future cell phones and I
opened up a discussion to the audience
you know your videos are more than just
you talking to somebody it's also a
discussion that follows down below in
the comments if you can prompt a nice
discussion not only can you learn from
your viewers your future viewers you
know it's also a nice chance for them to
you get to know you and they like your
content hopefully subscribe and
subsequently build your audience base so
that's a very simple way just talk about
product you necessarily have to have
them in hand you
have to do an unboxing a review or
harbor overview whatever you want just
talk about technology it's not so bad
the next option and this one does cost a
little bit of money but not much to just
review very inexpensive products if for
example you're an apple fan and you have
an iPhone review some my foot
applications and keep it at 99 cents or
review free applications you don't use
what you have a year to school if you
have a blackberry storm pick up a case
for a blackberry storm for maybe 20
bucks and review the case and start
building your audience that way you know
naturally holistically kind of build it
up from the ground up I think your
audience will eventually respect you
more as your subscriber base grows and
your viewers grow knowing kind of where
you came from to you know where you guys
want to be so again you don't have to go
out and spend a lot of money even just a
little bit next thing is review things
you already have if you have a wireless
mouse for example on your computer
review it if you have an older digital
camera review it people are still
looking for information on these things
if you've got a fancy keyboard or
whatever you have give it a review
someone out there is going to want to
know about it and that someone may tell
a friend and that friend may tell
somebody else and you never know things
could really snowball from there so
again for last time you don't have to
have a lot of money or spend any money
to start reviewing technology a next
video advice is kind of a carryover from
previous videos you guys have to have
confidence in yourself or if you have to
project confidence you have to do your
research you have to know the product if
you're giving out incorrect information
or regularly giving out incorrect
information people aren't going to
respect you they're not going to respect
your videos and you're going to see your
audience you know I experienced minimal
growth unfortunately so do your research
be confident in the videos that you're
that you're putting out there in the
words that you're saying and be very
mindful of what you're saying try to be
careful with your ohms and ahhs I know
that's difficult but really try and just
be mindful of it it's make you look much
less progress much less professional
rather and the next bit of advice if you
are going to reach out to other
youtubers or if you're going a look
average out to companies be very careful
the language that you're using in your
emails guys I can't stress this enough I
get so many emails that say instead of
spelling out y.o.u they just say you or
the title just says read me you know
people aren't going to be responsive set
especially if you're asking them for
something you're trying to get their
attention in a way that's a little
underhanded in the language you're using
in the emails is very juvenile no one's
going to take you seriously and it's
going to be hard to to get the exposure
that you need and and the next thing is
if you're going to reach out to some
youtubers and you're asking them to
promote your videos you're gonna have a
very hard time getting a response if me
for example or another youtubers going
to promote your video or mention you and
a Twitter post or something we're going
to get inundated with other people with
the same request and unfortunately it's
very hard to accommodate everyone so to
keep things fair most people will
generally decline those requests so
while it never hurts to ask don't be
discouraged if those requests don't come
through you might get those quite a bit
i know people way more popular than me
get them as well and that's a nice
little segways you don't be discouraged
don't be discouraged guys have have
confidence and know that you're not
going to build your audience overnight
it's not going to take a one week two
weeks no matter how many videos you put
up to that amount of time it's going to
take months it's just like any other job
it's going to take time for you to get
acclimated for you to learn and for
people to take notice so guys hope you
enjoyed this advice for aspiring tech
reviewers it's also one last thing that
I do want to share I've mentioned in
some of my videos like the one I did for
quick TV a while back people send me
some really cool lengths and some cool
promotions that sometimes like to share
with you guys well there is a very very
very neat one going on right now the
chance to win some pretty kick-ass
prizes and it's being done by mo films
Spike Lee and actually AT&amp;amp;T is involved
as well and this is really cool if
you're trying to be a tech review works
why I'm mentioning it right now what you
have to do is you can choose I think
they've got 10 or 12 companies and you
make an advertisement
them at home make a video on one of
their products or one of their services
each company has your own set of
guidelines and you enter it in the
contest from o films you can win a
chance to go to con which is pretty cool
in the South of France I believe they
were giving away a trip to the American
Idol finale but that's past when NCAA
final four tickets for next year a
chance to get recognized and get some
money there's a lot of really really
cool prizes and I know you guys like to
make videos Alex make videos so it's a
nice chance to get some reward for your
hard work I'll put a link to that up in
the sidebar and I actually read about it
on ett facebook page so you can check it
out there too if you like anyway guys
for exclusive content be sure to follow
me on twitter twitter.com / John for
lakers hope you are having a nice day
having a nice weekend whatever they are
going to be watching this year but
weekend coming up at some point and I
will see you guys in the next video bye
