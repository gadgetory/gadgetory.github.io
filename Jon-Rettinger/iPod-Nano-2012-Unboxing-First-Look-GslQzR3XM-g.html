TechnoBuffalo here it's an unboxing of
the brand new seventh generation iPod
Nano this guy got a complete redesign
it's now running an iOS asked interface
it's got bluetooth all kinds of cool
stuff built in let's go ahead check it
out alright so here is the 7 generation
iPod Nano it's available in 6 colors
black purple blue silver green yellow
pink and red and we've got the red
version here it's product red so a small
portion of the profits go to benefit
AIDS research
now same price though for any of these
guys no matter what color you get 149
bucks 16 and gigabytes
alright so go ahead and open her up
we'll pull the tab tab is being pulled
and this should just open up and here is
the iPod Nano push it out to the side
for just a quick second see what else
we're going to have in ZBOX
we got this thing I think it's probably
about product red
yep product red partner give you a
portion of your Nano proceeds to the
Global Fund to fight AIDS in Africa
hello Quick Start Guide we've got a
lightning cable in here this guy does
use lightning and they include a pair of
ear pods I does not have and you serve a
microphone in here though obviously so
push that off to the side let's see if
it's got any certain line control though
nope so no sort of control on here to
control your songs but Apple did sort of
make up for that by including controls
on the side of the iPod so go ahead and
pop this guy up and here is the iPod
touch screen doesn't seem to work though
must've had a busted unit just kidding
all right peel off the plastic here
somehow of course is a handy tab for it
and boom it looks like a mini iPod Touch
it's got a home button and everything
all kinds of fancy running a custom OS
it's go ahead move it up see if it's got
any power in it and it does look at that
screens even red so this looks like iOS
but it is not from dimension standpoint
it is 3.01 inches by 1.5 6 inches by a
pretty thin
point to one inches it's got a 2.5 inch
multi-touch print the resolution of 240
by 4:30 - that is a 202 PPI bag life's
going to give you 30 hours of music or
3.5 hours of video and yes this guy will
indeed play video kind of cool for a
nano previous generation nanos was not a
fan of it's hard to control it wasn't a
nice or home button but you could wear
them as a watch this one though I don't
think it's gonna work maybe like a giant
watch it would it would work for oh this
is Wi-Fi only it does have bluetooth
though bluetooth streaming especially so
you can carry this guy in your car and
stream right to your stereo which is a
very nice dish now for the iPod Nano no
camera here back there's that same sort
of aluminum can tell what's real or not
that we saw in the new generation iPod
Touches on the bottom as for your
lightning connector is going to live 3.5
millimeter headset jack on left-hand
side you've got volume up and down kind
of hard to see but there's also a button
in the middle that will control playback
and also you can launch playlists from
there let's take a look at the operating
system here does feel very I Oh s ish
videos you can now play videos on here
we don't have any it's left the right to
go back can you do that those miss there
we go and that will let you go back
music it's going to be typical iPod
stuff set the home button you can also
go back neck eafit this I can use my
Nike FuelBand
and do something with that but it is
built in podcasts you can go ahead and
download podcast right from here and
listen to them like TechnoBuffalo zone
tech on the range podcast available
every week go and download that photos
you can view them on here but you can't
take pictures good doesn't have a camera
it does have a FM radio so you can
listen to radio stations I'd leave and
get am signal on there as well no app
store though on here you can't download
apps or anything else clock you can tell
a time so you could use it as a giant
watch if you wanted to I've got a
stopwatch and then you've got a
countdown timer will go back settings
see what kind of settings we have boo to
general music radio photos or reset
settings so it's got a physics engine as
you move
does feel sort of i/os it is very smooth
if you wanted a ipod touch sort of
experience we wanted a smaller package
this is going to be a great way to go
it's extremely light won't even notice
this in your pocket as you're at the gym
or running whatever you want to do and
of course not going to skip on you
because it's flash storage as everything
is on nowadays so this has been an
unboxing and first look at the seven
generation iPod Nano I'm John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
