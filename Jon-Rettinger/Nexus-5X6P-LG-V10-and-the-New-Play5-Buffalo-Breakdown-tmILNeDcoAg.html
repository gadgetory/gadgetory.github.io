new Nexus is from google new
chromecast's a new dual screen LG device
and we salute El Capitan i am mark burst
i never technobuffalo it is saturday
october third and this is the buffalo
breakdown how's it going everybody so we
have so much great new stuff this week
so let's get down to it first up one of
my absolute favorite brands of all time
so knows they announced their refreshed
version of their original play five
device this week the new model is
sporting a slick new look and some
really awesome features on both the
hardware and the software side the new
play five moves from physical buttons to
new capacitive sensors on the actual
device so you can now swipe on the touch
panel to skip forwards or backwards if
you want to skip forwards or backwards
for the track if the device is in
multiple orientations totally okay
there's an accelerometer inside it's
going to make sure that it always knows
which way is up so you're always pushing
the button do you expect to be pushing
plus true play ensures that your music
sounds the way it was intended to by
using your mobile device to tune the
sonos to the specific settings for the
room and the devices placement so true
play runs on your mobile device we're
going to look a little silly using true
play since it requires you to more or
less paint your walls with your phone
but it should make for a much truer
listening experience for those of you
running max the newest version of OS 10
double Capitan is out this week it is a
free upgrade and it includes more than a
few design tweaks there's a brand-new
beach ball of death if that's of
interest to you it's actually very
pretty there's a host of new features as
well like split view a much more
powerful spotlight that you can use
regular conversational English in and
very much increased performance you can
head to the App Store on your Mac to get
it and again it is a free download the
LG v10 is official this week the v10 is
LG's first device in a new premium line
of phones this one is a little bit
different though it's rocking a second
screen up at the top of the display that
is always on and shows you the time date
notifications and shortcuts whether it's
on the devices on the screen or it is
asleep seems like a great idea on paper
but in practice it seems like it's going
to be a little bit
to reach all the way up there for a
short cut but we're gonna need to wait
until we get our hands on it to be able
to know for sure the device is packing a
snapdragon 808 16 megapixel camera 2 5
megapixel front facing cameras one
regular and one with a wide-angle lens
for your grew fees which is what they
call group selfies okay a three thousand
million power battery and 64 gigs of
on-board storage of course expandable
via microsd all the way up to 200 gigs
and that big beautiful 5.7 inch quad HD
display for a ppi of 513 the thing looks
like a really really fun device I'm
excited to get my hands on it the screen
does seem genuinely useful to me of
course that's not all LG did this week
though they also announced their second
generation of their G watch urbane its
claim to fame is that it is the very
first android wear watch to support
cellular frequencies well I'm not sure
that's something I want to pay for just
yet I'm sure there are folks who will
especially those who are interested in
living that Dick Tracy audio call on
your phone life finally we've got a slew
of google news from the press event this
week our new nexus devices are finally
here yes we saw and heard a lot about
them through leaks but the Nexus 5x and
6p are the new flagships from google
this year and this might be the year
that they got it so so so so right
before we dive deep into the two devices
let's take a look at what they look like
on paper the 5x is rocking a snapdragon
808 22 gigs of ram a 5.2 inch 1080
display for a ppi of 424 a 12 point
three megapixel camera with a larger
pixel size of 1.5 5 microns that's very
important it's a big selling point for
them twenty-seven hundred million power
battery and a excellent price of 379 the
6p is packing a snapdragon 810 which
hopefully the heat issues have been
resolved three gigs of ram a 5.5 inch
display which is a quad HD display which
comes out to a ppi of 5 18 and 32 gigs
of on-board storage which is all the way
up to 64 gigs and 128 gig options not
expandable via microSD and a really nice
hefty size 3434 50
milliamp hour battery the LG
manufactured 5x is definitely the lower
end model and it is the successor to the
Nexus 5 from 2013 I adored the Nexus 5
and this one is everything that a nexus
5 was but better it's everything the
fans wanted new case new internals same
great phone the original Nexus 5 had
kind of a hard time keeping up with its
ilk in the camera Department but Google
assures us that that shouldn't be an
issue this time around with a brand new
sensor that sits in both the 5x and the
6p which we'll get to in just a second
the Huawei built 6p is very much the
premium option it's an all-metal body
and it yields to a really nice big
bright Samsung AMOLED display and they
did confirm that it is the most recent
generation of Samsung panels around the
back it is not nearly as bad as we
thought the camera hump is much much
smaller than it looked in the original
leaks and it is what the Nexus team
affectionately calls the visor it's a
piece of Gorilla Glass that allows for
their laser autofocus to peek through
and it also lets the antenna that are
inside of the device and the coils for
things like NFC be able to get out
because they can't do that through the
metal the 5x is certainly intended for
the budget market but it is no slouch at
the claims about the camera are founded
this seems to me to be the phone to beat
for the budget range though we have yet
to put it through its paces of course if
the battery life can also keep up with
disposing camera improvements I really
have to echo our friend mkbhd here when
I say that I think the 5x is going to be
the first Nexus to really kind of
transcend the Nexus brand it really does
seem like a phone for everyone sighs
build and specs aren't the whole story
though there are more differences beyond
the bigger and better screen the 6p is
going to support 240 frames per second
video while the 5x will only support 120
and the 5x is not going to be able to
support the smart burst one feature that
takes multiple photos and selects the
best one they said they just couldn't
handle the horsepower of course they
both share more than a few things too
and not all of them are good they both
lack optical image stabilization which
means those identical camera sensors are
relying on the larger 1.5 micron pixels
to be able to take in enough light also
because they come with us bc you are
going to need to start rioc fitting your
home though this was
kind of inevitable anyway it was bound
to happen this is probably the device
that's going to cause you to do it new
chromecast's are also shipping right now
the new devices are much much smaller
the round and they support fast play
which is going to prefetch the next
episode that you're likely to watch so
that it starts instantly with no
buffering they also now pack three
separate antenna for a strong strong
signal and now support 5 gigahertz
frequency Wi-Fi networks and it's even
going to switch between two point four
and five gigahertz Wi-Fi networks
intelligently not to mention the actual
chromecast app got a fun nominal
makeover and you can check out more
about the chromecast and the new
chromecast app in the video up here last
but not least the pixel see is the last
big thing that google announced at their
event this week it is a four hundred
ninety nine dollar device and if you're
looking at it right now which I imagine
you are you can tell it's a tablet but
it's somewhere in between akin to the
new iPad pro and the Microsoft Surface
you can see there's a keyboard right
underneath there it's mostly a
chromebook looking pixel build if you're
familiar with the chromebook pixel looks
beautiful it's a great-looking screen
and it is running marshmallow that
keyboard is going to run you a separate
149 and this is supposed to be the kind
of work horse Android tablet device that
Google is going after that keyboard is
really one of the coolest things I've
seen in a while it attaches to the
tablet via very strong magnets and then
pivots up at just like you would for a
keyboard what's even better is it
connects to the tablet via bluetooth but
you don't have to worry about charging
it because when it's closed and attached
to the tablet it's going to charge
sucking juice out of the tablet via
inductive charging which is so so so so
cool we don't know exactly when the
pixel is going to be out though Google
has said in time for the holidays and
that's about all the google news for
this week so that means we are wrapping
up the breakdown that is the show for
the week thank you guys so much for
watching it very much appreciate you
guys taking the time to do so let me
know what you guys think in the comments
do you think the pixels he is going to
be something that you're going to be
able to use for an actual work horse and
also let me know which Nexus you guys
are drooling over for me i know i'm
getting a 6p hopefully i'm going to grab
one of those sweet mint looking 5 x's
