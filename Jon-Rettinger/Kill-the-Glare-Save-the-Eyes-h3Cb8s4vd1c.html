technobuffalo here if there's one thing
I hate more than running out of candy at
Halloween its glare on my electronics at
my new desk setup which there will be an
office tour coming this week I have
sunlight directly behind me I have
lights directly above me and it's
killing my eyes I spend a lot of time on
the iPad whether it's testing new apps
checking out some sites on it or getting
my Angry Birds on but the glare when I
sit and use it is really starting take
its toll on my eyes staring at a
computer monitor for all these years for
as long as I do has hurt my eyes enough
anyway and then this glare has really
been doing a number on it's almost
impossible to read things I feel I
fatigue after just about 10 or 15
minutes so if you're like me and your
eyes are killing you or you're getting
some glare problems I think that I've
got a solution let's go ahead and check
it out
alright so the folks at a case have
hooked me up with a anti glare shield
for my iPad they knew that this was
going on they sent it for me to check
out so I figure it instead of just
installing it and not telling you guys
be much more fun to install it and show
you and actually see if it works it does
come in black or white it's about nine
bucks from amazon put a link down below
so i'm going to put it on my white ipad
here this is an ipad 2 now you can see
the glare already right there in the
corner I mean it's really bad depending
on what angle I matter where I'm looking
I've been trying to do some reading on
this and just hurting my eyes so we're
going to go ahead and install this guy
we're usable anti-scratch saturated
color reduce smudging high transparency
anti-stain protecting easy install no
bubble so essentially yes stick it on to
your iPad 2 let's go ahead and open it
up and then I will attempt to install it
so it just pulls back on the tab at
least in theory you pull back on the
town come here tab tabby got it all
right i'm just going to rip this sucker
open tab on your tab and didn't do much
aha finger was a magic trick we'll go
ahead and slide the stuff out and you
shouldn't in theory even know that it's
there so the instructions are pretty
simple you peel off some stuff you peel
off some other stuff stick and you'll
wipe I'll which are very similar
instructions to doing something else so
I'm going to go ahead and give this guy
a shot and try to install it so I'll
leave the camera on and I'll put it on
fast-forward and you guys can watch
install process if you like
and that was really it no bubbles to
wipe out and most importantly no more
glare so you can see it's in the same
spot I'll move it around and see where
the light was so you can see the direct
light when it hits it as far as stuff
reflecting from outside it's much easier
to see and I meant Lee you can just peel
it right off no residue left behind so
that's actually quite nice somebody get
this for a little while see how it works
I'll let you guys know if it's helpful
or hurts my eyes doesn't really affect
the screen at all you've ever used any
sort of anti glare protection on your
iPhone or Android device or any other
phone or tablet you know what this looks
like it's pretty standard but really
it's incredibly helpful and hopefully
you will save my eyes and keep me
reading your comments for the next few
years so i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you the next
video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
