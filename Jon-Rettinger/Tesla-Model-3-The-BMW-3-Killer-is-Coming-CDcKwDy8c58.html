to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone welcome back their pursuit of
Retton Drew's wrist I'm British John
wrench in this week let's talk some
Tesla they just unveiled what they
thought was going to be the model III
have to be called something else and
they talked a little bit about sex this
is an odd renders wrists go and get
started so let's you've been living
under a tech rock the past few years
you've probably heard of Tesla Motors
they're a huge disruptive company based
out of Silicon Valley that makes
electric automobiles and run by a sort
of the mad genius Elon Musk they've
totally disrupted the auto world their
flagship car the Model S is available
now on a certain when it came out just
about a year and a half ago it's pretty
revolutionary so first off fully
electric I was designed to be electric
from day one so the batteries on the
bottom it's got a low center of gravity
thing is super fast performance model is
faster than a stock 911 you can get the
car at the range of up to three hundred
miles and it's absolutely gorgeous to
look at it's got a trunk in the front
because there's no engine as a Consumer
Reports best car they've ever tested it
was automobile magazines car of the year
it's been winning just crazy amount of
awards the stock price is going through
the roof and it's been sort of pretty
awesome for Tesla so before the Model S
came out they had a roadster was based
on a Lotus Elise platform is a sort of a
small sports car Dunster proved they
could do with EVs
I also get some money when they tried to
make their Model S so the Model S is out
now their next generation cars are
coming out with I will be the Model X
it's an SUV with sort of crazy cool
falcon doors like open up like this pie
looks cooler than that feeling ugly a
raptor
opens up like this and the idea behind
that Editions kind of looking cool is
that you can get access right to the
second third row seats while still
standing up if you've got kids or have a
lot of groceries sort of leaning forward
to get them in and out can be really
hard on your back and I could sort of
attest to that so if you're following me
the Roadster was there Jen one car there
Model S is George in two car the Model X
is based on my les let's steal gen 2
that leaves gen 3 a Tesla's been touting
pretty much since the Model S was
announced the gen 3 car is supposed to
be
um is a spout $35,000 priced car with a
200 mile electric range which means it's
got cars like the BMW 3-series out EA
for the Mercedes c-class square in its
sights that's really been the sweet spot
for Tesla sort of get mass market
penetration so the rumor was the car was
going to be called the model II thanks
for following along that would mean
Tesla would have the Model S the model E
and the Model X Tesla's last running
call Elon Musk when asked about model 3
said we tried to call it the model even
those two close of Ford's patents and
threatened to sue us Ford tried to kill
sex so earlier this week Tesla took the
twitter account to say they're third
generation car is going to be called the
very unsexy Model 3 with the three being
Roman numeral so it looks like Annie
just flipped on its sides oh ha ha
joke's on you Ford so how was it good
and be a 200 mile car with a $35,000
price tag that's sort of a big question
so the Model S is built of aluminum
super expensive lightweight this gen car
I'll be built supposedly on steel using
battery technology the Model S battery
pack supposedly is about 40 or 50
thousand dollars of its $70,000 starting
price point so super expensive they're
gonna be using batteries you can be
built from there Newton Giga factory
which is fancy term for them making
their own battery packs somewhere here
in the US so that should hopefully lower
cost they're saying the cards can be
unveiled in 2016 with a mass market
availability 2017 that ain't gonna
happen
I would say it's going to be better year
past that the model a supposed to be for
the Model X rather supposed to be
shipping about a year ago
now it's been delayed almost two years I
think Tesla's gonna need a lot more time
to get that cost down and they say
things like almost are up to 200 mile
range don't think your cars you can get
200 miles the Model S has an up to 300
mile range but sort of real world is
about 230 that's what's to charge your
car we up to 100% it's bad for the
battery pack to do about a 80% charge on
its that drop your range right there if
you get big tires you have a lot of
weight in the card all these kind of
variables how fast you're driving drop
your range if you're going 55 miles an
hour with no wind
it's or about a steady speed and yeah
you might get those ranges but real
world just eight
gonna happen you stop my Tesla story for
a quick sec to thank the good peeps at
Dollar Shave Club if your dude you know
the bike racers generally sucks you got
to go to the store you got to ask
someone for the Keeks I think you're
gonna steal those razor two anyway then
you got to shell out 20 30 40 bucks for
some stupid shake you don't need like I
don't need like a Dyson style ball on my
razor
the Rangers worked fine before vibrating
handles and stupid laser pointers but
fortunately there's a company that's
just making things better dunno like all
that silliness
it's called Dollar Shave Club and they
made it super simple for just a few
bucks a month Dollar Shave Club ships
amazing razors and other bathroom
related stuff right to your door so not
to get dressed to go do stuff that's why
we should have a good product if I can
get about getting dressed I'm super
happy
the razors are just as good as a big
shave companies just a fraction of the
price which is even better
that's per pants on and you save money
you've also got things like dr. Carver's
easy shave butter to make your shave the
more buttery smooth and silky check them
out at dollarshaveclub.com slash
TechnoBuffalo let's dollarshaveclub.com
slash icon buffalo now back to Tesla
Talk
so this is the car I think you really
changed or the way we look at cars it's
sort of a really big sort of paradigm
shift if they can get this car to $35
and dollar price and a 160 to 200 mile
range that's enough for most people you
know that's a 50 mile a day commute
there and back without any sort of
worries that's a car it's going to push
Evy maker store I think to try and sort
of see what else they can do right now
Evie adopted in pretty slow BMW started
there's Iran with their I 3 in the i8
but they don't have the similar range
they get with doing where you're going
to get with the tesla gen 3 or even with
the Model S right now
I think if Tesla can pull this off it's
going to force other automakers to react
to this it's going to force outer you to
push your each on Tisha to farther it's
going to push I think BMW to release an
i-5 with a longer range I'll see the
other manufacturers have to do but this
is now and it's coming in just a few
years in it's really cool to see we
don't know what the car is going to look
like yet it's not going to be based on
the Model S platform it'll be all new
and around 2016 2017 should be right
around when the Model S gets a redesign
so maybe look like a like a baby Model S
no one knows you get what's gonna look
like there are some fake renders
floating around but for the Tesla design
you can probably guess gonna be a pretty
good-looking car the cars are actually
gorgeous so what do you guys think would
this be the car of your dreams that you
don't have to worry about filling up
with gas you can use Tesla's free
superchargers you can get almost 100%
charge in probably in close to 20
minutes all the battery pack of that
size I'm guessing they'll be in the 45
kilowatt hour range I don't I just want
to hear your thoughts on leave the
comments down below I think that would
be a card most people would just dying
to get their hands on but what do you
guys think leave it right here until
next time I'm John Ranger from
