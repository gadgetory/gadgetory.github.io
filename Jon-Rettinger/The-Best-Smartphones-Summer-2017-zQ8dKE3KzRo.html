want to thank our sponsors anchor you
probably already know who they are but
if some reason you don't they are
America's leading USB charging brand
they've got awesome products including
the power cord plus PD it's a insane
twenty six thousand eight hundred
million power batteries and it will
charge your MacBook and USB C stuffs at
full speed and if you stay tuned till
the end of the video I will tell you how
ten people come in two thousand dollars
each we are over halfway through 2017
and by my made-up figures over three
hundred and seventy eight new
smartphones have been released during
that period of time it can be hard to
figure out which one to get and perhaps
you bought one and you want your
decisions to be justified or you want
opportunity to yell at me in the
comments I have for you the best
smartphones broken down by category thus
far in 2017 with the caveat if there are
still a lot of phones coming out at the
end of the year your iPhones your notes
that are still yet to be released will
do a video at the end of 2017 the best
phones of the entire year but thus far
here are the best smartphones 2017
so the first category we've got of our
mid 2017 awards is camera a lot of
reasons that you guys buy phones the big
factor for why I buy phones and
manufacturers have been upping their
camera game all year and the winner for
best camera goes to a device that
actually came out last year the Google
pixel and the Google pixel XL show some
love for the HTC and Google love child
distinct skill takes the best pictures
of any smartphone going despite the
galaxy s a to the world I will still
pick a Google pixel camera so next let's
go to the biggest determining factor for
me for phones and that is screen and
this should probably come as no surprise
but the winner of the best screen goes
to Samsung for the galaxy s 8 and the
galaxy s 8 plus their quad HD Super
AMOLED panels still look amazing to me
after using it every day since launch it
looks like a sticker on the screen the
pixel density is absolutely incredible
it's either 570 or 529 depending on
which phone and the screens just look
absolutely beautiful I'll be it a little
bit saturated if I'm picking up a phone
based on the best screen the best screen
technology it is Samsung's devices every
single day on them so no matter how good
a camera is or how good a screen is
they're only decent if they got battery
life to keep them going the next
category is battery if you want the
phone the best battery life going right
now you're going to go to your local
Apple Store and pick up an iPhone 7 plus
alpha will tell you this with the
milliamp hours at 2900 and this thing is
going to last and last you want to
quantify it a little bit they'll give
you 16 days on standby 15 hours is Wi-Fi
internet use but for some of you use the
phone pretty heavily I generally got the
end of my day mat 50 50 percent left I
could go two days on an iPhone 7 plus
battery some battery management which
for me is absolutely unheard of
if you want to fold what's going to last
and last iPhone 7 plus
so next let's jump into software I can
already feel the rage building in some
of you being like Oh John I know what
you're going to do you don't I got a
surprise for you the phone that has the
best software one plus five oxygen OS is
incredible it offers the best of stock
Android you get with the pixel a ton of
improvements built-in user customization
for almost every aspect every facet of
Android lets you make it your own they
added a ton of their own software tweaks
I absolutely love what oneplus is done
despite it having some hiccups if I'm
picking up the phone right now for the
best software think I'm still going one
plus so what if you want a phone that
just has kind of the best of everything
that's kind of got a lot of cool stuff
you can't get in any other phone this is
the intangible category if you lost your
recent versus videos this one should
probably not be a gigantic surprise to
you
this phone brings all the things you'd
expect from flagship it is the Galaxy s8
and the Galaxy s8 plus it brings so much
to the table and the feature set that
you almost can't get in any other phone
if I'm buying a device just for
intangibles little things that make up a
giant awesome package go and make a joke
it goes to the Galaxy s8 and the Galaxy
s8 plus last but definitely not least
what about value this isn't the best
budget category we have a new video
coming out soon it'll give you the best
phones under certain price points but
this is getting the best and most phone
for your dollar and that goes to the one
plus five not the gigantic version of
eight gigs of RAM this is the one it
gives you six gigs of RAM Snapdragon 835
for 479 bucks of course you get the
awesome software we talked about with
oxygen OS on the one plus five it is a
really well-rounded package you get a
killer dual camera system you're getting
a really good value for the dollar and
it's not again not the cheapest phone
that you can buy it's not the best phone
under 200 bucks
it's not the following to do the best
value per dollar look no farther than
the one plus five so I told you if you
wait it to the end of the video I would
tell you how
ten people could win $2,000 and an
anchor power pack which is pretty
awesome so you could spend your money
and keep your gadgets charged up so let
me tell you what you guys got to do and
how you can win so it'll be a link in
the description I'll give you the full
details but here are the general
highlights and how you could win one of
these 10 awesome packs the first you got
to create a video no more than 1 minute
long about a kind of unpleasant awkward
situation when you ran out of juice
you could be as comedic theatrical you
do whatever you want to make sure you
end the video by saying anchor hour done
so to recap 10 creator is going to win
$2,000 and an anchor power pack
including a premium portable charger
extra durable cable and definitely more
there are a few more things to know link
everything down below but the gist is
you can win $2,000 an awesome anchor
power pack and you get to make a fun
video telling an awkward story so minute
2017 I know we've got a ton of other
smartphones coming out like I mentioned
you've got your notes you got your pixel
twos your new iPhones LG v30 is getting
ready to hit the market we're going to
update this video at the end of 2017
there's been a lot of devices that have
come out perhaps you bought one of the
for that one of these categories perhaps
not you disagree with me I know I'm
probably going to get a little bit of
pushback for the software decision so I
could take it let me know in the
comments down below until next time I'm
