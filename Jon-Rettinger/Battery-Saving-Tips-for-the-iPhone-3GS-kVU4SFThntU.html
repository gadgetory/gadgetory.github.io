and i want to give you some battery
saving tips for the iphone 3g and the
iphone 3gs so when I first got my iphone
3g about a year ago it was well-known
the battery was not fantastic on the
first thing i used it i charged it all
the way up i took it off the charger on
6am and come noontime thing was dead the
next week with same amount usage not was
get until three o'clock the next week
even with the same amount of usage then
i was something getting a four o'clock
five o'clock and i started to get much
longer battery life out of the device
and I kept my usage contacts I really
was monitoring it very closely so I want
to share with you some of the tips that
I loaded with the 3g that have carried
over to the 3gs that have helped me
maximize battery life the 3gs does claim
much better battery left in the 3g and
i'll show you how to maximize that to
its fullest potential so the first thing
that i recommend is calibrating the
battery so calibrating the battery is
you might be familiar with that term
from your laptop so when you use your
device essentially you have a memory
meter in the upper right hand corner
either you displaying the number or a
visual representation that visual
representation might not always be so
accurate essentially what the phone need
is a reference point and what
calibrating does it gives it an accurate
reference point it updates it so the
reference point that was in there with a
photo shift was accurate but a few days
or weeks or even months later the
reference point may have shifted so well
in your phone says you have twenty
percent battery left you in fact may
have thirty forty percent or even ten
percent left so to calibrate your
battery and give you more accurate sense
of what you have it's very easy to do
first backup your phone just in case use
it until it dies once you get the twenty
percent morning at ten percent warning
and the thing will just shut off take
your phone plug it into the wall and let
it sit for a good eight nine ten hours
up to 12 hours if you can essentially
what this does it brings a battery down
to zero and from that zero standpoint is
that which the new reference point back
up to a hundred percent
these little battery technologies don't
really have memory or these you're not
supposed to but I have found that
battery conditioning can also really
help lengthen the life of the battery
and with all that means is just use your
phone you'll see that the first day you
use your 3gs or your new 3g that you're
better luck isn't going to be fantastic
don't get discouraged keep using the
phone use it charge like you normally
would and your battery life will
increase I've had the 3gs now for well
exactly a week and my battery life has
already increased drastically it's like
that to continue probably the next two
to three weeks so when I was telling you
about my 3g how it would last me till
noon by the time I finally gave it to my
father last week I can get a good day
day and a half out of battery life that
was just with conditioning and
calibrating the battery probably every
three or four months so hope that was
helpful let me show you some other
battery tips saving tips you can do
right on the phone so let's go ahead and
take a look down so here is the iphone
3gs these tips will work on the first
gen iphone and the 3g so the first thing
i could recommend and really the thing
that you can do to see the biggest
increase in your battery life is to
change the brightness so go to settings
go to brightness and pull it all the way
down or at least a level we're
comfortable at I will say though that
while I'm saying to do this I generally
keep the brightness up relatively high
on my phone it's turned down right now
because the bright doesn't always show
up best on the camera but turning
brightness down will definitely help
with battery also auto brightness turn
that on that will automatically adjust
the phone's keep saying right it's a lot
but it'll just the brightness level to
optimize your battery and for the
environment around you so for those of
you using a 3gs or any device really
with push notifications if you turn
those off you will also get increased
battery life especially if you're using
devices or applications that take
advantage of push that does take some
battery life it's not drastic but it's a
little bit of an increase that you can
get the next thing is Wi-Fi asked to
join network turn that off if it doesn't
turn off your Wi-Fi it just turns off a
little notification that pops up let you
know there are Wi-Fi hotspots so most of
time we're
in Wi-Fi you generally know where those
hot spots are in a place where you don't
you can always just check like I did
right now and go into Wi-Fi and seal a
different network you can still connect
it just turns off notifications really
just some simple steps the next thing if
you're like me use speakerphone quite a
bit when using speakerphone hit the top
button that'll turn off the screen you
can still use the speaker just as you
would be for definitely I think helps
with battery saving because you don't
have to light up the screen so guys hope
you enjoy want to give you just some
real simple easy tips to help maximize
your iphone's battery life if I miss
some tips and maybe you've come up with
leave them in the comments you know I'm
sure people would love to find ways to
help maximize the battery life on their
device anyway hope you enjoyed for
