to you by Citrix what's going on guys
the markings hangar from TechnoBuffalo
and I don't know about you guys but I do
not like TouchWiz one bit I jump back
and forth between the note 4 and the
Nexus 5 often and every time I go back
using TouchWiz I immediately remember
why I prefer the stock Android
experience that's a huge bummer too
because the note 4 is such an awesome
device with that being said we're going
to try to replicate stock Android on the
Galaxy Note 4 this will work with pretty
much any Android device that comes with
an OEM skin whether that's from LG Sony
or HTC so first we're going to need to
install a custom launcher now a custom
launcher is basically your home screen
it's where your icons and widgets live
now you have two options for this
launcher you have the Google now
launcher which is Google's personal
launcher but if you want a bit more
customization then go ahead and use Nova
Launcher you can find both of these
launchers on the Google Play Store both
launchers are free but with the nova
launcher you can buy the prime version
for $4 which includes unread counts
ability to hide apps and more so taking
a look at the Google now launcher first
it's pretty plain it works just like any
other ordinary launcher you'll be able
to add widgets multiple pages add your
icons etc you can also get the Google
now page the most left of your home
screen which is great if you use Google
now on a daily basis you won't be able
to change your icon packs which is kind
of a bummer this is as close as you'll
get to stock Android if you want to
fine-tune your homescreen and tinker
with your device for hours and don't
really care about the Google now page
check out Nova Launcher now this is my
go-to launcher if I want to customize my
homescreen
and just like any launchers you'll be
able to add widgets have multiple pages
and you'll be able to use custom icon
packs which is great now currently I'm
using the moonshine icon pack alongside
of stock Google's icons for my
homescreen I've highlighted moonshine
several times already in past videos
it's great for replicating Android
lollipop sigh cons and the best thing
about it is it's free now I'm using Nova
Launcher more than the Google now
launcher for a couple of reasons
number one I have the flexibility to
customize my homescreen and use I
compacts
number two I can replicate the Google
now launcher to a certain extent now
even though I don't have the Google now
page on the most left of my homescreen I
still have access to Google now number
three I can still activate Google Voice
come in by just saying okay Google
it works flawlessly number four I'm
using Nova Launcher prime and since I'm
using that I can hide unwanted apps and
blow we're in the app drawer number five
since I'm using the note 4 I can press
and hold the home button for the Google
now page so let's talk about how you can
achieve this look first go to your nova
launcher settings pane click desktop
change the grade to 4x4 and uncheck sub
grid positioning go back click position
search bar and hit lollipop go to scroll
effect and choose none and go back once
more and go to the drawer change the
color to background to white and
transparency to zero check show pages as
cards go to scroll effects and choose
none transition animations to circle and
go to tab style and choose small tabs go
back once more when you go to look and
feel for the icon theme I chose
moonshine you could use another icon
pack if you'd like but I chose to go
with this one change the icon size to
115 percent change the icon font to
normal and app animations to slide up
last but not least there's ok Google
just enable that and you should be all
set
moving forward to the lockscreen there
weren't really a lot of options that
could replicate lollypops lockscreen I
actually ended up using a lockscreen
that didn't have to do anything with the
word lollipop and it's called high
Locker now as silly as that sounds it
works really well make sure to change
the unlock style to lollipop before you
start using it and also change the clock
style to the third option so you can get
the same look high Locker is free with a
few premium options for the weather and
clock though it's really not necessary
to buy the premium version if you don't
want to so what's cool about this
lockscreen is you'll be able to change
the dialer and camera shortcuts to
whichever app you want now I have
dollars set to a custom app called
simpler dialer which sort of replicates
the look of Android lollipops dialer and
the other one I have set to the Google
camera of course you can choose not to
do this but since we're trying to get
rid of most of Samson zone apps this is
the best way to go in my opinion you'll
be able to see notifications in Google
now cards on the lockscreen although you
won't get lollipop card style
notifications you can swipe to dismiss
or launch them which I found to be very
useful you can also set a security
pattern or a code to add a layer of
security and there are a few lockscreen
alternatives I've tried in the past that
just fails its security this one works
flawlessly however also you can add
trusted Wi-Fi connection to unlock your
device
right away if you are connected at home
or if work let me stop the video for
just a quick second and thank our
friends over at Citrix we go through a
system of support you can provide live
or unattended support to any computer or
mobile device sign up today for a 30-day
free trial no contract no credit card
needed visit go to assist calming click
to try it free button now and since
everybody loves free stuff if you buy
the annual plan before March 31st you'll
get a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 as well so
that's now in terms of app there's a few
you can download from the Google Play
Store that can essentially replace
Samsung's own apps the Google camera app
for example is a really good alternative
to Samsung's own camera app the calendar
from Google which looks amazing and it
has that material design look you can
also download Google's Messenger app
which is a great alternative to hangouts
giving you the same material design
elements as the calendar app I also
downloaded some third-party apps like
simpler dial and contacts the dialer
which you saw earlier sort of looks like
Android lollypops dialer and if you want
to view your contacts you'd have to
download the simpler contacts though
everything works flawlessly after
downloading both I also downloaded
material calculator and clock ljus to
give the calculator and clock app that
same material design look and that's
pretty much it unfortunately you won't
be able to change the status bar or the
Settings app but this is as close as
you'll get to stock Android look on
TouchWiz without really rooting your
device or switching roms
some of lollypops functionality is in
here like the lockscreen notifications
but it still looks way better than
Samsung's own skin now the great thing
about this is you'll still be able to
use all of Samsung's features like the
s-pen multi window mode ultra power
saving mode and other samsung features
as well everything is still snappy maybe
even snappier than before and once we
get Android lollipop on the note 4 it
should look even better anyways that's
it for this video guys if you guys have
any questions or suggestions for which
apps we should check out for the note 4
to make it even better let us know in
the comments down below and if you liked
this video give it a thumbs up hit the

you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
