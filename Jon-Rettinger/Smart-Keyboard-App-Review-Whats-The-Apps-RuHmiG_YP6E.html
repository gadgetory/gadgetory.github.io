John Q here from TechnoBuffalo calm and
welcome to what's the apps a simple
little app review show here in
TechnoBuffalo with a rather fancy name
don't you think
today we're going to venture into
Android OS to take a look at an
application called smart keyboard thanks
to the totally awesome John venture for
sending me the Google Nexus One so that
I can finally experience Android first
hand now I am a very big UI and
functionality person and to be honest
I'm still having some trouble adjusting
to Android OS mainly because I've become
so used to you know the other guy right
off the bat I noticed that the typing
experience wasn't as fluid maybe it's
because the Nexus 1 is pretty old
compared to the newer guys but the
multi-touch screen didn't feel like it
could keep up with my obscene
tap-tap-tapping and on top of that I
didn't really like how the default
keyboard looked from what I've heard I
knew Android was very very customizable
you can change the icons the keyboard
layout whatever so I started doing some
research on keyboard alternatives after
reading a bunch of reviews and
downloading various apps from the
marketplace I settled on an app called
Smart keyboard and let me tell you this
thing is a masterpiece anything and
everything you can think of to customize
your keyboard you can do with smart
keyboard the only thing that's really
missing would be an implementation of a
swipe style typing feature which is
totally understandable because you know
copyright and whatnot there were three
things I knew I wanted to do right away
change the keyboard skin change the
keyboard sounds and somehow make the
spacebar bigger smart keyboard has a
great selection of skins to choose from
most of them look very default and very
native which is something I really
really appreciate in terms of
functionality the HTC or the Samsung
skin would probably be the best ones
personally I stuck with a black skin to
give my Nexus that Windows Phone 7 feel
cuz I'm cool like that
next keyboard sounds ever since I
started using a mechanical keyboard I've
become very particular on type of
mechanics and feedback plus I really
taken a liking to that awesome clicky
clicky sound okay the default Android
keyboard sounds aren't bad but I wanted
something a little bit less tinny
sounding
smart Keyboard lesson choose between the
default Android sound the iPhone sound
and the Samsung sound the Samsung sound
seems to work best for me as it's loud
enough to be audible but it's not too
loud where it's annoying
lastly the spacebar I always seem to
miss a spacebar when I type I have no
idea why androids default spacebar size
is a little squish as there's that voice
input button but with smart keyboard I
was able to remove it plus I can move
the comma and the period to the symbols
area for maximum keyboard pwnage
beautiful as an added bonus you can also
increase a patting size on the bottom
for more room you can go totally crazy
with this one oh yes the things I
mentioned only scratched the surface of
what smart keyboard can do you can also
do t9 mode compact mode arrows
transparency key height user dictionary
smart dictionary additional language
support gestures calibration and more
skins all of these fancy text prediction
options and much much much much more
best of all it's totally free the only
downside is that the free version has a
pop-up every now and then saying oh if
you don't want to see this pop-up again
buy the full version I didn't say that
but but that's a gist of what it said
according to market the paid version is
276 Canadian to be honest I only saw
that pop-up thing once so it's not too
bad but I'm probably going to pick up a
pro version anyways as should you
because I rate smart Keyboard a solid 5
out of 5 for its functionality usability
customizability and because the skins
they look really really pretty so if you
want to jazz up your Android typing
experience seriously check out smart
keyboard and thank you very much for
checking out this episode of what see
apps this is John Q from TechnoBuffalo
have yourselves a fantastic day now see
you guys next time take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
