comes to their flagship phones we've got
two in the ever-expanding p-series line
of phones and sitting at the very top
end and I wish we had one to show you
it's a Porsche designed hallway and it
looks absolutely incredible we've got I
think sort of the two in the sweet spot
I got the p20 Pro and EP 20 but focus
mostly on the pro here if you want to
see a separate video though on the 20
just let us know in the comments down
below so of course like a triple camera
we'll talk plenty about that it's
available in your standard colours like
blues and blacks and gold but you don't
want those colors the colors you're
going to want is this blue that it's
called Twilight because it looks like
Twilight and serve a gradient of colors
from blue to pink the purples and it
looks absolutely gorgeous in person
we're gonna spend a lot of time on the
phone but just real quickly so you get
in the box
we've got a USBC power cable god USBC
headphones we've got a dongle for 3.5
million headset jack cuz it don't got
one and we got a power brick and this is
probably your first sign this is not a
u.s. phone we talked about qual way in
the news at length but not a u.s. phone
but there'll be plenty of ways to get it
in the US if it's something you said you
want to do so turning the phone all you
notice a lot of things now I'm just
going to get this one out of the way
right away it's got its got a knotch
an android 8 and it's actually based on
Android 8.1 it's running hallways mu I
also 8.1 which is nice made easy for me
to remember but Android doesn't handle
notches all that well it will then get
to Android 9.0 and Android P but right
now apps look weird with notches so why
did something interesting you can
actually turn the knotch
off in software it's gonna sort of turn
it into it kinda like a second screen on
top and since it is an AMOLED panel that
kind of looks totally black so a couple
other interesting things with this so it
does have a facial unlock on you set it
up it looks like directly taken from the
iPhone 10 I can't talk for how secure
the facial unlocking software is here
but it unlocks
crazy fast I thought the galaxy s 9s 9
plus facial unlocking was fast this is
even faster it unlocks as quickly as I
can push the button so I do like that
Huawei put stereo speakers on here and
they
really loud it's not as full of sound I
think is what you get with the iPhone 10
the Galaxy S 9 but if loudness is your
jam these are definitely loud speakers
and they're still pretty good so the
screen it's a 6.1 inch screen it's like
a little bit better than 1080p it's
actually a HD plus but it does look
pretty good would have liked to see in a
full 2k screen here even though that
often times get scaled down it does look
good of course being an OLED panel the
black get really black and the colors do
look vibrant but you can't see a
difference when you compare it to other
flagships side-by-side aside from the
awesome color the big story with the pro
isn't the cameras you can tell there are
three of them and that's something new
so the first camera the press release
says it's a 40 megapixel camera it's not
quite the whole story it takes 40
megapixel images but the sensor itself
is not we'll talk about that more when
we do the full review the second camera
is actually a 20 megapixel sensor and
the third one is actually gonna be your
telephoto and it does zoom really well
it actually does a three times optical
zoom which if you're keeping track at
home is one time better than the iPhone
10 the galaxy s 9 but beyond that it'll
do a 5 times you middle so it'll do 2 on
the optical and it looks really good
this is where a lot of Huawei's AI
starts to come into play it'll know what
you taking pictures up so if you're
taking pictures of a blue sky I don't
know it's a blue sky and it'll adjust
appropriately a face I don't know its
face we put a document in front of it
and knew it was a document and got ready
to sort of scan it it's really cool what
it can do when you take 1080 video you
get not one not two but three different
stabilizations
- we've seen before so you've got
optical and you've got digital and then
always saying the third one is AI
stabilization which seems to be like
software stabilization kind of what you
would do in post but it works really
well with the caveat in normal light so
I took a video just walking down a hall
and walking around outside you could not
even tell that was moving I even jumped
and it looked really good when I tried
to do it though in low light you could
really start to see some jitters start
to happen so I wouldn't rely on all the
stabilization is for low-light when it
comes to video have you switched the
resolution up to 4k for video though you
are gonna lose a lot of that
stabilization just become
a regular shaky camera so there's a lot
of awesome stuff in the p20 Pro but what
might be the craziest it's got a four
thousand milliamp hour battery which
sounds awesome to say out loud it's not
the finished phone in the world and it
does have camera humps and all that
stuff but four thousand milliamp hour
battery
let me forgive a lot of things and again
it's not a full reviewed as first
impressions so this has been the Huawei
P 20 pro it's it's got a notch the
notches are pronounced it might as well
designed minecraft but it's a really
nice looking phone it's well-built the
phone feels solid and premium it's gonna
cost around 800 pounds up to 900 pounds
so buy my key currency math give me
about a thousand bucks us so you can get
one in I wanna see us do a full review
they'll give the video a thumbs up to
let us know till next time john ruetten
