to you by Linda calm hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley it's gather any question you
might have from the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo calm
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise you can send them to
me anytime on twitter at TechnoBuffalo
or at ashleys getha just use the hashtag
ask the be so i can see it usually i
answer between three and five questions
every episode but it's the last episode
of the year so i'm gonna count down my
top five devices of 2013 it wasn't easy
to narrow it down this much but i'll do
my best this is ask the Buffalo before I
begin I should mention that each of
these items are kind of my favorite
devices in their respective categories
so without further ado number 5 on my
list is the pebble smartwatch it's still
the all-time record holder on
kickstarter for most funding raised over
10.2 million dollars and there's a
reason it's so popular I have found my
pebble to be a really nice complement to
my smartphone it's not a replacement
device but it is really nice to have a
watch on hand so you're not constantly
pulling out your phone at dinner to see
who's just emailed your texted and I
personally use pebble to decide if I
need or want to respond to whatever
notification is incoming as opposed to
dedicating time to every single piece of
spam that comes to my inbox that's a
really big deal for me and that alone
not to mention pebbles really nice
subtle elegant design makes a huge win
in my book next up the Moto X this was
actually my smartphone of the year and
as I explained in the article that we
wrote it must seem really weird to see
me a pic that phone since I love the HTC
One and I use the iPhone 5s is my daily
driver but there's a reason for this
particular choice I think it's brilliant
Motorola chose to focus on personal
experience and style with the Moto X
it's more than capable of handling most
people's day-to-day needs and moto maker
is friggin awesome for customization and
at this point in my life I'm more
interested in how my phone can cater to
my personal needs as opposed to how
crazy they can make the specs I don't
need gimmicks I just need results and
the Moto X really showed what
personalization of phones
could lead to in the future and now
something a little bit different the
nest protect I'm recently a new
homeowner for the first time and for
whatever reason it brings out all the
paranoia I'm super convinced that my
built in 1955 house is going to go up in
flames any time I'm away from it or that
I'll be murdered by the wall heater
emitting carbon monoxide while I sleep
so that's why I am really glad the nest
protect showed up when it did now i can
sleep pretty soundly knowing the protect
will keep its sensors peeled for dangers
and i know that a lot of sensors that
are a lot cheaper can do the same thing
but my husband and i like to cook and
sometimes it gets a little smoky inside
i know a lot of people get annoyed at
their smoke detectors for being way too
overly sensitive and they take out the
batteries but then forget to put them
back in because we've all been there now
i just wave it the nest protect to tell
it there's no fire and i have just
simply overheated my saut√© pan up next
the ipad mini with retina I didn't
actually upgrade my iPad last year
because I was interested in the mini but
I didn't want a non retina screen and I
also didn't really want an ipad 4th gen
since I've felt like that 9.7 inch form
factor was kind of bulky for me and I'm
really glad i waited a generation
because i am super enjoying the ipad
mini with retina i ended up getting a
cellular version which i've never wanted
to do before because it's so portable i
should mention here that the nexus 7 is
also an excellent alternative choice for
a smaller tablet if you love android and
cheaper to but because I spend a lot of
personal time in the iOS ecosystem and
iPad Mini made sense for me ah now i can
take it around town without needing a
second bag and uh well that's nothing
money can't buy i guess it can last but
certainly not least the chromecast this
was a pleasant surprise for everybody
when it dropped in the summer 35 bucks
to be able to stream media to your TV
from your android phone or tablet yes
please this is a gift i have given to so
many of my android using friends and
family members my dad loves using it so
much he actually sought out by himself
the nexus 5 on the Play Store which is a
really big deal for him you can't beat
the price tag the app support continues
to expand and it's a really great
solution for anybody who doesn't have a
smart TV or other solutions for content
streaming nexus q Who chromecast Azure
it's at and
success makes me really excited about
the future of devices like this from the
competition and not to mention Google
