go and finish dinner I check my phone so
I got an email and was from Ford asking
if I could be in New York for dinner the
next day I'm in California so that is
not a closed distance so i told them
politely that that was probably not
gonna happen because you know in
Southern California but they're doing
some kind of cool they're using the
technology in the ford escape and ford
in general to do and escape the room
type series i've always wanted to do an
escape the room I don't know what it is
they use these master puzzle makers to
create these puzzles and set of rooms
and you solve one puzzle and to go to
the next room in the next room and your
time is tracked through each room and if
you get the fastest time then you win
either pride or a prize so I was kind of
excited to try it so I move my schedule
around I hopped on a plane and I was off
to New York the next day off to New York
for like 12 12 hours should be a lot of
fun see what's new from the folks afford
come with me you wouldn't believe the
crazy look to get some people when
you're walking around filming yourself
people really buying stuff in here just
pick it up a para para digs at the
airport
it was a whirlwind trip I didn't land
until about 11pm so I missed dinner just
landed in New York it's about 10pm ready
yeah ready to rock for tomorrow went
right from JFK to the hotel put on my
pjs boom no Jane you went to sleep and
woke up early the next morning i headed
on over to the escape the room event and
appropriately named they had a ton of
escapes I gotta tear up with your
average consumer Gutner if you guys uh
no credible town on youtube you should
definitely check him out so our goal
here is to beat the room right escape
the room keep my goal is to a steep the
room there are puzzles they have they
called a master puzzle makers yeah but
someone could do it is one bad day away
from like being the guy from saw I meant
we got team name your average Buffalo
cuz i do you what else could it go for
it ready to go up to leaderboard the
idea of the game just to escape the room
but they think they made it a little
easy actually just they got us in this
like holding tank kind of area you guys
can see they got some ford escapes by
here hence the escape room it gave the
room we got to use a technology in the
ford escape to actually solve the puzzle
in the room this one is a single heart
okay my heart radio oh my gosh i hurt Oh
I don't want registration video oh there
we go ready to start the vehicle now you
press and hold on the engine start
button at least now I've got a joke for
us gender last time I got to the
comments this early remember there's
nada and we gotta we had to answer a lot
of puzzles figured things out and we use
the technology inside of the Ford to do
with will have it on camera if you hit
something get it really close to
something so far so good all right I
didn't crash so I am not actually gonna
park your car for you but I'm going to
show you how the vehicle will assist you
it's called enhanced active Park Assist
this is now I am NOT this is kind of
freaky guy this is awesome
future I've never experienced this
before and it's kind of amazing I came
away now impressed with myself and
juggler for his having a baller time on
escape the room but also pre impressed
with for DES offer from a technology
standpoint so I was in the air almost
longer than i was in new york i was
really happy to get home and kind of
decompress and look back on escaping the
room and I'm hoping that I get a chance
to escape another room if the guy could
set an even better time and as of this
filming right now only four teams have
beat our time it's running for another
three or four days so I think we could
finish in the top five so thank you guys
for coming along with me I feel like I
need to sleep for about six days you
guys ever done and escape the room how
did you do let me know about is my first
experience ever doing it I've been
wanting to for a while in the comments
down below give the video a thumbs up I
always appreciate if you liked this vlog
