am Robert Rosenfeld and this is the show
that breaks down the top stories the
Czech world every Tuesday and every
Thursday and I apologize for the lack of
low downs recently I've been covering
different events for many people are
calling tech Tober and I'm finally back
in the office and are ready to talk
about some tech news and I've got a lot
to cover today while we just released a
bunch of new flagship phones we're gonna
talk about all those Facebook is working
to put more cameras into your house and
the new iPad pros may pack one feature
that'll make Team Apple and Team Android
both very happy what about that for a
change
here's the lowdown
while we unveiled a fleet of new
flagship phones to take the camera setup
from the p20 Pro to a whole new level
the new mate 20 and mate 20 Pro look
very similar in terms of design and on
paper though there are a few differences
here to take note of the May 20 Pro has
got a six point four inch curved OLED
panel with a bit of a wider notch then
the teardrop notch on the irregular mate
20 that's got a slightly larger 6.5 inch
display both phones have very similar
internals powered by a keren 90
processor running on top of Android 9 pi
and while the probe comes standard with
6 gigs of RAM at 128 gigs of storage
space the mate 20 does not though that
configuration is an option when you go
to buy the phone with a big difference
between the mate 20 and the mate 20 Pro
is its camera setup the pro packs a 40
megapixel sensor with two additional
sensors on there as well a 20 megapixel
ultra wide lens and an 8 megapixel
telephoto lens that is in this square
configuration on the back looks kind of
cool the mate 20 also has this triple
camera setup though it's swapped see 40
and 20 megapixel sensors for 16 and 12
respectively the May 20 pro also has a
bit of a larger battery 4200 milliamp
hours over the 4000 in the mate 20 and
also has the ability to reverse wireless
charge meaning it can act like a
charging pad and wirelessly charge
another device the company also unveiled
a gigantic 7.2 inch mate 20x smartphone
that takes the term phablet to a whole
new level our own app Gonzales is there
in London covering all of the latest and
greatest news from Huawei so stay tuned
for a full video on the mate 20 and mate
20 pro coming soon but of course for
full pricing and availability in specs
in the meantime check out TechnoBuffalo
comm we've got you covered
Facebook is reportedly working on a new
streaming TV camera because that
Facebook portal just wasn't creepy
enough the project rumored to be called
a Ripley internally works similar to the
recently announced Facebook portal video
chat system but this may be a standalone
camera you can attach to your TV
basically turning your TV into a
gigantic Facebook portal that could also
stream content and the camera is
rumoured to have some streaming
functionality built in as similar to
maybe something like that of a Roku it
would allow customers to stream
sent from facebook watch Facebook's
YouTube competitor catalog of content we
don't have many more details about this
device what it would do price or
anything like that we're hearing it
could launch as early as this spring and
we are about halfway through the month
of October but we're still hearing
rumors that Apple could hold a special
event this month to introduce some new
hardware including some big updates to
the iPad pro we've seen some rumors of
the new updated iPad pros floating
around on the internet for the past few
months but new leaks seem to confirm the
already leaked details according to some
alleged CAD renders of the new iPad pro
the front of those new devices would
support an almost edge-to-edge display
with very thin bezels along with new
face ID hardware that would work in both
landscape and portrait orientations and
the headphone jack and home button are
getting removed no big surprises with
these rumors it's kind of something
we've been expecting for a while but the
rumor that Apple could remove the
lighting port in favor of the more
widely industry adopted USB C port is
kind of a surprise move that many
thought would just be a rumor but it
looks now that it actually may be
happening with these new iPad pros these
updates will not only be big for the
iPad pro line but if these new features
are true this multi orientation face ID
and the replacement of lightning for USB
see it could mean some big changes are
also coming to future iPhones as well so
definitely something to keep in mind and
keep your eye on we've got no word from
Apple if this event is actually going to
happen this fall even if it's going to
happen at all and again this is all just
rumors and speculation at this point so
we'll keep you guys updated if anything
changes on this but I thought this would
be a great question to posed you guys to
discuss in the comments down below how
do you feel if Apple was to actually
replace lightning with us PC not just on
the iPad pro but across all their
devices leave a comment down below and
let us know whether it'd make it easier
would it make your life more difficult
would you be happy to swap out your
lightning cables for USB C cables or to
make your life easier or harder leave a
comment down below and let us know if
you leave a comment you could be
featured on the next episode of the
lowdown alright guys that is all I've
got for today thank you so much as
always for watching just a quick little
housekeeping note here I will actually
not be here on Thursday we got a special
video going up on Thursday that some
things we've been teasing for a while
something different something fun you're
