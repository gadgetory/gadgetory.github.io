to you by netflix hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show her you can ask me
Ashley's gather any question you might
have from the wide world of technology
every Tuesday we put up a call for
questions on TechnoBuffalo calm you
could leave your question in the post
comments otherwise you can send them to
me anytime of the day or night on
twitter at TechnoBuffalo or at Ashley
ask evah just make sure you use the
hashtag ask the bees so I can see it now
usually I answer between three and five
questions every episode but this time
around for the holidays we figured we'd
answer some frequently asked questions
this is asked the Buffalo faq I figured
we had to bring in the original buffalo
jon rettinger say hi to everyone hi I to
answer some of these questions because
I've only been here a little while but
John's been here since day one so I
figured if there was a question I could
not answer if there was a problem John
would solve it if there's a problem yo
I'll solve it correct first question is
what phone should i buy this one or this
one we get this question a lot people
going what should I buy should I get
this or this what's the appropriate
answer the appropriate answer is what's
best for the person asking them the
question we've a ton of comparisons or
their versus the end of the day it's
what phone do you want if you ask a
question like hey which of these two
phones is better for media consumption
which of these two phones is better or
you know for typing which is whose
phones is better voice recognition or
better app store things like that we can
answer when just a general hey you
should I get the iphone 5s the Nexus 5
mostly they're both super good phones
like there's no way to answer that
question yeah you you can't answer that
so you know try and maybe give more and
more contacts but other than that
there's so many good phone it's almost
hard now to get a bad phone you know
than it is to find like that absolutely
perfect you know shangri-la phone which
probably doesn't exist it don't sorry
guys I can tell you that much that's an
answer for you when is insert rumored or
unofficial product here let's say just
for example the
i watch when is the iWatch gonna be
available to buy this is a question we
get a lot about lots of products from
apple to samsung to nokia to Microsoft
to everybody in between uh what is the
answer for this question so if I knew
the answer that question I would have
liked for d Lamborghinis the answer is
we don't know you know unofficial
product when we can say you knows what
we here for rumors so if an iWatch was
to be announced you know it would make
sense probably a june july announcement
you could say maybe august so you could
maybe second half of the year you know
would be something you could say but so
we're just guessing that's the honest
answer anybody who tells you they know
and then doesn't put a caveat of like
man is just straight up lying to you
nobody knows it could come tomorrow they
could announce it at CES and upstate to
everybody I mean um do you know they
probably won't but no I don't know I
even know people who work at Apple and I
don't even know though their ironclad
let me tell you yeah they always good to
go Beyonce sound just release it you
know @midnight @midnight they just drop
it there's like boom I want mic drop out
Apple out also when we get a lot where
is blank staff member so we get I where
is so-and-so where is John cute people
thought John Q was dead Oh junk you
better not be dead I talked to him this
morning so I hope not otherwise they're
like it's gonna be like a scary story
where they're like John quach has been
dead for ten years what do you mean he
sent you an email if you play one of our
videos backwards from about a year and a
half ago we actually reveal the whole
whole story in serve a Beatles ask
fashion um we did a video with John
quatrain it came down from Canada to
work the office and he was still here
answering all those questions but he is
still very much here he's actually
editing this video so maybe you can get
him to wave and say hi while he's
editing but he does a lot behind the
behind the camera her behind the scenes
he prefers me behind the scenes despite
how much i think we all would love to
have him in front of the camera more i
think and he's hilarious and i still say
this to John's face i think he would
have been one of the biggest and best
youtubers dime in the tech world out
there if he just would have kept with it
so you know maybe if you just keep
asking him to be on camera he will
acquiesce and be on camera i hope so
just keep asking he's reading your
comments also for anybody for asking
about anybody else
this is a pretty fluid industry people
come people go I wasn't here a year ago
now i'm here so I mean it just that's it
that's kind of the nature of the
business it's a job if you're in the
workforce you were somewhere else before
you were we're at now and you have jobs
after its people we try and to you know
keep everybody here but sometimes things
don't work out our people want to try
other things just sort of the nature of
the beast yeah nature of the business
especially in I mean especially in an
industry where there's a lot of
freelancing a lot of it you know there's
a lot of that stuff so it's it's hard to
find like the right fit so absolutely I
get it do i get why people Carrick say
it's more personal thing on you did you
get a chance to know people and you
serve and feel like you're losing a
friend when somebody leaves so I I
totally can understand and then the last
question my personal favorite how much
did you get paid to write x y z review
this is we get this on every review it's
like oh you guys I think in the span of
one day one time I got called and I'm
not kidding you an apple android
microsoft and even a webos fanboy like
like in one day god forbid you say
anything nice about any product
immediately that company pays you let me
tell you unequivocally and honestly and
just put this to bed a one-percent they
do not pay us for this not only would it
be incredibly illegal to do that it
would be super dishonest and so
unethical we would never ever ever do
that we do like at ever edges just did
you dad can I also add that a lot of
times we buy like we don't keep fault
like we'd send them back like devices
come to us and they go home like we have
to buy them with our own money like it's
not like Apple showers us with iphones
during iphone week and goes we hope you
write a great article about us know
apple isn't actually notorious for they
don't give review units to even review
units to anybody we have to go out and
buy stuff to review from them so yeah I
mean could you imagine if companies were
paying review I mean that would that is
a slippery slope for them yeah that
would be some I'm heck of a story and
it's different you know sponsors are
something totally different we always
disclose this is sponsored by writer
average
Kaiser's like people who yeah and we
never and I would never call that a
review I never let my staff call that a
review because it's not and it's not
fair to the audience but I people just
get so upset that's like immediately
like the gut reactions like oh they paid
you to do that because you can never say
anything nice about the product cuz I
don't like it right you know and then
that would make my own decisions seem
bad invalid it never happened it's great
like the last thing I will say is just
being here the reason why I personally
like be hers cuz we're pretty positive
about stuff like if we really hate
something we just don't cover it like I
we cover things we like unless it's you
know like wow this company really
screwed up but generally speaking we
like to see the good in things and
technology is freaking amazing sure how
much did I pay you to say that so much I
got the biggest check ever from George
Jetson to say technology is the best
ever I'm i don't know i like to keep it
positive like to find the good things in
products i agree the general rule for us
and we started this from day one a
techno Buffalo still today is will write
about in two videos on stuff that
interests us if there are too many
phones to review every single one too
many tablets and anybody who tries to
review every single one ether has a
gigantic staff and good for them or
they're not can get the attention and
time they deserve do a thorough review
that we like to call you know
technobuffalo style review so if it's
interesting we'll review it if it's not
we just won't we just say oh that's cool
like oh it's nice all right next like
cuz that's the bandwidth we have but
yeah that's a question we get all the
time like oh your guys are fanboys and I
mean I'll tell you right now you guys
John uses a surface like i do i love i
love surface i do i really am i using
the lumia 2520 20 °c and that's the
thing like we use products from every
ecosystem like there are i have a
samsung television that i really like i
have you know i have an iphone i love
HTC products I like pebble like we just
like good technology that's really at
the at the end of it we like good
technology but we're also where they
have their flaws yeah we're boils down
to be like the technology and bedrooms
definitely bad jokes I gotta interrupt
the show for a quick second to thank our
