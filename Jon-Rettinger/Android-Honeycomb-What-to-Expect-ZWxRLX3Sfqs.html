TechnoBuffalo here the YouTube
broadcasted Google honeycomb event just
wrapped up where they showed us a ton of
new will honeycomb ish features and what
we can expect from Google's first tablet
OS so let me go ahead and run you
through what they told us so if you see
me look down it's because I got some
notes in front of me the keynote
conference demonstration thing just
ended let's go ahead and jump right in
with the honeycomb UI was how they led
into the event showing a lot of the new
features of the honeycomb layout really
looks very different than any Android
operating system we've seen before
including the most recent version
Gingerbread so first as you'll see
there's a completely new layout there's
a brand new multitasking button which is
going to open up all of your apps
certainly it's going to be for
multitasking there's a new Google search
button you can see up there in the upper
left hand corner the bottom is now for
notification but to actually pop up with
images so someone's trying to voice call
you if you're getting an email any other
picture of them stored that you show up
right there in a very non intrusive way
a really augments the tablet experience
and really separates the tablet
experience from what we seen previously
on phones you also have the new Quick
Settings panel where you can jump in
just all of the basic settings that you
use is the most you know volume
brightness and those kind of things the
rest of the screen real estate is just
going to be used for apps and widgets
and they're going to be quite a few of
the apps and widgets first all old
Android applications will work so it
flows you have a worried about
fragmentation not to worry
it may not be optimized for honeycomb
but they will still work so if you love
your older version of Angry Birds don't
fret still be able to kill some pigs
also there's going to be something now
called funnily enough app fragmentation
which is kind of interesting it sounds
like fragmentation like different
platforms are supporting but actually
what it means is that inside of the
application
you can have different panels and
screens they demonstrated this with
Gmail so you've probably seen some
screenshots of a Gmail looks like on the
honeycomb but it definitely gives you
different panels so on one panel you can
have all of your email coming in on the
other panel you can have the actual text
of that email as you rotate it you can
move those panels around and that's what
they mean by fragmentation kind of
interesting it's actually be able to
drag applications around inside of
applications so inside the Gmail
application for example you can tap on a
message and actually drag it right to a
folder which is kind of a novel idea and
I think will really make a honeycomb a
immersive and separated experience so
immersive and unique so the next thing
they talked about was a new graphics
rendering engine called render script
which is going to be used for a lot of
the 3d stuff that you're going to see in
honeycomb demet rated on a few native
applications including the YouTube
player which is now new and redesigned
the surf has a 3d theater effect to it
just kind of neat so we'll definitely
see a lot of 3d capabilities as tablets
with dual cores come out needs to be
support for accessing both of those
cores alright so moving right along
there's also a new music app by the way
to take advantage that render scripts
Danny's got server coverflow esque look
and feel to it but it appears to be very
nice they also announced Google body
which is sort of like Google Maps for
people so you can go and peel back the
skin and look at the muscular system
circular system circulatory system
endocrine system whatever systems you
want to see if you want to see muscles
you want to see bones you can actually
go ahead and do that you could pan and
zoom actually all the way around a
person which is kind of neat perhaps a
little bit pretty but kind of kind of
cool to see so look for Google body
coming very soon there's also going to
be a new camera app which is kind of
nice you're gonna have full control over
the camera functionality of your
honeycomb tablet so white balance and
all those effects easy switching for
front-facing camera and of course you're
going to be full video chat capability
which is going to have image
stabilization
just kind of neat I did a they kept
waiting for him to show up they kept
doing or trying to get video chat with
Cee Lo Green so he showed up there
eventually
CNN came on stage to demonstrate a new
CNN application which is kind of neat
you get support for I report so if
you're witnessing news happening you can
record it with your tablet upload it to
our report and you can actually be part
of the news I didn't give a release date
or for the most part it's what you'd
expect from an immersive news app
there'll be video picture than a ton of
articles to choose from
nothing giant they will say it would be
available with the Motorola Xoom tablet
just presumably going to be the first
honeycomb tablet to hit the market
the next big news speaking of the market
does a very nice Segway is in the
Android Market we now have an Android
web app store which actually works
really cool you can go right to its
market Android com allow you to specify
that to be sure you can go ahead and
download applications now right from a
web browser directly to your device you
can browse by category featured
developers can actually embed YouTube
videos in their web page so you can sort
of see the applications a little bit
more and as you go ahead and hit by
they'll automatically send it right to
your device now Android fragmentation in
the real fragmentation so the support
for multiple operating systems has
really been a concern especially amongst
developers this helps take care of that
a little bit when you click on
application to buy if you have multiple
devices registered to your gmail account
it's going to show you which
applications are compatible with that
application so if you're running a
really older version of Android so you
got g1 and you also just picked up the
zoom I'm not all peeking they're going
to work on other platforms so these
quick an application I'll tell you you
know right in the list if you want to
send it to your if you want or send it
to your zoom and you can go ahead and
pick the one or both they're available
and send it right to there and they'll
start downloading automatically which is
kind of neat there's also going to be
support for in-app purchases some more
ways to gain folks your money you need
to provide virtual goods you can get
premium versions of games all that stuff
we've seen from in-app purchases in the
past on Apple's App Store it's also
going to be multiple currencies
important for developers so if you
developer and London and you're pricing
your stuff in pounds you now be able to
price any dollars and vice versa you
want to be sold in different markets
they'll be different currencies reports
that'll be sort of rolling out in phases
so if your developer it's probably
really good news to go out for you it's
also going to be support for multiple
multiple multiple applications so
certainly Android in the past could run
multitasking this is now sort of taking
a little step further going to be
genuine true multitasking taking
advantage of both dual cores
it's going to be really impressive had
chance to see the Motorola Xoom in
person I was the first tablet that's
used the new dual core platform I
believe it was rocking some Tegra 2
action this is very very capable of
putting out an immersive environment the
applications like gorgeous games look
fantastic if you were looking for not
even of a an iPad competitor anymore but
if you were watching people play iPad
games and looking longingly at your
Galaxy Tab to sort of have that same
experience yes I gotta have then perhaps
a little bit more now with Android and
really has come up to par very nicely
and it's trying to separate themselves
from the rest of the market I don't
think that we now have tablets as iPad
competitors I think that they are now
completely going to be on par of each
other and it's going to come down to a
matter of personal choice there are a
lot of fantastic tablet OS is coming in
a very near future and two great time to
be in the market so what do you guys
think of honeycomb that was a lot of
rambling for a short explanation I
wonder what you guys think you excited
not excited are you waiting to get a
honeycomb tablet do you not care you in
for an iPad 2
