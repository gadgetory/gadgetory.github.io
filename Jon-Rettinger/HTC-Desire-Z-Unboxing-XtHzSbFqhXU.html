from TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing
for you of the HTC Desire Z this is the
unlocked cousin of the t-mobile g2 so I
say what's up everyone in all my videos
but nobody ever answers me what's up so
in the comments tell me what's going on
with you alright so enough of that let's
go ahead and dig in and see what you're
gonna get with your desire Z so the
folks at clove Kota you can hook this up
with the desire Z let's take a quick
look at the box then we'll dig in take a
look at the phone specs and the rest of
the unboxing goodness you've got a
picture the phone on the front with a
little bit of its QWERTY keyboard
peeking out there from the side you got
nothing on the left is Siri typical HTC
box nothing over there you got some
specs on the back we'll run through
those oh I do like how it says for
platform
it just says Android Android the
platform to get updated so often that
oftentimes these phones by time they
reach market aren't accurate anymore
with what's printed on the back so here
is the Desire Z we will shall pull that
out of the plastic it's pulled out of
plastic push it off to the side let's go
ahead and lift up the tray we're going
to have your usual array of accessories
you've got a power adapter here it's
going to plug into the wall charger
right here it's gonna push right in this
one is for some European markets here
you can have a US one or use whatever
you like it just has a USB port on the
end charges via micro USB so any micro
USB wall charger you have will work here
is that micro USB wall charger and
you're also going to be getting a pair
of stereo headphones will see it as a
microphone on
don't don't Oh with out a microphone so
you're gonna get just a pair of stereo
headphones in the box alright let's go
and look at the phone push all that
business off to the side in case you
aren't familiar with the g2 in this case
the desire Z let me run through the
specs really quickly this is one
the higher-end Android devices out on
the market right now it's got Android
2.2 with HTC's new version of sense
sitting on top of it it's got an 800
megahertz processor and don't let that
processor speed for you on this world of
1 gigahertz and now coming one gigahertz
Plus this is a next-generation 800
megahertz chip which is really optimized
the hardware for the software that this
runs this thing is a screamer one of the
fastest phones on my opinion the market
it's got a 3.7 inch wvga screen with the
resolution of 480 by 800 this phone's
backside you are going to see a 5
megapixel camera with autofocus and
flash capable of shooting at 720p it's
got about a 1300 milliamp hour battery
so you're not going to get outstanding
battery life you're going to want to
probably monitor that a bit closely this
does have Android 2.2 so we're going to
get full flash 10.1 support and it's got
Wi-Fi VG and n as far as 3G band
supports European and Asian 3G bands
with 900 by 2100 in the US 18 to uses
some about 2100 bands so you might get a
little taste of 3G if you're in the US
with this guy alright so let's go ahead
and look at the phone you've got a
optical trackpad right there which can
be depressed so you can turn make treat
it like a five-way joypad you've got
your typical Android buttons across the
bottom and they are capacitive you can
see me right there in the camera you've
got a home button a menu button a back
button and a search button we got your
speaker grille and microphones in their
usual places left hand side volume
rocker micro USB charging port on the
right camera hard button and if you want
to expose that battery that is hiding
underneath here there is a lever for
that go ahead and push that lever this
metal thing pops up there's a batteries
also where your SIM card is going to
have to be inserted gonna push in right
there go ahead and put that back at
least attempt to put this thing on this
is really a very heavy thick metal HTC
devices just have a great sort of
industrial feel to them and this desire
Z is really no exception to that really
high build quality at HTC being known
for alright so we've got the back
one of the cool things about the phone
is it's full slide-out QWERTY keyboards
and then I forget which way it slides so
if you go ahead and figure out which way
it does slide and you push open you get
a kind of a neat spring-loaded mechanism
pushes the phone actually up over the
keyboard supposed to sort of sliding it
right out on top of it you can see that
right there
and you've got what I consider to be one
of the best keyboards available on the
market
the keys are spaced out have a great
throw there's a really nice big space
bar which I like of course is in the
landscape orientation here let's go
ahead and peel off this plastic there we
go
plastic is off I know you guys are hate
that kind of stuff so you got some
programmable keys here on the bottom you
can set this wherever you like them to
do if you use something a lot go ahead
and set it to do that so I'll go ahead
and do walk through and review let's go
ahead and put this guy on and see if
there's any sort of charge here we'll
take a real quick look at what the new
Sense looks like you may have seen it
before but it does a lot of really cool
things that we haven't seen really
before on the older versions of HTC
Sense so I'll go ahead and let this boot
up and I'll come right back all right so
we're all booted up here let's go ahead
and see if we can make sense of this UI
skin that was super cheesy I know all
right no SIM card in there we know that
cuz I didn't put one in go ahead and
slide that down get the HTC logo and
let's get started all right so it's
gonna ask for English will just tell it
we're in the UK I'm gonna have to go
through some setup here remove the back
cover insert the SIM card will go and
skip all this stuff skip skip you can go
ahead and set up all of your information
here Wi-Fi Wi-Fi only whatever might be
go ahead and skip all the setup stuff of
course sense will sync all of your
social networks and that kind of
business
use Google yes we want to go and do that
skip finish and we are going to finally
actually be in the UI of the phone this
is going to probably very familiar for
those you that have used Android HTC
devices in the past let's go ahead and
configuring right now on this option
this actually new version is going to
give you some customization options that
we didn't have before and all that new
customization stuff lives right here
with that new paintbrush and palette
icon go ahead and give it a little click
and this is where you can go ahead and
personalize sense now which is kind of
neat so before you can obviously change
the wallpaper there were some live
wallpapers and widgets but now you've
got a ton of new things you've got so
let's take a look at some of the scenes
we have so you can go ahead and sort of
pick different looks you can see that
things look relatively similar but the
overall feel changes a little bit so the
clock there is a bit different the
bottom stays the same width of three
icons you can go ahead and pick one you
can get more from the HTC Sense website
let's go ahead and go back go ahead and
pick whatever one you would like if you
want and there are now skins here as
well which is kind of cool and that's
going to take that one step further than
the scenes actually change the way the
operating system looks so right now
you've got sort of that curved three
icons across the bottom go the next one
it becomes flat there are some talaq
looking ones there's some wood ones I
actually like go ahead and use this sort
of metal one we'll go ahead and apply
and again you can get a ton more of
these you can people are actually making
their own there a lot of really cool
choices and ways to very easily
customize your android phone without
having to get into the routing business
which some people is outside of their
comfort zone so here you go here's a
sort of a new look and feel of course
you've got the you can jump to everyone
it's called snap you can snap it over
how much bring it like you've got all
the same widgets that you've been used
to on HTC device to take a look at what
those are real quickly there are a ton
of them here all of your social
networking Facebook mail music and just
a ton of other choices let's go and see
what HTC bundles in here in the
applications there we go
go ahead and pull out the applications
tray and there is a lot of good stuff
here this does support Wi-Fi and USB
tethering of course you've got Google
Maps Navigation which is an awesome free
turn-by-turn navigation choice there
serve a lot of good stuff in here and
there's that Wi-Fi hotspot that we
talked about because of course this is
an unlocked device like I just pop in
your SIM card and you are off in the
tethering world so guys i am john r
Ettinger from TechnoBuffalo this was an
unboxing and first look at the HTC
Desire Z thank you to the folks at club
coat UK for hooking us up with this
device I will see you
as in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
