gaming it's no one better to access
those big questions the brains behind it
so I'm delighted to welcome to the stage
the CEO and president online mr. Seiber
so then very much how many here was so
excited to live in UK hi everyone this
is dave from gita noids bringing you my
first video for technobuffalo and it
brings me great pleasure to give you
details of the UK launch of the online
gaming service now on live has been
available in the US for a couple of
months now but on Thursday 22nd of sep
tember 2011 it launched in the UK I was
lucky enough to be there and I managed
to pick up an online gaming system to
test and the gaming system comprises of
a small console a control pad and all of
the cables you need to connect it to
your TV now you don't need a console to
use the service you can play on live
games on your Mac or PC creating an
account is free of charge and once
you've created that account you can play
demos of all of the games that on live
host now the idea behind on live is that
you can play on a fairly mediocre system
as long as you've got a good internet
connection as all of the actual games
are hosted on their servers now apart
from buying games outright which range
from a couple of pounds up to 45 pounds
in the UK you can also buy a play pass
now the play pass costs just six pounds
ninety-nine and that enables you to play
over a hundred titles at your will so
you can jump in and out of games for a
whole month for just six pound 99 I
think that's going to really challenge
the likes of blockbuster which charge a
couple of pounds of rent again just for
a weekend there is also another offer at
launch for the UK which is if you are a
BT customer you can gain access to the
play pass which normally costs a six
ninety-nine a month for three months
free of charge which is a fantastic
launch offer as well
my personal experience of the onlive
system so far is that it delivers a good
detail of graphics not as good as what
you would expect from an xbox 360 or ps3
but that's because it's actually
streaming those graphics down to the
little tiny console or to your Mac or PC
but it is perfectly acceptable very
minimal lag hardly noticeable a very
comfortable controller and overall a
good experience I certainly do think
they've got the pricing right in the UK
and I think they have got a winner on
their hands well thank you very much for
watching I will see you all again in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
