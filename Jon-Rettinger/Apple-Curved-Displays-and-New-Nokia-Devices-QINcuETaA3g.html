to you by netflix what's up everyone
walk back there episode of rumor roundup
iris jon rettinger in this quit
obviously as a show where I take all the
tech rumors from the week and I tell you
the biggest baddest ones that you need
to know of this week it's all Apple and
Microsoft let's start with Apple getting
awarded a patent for a pretty cool
curved display Microsoft might be giving
away a few operating systems and a brand
new normal saw his Lumia might be coming
down the pipe in the near future this is
rumor roundup go ahead and start
rounding them up earlier this week Apple
was given a new patent detailing a
curved touch sensor could open up the
door to pretty awesome new form factors
the patented technology essentially
swamps to flat sack of materials that
makes up its Kurt displays with a stack
of flexible materials to get its super
curvy shape the patent was actually
submitted way back in 2010 so probably
means they've been prepping that
technology for the past few years but
don't keep your fingers crossed we're
gonna see it anytime in the near future
far to put money on it I'd say that this
is gonna be used for entirely new type
of products perhaps one that you would
wear somewhere other than talk to on a
phone would be pretty good for a new
curved touchscreen that might be the
first place we see something on a curved
touchscreen and I bet we'll see that
sometime in 2014 it's a watch Android is
quite obviously taking the mobile world
by storm largely due to the price that
it costs manufacturers so you might want
to get out your calculator but it cost
them zero a goose egg big fatty bigger
the doughnut not a zip zilch nothing
windows phone in our to the other hand
not so much but it looks like the big
bad boys of redmond are getting ready to
be in the holiday spirit might be giving
both os's away for free to manufacturers
according to sources speaking to the
verge this might seem like a total
altruistic move from Microsoft your way
just to try and get market space but it
makes total sense think about it from a
business perspective microsoft currently
makes a huge chunk of change licensing
it's off foreign manufacturers but with
Nokia cleaning ninety percent that
windows phone market at least the last
count that revvy is gonna totally dry up
as soon as their acquisition is
finalized Luke is also won a few oh em
gee sine Microsoft's the developing
windows and RT devices so if you think
about it not many people are paying the
royalties anyway you know they're gonna
dock gonna charge themselves as least
you wouldn't think try and get other
manufacturers you're thinking maybe
using Android might want to consider
using windows because a it's cheap so
this rumored strategy will be
implemented until these 2015 the bridge
reports when Microsoft allege threshold
update at the moment though making its
mobile software free and push against
online services seems like a pretty
decent idea but knows what the markets
even gonna look like in a few more years
you'll have another version of Android
iOS 8 ish will be out it's gonna be a
very very crowded market but hopefully a
merger of Windows RT and Windows Phone
maybe Windows Phone 9 or Windows Phone
9rt I decide to call it might have the
gumption to make a run at the two kings
so you know that pretty awesome Lumia
1520 that we loved and his thin it's got
a gorgeous 6 inch screen but it might be
too big for normal people's hands or
won't fit in your pants it looks like
you might have a perfect phone for you
coming out very soon so according to an
Indian website called zaba a 5-inch
someone might be coming very soon all
information that they know that device
is gonna be called the RM 964 the
shipping label does reveal though a 5.2
inch screen size though we really have
nothing else to go off of I think a 5.2
and phone really hit the mainstream the
six inch phone is really too big for a
lot of folks it's a halo phone get the
outliers the folks like me that like
gigantic screens about a 5.2 inch size
really make it more adoptable for a
mainstream so I'm hoping that we see
that perhaps maybe it'll launch with the
next version of Windows Phone not the
one that's coming in 2015 but the update
due early 2014 might seem like a good
time to launch a flagship phone with the
new OS I'm just saying I mean eruptive
rumors for just a minute to thank our
