to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hey what's going on guys a
Martin Tsang from TechnoBuffalo and in
today's episode of rumor roundup we're
going to be talking about Apple's plan
to bring touch ID to max how much the 18
karat gold Apple watch my Kashia and
also we're going to be talking about the
galaxy s6 edge this is rumor roundup so
let's get started let's kick the show
off with the very first ruler of the day
which is Apple pudding touch ID into its
Mac later this year Apple's such ID
sensors work better than pretty much any
other solution on the market touch ID
used to just be for unlocking your
device but now the Apple pay is here on
the iphone 6 and 6 plus and newer iPads
we might start seeing touch ID show up
on future max a report on Tuesday cited
by 9to5 mac suggests two new laptops are
set to receive touch ID support
including a macbook pro and the still
rumored 12 inch macbook air with retina
display report also as the touch ID will
be integrated within apple's magic mouse
and magic trackpad for imax and mac
pro's while this is still a rumor i'm
kind of excited to see what comes to
life i'm a big fan of touch ID i use it
on a daily basis whether it's for
accessing apps or unlocking the device
or even using Apple pay I think it'll be
a great addition to max unlocking your
computer authenticating one password and
so on what do you guys think touch ID on
max no yes maybe let us know we're not
too far off from mwc 2015 and samsung's
big event on march first but on
wednesday a new benchmark league
showcasing samsung's new Exynos
processor the galaxy s6 edge notched up
a score of 1495 in the Geekbench single
core test then in multi-core test puts
the 64-bit Exynos 7420 and all 8 cores
to the test the phone got a ridiculous
score of 5375 which is pretty crazy to
see from a mobile device it is possible
the benchmark could be bogus but we're
expecting big things from samsung's next
flagship device will be seeing less
bloatware more powerful hardware and i'm
really excited to see whether samsung's
new flagship device is really the next
big thing will be of course doing a live
blog in covering the entire event on our
site at technobuffalo calm so make sure
to check us out there for more coverage
and last but not least let's jump back
to apple in its upcoming SmartWatch
Apple hasn't revealed pricing for the
apple watch edition or the Midway
model of its smartwatch just yet but
we're really curious how much do you
think the most high-end model is going
to run you one man Greg Koenig took a
rough estimate of the Apple wash size
and created a software model to
determine how much 18 carat gold might
be needed for the apple watch edition
model came up with a rough estimate of
29 point 16 grams that figure was then
run through a quick Gold calculator at a
price of 1210 and 88 cents per troy
ounce with 18 carat quality it means
that we should expect roughly around 851
dollars worth of gold use in apple
SmartWatch this is just one man's
assumption so there could be room for
error some are saying the Apple will
price the apple watch edition at around
five thousand dollars or more but so now
that's just another rumor and I guess
we'll just have to wait for apples next
announcement before we draw any
conclusions so the question of the day
is how much do you guys think the apple
watch edition and the mid-range model
are going to cost let us know in the
comments down below and if you like this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up

as always a mark on second from
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
