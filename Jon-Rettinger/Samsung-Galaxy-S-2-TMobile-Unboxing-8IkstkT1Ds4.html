you may have seen the other video
already
that's funny cuz I'm shooting these at
the same time so I don't know which
one's gonna go up first
doesn't matter t-mobile sent us one two
of their new Android cell phones
the HTC ma is 4G so you might even say
cell phone anymore three phones are new
smart phones that are super phones and
the Samsung Galaxy s2 we started on the
left which means it's now time for the
one on the right all right so spring cut
there's 18 T got there's Verizon didn't
get theirs and apparently they're not
getting their special extra fancy Nexus
Prime next to reflect we all thought
they were that Samsung unpacked event
for October 11th at CTA has been
postponed
but whatever t-mobile got there since
the Galaxy s2 the t-mobile variant also
offering a giant screen like the Sprint
version of four point five two inch WVGA
monster of a display this one is
available for pre-order beginning
October 10th and is expected to be in
t-mobile stores beginning October 12th
to $29.99 on contract after rebate and
along with the Amaze 4G which is
featured there in the opening one of
t-mobile's first t-mobile USA's first
HSPA+ 42 devices theoretically
supporting the full 42 megabits per
second down network although you're not
gonna get 42 using this thing in the US
that's for sure anyway in the Box you
get the phone you get $10 for the credit
for samsung media hub alright
I turned the conditions Start Guide all
that good stuff you get power adapter
USB cable and your headphones take you
to a vic lay ps2 ears your earpieces a
couple different sizes there phone
itself much like the sprint variant in
terms of just
overall look and feel again the 4.5 2
inch display absolutely Giants Super
AMOLED 800 by 480 kind of interesting
kind of weird that they didn't up the
resolution for a screen this big but the
Super AMOLED still looks really nice
I'll skip through this stuff for now you
can see the 4G network already
connecting very thin very lightweight
it's got that weird little chin on the
bottom like the other Galaxy S 2's but
just very very lightweight foam kind of
in contrast to the HTC I was just
playing with you know this one if she
has like a solid kind of heft to it I
like to use the car analogy it's like a
like I'm Rossini he's like a German car
you shut the door and it's a big thunk
and to me for cruising the audubon you
know it's rock solid at 200 miles an
hour but it's not you know maybe the
super best handling phone we're handling
car whereas these Samsung's are like you
know just lightweight and blazing and
ready to go and you know more like I
don't know like a Nissan GTR maybe I've
never ridden in a GTR but something like
that anyway yeah you get a big
horsepower to pounds ratio I guess I'm
gonna stop at the car metaphors uh-huh
the phone is powered by a dual-core
snapdragon s3 processor it's not a
Samsung Exynos processor if I pronounced
that correctly but instead a snapdragon
s3 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor the
tearsheet says it's running Android
2.3.5 let's just double-check that
Android version 2.3.5 there you go the
very newest version of Android to date
comes pre-loaded with a bunch of stuff
that you might like or you might hate
including Netflix including the Samsung
media hub including t-mobile TV
including TeleNav the familiar Samsung
TouchWiz user interface there on top
it's you know it's lighter weight than
it used to be I don't mind it as much
and so it actually is kind of cool
here's this bonus app thing this
t-mobile thing again you know is
extra features is it bloatware I don't
know but there's this widget on the
number 5 home screen telling me about a
stack of radio and doubleTwist and all
these things that I can download if I so
choose taken a tour around the phone
we've got 4 capacitive touch buttons on
the front your standard Android button
set a front-facing camera 2 megapixel
front-facing camera on the back 8
megapixel camera with LED flash
autofocus and full 1080p video capture
screen that likes to say hi to my palm
and fire things up currently a USB port
on the bottom microUSB which I was also
compatible with what's called an MHL
adapter if you want to do HDMI out so
get your Netflix or your Samsung media
hub or your t-mobile TV HDTV content out
of here and onto the big screen if you
want to
you also get let's see take tour around
the phone on the right spine there's
your power lock switch on top three nine
millimeter headphone jack on the right
spine rocker switch I like this at this
great it's kind of dark metallic grey
finish and then the textured finish on
the back a little bit of a very slightly
rubbery grippy coating feels pretty nice
if you're going to go plastic you know
this is actually kind of a nice take on
plastic but in contrast again to the
Amaze 4G which I just unboxed if your
buttons fewer controls that kind of
thing it's lighter weight you know it's
it's it's just I don't know these these
I had the epic touch was reviewing that
and really did not notice the weight in
my hand despite the giant footprint
because the phone is so thin that 0.37
inches thick or thin if you will waste
4.77 ounces you know you really just you
don't notice it anymore than a smaller
phone carrying it around or at least I
didn't what else can I tell you you've
got all the stuff you expect on a
current top-of-the-line
gingerbread phone 16 gigs of onboard
memory expandable to 48 with a micro SD
card slot 1,850 milliamp hour battery
pre-installed again it supports the HSP
PA 42 you
not gonna get 42 t-mobile officially
says average speeds of eight peak speeds
up to 22 so uh you know if you're in it
it tends to work well for me when I'm in
good range this office that I'm
recording in right now noted for not
having the best coverage so I'm going to
do some speed tests elsewhere where
things are a little more solid but I've
been impressed with t-mobile's network
since they upgrade to the HHS p8 + so
there you go quick tour quick unboxing I
say quick I'm probably at the 15 minute
mark already of the galaxy to 400 so
this has NFC I don't know if I mentioned
that it's got NFC for you know when
everybody ditches their wallets and
starts paying for stuff with their cell
phones we'll see if and when that
happens in the u.s. anyway there you go
first look the galaxy s2 for t-mobile
again available October 12 in stores
October 10 for pre-order to $29.99 on
contract comes out the same days as the
Amaze 4G for HTC both our Android
Gingerbread phones built to take
advantage of teemo's HSPA 42 network
thanks t-mobile for letting us the
galaxy s2 much much more on all the new
phones all the stuff going on in San
Diego next week at CTIA on TechnoBuffalo
until next time my name is noah thanks
for watching buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
