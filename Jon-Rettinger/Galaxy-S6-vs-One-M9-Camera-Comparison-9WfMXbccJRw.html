in here from technobuffalo today we have
a pretty awesome video for you guys
today we're going to be comparing the
galaxy s6 this camera to the HTC One m9
now as you know the galaxy s6 is rocking
a new 16 megapixel camera in the back
with an F 1.9 aperture with 0 is and a 5
megapixel camera ultra wide-angle lens
in the front now the one m9 is rocking a
new 20 megapixel camera in a bag and
move the four old sure pixel camera up
in a front for better selfies so let's
go ahead and see which flagship device
has the better camera so for the past
few years HTC is always focused on its
sensors and not the megapixels but we
all know the images that the ultrapixel
sensors produce were just ok now this
year the company jumped back into the
megapixel raise putting a 20 megapixel
shooter in its new m9 and using the four
ultrapixel sensors on the front a
samsung on the other hand has always
opted in for a high megapixel sensors
though it's software is typically over
processed a bit too much for our taste
the galaxy s6 this year is rocking a new
16 megapixel camera in the back would it
improve f 1.9 aperture just to let more
light into the sensor and it has 0 is
which the one m9 unfortunately does not
have it also has a 5 megapixel camera in
the front with an ultra wide-angle lens
so let's talk about the camera
performance first so with the galaxy s6
samson's put a lot of focus on improving
the camera experience now if you double
press the home button it'll launch the
camera instantly and it is fast the one
m9 has a similar feature when to
displace turned off turn the phone in
landscape mode and press the volume up
button and it'll launch the camera right
away it's not as fast as the s6 but it's
not far behind despite the galaxy s6
launching faster the One m9 actually
shot quicker compared to the s6 now in
terms of autofocus both the One m9 and
galaxy s6 are fairly quick both seem to
hit focus right away though the one
thing that the galaxy s6 has that the
one m9 does not have is the tracking
autofocus feature which constantly
adjust is the focus as your subject
moves or when you move the camera so in
my opinion in terms of camera
performance the galaxy s6 wins here so
moving on to software if you've used
samsung phones in the past you'll be
familiar with the camera experience not
much has really changed here there's
still a bunch of tweaks and little
settings you can turn on and off and
there are all
various shooting modes as well like Pro
Mode which lets you take full control of
the focus is 0 white balance exposure
and more there are also new filters and
effects you can apply in real time which
looks great and works really well and I
also notice that everything is so much
cleaner and snappier this time around
the heavy image processing has been
turned down quite a bit too which is
most definitely a plus for me HTC is you
why hasn't really changed all that much
either you'll still be able to change a
few settings through the mini window
that pops up to change ISO exposure and
white balance but everything else is
exactly the same as the one m8 and the
sounds to the buttons there's not a
whole lot of new features within the
camera app you will find a new boca mode
that gives your photos that nice depth
of field look but all in all is hoping
HTC would have added something new to
the table just to make the experience
much better so for me simplicity is key
both you eyes are very simple but I'm
going to have to give it to the galaxy
s6 on this one software is a big part of
the camera experience and the one m9
definitely let me down in this
department there wasn't anything new to
play with unlike samsung's new camera
app there are new visuals throughout the
app and to me the one m9 Sui just look
very similar to the one m8 and it just
didn't have that wow factor I just
wasn't as excited as I was when I use
the galaxy s6 so in terms of video
quality both are able to film in 4k
resolution unfortunately the bitrate on
both devices aren't very high which
means quality won't be all that great
there's also a limitation on how much
you can film on both devices when
filming in 4k a total of six minutes on
the one m9 and the total of five minutes
on the galaxy s6 if you're not planning
on shooting 4k and one film in full HD
1080p the galaxy s6 has an optical image
stabilization so the videos are going to
be much smoother and more manageable
compared to the One m9 if shooting in
1080p there's also slow motion and fast
motion videos on both devices with the
galaxy s6 you can control where in the
video you want it to slow down just like
on the iphone 6 though the one m9 on the
other hand slows down the entire footage
and the quality just becomes really
muddy no matter what lighting condition
you're in so in terms of video quality
I'm going to have to give it to the
galaxy s6 on this one last but not least
let's talk about the image quality now
Samsung said the galaxy s6 is 16
megapixel sensor is the best in any
mobile phone while HTC got back into the
megapixel race with its 20 megapixel
shooter looking at the images we
took this past week the Essex images
just look so much cleaner compared to
the photos taken on one m9 the images we
got from the one m9 were software noisy
especially for a 2015 flagship device
the s6 photos on the other hand were
sharp vibrant contrasting and featured a
pretty wide dynamic range though I did
notice that the Essex tends to shoot a
bit on a warmer tones compared to the
One m9 schouler looking tones HDR mode
on the Galaxy s6 is great too adding a
pretty subtle effect on top of the image
the One m9 s HDR mode on the other hand
is just terrible images came out flat
and the colors just looked unnatural
exposure is also a big factor in mobile
photography previous Samsung devices
have tried with the exception of the
note for handles exposure pretty badly
and I'm glad to say that the Essex
doesn't suffer from this issue however
the one m9 suffers from this problem big
time exposures all over the place to a
point where highlights are clipping
which is most certainly not a good thing
when taking photos on a go so even if
you tweak the settings on the One m9 the
quality is just not up to par with the
galaxy s6 in auto mode alas bigger
megapixel count doesn't always get you
better image quality talking about the
front-facing cameras on these two the
One m9 has an ultra pixel front facing
camera and that essentially lets more
light into the sensor which should help
in low-light conditions the galaxy s6 on
the other hand has a 5 megapixel sensor
with an ultra wide-angle lens and to be
quite honest I thought both were great
despite the difference in sensors The
One m9 I felt just had a bit of a softer
look than the s6 is detailed shot but
overall both front-facing cameras are
pretty good if you prefer to have a
wider field of view the galaxy s6 will
give you just that the One m9 has a wide
field of view as well but just not as
wide as the galaxy s6 is camera now
overall in terms of image quality i
think the galaxy s6 wins this room and
so to wrap it all up for you guys we
ultimately think that Samsung is taking
mobile photography to a whole different
level now I know in the past that I
bashed Samsung for its image quality and
heavy image processing but the new
sensor in software in a galaxy s6 just
shows how incredible the photos can be
same things doing a great job improving
its sensors and photo processing and I
think HTC needs to step up its camera
game if it wants to keep up with the
pack we actually have a gallery up on
our site with sample images from both
devices so make sure to check out the
