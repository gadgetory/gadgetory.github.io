have heard a lot about Google Wave in
the past weeks
it's just entered a invite-only beta
period previously being in alpha only so
what is Google Wave if I received quite
a few questions
Mashable has a great overview of what
the products going to be I'll put a link
to it in the sidebar but I thought that
officer of a layman's description of
what Google Wave is so when you hear the
term mentioned that you're undoubtably
going to hear it in the coming weeks and
months at least you'll have an
understanding so let's get started a
Google Wave is essentially a real-time
communication platform it really
combines aspects of all the
communications that you're used to using
online like instant messaging a web chat
social networking and really project
management in sort of a a single in
browser communications client everything
is in browser no need to install
anything on your software what you can
do is you can bring group of friends or
businesses partners together and you can
discuss whatever happened that day and
share files so so far and nothing that
revolutionary right Google waves got a
lot of really innovative features here
sort of just the highlights first it's
real time so you're editing and revising
documents in a real time with obviously
real people things like Google Google
Docs have sort of had this but I you can
see what people are typing as they're
typing you're essentially seeing what
they see in a real time those of you
that are in business it's is a really
invaluable tool if those of you that are
in school imagine working in groups
without having actually be in groups
especially if you're in different parts
of campus or in some spots even across
the country if you're in an online
classroom it really does add a lot of
usability of being in real time it's
also embeddable media can be embedded in
any website or blog wherever you want
it's got an embed code you pop it in and
suddenly you have access to your full
Google Wave account and all the
documents that you're working from the
next sort of big point is applications
and extensions just like Facebook
application or an iGoogle gadget
developers can really build their own
app
and they could be anything from I guess
BOTS to real-time games so the potential
of Google Wave is huge sort of you think
of what Firefox is done with add-ons and
all the different functionality that you
get Google Wave offers the same promise
just a ton of additional functionality
that even Google perhaps didn't envision
so that's what I think is I'm most
excited about the new frontier is really
just wide open for what can happen with
Google Wave next it's completely open
source the code will be available to
anybody to help sort of foster
innovation especially in the development
community so again if people don't have
to pay it for access to the Google Wave
codes you're probably gonna get a huge
influx of developers looking to get
their name and word out there the
downside of that is you may see some
advertising on Google Wave since
developers have the option to put in
really whatever they want but you're
gonna control the plugins you can
control what shows up the next thing is
a playback you could playback any part
of the wave to see what was said so if
you're communicating with a friend or
business partner and he says or type
something that's important and you
forget it later you can rewind back so
I'm just like hitting the rewind button
in a real time which is quite useful and
often times I'm working with people I
forget what they said I can just rewind
back and always have a record of it
something that I think is really useful
the next thing it uses natural language
a Google Wave will auto correct your
spelling even going so far as to knowing
differences between similar words
friends it's like being and bin which is
a big thing I'll also auto translate on
the fly which is huge if you used
Microsoft Word or Google Docs or
whatever the spell check can be helpful
but often times very annoying so this is
going to be a more accurate version I
guess what spellcheck is next it's got
drag and drop file sharing no
attachments at all you just have to drag
your file into the Google Wave and
everybody will have access to it that
makes things a lot easier than having to
drag into an email type in the address
and then hit Send
you drag it into Google Wave everybody
gets access to edit it to see
it can be a great tool for presentations
or just collaboration this is just a a
short overview of what Google Wave can
do and the potential is just wide open
for this platform really excited for it
I think Google's got another huge winner
on their hands so what do you think
about Google Wave are you excited have
you gotten access to the beta program do
you not care and really curious to what
you guys sing so please leave comments
or video description or video responses
rather so I can check out we can sort of
start a dialogue on Google Wave you're
gonna hear a lot about it in the coming
weeks and months I promise so for
exclusive content check me out on
Twitter twitter.com slash John for
Lakers and to learn more about
TechnoBuffalo check out TechnoBuffalo
comm links to all these will be in the
sidebar
I believe this over there and I will see
you guys in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
