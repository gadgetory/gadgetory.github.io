to you by Squarespace and the letter C
what's up everyone and welcome to
another episode of techno buffalos rumor
roundup where we round up all the tech
rumors for the week up i'm docket today
it's all mobile all the time so if
you're looking to get any tablet or new
smartphone sometime this year you're
going to want to stick around and watch
we're going to talk iphone 5 we're going
to talk quad-core tablet we're going to
talk of Google's Ice Cream Sandwich and
windows 8 this is techno buffalos room
around them all right let's go ahead and
jump right in iphone 5 rumors have been
everywhere on the tech blogosphere this
weekend we've got a ton of rumors to
share with you so if you want to buy an
iphone 5 it's got to be made first
rumors are saying that a hundred and
fifty thousand iphone bonds are being
produced per day at the fox com
production facilities so when you wait
in line to that iphone 5 it might just
might be being produced right as you are
watching this video kind of neat uh what
about a launch day so we know what size
is going to come in we're kinda sure
what colors it's going to come in
presumably the same white and black
palette with hopefully white launching
alongside what is it going to launch
what we are hearing October 7th is the
day you can first pick up your iPhone 5
we're waiting any mint for an apple
press event to let us know what the
iPhone 5 is going to look like we're
hearing it's going to look very similar
to the iphone 4 tapered edges a larger
elongated home button the rumors were
hearing right now that it won't be a
physical home button it's going to be a
capacitive buttons we've seen on
countless sort of Android devices
perhaps you're going to be a gesture
area even put in there as well also
speech recognition is coming to iOS 5
and your iPhone 5
so now when you get a drop calling to
yell at your phone it's actually going
to understand you is ios not your thing
well let's talk android because eric
schmidt let it slip out that ice cream
sandwich the latest and greatest build
of android the build that's supposed to
end all the fragmentation and bring the
tablet world in the phone world together
in beautiful tech harmony is coming and
coming very soon this October or
November we're going to see Ice Cream
Sandwich launched on a Nexus device as
we've seen the previous versions of
Android launched on those as well
presumably it's going to be the Samsung
built nexus prime all just going to have
a gargantuan larger than 4.5 inch touch
screen probably not as big as the
Samsung notes 5.3 inch screen but it's
going to be big and it's going to be
powerful but what is it going to be
powered by um possibly it's going to be
powered by the latest quad-core chip
that was an awesome unintentional segue
coming out of nvidia their CEO let it
slip that caught l which was a code name
for the quad core chips will be coming
sometime in 2011 so if one core is not
good enough for you who core is not good
enough for you you can get for battery
sucking cores on your phone or tablet
coming soon this holiday season so look
for those coming um again i keep making
jokes about battery life dual-core
certainly took a hit for battery life
we're only assuming that you double the
amount of course you to double the
amount of juice needed or at least need
more juice so didn't want to bring an
extra juice box I'll when you pick up
your quad core device are you excited
about quad core you care or not care I'm
more excited from a geek standpoint to
see what quad core can do for a
benchmark standpoint I'm not sure how
much actual performance I'm going to get
from dual core two quad core I last
year's CES we did see some
demonstrations of what quad core can do
as far as shading and graphics prowess
it was absolutely incredible I'm just
not sure if the trade-off for again
battery electric
be worth that increase but the consumers
are going to be the ones that are going
to tell the truth there so let me go
ahead and take a quick minute to thank

and talk about windows we saw a first
sneak preview of Windows 8 which herb
has a metro which is Windows Phone 7
type UIC on top of it but what about for
the windows tablets are going to be
having so we've seen windows 7 actual
tablets come out looks like Windows 7
that you use your finger with Windows 8
is going to have a specific tablet build
but we haven't seen that yet the rumors
are saying that we're finally going to
see the first Windows 8 tablet build
revealed at drumroll please as a bad
drumroll drumroll please Microsoft's
BUILD conference which kicks off
September 13th Microsoft might be a
little bit late
tablet party but there's still plenty of
time to make up ground I think they have
spent a lot of time in R&amp;amp;D and if it's
anything like windows phone 7i think
it's going to be very very easy to use
I'm pretty robust I'm a big fan of
Windows Phone 7 you couldn't tell so
I've high hopes for the tablet version
of Windows 8 what do you guys think when
it comes to tablets I'm in the Apple
camp you in the Android camp are you
going to be in the windows camp are you
in the webos camp you pick up a $99
touchpad and now you can't get enough or
you're flicking cards I'll you want to
hear from you is to leave all your
comments I am jon rettinger filling in
