hearing a lot about network speed either
in advertisements or on the news it's
really everywhere so I wanted to take
three of the four major carriers and do
a speed test and see how fast each of
them load the same site and put their 3G
network essentially head-to-head I've
got five bars of 3G service for ett on
the iPhone I've got five bars of 3G
service for Verizon on the Droid and
I've got five bars of 3G service for
t-mobile on the g1 I before so I don't
have sprint phone to throw that in there
at least you can see how three of the
four major networks compare speed test
wise we're gonna load TechnoBuffalo com
the site that has been loaded on each of
these devices so it'll be a test of
visiting a website that you check out on
a regular basis so each one now is blank
to google.com I'm gonna get technical
Buffalo queued up on each and we'll get
to the test I'm taking any bets right
now is the who you think is going to win
all right so I've got TechnoBuffalo
queued up on each device hitting go at
the same time in all three is going to
be the trickiest part of this test we're
gonna give it a shot
that was almost exactly the same time
and we are off on all three devices now
certainly your 3G speeds are gonna vary
depending on where you're at this test
is done in Southern California
looks like Verizon jumped out to an
early lead
AT&amp;amp;T close second and t-mobile is
actually keeping up quite nicely we can
read contact on all three sites Verizon
just finished AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile are
fighting for a second
AT&amp;amp;T is done just a few seconds behind
Verizon and t-mobile is still loading
and we do have full bars on each year
I'm very fortunate to get 3G reception
from all major carriers here all right
and t-mobile is done so that would serve
an unofficial speed test of what you can
expect in this case Verizon was faster
than AT&amp;amp;T I did this a few times off
camera and out of the five times I tried
it Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T tended to split the
speed test they're really going to come
down to which test that we happen to to
run and see which one won then t-mobile
was always third so at least for my area
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon definitely add the
factor 3G speed other t-mobile is
certainly not bad so guys hope you enjoy
very curious as to what you think of
these tests and you get the same results
depending on where you are do you find
your Verizon 3G or 18 to 3G or t-mobile
3G to be fast fast enough or not quite
as fast hope you guys enjoyed for
exclusive content check me out at
twitter twitter.com slash John for
Lakers and for more information on this
test and how it was conducted and for
all your tech news check out
TechnoBuffalo comm links of course will
be in the sidebar see you guys the next
video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
