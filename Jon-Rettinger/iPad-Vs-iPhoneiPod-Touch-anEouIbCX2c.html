John Redinger from TechnoBuffalo here
there's been a lot of discussion and
debate about whether or not the iPad is
nothing more than a larger iPod Touch or
an oversized iPhone so I thought let's
let you be the judge
we're gonna put the two head-to-head you
can see the iPad is right for you so on
the right side we've got the iPhone 3GS
as a contender and on the Left we've got
a 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi on the iPad has the
other contender let's go ahead and get
started we're gonna cover a lot of
topics we're gonna have to sort of
glance over some nuances here just in
the interest of time otherwise this is
going to be close to the two-hour video
so let's start with the lock screen on
the iPad you've got you got and I kind
of right there for pictures if you hit
that it'll start a picture slideshow on
your lockscreen kinda neat the iPod on
the other hand does not have that
feature that could certainly be added
with a firmware upgrade you can go ahead
and unlock the Vettes
I'll go ahead and unlock this as well so
let's start with customization you can
do a little bit more customization on
the iPad than you can on the iPod touch
so there's a lot more screen real estate
obviously on the iPad come standard here
with 4 icons on the dock you can
actually add 6 to those so I can take an
icon say there's ABC player for example
I can drag it down I can take the Kindle
app right here and I can drag that down
here you're limited to just four go
ahead and put it back up so there's one
example of customization let's go ahead
and show you a few more and it's also a
good way to show what the menu systems
look like on the iPad so you take
advantage of the screen real estate a
little bit more the iPad you get more of
a hierarchical menu system so you can
see all the menu options here on the
Left whereas on the iPod Touch or the
iPhone you have to scroll through to get
to them so you can determine whether or
not that's an important feature queue or
not so let's go ahead and go to let's
say brightness and wallpaper
so the come standard the whole bunch of
different wallpapers nothing terribly
fancy there go and tap it you can pick
all your pictures if you'd like
or you can just pick an image we'll go
ahead and pick that one you can see all
the pictures that you have on your phone
or you can go to wallpapers and pick the
ones that are default so I've got the
globe set is mine and you can pick
whether or not you want to set as a
lockscreen set as home screen or set it
as both right here on the iPhone the
iPod touch go to wallpaper and we pick
one so there's the same globe you can
set it just as the backgrounds for the
lockscreen you can't change the
background of the device we are actually
using it so there's a little bit example
of some customizations that you can do
again this is something that could be
fixed very easily with the firmware
upgrade to the iPod Touch or iPhone so
let's go ahead look at the native
applications that come standard on both
so we'll cover probably some of the
bigger ones right now let's go ahead and
jump right into the YouTube player so
here's the YouTube player on the iPad
obviously and you get sort of a much
larger grid and all of these features
just take advantage of the additional
screen real estate so today this week
all featured top rated most viewed and
just get it's a little more um visual
same thing some of the favorite videos
all your subscriptions sort of come out
here on a big list you can pick the one
you want so I can pick it's popping out
video I can go ahead and see what
they've done and just click away let's
go ahead and pick a video so we'll go to
to pick one that I've done most asked
tech questions something I did a while
ago it actually plays in a little
different format here so you can
actually see all the information about
the video right below and I'll start to
play a write in the screen you just get
a little bit more of a native viewing
experience here and you can full screen
it and of course you can rotate it and
that will start playing you don't need
to see my mug so I'll go ahead and done
to that let me show you what the YouTube
video and YouTube application looks like
on the iPhone and iPod touch so use go
ahead and turn on Wi-Fi I turned on
airplane mode because I didn't want to
get phone calls while we were using
tends to go on and on and on the only
time I get phone calls in TV when I'm
filming videos so let me show you here
what that looks like
I'll go ahead and open up YouTube still
looking for a french bulldog puppy I was
thinking about getting the dog so you
get certain rows across the bottom and
you get much smaller thumbnails it's
pretty eloquent way to view videos I
watch a lot of YouTube video on here but
its small ready to take advantage of the
larger real estate here on the iPad I'll
go ahead and close this and let's go
next - how about mobile safari an
application that I use quite a bit I
assume you do as well I did a previous
video sort of walking you through mobile
Safari on the iPad and how it's a little
bit different let me give you guys just
a quick summary here let's go ahead and
launch this and we'll launch it as well
on the iPhone so you can see we've got
Google loaded up here looks like a
standard website as you can find really
anywhere let me show you the speed of
the site how quickly load on each before
I do that let me show you some of the
very quick nuances you've got this
bookmarks bar across the top you can see
I've got TechnoBuffalo bookmarked right
there so I could go ahead and jump right
to that if I wanted I've got a sort of a
3d ish effect that comes back with my
different pages bookmarks are all
contextualized you actually get these
pop-ups and the menus that sort of show
up throughout the iPad let's go ahead
and check some load speeds although
TechnoBuffalo on each of these and we'll
see how quickly they work now I should
mention that this is then loaded on both
of these devices so cookies and stuff
have been cached you can see they make
this a representation of how fast a
paging you visit on a regular basis
would load for you so go ahead and do
TechnoBuffalo on each try and hit them
both the same time there and right there
and these are both on the same Wi-Fi
network the iPads got a one gigahertz
chip it's the a4 chip built just for
it's already done
built just for the iPad and the iPhone
3GS is about a 600 megahertz chip it and
that looks like it's almost about done
as well as actually still loading so
we're at the back you can see there's
definitely a speed difference with the
iPad something that I've certainly
noticed all the way through so browsing
here was a pretty similar experience
it's very quick its fluid but you can
just see so much more content you can
look at the difference here than what
you can see on this page and where you
can see on the iPhone makes it a lot
easier to look at content so pinching
and zooming worked so you'd expect
YouTube videos we just saw play right
inside of the browser here you can see
just go ahead play you can fullscreen
and everything just as we could before
of course flash isn't present on either
device to me show YouTube videos play
here on the iPhone or iPod Touch
actually opens up a secondary player so
next let's hop on over to male because
there are a lot of differences here with
male this is probably some of the best
implementation of using the larger
screen real estate so go ahead and open
up male and you can get a glimpse of
some of the stuff I'm looking at here's
a contact form that came through you go
ahead and see all these messages get
this contextual menu that pops up you
can pick one that you want so here's a
let's go to the YouTube message you go
ahead and open right to that question
about the obligatory biggie nice if you
rotate it you actually get a bit more
context on the side and you can sort of
keep jumping through it so we'll go
ahead and pick another one you can see
what it looks like go ahead and push
this back up here you get sort of the
same sort of view and you could go ahead
and pick emails and open them and view
them just as you're probably pretty used
to again it's just an implementation of
where more screen real estate equals
more features you get a bit more things
that you can do just because you have
more space to do them so next let's
check out the iTunes Store on each
device so here is the iTunes Store on
the iPad it looks very similar to the
iTunes store that you are used to on
your desktop or a laptop computer
it looks very native and of course well
because it is native made by Apple so
you can view and scroll up whatever you
want you can download things over Wi-Fi
you can view movies TV shows you can
rent them or buy them
and you can go ahead and just scroll
through and it's very easy and intuitive
here on the iPhone we'll go ahead open
up the iTunes it's very intuitive easy
to use as well but again a little bit of
a smaller space means you can't do as
much and you can't see as much at once
so you can scroll through pretty easily
the search function to work just the
same so go ahead and migrate out of this
and let's jump to the iPod so here is
the iPod and the sort of opens up
another iTunes ish looking thing and
this is sort of another way where looks
a bit more desktop now interestingly
enough what's been omitted is Cover Flow
there really isn't a Cover Flow
functionality as far as iTunes is
concerned something that was a big
selling point on the first generation
iPhone I remember when the first time I
saw it I was scrolling through showing
everybody up who I thought it was not
here so I've got music podcasts
audiobooks
I only have one playlist I put on here
Green Day volume is controlled by upper
left-hand corner can view songs artist
album genre is heavier genius playlist
there in the bottom left or if you want
to add a playlist you can go ahead and
hit play they'll play through the
speakers on the bottom and of course you
can see on the iPad only other
difference is that I'll rotate any
direction so I'll hit play here pull up
lots of songs
if you rotate it just rotates so the
play looks like it opens up and that's
about all thought I'm not going to play
it any longer I don't want to get any
copyright issues but you can see how it
looks you get sort of it's a big album
but no cover flow so on the iPod here
I'll go ahead and open this up see I've
got some Always Sunny in Philadelphia on
my favorite TV shows we'll go ahead and
go to songs and if I turn this there's
that cover flow of thing I was talking
about that you just don't get with the
iPad so you get all your songs here and
go ahead and pick one plays almost
exactly the same pause is right down
below so that was sort of an overview of
some of the standard applications let me
show you some of the things that the
iPad does and can do that
the iPhone does not do we're still going
to be a very quick overview I'm going to
show you the iBooks application right
now I'll go more into detail about the
iBook and show you how it works by just
want to give you a general overview so
you can go ahead and open that up you
get a full sort of cool bookshelf
looking effect and you can open up up it
comes to anyway the Winnie the Pooh and
you can go ahead and just read and of
course you can flip your pages just as
you would a normal book and one of the
things I should mention that you don't
see in the video is how the device feels
in your hands it's sort of one of the
reasons I'd say you can get to an Apple
Store Best Buy go check one out because
it's holding it may change your opinion
I was very skeptical about it when I
first held and I saw the utility of it
it became very interesting so you can
scroll through and read a book you can
actually adjust the brightness right
from the application guess you prefer a
little lighter darker I don't think the
glossy screen is gonna affect my eye as
opposed to Kindle like ink it appears to
be pretty solid let me go ahead and go
back and show you the story very quickly
the story looks pretty native to what
you'd expect similar to what iTunes
looked like it's sort of the 3rd store
that they have here and you go ahead and
pick a book by it books are about new
releases about 13 bucks $12.99 or around
there and you've got a lot of other
applications that you just don't have on
the iPhone I think that make it a bit
more utilitarian so you've got pages for
example and I'll do a full video on
pages and this is sort of Apple's
version of Microsoft Word and go ahead
and start typing you can insert images
you have got pretty decent customization
options that you see across here insert
pictures there's a spreadsheet
application and a presentation
application so like a PowerPoint ask so
you can actually use this a bit more as
a Productivity tool so go ahead and quit
out of this and I'll show you a few more
other things you've got Netflix for
example which supposedly is coming for
the iPhone lets you stream Netflix
on-demand content right to the device
and another thing that I should mention
the iPad is very very good for video
really lets you see things
it's almost like you would on a TV and
just because it's packed it's a larger
don't share another application some of
the apps are very different and take
advantage of the larger screen real
estate for example Twitter if ik my
Twitter client of choice things just
look a bit bigger not very different
than what you find on the iPhone or iPod
touch just larger and if you rotate it
like most applications you get a bit
more menu options so I've got my all my
tweets mentions messages or favorites so
the things that are really important to
me and the things that I was looking for
in the iPad was the mobile web
experience I rely on mobile web for
quite a bit for work even for commenting
on YouTube videos before checking out
post on TechnoBuffalo responding to
people and I reached Bly on mail quite a
bit how I react and respond to people so
I needed something that could really
handle those two things that are very
simple requirements and I got that plus
much more with the iPad I know at the
pages application where I can actually
write up posts and articles I can watch
a video on here I can watch TV on here
there are things like the AVC video
player which takes advantage of html5
format I'm going to stream content
directly from ABC's website and watch
newest episode of lost or modern family
or Grey's Anatomy and that's your thing
um not necessarily mine so there's a lot
that you can do with the iPad and the
iPad itself may not seem like much more
than a big iPod touch but I think the
future of the device is gonna be in the
hands of developers and what they do
with it I think that again I've
mentioned this in previous videos we're
looking at a paradigm shift for how we
consume content we've got things like
you know Wall Street Journal application
we can go through and read newspapers
and get magazines and even some books
are gonna have their own applications
you can get a more immersive environment
so imagine reading a book to your kids
it's a child's book and actually go
through and see the characters move and
come to life it's just a very
interesting way to interact with the
device and I think that we're looking at
sort of the next generation of mobile
computing and whether or not it's the
iPad
another device that sort of takes that
crown there's very little doubt that the
iPad is going to change the industry
it's going to force the competition to
evolve and change their business models
much like the iPhone didn't so I think
in that aspect whether you love it or
hate it certainly going to move people
forward in the right direction
so again lesson I want to talk about is
the App Store it looks about as you'd
expect almost exactly like the rest of
the applications it looks very native
and the App Store on the iPhone or iPod
Touch looks about the same as the other
application on the iPhone or iPod Touch
you just get a bit more options here so
guys sort of a tough to say whether or
not the iPad is going to be for you for
what I needed it for now is looking for
the iPad is perfect I can sit on the
couch I can write my TV posts I can view
my websites that I need to I could watch
TV or watch movies take it with me on a
plane or a train or an automobile
wherever else you want to go and be able
to sort of consume all of my media my
books my TV movies online life and mail
served in one application that's a
little bit bigger a little bit larger
you shouldn't just discount the fact
that it's a larger iPod Touch because
the larger screen size does give you a
bit more utility however if you're very
happy with your iPhone or iPod Touch and
you don't see a compelling reason to
upgrade I am probably pretty happy with
what you have again it comes down to a
personal preference and again I can't
recommend enough going to an Apple store
going to a Best Buy or a retailer near
you that sells this and taking a look at
so once you have it in hand you may feel
that you've got a very different
experience with it so guys John render
