about a year since Apple released the
iPhone 6s and 6s plus and I've used both
during that time and as we head into the
iPhone 7 and 2 months that'll be a nice
time to look back a bit of a
retrospective on the phone they fulfill
what Apple promised says my experience
has changed since our additional review
and for the most part it's exactly the
same as I thought when they show review
the device 3d touch has been nice but
haven't really used it all that much
Apple promised it would revolutionize
how you use your phone and for me just
kind of revolutionize how I use my
keyboard the only time I generally use
3d touch and it's a great feature it's
actually moved the cursor around by just
pushing down on it other than that I
don't use 3d touch that much and even
without 3d touch on the iPhone 6 or an
older phone you can still move the
cursor around so it's not a giant
benefit to me the improved camera has
been fine it's certainly the best
iPhones that have ever been out for you
expect that with each new phone to come
before it
I still firmly believe it's not worth
the upgrade and wasn't worth the upgrade
from the last gen 6 and 6-plus
fat anything older certainly be a
welcomed upgrade you got to thinking
about buying an iPhone now certainly
wait on it I have had a few things
change battery life is degraded a lot
for me over the past 10 months and today
I used to be able to get about 60%
battery life left on my 6s plus now with
down almost 20% from that to about 40% I
don't know what happens maybe it's
memory drain maybe I've got a bad cell
in here but either way better life has
not been as outstanding as I would have
expected for incessant fasted expect
from the latest Apple phone but really
not much faster in real-world use than
versus the previous generation that
seems to be the theme here it was a nice
phone not much a reason to upgrade as we
head into the iPhone 7 and we're looking
at things being removed like 3.5
millimeter headset jack and perhaps a
profile switcher on the side this might
be a phone that you might consider
hanging onto a photo while long as we
get to maybe the iPhone 7 plus or the
iPhone 7s plus then the iPhone 8 after
that think about what you're going to
want from your phone if we're going to
want something that's going to have a
3.5 millimeter headset jack I would wait
until after the iPhone 7 comes out one
of these up at a discounted price if I
were you and I could go back in time and
file
going to upgrade from a six or a six
plus I still wouldn't do it
I've enjoyed the iPhone it's the best
experience for an Apple device that you
can have out there but it's not
necessarily the best experience for me
what do you guys think have you enjoyed
your 6s and your 6s plus you wish you
wouldn't have upgraded you wish you had
upgraded earlier now you're waiting for
the next-gen let me know what you guys
think about the phone leave in the
comments down below the video a thumbs
up we always appreciate it the next time
genre and Jeff and TechnoBuffalo see ya
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
