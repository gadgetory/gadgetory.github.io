from TechnoBuffalo and today iOS 10 has
been released so here I am I'm gonna run
off a couple new features of iOS 10 what
I'm excited about and I want to hear
from you guys as well in the comments
down below let's go and get started so
the first thing we're going to be doing
is picking up our phone and when we pick
it up the screen lights up on its own
the phone is ready for action this is a
very small but welcome change it worked
every time seamlessly unlocking the
phone has also changed significantly now
you press the home button to unlock it
and by swiping left and right you can go
either to the widgets the camera or if
you swipe up you can go to the control
center so these are all features and
apps we're very familiar with the way
you get to them however is completely
different sticking with the lock screen
we have new updated notification so
Apple is now incorporating more 3d touch
aspects into the lock screen so for
example if you 3d touch your messages
you can pull up the entire conversation
and respond to it right then and there
this is not that different than what we
had before with your quick responses
however the context of the entire
message I guess is much nicer and what
we saw probably get the biggest series
of updates was messages already built in
the iMessage we're now going to be
seeing link previews which is incredibly
welcome and will also be seeing things
like handwriting support and digital
touch which are all coming from the
Apple watch so now I message has its own
app store an app store of an app store
or an app store of a nap rather it will
allow you to get I message extensions to
get sticker packs and integrate
different aspects of messaging to
further just expand the way we express
and communicate with each other this
next update was a big one you can
finally now hide first party apps from
Apple you're not actually deleting them
you're hiding them finally next we have
third-party integration with Siri which
will basically allow you to say things
like order me an uber or call me a lift
and you'll have that done control center
has also seen an update although I'm not
sure if it's the greatest update the big
thing for me was they've moved the music
player over now to its own card so you
have to swipe another time other than
just up before you can get to your music
player not sure from a huge fan of that
they have added 3d touch however for
example by using the flashlight and
using 3d touch you can select what
setting you want the flashlight on and
so that's pretty much it for the
video guys there are a ton of other
features in iOS 10 that we did not get
to cover these are simply the ones we
were most excited about but let me know
in the comments down below which ones
you are excited about which ones you are
looking forward to give us a thumbs up
if you liked this video we really
appreciate it and I'll see you guys in
the next one thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
