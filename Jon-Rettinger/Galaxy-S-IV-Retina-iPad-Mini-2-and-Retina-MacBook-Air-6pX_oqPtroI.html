to you by carbonite welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup this year we
take all the tech rumors from the week
from all over the world and smash and
bash them into one video awesomeness
telling you everything you need to know
from the week up this week samsung
galaxy s4 announcement is definitely
coming march 14th iPad Mini second
generation screen production is already
ramping up and a newly redesigned
MacBook Air rumored with Retina display
and Intel's new Harwell processors comin
soon and a google exec himself says an
upcoming next device will have insanely
great camera this is rumor roundup go
and get started the samsung galaxy s4 we
are hanging rumors that announcement is
definitely coming march 14th the report
said if you believe sources that are
speaking to the verge the event will
indeed be held in the US though though
such details and specs and carry
availability are still being withheld
ash the device itself the design
supposedly is a tightly guarded secret
rumbling suggest though that much of the
show stopping breakthroughs sometime
next month are going to focus more on
software and less on the hardware the
leap and cool new features from the
Samsung Galaxy S treat the next flagship
we bigger than the leap from the s2 to
the s3 at least that's according to the
verge you can expect things like a
bigger screen 1080p resolution wireless
charging built in and hopefully
octa-core processing which is an awesome
way of saying it's got eight core so it
should be crazy fast ipad mini second
generation screen production is already
ramping up and also we've seen the back
shells are starting to show for what
might be a little fatter iPad Mini
according to digit times which listen
admittedly as a hit-or-miss track record
when it comes to apple rumors but this
is a rumor show exclaiming AU Optronics
is finally caught up on its panel
shipments for the first generation and
is turning its attention to what's to
come next ever since the launch of the
first generation iPad Mini
last year rumors have circulated that a
second generation device would feature
retina display it seems like a logical
evolution I use my iPad Mini as my only
ipad I would love to see a high
resolution screen in that guy any report
states that Apple is prepping for the
next generation macbook air sometime
around the third quarter of 2013 the
source claims the update will include
facelift and the usual hardware upgrades
including the latest Intel processors
and possibly the addition of retina
supply models interesting though reports
are saying the retina display is going
to consume actually more power than the
current display technology as well as a
price premium we've seen in the rest of
the macbook line there is long boasted
impressive battery life and was the
cheapest in the macbook family all this
change might finally eliminate that
google exec is saying the upcoming next
necklace will have an insanely great
camera Google's Vic goon dorada senior
vice president engineering says the
company's next line might become
insanely great and that's his quote gun
dorada didn't reveal any specifics about
what he meant by insanely great but as
optimism certainly has us interested
particularly because Motorola's alleged
X phone was supposedly be so killer so
while manufacturers keep trying to outdo
each other with bigger screens better
specs seems the focus is slowly gearing
towards better cameras yeah megapixels
have been ramped up in the past few
years but with technology like PureView
and HTC's new ultra pixel technology and
their one phone starting to see sensors
and optics noticeably improve so maybe
the spec race is over and counting or
focus on fine-tuning and getting just
awesome performing phones and cameras
what do you guys want the next Nexus to
have I would love a few different screen
sizes I love a phablet Nexus than a
normal screen size Nexus I to give
different options similar what we've got
with the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 but maybe
that's just me most importantly though I
want me some key lime pie i crammed into
that guy hopefully with some awesome new
Android features Google's been super
good about software updates and evolving
operating systems let me step away from
the rumors for a minute think our
