to you by domain.com what's going on
guys the markings hanging from
technobuffalo with another new episode
of rumor roundup today we're going to be
talking about the HTC One m9 the galaxy
s6 and the one plus two so let's get
started talking about HTC yet again last
week's episode we showed you guys the
alleged pictures of the one m9 but fresh
reports are saying the HTC has been
tricking us all along with fake versions
of One m9 smart very smart HTC now two
days ago F leaks posted a picture on
twitter with the caption old habits die
hard showcasing previous leaks is
evidence that leaks is a reliable source
now the one m9 and the one m9 plus a
divisive was leaked a week ago they
share similarities with older models but
also appear to feature distinct designs
of their own now the one m9 is packing
ultra pixel technology which means
bigger sensor in more light coming in
resulting in better low-light shots for
selfies now the one m9 plus on the other
hand is sporting some sort of home
button at the bottom now I don't know
how I feel about that just yet it looks
like a Samsung device to me which isn't
a bad thing but I think HTC can design
something better now with the one m9 it
looks like the black logo bar found on
the one m7 and the One m8 are gone
finally I never really liked that black
bar cuz I kept thinking is my home
button now moving on to the galaxy s6
phonearena got its hands on a photo of
what appears to be an early prototype
for the device now the galaxy s6 looks
pretty good in this picture if it is
real it's thin and modern while still
offering that familiar Samsung style we
also can't help but notice that the rear
camera isn't flush with the rest of
device which isn't all that uncommon for
samsung but is that a big deal at all
well for me not really but I like where
Samsung's design language is going I
absolutely love the Galaxy alpha and a
no 4s design with its premium looking
exterior and hopefully we'll see that on
the Galaxy s6 now the other thing we're
also expecting from Samsung is a more
toned down version of TouchWiz similar
to what we're seeing on stock Android
less bloatware and much lighter on the
software side of things now what does
that mean to you whoa services like s
voice as translator story album and
others will be optional apps and
services that you can download likely
from the google play store now i would
love to see this in the next version of
TouchWiz and I
a lot of people will like it as well

rumors for just a quick second and thank

now last but not least let's talk about
the 1+2 the chinese started behind last
year's hottest phone is reportedly hard
at work on a follow-up device but
according to a report from forbes
contributor eewan spence it won't
actually hit the market until the third
quarter of 2015 now citing anonymous
sources spence also adds that the phone
is being held back on purpose while
caulking sorts out alleged issues with
the Snapdragon 810 processor now the
recent reports claimed that the
processor is prone to overheating and
clearly 1 plus doesn't want to take any
chances now I personally love the
oneplus one and I can't wait to see what
one plus has to offer for the next
iteration of their device anyways that's
it for this episode of rumor roundup
