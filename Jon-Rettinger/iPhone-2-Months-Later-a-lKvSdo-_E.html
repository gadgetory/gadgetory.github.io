Lakers comm got some stuff behind me and
it's be unboxed but that's for another
day today it's all about the iPhone it's
been about three months since the iPhone
first came out three months since I've
had it I thought it'd be a great
opportunity to give you guys an updated
review and some updated opinions on it
you know you've seen all the hardware
you know the buttons you know the
features I'm not gonna go over that I'm
just gonna discuss briefly my
impressions now that I've had the phone
for about three months whenever you're
watching this
today is September 10th this is before
the 2.1 update I wanted to get this
video out before that update came so I
could post opinions before and after
first thing I still love the iPhone it's
still one of the most advanced he's back
technology I've ever used qual quality
is still fantastic I am however having
some Network issues and now that's been
addressed numerous times by a TMT I get
drop calls on a fairly regular basis
that I never had with another phone and
if you guys can see here I get up for
you I get one bar of 3G service in my in
my apartment which can be quite annoying
because it keeps dropping and now people
can't hear me and the phone occasionally
has some hard time switching back over
to edge outside my apartment however
there five bars I'm hoping this update
will fix the reception issues that I'm
having within my home
the next thing I want to talk about is
battery life since the most recent
firmware update my battery life has
actually gotten worse
so bad in fact that actually had to turn
push email off which is one of the
features I was really looking forward to
on the iPhone 3G with mobile me what you
know you can get on the first generation
iPhone as well
with the with mobile me turned out with
push email turned off I can now get
through a full day but usually around 10
11 o'clock at night I get the 20% left
warning so the battery's been ok but
hasn't been as strong as it was before I
don't know if it's battery degradation
or just because the software is
requiring more juice I know Apple had
said that there are problems with the
older firmwares asking for too much
power from the
I'm hoping that that would be fixed
again with the new software update using
the GPS has been awesome I'm really
happy to have it
that's the numerous times that's come in
handy and having 3G when I'm outside of
my apartment has been great the download
speeds really are just as fast as as
fast as advertised so I still recommend
the phone
I recommend waiting though until see
what this 2.1 update does there are
still some issues with the phone that
I'm hoping will be fixed again very
happy with it I don't regret it at all
still my favorite phone but it's not as
perfect as I hoped it would be all I
will say one of the best things about
the iPhone is definitely the the App
Store you can see all my apps I've got
going on there
I actually just downloaded we can see it
right there spore origins it's actually
a lot of fun definitely would recommend
it if you guys are looking for good
reviews by the way on the App Store you
guys can go check out App Store reviewer
on YouTube a friend of mine he makes
very good videos I'll put a link to him
up in the sidebar so anyway guys I'm
still I still love my iPhone I just wish
Apple affixing annoying bugs I'm hoping
the next video I make brought the iPhone
which will be post 2.1 update I can say
fantastic everything's been fixed right
so anyway guys just wanted to give you a
quick update sure to check out the
website wwg on for Lakers comm this is
John rhett endure and I will see you in
the next video I guess
hey guys john r Ettinger here with John
