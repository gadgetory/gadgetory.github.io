to give you an overview of the sense UI
found on the HTC hero for sprint we
first took a look at the sense UI back a
few months ago when it was released in
europe as a gsm-only version but since
its come to the US and come to the US
with friends the eris for verizon will
be a very similar experience however
with the sprint version here you're
going to get some things that you won't
get with verizon so let me show you what
this looks like there's been a lot of
talk over android 2.0 android 1.5 well
the hero is running android 1.5 but it's
running a completely new skin on top of
it done by a company called HTC that
traditionally makes windows mobile
phones but it's moved over to make a
tremendous amount of android phones as
well it's a complete skin that goes all
the way all the way down and what the
skin means is it adds functionality and
put sort of a fresh coat of paint on the
operating system now with Android to
point out of cool new features like turn
free turn-by-turn directions but with
the sprint version with they're simply
everything plans you get a better
turn-by-turn navigation option which
I'll show you guys a little bit later
let's go ahead and get started and for
the record HTC and sprint have both said
that android 2.0 will be coming out to
this device that was a concern of yours
so with the typical Android device
you're going to get three home screens
with the sense you why I'll show you is
a little bit different so the unlock
screen is sort of unique to take this
and you throw it down so we actually get
seven home screens here you can navigate
them with your finger using the
capacitive touchscreen or this touch bar
right here so everything on the home
screen is completely customizable so
what I've got right here is the time the
weather which automatically updated so
I'm an Irvine it's mostly sunny 66
degrees Fahrenheit it's gorgeous here in
Southern California and one of the nice
things about Android is that it's
completely widget based and with the
sense UI you get a lot of more widgets
and increase functionalities let me show
you what some of those are to access the
widgets on a blank home screen or any
home screen simply hold your finger down
so you get your shortcuts your Android
widgets your folders and
one called HTC widgets and that's
completely unique to the HTC devices
running the sense UI let me show you
what's these are some of them are very
useful bookmarks I'll show you that
calendar clock footprints which is a
very cool geo-tagging application so
let's say you're traveling with a friend
you want to take a picture of you in
front of the world's largest ball of
twine take a picture and a lotta
matically know where you were you can
add notes to it so that way you never
lose track of where your pictures were
taken I've got a male plug in a
Methodist plug in music people photo
album photo frame search settings stocks
Twitter and whether pneus does have a
pretty decent built-in twitter client
let me show you a few of these I can't
walk you through everyone this would be
probably a 45 minute video but i will
show you some of the highlights so let's
take a look here and go to calendar I
forget what I've got going on an hour
from now let alone in a week from now so
I rely very heavily on calendar so let
me go ahead and select that I'll put
this on this blank homepage and we will
choose what we wanted to look like what
you want to belittle and tell you what
you have tomorrow whether you want just
a massive calendar there that you can
select the dates let's go ahead and
select the massive calendar so i can go
through and see what I got going on the
next day I can select different dates I
can go ahead and add new appointments
and the sense UI skin goes all the way
down to the calendar as well it really
is quite handy and very easy to use and
if you want to get rid of any one of
these widgets you tap it down right down
there turns into remove and you judge
drag it to the trash let me show you
some of the other functionality here the
sense UI and some the other widgets that
you're going to get and things you might
enjoy those you that follow me on
Twitter you know that I use it quite a
bit so there is a built-in Twitter
functionality and you can sort of select
again how you want it to look we want
just to be little with your recent
tweets or big will go for the little one
this time all you do is you login with
your twitter name not going to do that
right now and all of your tweets will
show up right there and you can see that
it's very easy to use and simple to
navigate as is all I enjoy I think it's
very easy to learn there's a bit of a
learning curve at first point to get to
hang up the gin
navigation it's really quite simple so
one of the cool things that HTC has
added that really no other US released
android devices have is a multi touch
especially multi-touch in the browser so
let me show you what that looks like I'm
going to open up a web page here we'll
go ahead and open up technobuffalo calm
and you get a chance to see how quickly
this loads as well and this is over a
Wi-Fi connection although sprint's 3g is
very fast that's of course over evdo rev
0 the browser has been completely
revamped and redone for HTC a and it's
been done by HTC as well so I think it's
something that separates the hero from
the rest of the Android devices so
actually when you think of Android now a
lot of people are thinking of the droid
but the hero really is a nice middle
ground so let me show you what this
looks like so here we are on
TechnoBuffalo and you can advocate just
as you could on other Android devices
you can scroll around still finishing
loading here but no matter scrolling is
pretty smooth it's not resizing to the
whole page but you can pan around and
see what you'd like so one of the very
cool things like I mentioned is
multi-touch I can pinch and zoom my way
around this phone I want to zoom in and
zoom out it works exactly like you'd
expect pinch and zoom to work you can
double tapped on an area and it will
zoom in it won't automatically fit the
text that area but it will bring it up
I've gotten very used to this
functionality of pinch and zoom and I
think it really adds the utility of a
browser so actually a very fully
functioning capable browser like the one
found on the HTC hero now the hero
doesn't have a built-in physical
keyboard it relies exclusively on a
wireless keyboard or a virtual keyboard
rather so let me show you what that
looks like as well because it's HTC's
own keyboard not the standard default
keyboard that you get with android
devices to the browser here is very
smooth so go ahead and close this will
go into mail
after let's go to messages instead open
up messaging and will compose a message
so this keyboard is extremely useful and
very accurate and certainly will take
advantage of the accelerometer for
either portrait or landscape there's a
bit of delay with the rotation times
screen will gray out a little bit and
then change the keyboard how it works
you get haptic feedback feedback and
love to vibrate and then you get the
letter showing up above which makes it
very easy to type I found this keyboard
to be one of the best virtual keyboard
I've ever used and I think HTC has done
a great job tailoring your device for
that so if you're wondering about or
worried about not having a full qwerty
keyboard don't worry the soft keyboard
or virtual is fantastic let's go back to
the home screen and we'll keep taking a
tour of the sense UI there's a lot to
show here I'm going to highlight some of
just the the biggest features so
something other things that you're going
to get are these built-in sprint
functionality so I mentioned earlier
with android 2.0 you get access to
Google Maps navigations beta what was
sprint you have access to their complete
sprint navigation which is just a talent
app service which is available for for
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile it's a great turn-by-turn
navigation service which generally comes
at an extra cost except with sprint and
the that is very nice you're getting a
lot of value for your money with HTC and
sense UI you're also getting stocks so
you get a very nice stocks application
and pulls it in from yahoo finance
you're getting the same Android YouTube
viewer that you've seen in other devices
and you've got some weather
functionality and some accelerometer
games you've got quickoffice and this
will sync up with exchange servers as
well okay this is just a short tour of
the sense UI found on the HTC hero in
this case for sprint hope you enjoyed
there's a lot more in depth at we could
go but I want you to get an overview of
what you can expect when you go to a
sprint store you think about picking one
of these up I really am a big fan of
this ncy I think it's implemented very
well the combination of capacitive
touchscreen and physical buttons really
is a very nice combination
and having seven home screens for all
your added functionality is great you
can use one for Twitter 14 calendar 14
application shortcuts 14 contacts really
you can use them for as many things as
you like and it really makes a for a
very usable device so guys hope you
enjoyed for exclusive content checking
out of twitter twitter.com / john for
