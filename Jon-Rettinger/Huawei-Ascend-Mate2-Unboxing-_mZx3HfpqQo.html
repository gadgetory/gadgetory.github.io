TechnoBuffalo here I like my phones big
and I've always got one they're hoping I
and you are going to enjoy in this buck
I've got the Koala way ascend mates too
you might not have heard the name but
always hoping to change that to trying
to get more of a foothold into the US
market let's go ahead and see how the
ascend mate to helps them with that here
is the box for the hallway ascend mate -
look at that how would you think you
pronounce that if you don't have any
idea like I didn't it is hallway and
they are hoping you're going to remember
their name the Chinese company is trying
to make a name for themselves in the US
market and what we've got is their
latest phablet a large green device it
is a hallway ascend to me to this 6.1
inch phone pack some pretty nice pecs go
ahead and take a look it's got a nice
little slide out thing which does make
things a bit easier then the typical
kind of boxes you got to open up I know
complaining about a hardest open a box
those it's absolutely complaint I will
go ahead and pull this guy out sometimes
I forget how big six inch phones
actually are actually hold one shut off
to the side for a real quick second so
you'd else we're going to have inside of
this box we got nothing under there
about a wager there's something in this
side it looks like there is we've got
accessories if you want to see more
detail of this hit the link down below
to go to our contact number for comment
got a gallery kind of a unique looking
wall work square but same USB port same
plugs you probably have about 12 of
seeking of 12 oh we've got a micro USB
port so you can charge and sync your
device push all that stuff off to the
side here is the pretty big huawei
ascend mates - I rented a specs and we
will power the sucker on
so a 6.1 inch display which technically
is HD but it's 720 by 1280 giving it a
241 PPI it's got a really nice camera on
the back a 13 megapixel sensor and a 5
megapixel compadre living right there on
the front a quad-core processor
Snapdragon 400 here
sixteen gigabytes of storage and two
gigs of RAM and it's gonna keep going
for close to sixty hours with a 4050
milliamp hour battery I'm gonna go ahead
and power this sucker own all right
you've got all this thing powered on let
me go ahead and walk you through the
phone itself no buttons and very slim
bezels living right here on the front so
you can bet they're going to be buttons
on screen on the left hand side we've
got nothing on the right hand side got a
little bit of action volunteer Proctor
up and down power and lock button
located below the volume rock which I
like because it's a big phone and kind
of hard to stretch your thumb all the
way up there as often as you might need
that guy 3.5 millimeter headset jack on
the table noise cancelling mic noise
cancelling mic on the bottom as well as
your charge and sync port let's go ahead
and turn the sucker on it's got
something neat on it they're calling
glows mode which means you can use your
phone when you're using gloves I don't
have gloves but I will use my shirt see
if it works
hey it did work that's neat don't always
uh see that happening so if you live
somewhere it's cold you like to wear
gloves and the warm because your hipster
like that you might want to consider
this device a quick look at the UI they
customized it a bit certainly customize
the icons but they did kind of leave
Android alone the put sort of a fresh
coat of paint on it so to speak let's go
ahead and see what's going to be in the
app drawer so go ahead scroll over all
your apps now show up right here no
particular app drawer if you were
looking for one so just you know where I
get it sort of Apple style meaning all
your applications are gonna show up as
you scroll so the UI on this is called
emotion UI but nice things but Android
if you don't like the way this looks or
you don't like to have all your apps
show up here you can put on your own
skin you could put on your own OS you
can do all kinds of customizations on it
I'll just sort of the beauty of the
operating system so quick look here at
the device it's big it's sort of high
resolution and I served in that mid
price if you want to check out always
official site for pricing because they
change every day so I hate to say prices
in an initial unboxing video or two
things later it could be a hundred bucks
less but you can get unlocked and it
does have 4G LTE capabilities in the US
so you'd be able to use it on 18 T's
network if you want to pick up a phone
and don't want to sign a contract to be
able to do that click look here at the
camera UI it's a pretty standard and
very fair go ahead and go back if you
guys want to see any particular about
the hallway ascend may to be sure to let
me know I'm going to recover that in
future videos and review if you guys
think that you want to see that again
until next time I'm John written
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video
bye bye thank you guys for watching if
you like what you saw please subscribe
they'll be the first ones to know when
new videos come up we have a ton of
stuff we do unboxing to do hands-on
reviews cars and everything in between
the Nets do consumer electronics we'd
love to have you stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
