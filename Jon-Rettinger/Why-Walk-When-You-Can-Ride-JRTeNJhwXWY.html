from TechnoBuffalo and a couple of
months ago we did a video called
transport tech we covered three
alternative ways to get around whether
it be the boosted board the ER be or the
specialized electric bike today we're
back with part two of that series three
other alternative ways to get around
they come in at different price points
different budgets and we want to see
whether they're any good or not let's go
ahead an get started this last year
hoverboards became all the rage and for
a lot of us it was a reminder of what
segway originally made the whole paul
blart mall cop style standing segway now
segway is jumping into that hoverboard
market with this sort of hybrid product
called the mini pro it's very similar to
your standard hoverboard however it has
a stick in the middle that goes in
between your legs that you allow to
maneuver side to side the wheels are a
little bit bigger and as a whole the
whole thing is a bit more stable a
little bit slower the trade-offs that we
really recognize where the hoverboards
are a little more fun a little faster a
little riskier compared to the segway
mini pro it really boils down with a
question of how thrill-seeking are you
also some of the hoverboards have a
history of blowing up the segway mini
pro does not so if you're willing to
explode go fast and fall hoverboards are
perfect for you but if you're interested
in shying away from these things much
like i am the segway mini pro is gonna
be a great alternative another cool
little feature with the segway mini pro
is the app that allows you to wirelessly
control the mini pro without having
anybody on it i don't know how useful
this is but it's definitely a cool party
trick next we have the COO wheel d3m
this is effectively a budget version of
the boosted board in some ways it's
better and usable in other ways it is
not its way cheaper than a boosted work
coming in at six hundred dollars for the
dual motor version whereas for a boosted
board you have to be well over a
thousand dollars to get that same dual
motor version however there's a lot of
differences and you see that price gap
really come into play here well the
board is built pretty well it doesn't
have that flexible type deck that the
boosted board has which is not
necessarily a con it's just something
cool that I really missed but the big
issues were really with the remote
controller it's super super low quality
and there's very very low amount of
travel on the thumb controller meaning
the acceleration deceleration is super
abrupt if you've ever ridden an electric
skateboard you know they can be very
sketchy combine this with the short
travel of the thumb controller and it's
an accident waiting to happen one of the
bigger issues with the control
it would just randomly disconnect while
I was using it since we experienced this
issue kuya reached out to us and let us
know that this was a manufacturing issue
that has now been fixed but
unfortunately we have no way of testing
this but when it did work it worked well
enough at the price range so if this is
gonna be something that you're just
going to want to have fun with over the
weekends I can recommend it if you want
to use a day-to-day commuter this is
nowhere near good enough or reliable
enough and I would recommend selling out
the extra money on something higher end
and last but definitely not least we
have an electric folding bike from turn
called a vectron this bike is very
expensive it retails for thirty four
hundred dollars and if you supported
them on Kickstarter you could get one
for three thousand dollars regardless
this is not going to be a fun toy you
just buy because you want to this is
going to be a commuting alternative that
you use to get from point A to point B
the good thing is for that purpose this
bike lives up to everything that you
would want except the folding
portability part I want to make it clear
that while it does fold up in under 10
seconds as advertised it is 48.1 pounds
by no means are you can be carrying this
thing around quickly and easily it's
definitely a heavy piece of machinery
it's up to you whether or not you're
willing to put up with the wait for me
I'd much rather have a lighter standard
folding bike that I pedal myself however
once you have unfolded this bike it
works pretty well the bike itself feels
very high quality feels very very
premium from there onward you're pretty
much just pedaling yourself so your top
speed is really dictated by how fast you
can ride a bike if your Lance Armstrong
that's going to be a lot faster than
what I got it has arranged between 30 to
80 miles of distance which is very good
you can go very very long distances I'm
not sure who's going 80 miles on the
bike in one trip but if you are props to
you a feature the turn is very proud of
is that this is the first Bosch powered
electric bike I mean you can walk into
any box store and pick up a replaceable
battery that will fit immediately and
you'll be on your merry way I thought
this meant you would carry around a
spare batter in your backpack for extra
range or whatever reason I don't know
why you need an extra battery with 80
miles of rain but if you did I thought
that would be a really cool way to carry
one around however I come to find out
that the batteries are insanely
expensive somewhere between 600 to 900
dollars depending on the capacity or
more if you're going to be going for a
bigger capacity battery so battery
plates ones on here are going to be once
the battery dies but we were also told
the components of the bike would wear
down before the battery wears down which
is obviously very good sign because the
components feel very solid in very high
quality just know that if you're willing
to deal with the weight of this folding
electric bike it's a great travel and
transport alternative and so that's
pretty much it for this video guys those
are three alternative tech transport
methods using electricity let us know
what you guys think in the comments down
below do you like any of them would you
get any of these three and do you like
this series if you want to see more from
us give us a thumbs up and we'll see you
guys in the next one thank you so much
