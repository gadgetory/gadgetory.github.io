technobuffalo here the pigs are back to
their shenanigans and tomfoolery the
angry birds have returned but this time
they're in outer space for some
unexplained reason let's go ahead and
take a look at the newest addition to
Rovio's cash cow this is angry birds
space so this is a new take on the
familiar gameplay of pig smashing using
some pseudo physics here let's go take a
look at anger e birds so these guys are
in space here's a gameplay can see the
different levels pic Bank cold cuts
danger zone egg steroids and then stuff
it's coming soon rovio has been really
good about updating content for all
their angry birds games let's go and
take a look and let me show you the
gameplay I'll go and take a look at
level 2 thought I played level 1 and got
three stars no big deal so here's the
basis so you still got the slingshots
and the birds and there are some new
birds here as well including an ice bird
and some very angry looking red ones but
essentially you've got these little
planets and what's around it is gravity
so instead of the older Angry Birds
where you just shot the bird straight
ahead and followed a normal trajectory
this time actually gets sucked into
gravity and spins around as you can see
there so let me go ahead and show you
zoom out just a little bit I'm go ahead
and take this year bird you can see as I
move this the trajectory moves as it
crosses gravity so I want to go right
about there to hit that bird it'll cross
and then it'll start hitting me some
pigs and boom I knock three of them
again so it's really a new way to play
the game and it adds new challenges to
it so it should be a lot of fun actually
and then the you know now two levels i
played it's been it's been fun it's sort
of a fresh coat of paint on the Angry
Birds model go ahead and go to the next
level and take it out of look you can
see things get different sometimes
you're actually inside of the gravity
field so you've got to go all the way
around to hit anything so if we go back
that way then I can start to hopefully
see the direction I need to go and loop
back around and get that pig alright
just miss deaf pig but you can
definitely see the different sort of
gameplay options that Rovio's
here so it's pretty a pretty neat set of
systems I'm gonna figure guys are going
to miss the the old angry birds that
we've seen or the familiar gameplay but
certainly as fresh and it brings for
that love Angry Birds certainly many
hours spent on the toilet will be wasted
with angry birds which is coincidentally
where I do my best gaming so what do you
guys think you excited for Angry Birds
you can pick it up for the ipad for 299
it's available on android devices it's
available on in the Mac App Store you
can pick it up on a PC it's available in
a ton of different platforms angry birds
space is available now see you guys the
next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
