techno buff flew here it's an unboxing
for you of the 27 inch Apple LED Cinema
Display let's go anything in so think of
the cinema display as a 27-inch iMac -
the Mac it really shares all the screen
components that it's bigger brother does
let me go ahead and run through the
specs real quickly and then we'll go
ahead and dig in
this guy's gonna ship it set you back
just about shy of $1000 which is pretty
comparable prices to like models from
Dell and Samsung the resolution is going
to be 2560 by 1440 16 by 9 aspect ratio
gonna actually give you 60% more pixels
than the outgoing 24-inch model of
course LED backlit got something called
in pain switching or IPS you might have
heard of them it gives you pretty good
visibility from all angles it's got a
built-in iSight it's got a microphone
it's got three USB ports ambient light
sensor it makes its connection with the
Emmaus blackboard so if you want to use
this with any other computer other than
immaculate doesn't have a mate
DisplayPort you have a bit of difficulty
it also has a built in light sensor
something to keep in mind enough of me
yapping let's go ahead and dig into this
guy so of course we will use a senior
stab ou for this so on the box you've
got a picture of the 27 inch LED cinemas
play probably see what this looks like
before here's a sort of rehash of the
specs on the top and I will point with
the knife another picture on the sides
on the back you've got exactly what you
have on the front picture of the device
alright so with Apple there generally
are some compromises to be made while
there might be spec force pack pretty
comparable price one of the other models
you are gonna get limited inputs so
you're just left with the DisplayPort
option here you don't have an HDMI in or
out which for me was okay I plan on
using this just as a monitor but if you
need something that you want to do
gaming on or hook a blu-ray player up to
you're going to want to look elsewhere
if you need something that's just going
to be a monitor and hook up with your
Mac the LED cinema supplies well maybe
good option and of course I'll be
reviewing this guy and see if it really
is worth the money let's go ahead and
cut the classic here there was a lot of
it let me open this up just a little bit
of the plastic on the side alright so we
have our literacy Logan looking broken
designed by Apple in California I'm not
sure what they're gonna give you in here
when we can't be any driver damn I'm
supposed to just plug it in let's go
ahead and check it out
looks like it's just some warranty
information and a Apple cleaning cloth
what do you do pull this out there's
just some styrofoam packing top and
inside that you've got these cinema
display it's go ahead and see if I can
pull this guy out of here there it is
so pull this out like there's some cores
some more chords let's take a look at
the display itself this guy is not light
I'll tell you alright so let's go ahead
and the sort of ICH protective this is
probably the only time I'm ever gonna
see this thing smudge break so I always
enjoy it you guys actually see it first
before I will I'm like a magician
voila alright so here is the 27-inch
display looks sort of very similar to
what we've seen for past models
dissimilar to the iMac it's got sort of
the black face around it it doesn't have
any sort of chin it's got the edge to
edge glass that you seen there's the
eyesight and the microphone limbs right
on top let's go ahead take a look at the
back which is where all these ports and
options are going to live and it feels
almost the same weight as the 27-inch
iMac Peter instantly enough alright so
go ahead and pull this guy back let's go
ahead and take a look at these
here so you've got three USB ports and
that's about it
power cord in the back this is where
some of the things that make this unique
and serve a perfect complement to math
live are these cords that come out of it
so you've got the DisplayPort option of
course which is you be able to use with
any modern Mac you also have a Mac safe
adapter which you can charge any sort of
match with really meant for a laptop
accessories you can charge your MacBook
Air MacBook MacBook Pro and the USB port
to connect to power it transiently
enough these three USB ports on the back
right here will draw power even one of
the monitors off so you're getting
essentially a three USB port hub and we
just have sir your standard Apple power
cord so of course I will use this guy I
will review this guy and I'll let you
know if it's worth it be sure to stay
tuned the TechnoBuffalo for all the
details I am John renter and I will see
you in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
