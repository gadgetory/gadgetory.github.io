sheds its beta tag onuma talks Majora's
Mask remakes Blizzard is shutting down
Diablo 3's auction houses and how to
sell your used iphone it's Buffalo Bill
it sometime hello internet and welcome
to the Buffalo bulletin where we
recapped five major stories from our
site TechnoBuffalo every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story we talked about on
the show check the description for links
or click on the graphics for each story
if you have annotations available and
toggled on I'm ashley Esqueda here your
top stories yesterday google announced
it acquired bump a popular file sharing
app for iOS and Android the concept is
really simple with bump you just bump
two phones together to share things like
contact information pictures and more
and it's even got desktop integrations
is a pretty cool app there's no word yet
though on how Google plans to implement
bumps technology in the future of
Android but we're pretty sure we'll be
seeing bump and its companion photo
sharing app flock baked into the OS
before long KitKat anyone when C
relaunched in fall of two thousand
eleven it was with a cumbersome beta
caveat attached about addendum is no
more as Siri seems to have shed her beta
status in the past few days in
preparation for the iOS 7 launch
tomorrow Apple's changed the Siri
landing page on their official site to
reflect series non beta status and
they've added more functionality to
cupertino's favorite digital assistant
we're hoping this means a more capable
improved Siri moving forward in gaming
Blizzard dropped a little bit of a bomb
today on Diablo 3 players announcing
plans to completely shut down both the
real money and gold auction houses for
the game on March 18th of 2014 Diablo 3
players have argued it takes the fun out
of the game and it seems Blizzard ended
up agreeing with them and hoping their
new loot 2 point 0 system combined with
this auction house shutdown will help
balance the games economy as a launch
day Diablo 3 player I am fine with all
this just as long as they don't take my
firebats away Paragon level 62 witch
doctor
but also in gaming longtime Legend of
Zelda producer edgy onuma spoke to IGN
about a potential Majora's Mask remake
well I guess technically he laughed at a
question about the remake and then said
it was up to his fans to interpret his
laughter in the way they saw fit now
whether that means he'll helm a remake
of majora's mask or not we have no idea
but his response is pretty interesting
especially considering how hard Nintendo
is currently pushing the wind waker HD
remake lastly our wild card for the week
is all about selling your old iPhone to
grab some cash for the new one we cover
a bunch of services and their pros and
cons from ebay to gazelle to craigslist
if you're planning on picking up an
iphone 5s or 5c later this week it's
always good to know what your options
are for cashing in on an older device me
