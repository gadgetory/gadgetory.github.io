(#2)</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2016-06-20</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiYyYwXmNNY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">the stock apps on iOS are usually pretty
good but there are a lot of third-party
applications that fill gaps that Apple
did not a fast couple weeks ago we put
up a video showing top 5 alternative
apps to stock and we asked you guys to
give us your favourites what you put on
your phone and you guys came through big
time so every app that I'm thinking for
this video came from the comments of the
last one fun check out the last one I'll
link to it up above you want to download
any of these apps link to them down
below the first one is one that I saw
more than anything in the comments G
board we filmed our previous video
before G board existed it is Google's
take on an iOS keyboard and it is
absolutely awesome you've got things
like gesture typing in there you've got
Google search built right into the
keyboard
we've got emoji search and a ton of
other awesome keyboard options it's free
if you haven't tried it yet download it
immediately the next one to replace
reminders is an app called tick tick
this one's got a ton of really good
features things like syncing tasks
across all your devices you can add a
task by typing or just using your voice
you set multiple reminders to test you
can set priority levels flexibility for
recurring tasks checklist within
checklist and all kinds of other options
that get really granular if you rely a
lot on reminders tick tick is a good way
to go for replacement for email should
give an airmail a shot available for
either the iPhone or the iPad my
favorite feature that's built in ear
read receipts so you can know that
person actually read that email that
they claim to or if they just said they
lost it but you know better a lot of
other cool features in there as well
like touch ID support the ability to
send the emails later which is one I
really like as well as customizing 3d
touch options if you're looking for
replacement for email give their mail a
shot if you're big into podcasts try
overcast which is an app that I'd never
heard of until I read the comments of
the last video and it does something
that I have never seen before if there's
a lot of dead space in a podcast and
automatically speed it up and you might
think it's not gonna sound too natural
but it's gonna sound really good you
could turn that hour-long podcast it's
maybe 45 minutes it also has great
search functionality built right in and
last but not least
camera plus is gonna give you way more
granular control of your photos than
anything Apple gods have bestowed upon
us
you can set exposure separately from
focus you can now easily control how
light or dark your shots come out
you can use the stabilizer to steady
your iPhone and get the sharpest photos
you can and also kind of cool you can
use the phone's flash to continuously
fill light to improve photo quality
especially for portrait or macro shots
so if you're a phone photographer you
want to get the best pictures
check out camera plus what you guys
think about our updated list that I use
one of your suggestions do you have more
than maybe I didn't mention leave it
down below and we'll do a follow-up
video this next month hope you guys
enjoyed till next time I am John rain
trickle TechnoBuffalo talk to you guys
next video now that you know five apps
let me tell you a little bit our friends
from Atlassian it's a great
collaboration software that you work
with teams communicate from anywhere
around the world you can assign and
track and manage tasks for any project
no matter how complex
that's the clarity of JIRA you can
create and share content organize
results and bring team members up to
speed with confluence they offer an
incredible amount of collaboration
software things like HipChat and
bitbucket check them out at Atlassian
