unboxing for you have call of duty
modern warfare 2 now I fully realized an
unboxing of a videogame but I've had a
lot of requests to actually do this and
I will try and make it as entertaining
as possible but I'm not promising
anything
mostly because I'm boring so I know this
is a little bit of Cillian boxy what
people wanted to see it so I'm going to
go ahead and do it anyway so I got the
Xbox version just cuz it was what they
had I would have gotten the PlayStation
version too
no big deal you got a picture of like a
dude with a thing and a gun on the front
on the back you got more pictures of
dudes with things and some gameplay and
of course that's rated M so if you're 17
or under hire somebody over 18 alright
so we'll use the of course the big ass
knife to dig into the boxer and we will
see what what yet and I'll do this in my
typical unboxing fashion and again yes I
realize this is just an unboxing of a
game I have no delusions of this being
anything more than just sort of a silly
video so go ahead and rip off the pasta
let's see what we're going to get inside
I'm guessing there's a disc
alright so plastics off and there's more
plastic they make these things like
trying to get into CDs it's impossible
alright so i'll hack through that so we
can finally get in yes and look at that
we have a disc so in my typical unboxing
fashion we'll take you guys through it
xbox live your fun never ends
looks like this is a 48 hour free trial
of Xbox Live Gold look to let you play
online
you've got your modern warfare 2 book
which probably tells you how to play and
kill bad guys so keeping with my my
traditional unboxing style let's go
ahead and take the disc and compare it
to some things that you guys might be
familiar with for example here's the
iPhone you guys can see that it's a
little bit fatter but it's definitely
skinnier it's much smaller I mean I
wouldn't really put this in the pocket
because it's so big
but you know it's didn't this maybe you
could you could be able to you might
also be familiar with another product
Halo Wars will do a size comparison here
they do look to be almost the same size
will stack them will go head to head and
look at that they do look to be just
about the same size so that's impressive
they're able to sort of match up
size-wise and here we have Call of Duty
hard warfare 2 guys hope you enjoyed
we're gonna have a ton of more serious
egg reviews on a modern warfare 2 up on
techno buffalo and of course the youtube
channel youtube.com slash John four
Lakers so that's what stay tuned for a
little more real video hope you guys
enjoy them for exclusive content check
me out of Twitter twitter.com slash John
for Lakers and of course for all your
tech news TechnoBuffalo comm where you
can create your own tech blog and make
some money from it so see you guys next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
