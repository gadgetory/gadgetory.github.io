lakers here with an unboxing for you Oh
spore um no just an unboxing of a game I
feel too boring but I thought some of
you guys might want to see it if not no
big deal um I bought spore origins for
the iphone actually really enjoyed it
and arman echo fish told me this is a
great game and talked me into it I
figured I'm gonna give it a whirl it's
actually the only game i have for the
mac or pc for that matter it's my way
computer game so let's give it a real
quick world do the old unboxing tour and
see it says spore on the front picture
of some of the creatures spore on the
side on the back you got some pictures
and a little bit about the game create
volve spore and share but the game it's
about is you create a little bit create
a little creature and you watch them
grow and evolve throughout the game to
create your own civilizations and
villages that kind of stuff so we'll go
ahead give it a lil bit of a world get
open up the front some more sport
pictures nothing terribly exciting stay
look at the DVD in there so i'd slide it
out by can oh it's taped in check out
the obligatory john for lakers big-ass
knife open this thing up all right now
to being slide down Oh still taped up
top cut that a lot of tape on it for one
game all right now it should slide out
and does spore there it does it case
you're wondering with the game costs
let's see it right there 4995 in the US
went and picked this up from best buy
had some gift certificates that i got
his presence so i was put them to good
use bride the game little reflection
their twitter there's back just box
nothing that exciting open it up inside
see what's there probably lost you all
by now since it's just a DVD unboxing
but we'll open it up anyway in case some
of you are still watching
all right open this bad boy out more
stuff sealed right there like CDs thing
is it's possible to get to there we go
all right now let's open it up there's a
game there's a little book actually
pretty thick book that it's got some
pictures and there's a disk and that's
it just you guys know to the windows and
