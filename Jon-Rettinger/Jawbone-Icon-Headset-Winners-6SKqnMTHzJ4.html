technobuffalo here about two weeks ago I
partnered with AT&amp;amp;T to help promote
their don't text and drive campaign a
program that obviously is trying to help
you not text and drive you know odds are
you've seen somebody do it chances are
maybe you even done it yourself I
certainly have been guilty out in the
past what this pledge does it is it's on
EG and keys facebook page it says that
you will no longer text and drive and
you are pledging to make the road safer
for everyone for you me and whoever else
may be out there texting and driving is
really a problem and it's you know even
worse than talking on the phone cuz your
eyes ur is completely off the road
looking down at your phone so it helps
to promote this campaign 18 feet up
coming up with five jawbone icon
bluetooth headset these are the newest
jaw bone head sets that are available
and arguably some of the best bluetooth
accessories on the market so i asked you
guys to take the pledge on AT&amp;amp;T facebook
page upper link in the sidebar k-keep so
like to and then leave a comment on a
technobuffalo post with your pledge
number and i would pick five random
people to win so I did was I took all
the comments put them in a word document
went to random word pick five numbers
and went right down the list to wear
that number was and picked five winners
so the five people that I have are
really just TechnoBuffalo users and
you'll be contacted sometime this
weekend and your headsets will be sent
out early next week I hope to see
unboxing videos of these and sort of
videos about how you like them so the
winners are Taylor Olsen Jason Peck Josh
dog 3 least n and Franklin 5 you guys
are the winners of the jawbone bluetooth
headsets for the don't text and drive
campaign if you didn't win a headset
like many of you didn't since
unfortunately we only had five your
pledge actually a portion of that what
to help a campaign that 18th he was
doing a bit of money to a non-profit
to help fight texting and driving so you
still did a good deed you go you might
now to want a prize and we guys thank
you for your support of this contest and
really is a good cause one that I
believed in I get a lot of sort of
giveaways across my desk and I generally
don't do them all that's something that
I think you guys will enjoy and this one
time something I thought you'd like and
also was a fantastic cause so thank you
Devon taking the pledge yet link will be
in the sidebar downloaded for reading
this on technobuffalo or watching the
video rather so go ahead and take that
pledge anyway i'm jon rettinger and hope
you guys enjoy the headsets and have a
nice weekend I'll see I next video
