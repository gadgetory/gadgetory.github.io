TechnoBuffalo here there have been
rumors of an over-the-air update for the
droid x2 gingerbread verizon has denied
that it is coming but what appears to be
the official or going to be official
gingerbread update to the droid x is
readily available to download and
install on your droid x without any
routing the folks over at droid x forums
all the instructions are going to be
down below have made it idiot proof
proof positive i actually did it here
very very simply this gives you
gingerbread it gives you the updated
version of motoblur which is really
welcome so if you want to check it out
I'll linked your down below let me walk
you through very quickly about what you
can expect on gingerbread on your droid
x so first finally we've gotten rid of
these cartoonish colors the droid x
didn't have it but motoblur definitely
had we've got sort of a new launcher at
the bottom you can put new icons in here
if you'd like but you can only have four
short that looks like if you hold it
down you can go ahead and drop it down
there if you would like so let me go
ahead and show you that this is indeed
running Gingerbread and it is running
two point three point three you can see
right there menu system is now white you
get this sort of gingerbread look when
you scroll to the bottom it's not orange
you get that sort of blue color
hopefully that's picking up on camera
when it gets to the very top so go ahead
and hit home there's a lot of other
gingerbread e things that you might want
to see he hit the home button you're
going to get your panel of icons they
can't be rearranged but they are there
if you want to jump 21 you've got that
option for me again the most welcome
feature definitely is this new launcher
across the bottom really was not a fan
of the way motoblur had it you now have
better use of the screen real estate the
application drawer lives on the
right-hand side go ahead and select an
icon that's the one actually that you
can't change so you really only have
three they can customize at the bottom
here's what the application door it
looks like go ahead and go into recent
let's go ahead and select that and you
now can jump into groups this is sort of
a gingerbread thing but you can see it
here in effect
let's go ahead and get out of there
let's go into all apps as you can see if
anything new is here things look to be
generally same this is very zippy there
you can see a little blue at the bottom
hopefully I updated this yesterday I've
notice a huge increase in speed is quite
nice other gingerbread II things that
you're going to see we now have the app
manager you can manage your applications
you also have profiles which is kind of
neat this is something that the
motorolas doing really it's pretty
standard stuff homework weekend you can
go ahead and customize it any way you
want we'll go ahead and select work
takes a minute and just a blank slate
you customize the background if you like
take a quick look at dem widgets so go
into motorola which I pretty standard
stuff things we've seen in the past that
really redone any of the widgets
unfortunately but at least you don't
have to use them if you don't want to
and finally this new dock crossed the
bottom so this has been a real quick
sneak preview of what you can expect
when you get gingerbread on your droid x
all the instructions again are down
below if you want to give it a shot it
is unofficial just as a disclaimer so if
you do want to do it be wary that you
might have some warranty issues if you
got to go back to verizon I'd only do
this if you own the phone and you're
comfortable restoring back to your
original operating system should the
need arise i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
