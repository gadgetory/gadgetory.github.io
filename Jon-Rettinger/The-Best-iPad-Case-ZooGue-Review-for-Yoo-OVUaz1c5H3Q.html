technobuffalo here I don't review that
many accessories the ones I do or things
that I find especially interesting
intriguing and the zoo goose smart case
for the ipad is one such product so
enjoy the video so here is the back of
the case it's sort of a Swiss Army knife
type case does a lot of different things
let me go ahead and show you how it
works and open it up I will slide my
iPad on it there's a bit of a latch at
the bottom so the iPad slides in from
the top you can see it right there and
when you slide it and there's a bit of
resistance so you know that it's going
to be in there nice and securely some of
those cases where you're worried about
the device falling out and the buttons
around the back so go ahead and give it
a button and now we are nice and secure
so uncertain the first blush looks like
a standard ipad case it adds a decent
amount of bulk to it there is a lot of
protection sort of a thick layer of
cardboard inside suede goes over the
screen and leather on the outside and
the back to sort of get that same term
hard plastic protection so sort of
holding it it looks very strange you got
velcro strips on in front of it you've
got these weird flaps on the back with
the strap it's very odd to think about
what this thing isn't what it does let
me go ahead and show you first it sort
of forms some familiar functions that
we've seen on many other I pad cases so
this part right here actually lifts up
and you can set this anywhere you want
to have the stand so go ahead and to put
it right there all right there that's
sort of the widest velcro is therefore
so you can move it and adjust it so you
can stand this up really in a variety of
ways in a variety of viewing angles to
find the ones best for you from all the
way as far down to here and as far up as
almost completely vertical certainly a
nice feature to have and there are a lot
of other cases do something similar this
one actually lets you adjust it sort of
one of the other interesting features
here is a strap what this is meant for
is either to go over a car headrest or
even if you know the person sitting in
front of the back of an airplane seat so
you can have your
ipad almost like an ink Carter tainment
system have it just looking right at you
which is kind of neat it doesn't really
affect the performance of device things
always work very well it's still smooth
give access all your buttons on the top
the case does add a bit of bulk so when
I use this case on an everyday basis as
my general ipad case I probably would
not but this would definitely be the
case i would take with me while
traveling in fact that had take it was a
while traveling being able to prop it up
with different angles it's fantastic for
the table on airplane being able to sort
of put it over the top of his chair for
a long ride makes it a really a nice in
car entertainment system as a lot of
versatility zooboo did send us over for
review is a fifty dollar price point
i'll put a link down below keeps me
wanted to pick one up overall it's a
very useful case I don't think I've to
use it every day like I said but for
traveling it actually is sort of the
perfect choice and I guys hope you
enjoyed i'm jon rettinger technobuffalo
I'll see in the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
