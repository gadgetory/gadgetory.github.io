technobuffalo in this video I want to
talk about the second major feature of
technobuffalo which is the sub blocks
I'm going to talk about in detail about
how you get one and what you can do with
it most importantly so before I talk
about the sub blogs I want to give a
little bit of history of why we came
across this idea when John and I were
thinking about TechnoBuffalo many many
months ago we wanted to create this
immersive tech environment where people
could come to really experience
technology in a very holistic way and
one of those ways that we thought that
people could experience technology is if
they're writing about technology if
they're making videos about technology
and there's already a lot of people out
there that have their own youtube
channel or they have their own tech blog
but they perhaps want to have it on a
bigger level they want to have more
exposure to their tecbug and perhaps
learn more about what it takes to write
compelling tech articles and what it
takes to make a really compelling tech
video and so John and I decided to give
people the tools to build and monetize
their own tech blog right on
technobuffalo okay so let me take you
through this whole thing when
TechnoBuffalo launches there's going to
be a sidebar item that will allow you to
create a username and password and a sub
blog offer free and anyone can do it you
don't have to apply you just click the
button and you do it you create a
username and password which will work on
the main part of the site when you
comment on the sub log's when you login
and on the social network when you
interact with other people so one login
for the entire site so you don't have to
log in multiple times you log in one
time and you're done now we ask you to
make a name for your sub blog so if
you're thinking about making a blog
about iphone tips and tricks you could
do technobuffalo com / iphone tips and
tricks or if you're interested in
Windows 7 and you want to write a blog
about windows 7 and all this
capabilities it could be technobuffalo
com / windows 7 it's really up to you
and we give you that that option to
decide what you want to call your sub
blog now we give everybody a hundred
megabytes of space that you can use to
create your block we're using WordPress
on all of the sub blocks and for those
of you that don't know WordPress it's a
very very easy to use content management
system if you're unfamiliar we're going
to have training
that's going to go through how to
exactly use the word press system so for
the sub blogs we had four focuses in
mind we wanted to give people the
ability to customize monetize analyze
and get exposure and I know most of
those rhyme but that's not on purpose I
promise so let's start with the first
one customized we give you the ability
to customize your blog in a lot of ways
you can change the logo at the top of
the page so if you want to whip up a
logo in Photoshop that says you know
Bob's iphone tips and tricks blog you
can do that and put your logo at the top
of the page we also give you the ability
to customize the sidebar so we have a
bunch of pre-configured widgets you can
add them and move them around you can
add text to the widgets and change them
and we also have the ability to turn on
and off a flash-based feature rotator at
the top of the page so if you want to
have your recent most post kind of go
through a nice slideshow animation you
can have that turned on now number two
is we want to give you the ability to
monetize to make money from your tech
blog you're doing the work you should be
rewarded for your efforts so at the top
under your logo there's a space that you
can put your own adsense code in google
adsense or any other supported ad format
or you can have a static ad banner and
this is in a very prominent location
very close to the top of the page so it
should get a lot of exposure if you have
a sponsor for your tech blog maybe
someone sponsored you or maybe you're
just trying to promote your own YouTube
channel you can use this space however
you want to do it really number three we
want to give you the ability to analyze
the traffic that comes in to your tech
blog and we're and you can use google
analytics to do that Google Analytics is
free and its really really powerful what
it lets you do it let you see where
traffic is coming from what people are
doing on your site how long they're
staying what countries they're coming
from what browser they're using pretty
much everything about your users you'll
get to learn about your audience one of
the biggest aspects of running a tech
blog is learning about your audience
learning about how they interact with
your site so we want to give people the
ability to really analyze the traffic
that they're getting on their on their
sub blog and number four we want to give
people the ability to have more exposure
than they would if they were
just starting a tech blog at any other
place so we are featuring new posts that
are made to the sub blogs on the main
TechnoBuffalo com homepage so you go to
the home page and you'll see a side bar
item that says you know Bob just wrote
an article on the five best iPhone games
and you can click on it you're taken
right to the article on Bob's blog you
get some exposure that way and although
it's a little too early to talk about
we're working on ways to incentivize the
people that really do an awesome job
with their tech blog those that drive
the most traffic that that manage it the
best that have the best content we'll
talk about that more about that in the
coming months and one more thing
everybody that has a sub blog on
TechnoBuffalo will get exclusive access
to an archive of videos and PDFs that
are created by John and I that go over
things that we've learned over the years
on how to run a successful tech blog or
how to be good in front of a camera or
how to reach out to companies and try to
get items for review so that you can
bring it back to your tech blog and
review it there so we're really excited
about this feature of TechnoBuffalo in
its ability to give you a voice and to
really allow you to immerse yourself in
technology by writing about it by
creating videos about it and giving you
the tools to customize your own sub blog
monetize it analyze it and get exposure
from the traffic that comes to the main
site at TechnoBuffalo so that's it on
the sub bogs and we're really looking
forward to telling you even more in the
future about this and that's it for now
