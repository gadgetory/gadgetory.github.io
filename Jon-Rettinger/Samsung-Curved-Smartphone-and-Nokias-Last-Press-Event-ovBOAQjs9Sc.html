to you by Full Sail University hey
everybody and welcome back to another
episode of rumor roundup the show where
we get you up to speed on all the wacky
exciting and generally awesome tech
rumors that happen every single day on
the internet this week nokia might have
six devices to announce in less than a
month nest might be making a smoke
detector specs for a possible HTC one
successor and the first curved
smartphone may come from Samsung Jon's
busy taking care of his brand-new son
with his lovely wife right now so I'm on
the rumor watch this week this is rumor
roundup let's get started
it looks like nokia might go out with a
bang their final press event before they
officially get swallowed up by Microsoft
is on October 22nd and sources are
saying it's gonna be a doozy not one not
two but six devices are reportedly on
the docket for announcement six plus a
slew of new accessories for the Lumia
line so what devices might we see well
there's a six inch Lumia phablet and a
Lumia Windows RT tablet that look like
they're gonna be announced but beyond
that we're not really sure
probably an Asha device or two but the
real question is that Nokia handset that
runs Android can you imagine that being
Nokia's last hurrah before moving under
the Microsoft umbrella that would be
what I call a mic drop well the company
nests pretty much redefined the boring
thermostat for homeowners and now it
looks like they're gonna attempt to do
that again only this time with smoke
detectors yeah sources familiar with
nest plans say they're planning to
launch a smoke and carbon monoxide
detector with connectivity in mind it's
also rumored to have a subscription
service attached that will alert your
smartphone if smoke or fire is detected
in your house you can keep an eye on
your home even if you're not there a
subscription model is a really great way
for nest to bring in a steady revenue
stream and they've already shown they
can make a seemingly boring device for
the home really cool and high-tech with
the nest thermostat so this smoke
detector could be just as successful I
mean how many of us ever thought about
our thermostat before nest came along
not me so I hope they keep expanding and
if they do keep expanding I would
personally love to see a home security
system from them so the HTC one is
probably my favorite Android device of
2013 and if these rumors about its
follow up or true it's gonna be a beast
Greek website tech community gr reported
that the one is getting some hefty
upgrades specifically an octa-core chip
and three gigs of RAM it looks like the
screen size will stay the same as the
current HTC One and will almost
definitely see a camera upgrade but
overall even with those most basic of
specs it's a pretty exciting prospect of
course the only thing we have to go on
is a screenshot from the rumored device
so it's a kind of a
a rumor but I'm already wondering if
it'll have a huge battery like the
butterfly s which was amazing and what
HTC will name it the HTC - the HTC one
squared
HTC zero where does HTC go from here and
lastly Samsung in the rumor mill this
week with a really interesting story
according to reports at a node 3 launch
event in Seoul South Korea
Samsung Mobile's head of strategic
marketing said they plan to introduce a
smartphone with a curved display surely
this is futuristic tech nope it's this
October in Korea that's a whopper of a
rumor right there now we don't know if
curved also means flexible but I'm going
out on a limb and guessing Samsung will
want to crawl before they walk and
introduced similar tech to their curved
OLED TVs that we've seen at every
tradeshow this year so it won't be a
bendy phone sorry guys I'm actually
really curious about your opinion on
this one is a curved screen like a bonus
for you because I don't know about it
it's one thing to have a curved eighty
to a hundred inch television in your
living room because it's really
immersive and it wraps you and your TV
but a five inch screen and your pocket
or your hand I'm not sure I guess that's
up to the user all I know is I'm looking
forward to October anyway because I just
really want to see that because that's
something new and exciting and I love
new and exciting tech got to interrupt
this episode with a quick little shout
out to Full Sail University obviously
apps are huge right now they are
everywhere and we've all had those ideas
that make you say oh my god that should
totally be an app right well Full Sail
University's online mobile development
bachelor's degree program can teach you
how to make an app from concept to post
launch marketing well even better you do
the entire program for the comfort of
your own home via full sales online
education platform well with full sales
mobile dev program you learn both sides
of app development for iOS and Android
creating your app with advanced
programming languages and then launching
and managing the business of your app
once it's complete but Ashley you say I
don't have a good enough computer to run
lines of advanced code and I can't
afford all that expensive software
that's ok because with full sales
project launch box program students get
a MacBook Pro preloaded with industry
software plus iOS and Android devices
you're all ready to go now if you're
ready to make that killer app and you're
interested in learning more about full
sales
in degree program just head over to Full
Sail dot edu slash TechnoBuffalo
