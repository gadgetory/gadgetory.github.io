it from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
video we'll be sharing with you 10 tips
and tricks for you new shiny Apple watch
now these are just some tips and tricks
but if you guys want a full tour of the
UI you can check out John's video which
we will leave a link down below our
Apple watch review is also up on our
channel so if you guys haven't had a
chance to watch it yet make sure to
check that out as well so number one is
how to take a screenshot on your Apple
watch let's say you want to show off to
your friends that you walked over 10,000
steps today you can take a screenshot on
your Apple watch by quickly pressing
both the side button and the digital
crown you'll then see that screenshot on
your photos app on your iPhone number 2
is how to hard reset your Apple watch no
device is ever perfect and if for
example your Apple watch freezes you can
hard to reset your watch by holding down
both the side button in digital crown
for at least 10 seconds until you see
the Apple logo number 3 is how to force
close an app let's say an app is lagging
or isn't properly working you can force
close an app to restart it now to do
this press and hold down the side button
until the power-down sliders appear and
release the button press and hold the
side button again until the app
disappears and you're back to the home
screen launching the app again will
start fresh and that's how you force
closed an app number 4 is how to quickly
delete apps on your Apple watch now I
personally have a pretty messy home
screen I actually need to organize my
setup but in the Apple watch you can't
really put an app in a folder and
organize them instead you can delete
them by holding on an icon and pressing
the X button it'll ask you if you want
to delete the app and after that the app
is gone on your Apple watch
however it's not gone forever you can
always bring it back if you want through
the Apple watch app on your iPhone
number 5 is how to move apps around on
your home screen so just like any other
iOS device you can move the icons around
by tapping and holding on an icon and
moving them it's super simple and works
really well on this tiny screen you can
also use your iPhone to rearrange your
apps by going into the Apple watch app
and going into a play out and here is
where you can move your apps around
number 6 is clearing all of your
notifications so when you swipe down on
your Apple watch you can see all the
notifications you have received and
instead of swiping each notification
away individually you can actually use
force such to dismiss all the
notifications would just
one tab just press and hold down the
notification on the screen and a new
action will pop up asking if you want to
clear all notifications number seven is
to set a default city for your weather
the weather app on the Apple watch can
check a variety of cities and your
current location but if you want a quick
weather look up in glances and on your
watch face you'll want to pick a
specific city head on over to the Apple
watch app on your iPhone then go to
weather default city and here's where
you can choose which city you want to
set as your default if you want to add a
city or remove a city you can do so by
going to the weather app on your iPhone
number eight is pinging your iPhone if
you can't find your phone around the
house and you swore you had it in your
hands a minute ago you can quickly ping
your iPhone using your Apple watch by
swiping up to your glances and tapping
on the ping iPhone button brand said you
do however have to be in proximity of
your phone and once you press the button
you'll hear the iPhone ringing and
you're all set number nine is zoom mode
on the Apple watch if you find it hard
to swipe around the small tiny icons on
the Apple watch or just can't see all
together you can actually turn on
accessibility to zoom on your watch to
activate this feature launch the Apple
watch app on your iPhone then go to
general accessibility accessibility
shortcut from here you can choose the
zoom feature when you triple click on
the digital crown number 10 is to adjust
the intensity of the haptic feedback
when you receive certain notifications
the Apple watch will tap your wrist
using its taptic engine and if you find
you have t'k feedback to be a little too
much or a little too soft you can adjust
intensity of to have to feedback and you
can do this either on your Apple watch
or on your iPhone so to change it on
your Apple watch
go to settings sound and haptics then
scroll down and adjust a ringer and
alert haptic slider to change it on an
iPhone open the Apple watch app go to
sounds and haptics and just a haptic
strength slider to your preferred level
now as an added bonus we thought we'd
also show how to quickly customize your
default replies when replying to a
message if we head on over to the Apple
watch app and go to messages default
replies here you can add your custom
replies to anything you'd like also when
sending an animated emoji through the
watch if you force touch the emoji the
emoji will turn from yellow to
read instantly and that's about it if
you have any other tips you'd like to
share with us that we didn't cover leave
them in the comment section down below

will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
