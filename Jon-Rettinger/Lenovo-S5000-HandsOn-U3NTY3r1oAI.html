I'm here at the Lenovo booth at Aoife in
Berlin checking out the s 5000 this is
the new seven-inch tablet they're coming
out with quite nice good it's got really
really thin it's got an aluminum chassis
although I would imagine this chrome
sort of picks up fingerprints pretty
quickly this is laser etched plastic it
actually looks a little bit like brushed
aluminum but it's actually a plastic I
want to show you guys something really
interesting about what they've done with
the lenovo launcher this is the 16 gig
Wi-Fi model they're gonna have different
models in different areas of the world
so you're gonna have Wi-Fi and 3G
available depending on where you live
this is gonna come out in November but
let's look at the launcher because it's
really interesting you'll notice there's
no place for an app drawer here there's
no snow after-hour button where would I
find it
we got settings come quick quick options
our menu multitasking home button back
button but no after well that's because
they don't have one there's no app
drawer in this thing they just want you
to put your apps right on the screen and
lenovo says that the reason they did
that is to optimize the quad-core
processor in the outdoors actually can
be a little bit bloated it can be a
little bit bulky so they've decided to
go ahead and issue that for just a
standard homescreen you just add as many
home screens as you want make your
carousel put your apps in there use
folders and go really interesting thing
that lenovo is doing with the s5000 and
the price is pretty good too it's 199
euro and this will be out in in november
and 249 euro for the 3G model so
definitely a competitor to a device like
the Nexus 7 and you can see obviously
they've made all the icons rounded this
is a very specific specifically designed
UI and any user experience we're gonna
be bringing you all kinds of show
content tablets phones convertible
laptops all the things be sure to leave
