lakers calm here with an unboxing for
you of the arc mouse by Microsoft I've
been doing a lot of spreadsheet work on
the macbook and we're dealing with
confined spaces like the cells found in
Excel the trackpad can be very
frustrating to use as far as
right-clicking and such so I picked up
an external mouse and this mouse is very
cool because it's actually a full-size
mouse but folds down to be a little bit
more portable suppose all mice are
portable and pocketable this one just a
little bit more so let me go ahead and
show you guys what it is here's the box
art mounts by Microsoft Microsoft does
make some very nice Hardware actually so
it's good for PC or Mac says right there
and it's USB with a little bit of a
dongle there's the mouse right there and
a picture of it on the side there's a
mouse on the back to some pictures and
specs showing you the little dongle and
there is the mac logo let me know it'll
work with mac and of course for pc and
picture of the mouse on the side and
there is on the front kind of soft
plastic but the mouse is very nicely
displayed go ahead and open this sucker
up take out the trusty knife and we will
and break the seals so to speak they're
here all right put that off to the side
slide off the top
and there is a device sitting right
there so then pull that out pull
packaging slides out right out of that
clear plastic so here is the mouse
itself like it's under some more plastic
if you can get to that maybe from
underneath open up the sides of the box
and let's see what we got some
instructions never going to look at that
I a carrying case it's a nice kind of
fake leather feel with to triple-a
batteries energizer batteries so least
there's quality nothing else in there
some warranty information blah blah blah
I'm never going to look at any of that
okay let's take a look at the mouse
itself get it out of plastic alright so
here is here is the arc mouse and from
this angle looks like any other mouse
like that one for example but the cool
thing about it is actually if you turn
over on the side it's got that really
kind of neat arc to it makes it very
comfortable to put your hands on and use
very ergonomic and it also folds
completely in for easier traveling you
can also use it like this if you want
just a small amount so that's what you
prefer so let's take a look at the
device a little bit more what you'll see
right there's actually the USB dongle
tucked in under some tape let's pull
that tape off it's pretty small and I
think it just secures in just like that
via magnet so that's pretty neat and the
batteries go in right there and there's
an indicator on the top right there
that'll tell you how much battery life
you have and let me know it's connected
to battery power it's got a left click
or right click a scroll wheel it does
not go left or right it does have a
button on the side and you can push in
on the scroll wheel so it's got
technically four buttons feels really
nice looking for
are using it should be a nice addition
to the macbook something that I
certainly need so this is it anyway jon
