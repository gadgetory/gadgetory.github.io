good from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll
be taking a quick look at the Windows
Phone 8.1 Update 1 on the Nokia Lumia
1020 and see what it's all about
probably the biggest addition to the
update is inclusion of folders yes
Windows Phone finally cut up to Android
and iOS it's a simple feature but adds a
lot of depth to a user's home screen the
great thing is that live tiles are still
enabled meaning you can see your live
tiles moving and updating when they're
inside a folder you can move your tiles
into little groups within the folder
themselves or actually separate them out
so they're easier to tap on and launched
Microsoft also added some minor updates
to Cortana including the new natural
language capability though that's a bit
tough to test out but the new do and
impression request prompts Ratana to run
through a few lines voiced by actress
Jen Taylor do an impression do an
impression and then last one do an
impression
Crotona has also been adopted for UK in
China
unfortunately Cortana doesn't speak with
an English action just yet which is a
bummer
I guess she wouldn't be the same Crotona
we all know and love if she did other
changes include an updated and faster
Xbox music app which also brings back
the ability to sync music in the
background and also swipe to advanced
feature update also brought new features
to the messages app allowing you to
forward a message and delete messages in
bulk and last but not least there's now
VPN support for those trying to access a
protected company website while on a go
unfortunately we don't use VPN all that
often so we can't really show it to you
guys in video but there you guys have it
a quick overview of the Windows Phone
8.1 Update 1 and a Nokia Lumia 1020 it's
rolling out now to developers so make
sure you guys update when you get a
chance if you guys have any questions
