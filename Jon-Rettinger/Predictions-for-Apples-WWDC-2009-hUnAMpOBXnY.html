predictions for you for Apple's
Worldwide Developer Conference also
called WWDC coming up in june of this
year Apple usually holds two big
conferences he here macworld which they
said they don't want to go in to attend
and this new worldwide developers
conference so naturally people are
expecting big things so probably the
list of things that I think we
definitely see happen something we might
see happen and some that are really
unlikely to happen but possible so let's
start off with these likely the first
thing that I think we're definitely
going to see is iphone three-point oh
not 3g not only talking about OS three
point out i'm talking about an entirely
new iphone version 3.0 got a feeling
they're gonna call it iphone pro i have
no substantial evidence for that it just
sounds like something they might do
features i expect that we'll see on this
new iphone a front facing camera for
ichat but no secret that AT&amp;amp;T has been
up in their network for faster download
and upload speeds I think that's
anticipation of the expected traffic
they're going to be getting with this
new video of track new video chatting
certainly if there was just a new iphone
with 3g capabilities the upgrade pod
wouldn't be necessary certainly nice but
it would not be a requirement i think
apple is pushing a teensy to do the
upgrades that could accommodate these
new features next thing I think we're
going to see is certainly increased
storage Apple ordered millions and
millions and millions of eight gigabyte
flash cards for the iphone looks little
flash drives rather and you think it's
not enough what Apple actually does they
stack up my tie to get your 16 gigabyte
iphone I'd expected we're going to see a
16 gigabyte entry model and a 32
gigabyte premium model to be really
similar to what Apple did when they
release the iphone 3g with the 816
configurations i also think this is
going to be the first time we're going
to see a complete redesign of the iphone
certainly there's not that much apple
can do some things that i think we'll
see in terms of a design i think we'll
probably go back to a permanent Luminum
look punk a plasticky plastic aluminum
that makes sense sort of a metal paint
on plastic i think as well we'll see
appleton that in the past on the product
actually comes across looking very very
nice I think we'll see full 802 11 and
wireless which means much faster
transfer speeds I think we'll see more
features that will be up in the iphone
as well I think we're good they're going
to talk a lot more about OS 3.0 and some
of the things that may be a bit hidden
from developers this far I think we're
going to see internet tethering be
announced certainly it's been no secret
that that's been in OS three point out
just a little bit hidden out away we're
going to have video recording that laws
and announced that either certainly mms
the vertical keyboard cut copy and
pasting that Apple talked about in their
released OS through point O we talked
about as well so some other things I
think we'll see on new iphone I think
there's a chance a slight slight chance
we may actually see a physical keyboard
on this version of the iphone it's I've
heard from a friend of a friend who
knows a guy inside of Apple that there
is a prototype version of and iphone
with a full qwerty keyboard sliding out
to the side similar to the samsung
impression that's been floating around
the Cupertino campus well that's just a
prototype or not I certainly can't speak
to I would love a full textile keyboard
physical buttons however having use OS
three points a that using the keyboard
in landscape is fantastic actually I
make much much much fewer errors having
it like that so there isn't a physical
keyboard I certainly won't be
disappointed I also think that the phone
will be just a little bit thinner as
well and could probably just stick as
the flash modules will allow next thing
I think Apple is going to spend a lot of
time talking about is their newest
operating system snow upper it's been a
little while since Apple released
leopard and I think that some leopard is
probably primed for at least candidate
or at least we'll be in June they're
probably announced one is going to come
out look people are expecting a
september-october release but until now
instead of release candidate is going to
be more widely available to developers
don't expect anything drastic with snow
leopards not gonna have any new cool
features are introduced like OS 10
leopard was you know when they
introduced time machine stacks and ton
of other cool stuff this step is mostly
going to be under the hood so you're
going to have a lot of increased speed a
smaller footprint of the operating
system and full compatibility with that
some 64-bit applications and such so I
think that some lepers going to be a big
focus I'm sure we'll talk about some
other new feature don't expect to be
wowed just expect increased ability all
i gotta say up and thrilled with leopard
it's been incredibly stable for me so
those are my definite things i think
we're going to see we may see some spec
bumps in the imac macbook a possibly mac
pro line as well i would definitely say
that that would be something that we're
going to probably see as well so some of
the possible things I think we might see
I think we might see an updated imac
design it's been a while since Apple
released the aluminum imac the one that
I you know a lot of you guys sees as
well so i would say that a redesign is
certainly not out of the possibility it
expects something maybe similar to what
the current apple cinema displays look
like the apple lose the chin go with an
all black bezel around it would probably
be what I would anticipate coming again
nothing revolutionary more of an
evolutionary design change we may also
see an updated map prodesign the apple
just updated the specs but it's been
quite a while since that design saw an
overhaul it's very little what you can
do with a tower desktop computer however
I think that app will probably
streamline a little bit possibly add a
few more days they make it look a little
bit nicer a little more modern to entice
some of the pro buyers to look at the
mac pro so some of the things i wish or
probably doubtful but there is a little
monica match ants they might come out
first since been talked about quite a
bit is a netbook apple supposedly
ordered 10 inch touch panels while back
millions of them people were
anticipating we're going to be for a
touchscreen netbook now when Apple does
something as opposed to some other
companies they spend a lot of time on
the design crafting and the materials
usually there's a price premium that you
pay for that now when you're dealing
with a computer that price points
competition is around three or four
hundred dollars it's a very susceptible
to an increase in price so if you're
going to
netbook with all those fancy components
the touch panel you're not gonna be able
to hit that three or four hundred price
markridge Apple has gone on the record
saying so for those reasons I think a
netbook is probably doubtful but those
panels maybe for you know i i'm just
going to speculate i don't know but i
think in that book is probably not an
apples market simply because it can get
the price down low enough for it would
be acceptable you've got the macbook air
at 1799 figure over these a netbook at a
six hundred other price point for a few
hundred dollars more you can get a full
fledged i'm at our macbook so i'm not
sure that this really is a niche for
that being said i would love an apple
netbook they could find a way to make
one affordable and a touch screen would
be absolutely fantastic and who knows
maybe even snow leopard allows them
touchscreen capabilities in it so one
thing that I think these touch panels
might be used for and this is again
speculation is an e-book reader an
e-book reader to me just makes logical
business sense it certainly fits in at
the iTunes business model they have a
great way to distribute the content
itunes and they distribute that over the
air via an 802 11 n trip built into this
possible ebook reader they could be
fantastic the Kindles made a lot of
noise showing that the market for ebook
readers is alive maturing and certainly
growing you know in the life cycle of
product it's definitely on its way up I
think Apple wants to capitalize on that
piece I would anticipate there's been
reports of trucks and load and
truckloads of people dropping off books
at Apple's campus now Apple may just be
refreshing their library or they may
also be digitizing their own content
which is actually a very interesting way
for Apple to get the contact to you they
don't have to go through amazon or
barnes and noble twice and set they can
actually license their own digital
content right to their possible new
e-book reader set would make sense that
we falls into apple's business model and
distribution model i think gets the
possibility although if it is going to
come i wouldn't expect it at WWDC maybe
a special announcement a little later on
in the year so guys it's just my son my
predictions for the Worldwide Developer
Conference I've been relatively accurate
in the past with some of my sure things
but some of my outlandish ones you know
you never know
everything with a grain of salt anyway
guys hope you enjoyed for exclusive
content sure to follow me on twitter
twitter com / john for lakers i will see
you in the next video I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
