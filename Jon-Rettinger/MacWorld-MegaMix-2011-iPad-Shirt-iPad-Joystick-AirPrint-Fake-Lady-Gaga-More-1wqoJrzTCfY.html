him here at macworld 2011 at my press
badge I got my coffee let's go alright
so here we are the show is you know not
as big as it was when Apple is the
anchor they moved it over to the smaller
Moscow nihal but it's actually I think
it's a good call because it feels kind
of you know cozy and full as opposed to
last year when I felt a little empty in
the larger hall so we're going to walk
around see what there is to see taking a
photo let's say I picked this orangatang
here per second hero actually
combination orangutang elephant I Slough
right so we're viewing that and you see
now i get i go to my action button here
in the upper right and there are several
things that i could do an email photo i
can use this as wallpaper and now we see
a print and then I'd be able to print so
drop that easy can't get even
we have our hub k system with an
integrated hubs value system what this
hub does it allows you to attach our
various accessories such as the easel
the easel slides in place here now you
can watch your work play out your iPad
in a fortune or landscape mode and it's
just like that from here you can take it
from essentially a tabletop
you can attach to a wall
same thing clips in place you can rotate
it would travel along you attach it
that's our auto mount use that for our
backseat passengers
industry product launch they've made x1
built-in ipad
so if i run into somebody on the street
who's got their head down reading their
ipad I have you to blame right yes so
ours is primarily a learning your hood
because the way that people use it you
ethnic the cases
so although I guess I'm actually having
a great time here at macworld you know I
wasn't sure what to expect last year the
show was kind of small really heavy on
apps and iphone cases which iphone cases
are cool but really how many can you see
let alone report on in a day but today
you know in the smaller venue which is a
little cozier a little more busy because
it's a smaller space which packed people
are buzzing around it's fun and a lot of
interesting stuff some really cool ipad
apps let them need accessories and you
know just interesting design language
that kind of thing which you know what
makes for a good day out of the office
right format world 2011 in san francisco
i'm noah for TechnoBuffalo much much
more on the site on the youtube channel
on twitter you know all those places i'm
going to go up I'll sit down with one of
these crazy iPad guests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
