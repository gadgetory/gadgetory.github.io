technobuffalo here and i want to talk to
you about some of the iphone OS 4.0
rumors that's one of the big things
Apple is supposed to focus on in there
January 27th keynote certainly what they
may discuss it's all rumor and
speculation but there's needs to be a
lot of attention on iphone OS four point
oh boy genius report today which is the
19th of January had some screenshots of
OS four point oh and went through some
of the things that they're tipster said
it was going to have so I'm gonna run
through those and give you sort of my
own take on where I think we can expect
from iphone OS four point oh and let me
just clarify i'm talking about just the
operating system i'm not talking about
new iphone hardware or a new iphone
which will probably see in the june or
july so the first thing that boy Jesus
reported on was that iphone OS four
point oh features our way to multitask
finally fools do that have been using
Android Windows Mobile even or palm pre
even multitasking to your heart's desire
for quite some time now us iphone users
that have not jailbroken have been using
just one app at a time and it's painful
so it's like OS four point oh is going
to really rectify that not sure how
they're going to have a multitasking
certainly some sort of expose feature
would be quite nice palms deck of cards
i think is probably the best
implementation of multitasking really
really nothing has been said about how
Apple is going to handle it how it's
going to handle predictions running in
the background certainly it's going to
be a big drain on battery or a bigger
drain on battery but should be up to the
consumer with how they want to handle
their battery maintenance I don't handle
their phone usage you know that if you
have a lot of applications running on
your phone your battery's going to die
quicker if you want to save battery life
then don't have things running but it
should be up to you and up until this
point Apple really hasn't given the
consumers the choice would be nice to
have a little bit of power back in the
hands of the user I think it would make
sense settled sort of bug I mentioned
earlier next pose a feature where you
push a button or a hotkey and opens up
sort of a view of auto for applications
where you can close open or select them
and go to where you'd like so the next
thing that boy genius
John was that OS four point oh features
multi-touch across all the applications
multi-touch is really sort of limited to
some few key applications so we're
talking photos web and if you select
other ones so I'd assume that we're
talking multi-touch as far as stocks
application goes as far as using the
extra OOS itself so when you're on the
iPhones home screen perhaps you'd be
able to use multi-touch to sort of zoom
in on a particular screen or pain and
sort of see where you want to go a
having multi-touch actually throughout
the OS can add a lot more usability and
certainly can increase the range of
space for just what you see on the phone
it's a really infinite number that you
can span or scroll around you think that
may be the biggest surprise that we see
of OS four point out is how Apple
Institute's multi-touch throughout the
entire device the next thing I know you
guys are all wondering is this going to
be available for your iphone 3g 3gs or
OG iphone and the answer is yes and no
the rumors have it that it's going to be
available for iphone 3g and iphone 3gs
users only I've original iPhone owners
you're out of luck I would assume that
the rollout will be very similar to how
OS three point no was it be available to
developers first you have a few beta
versions of it and then it'll finally be
released to the public probably it would
be a free upgrade to the iphone 3gs and
on tiles are going to charge 10 bucks
what it was for a web spawn what they're
going to charge you for the 3g if you're
an iPod Touch owner probably the same
thing if you're using a new generation
probably going to charge if you've got
the last generation probably going to
charge as well ipod touch users tend to
always get the short end of the stick
when it comes to apple updates so
definitely something to keep in mind
another thing that's the boy genius
mentions that there's going to be some
sort of new syncing mechanism way to
sync contacts and calendar with your
computer may be really specifying what
that was but it lead you to believe that
it's going to be some sort of wireless
syncing practice or a cloud syncing
it'll sync wirelessly up to mobileme and
mobileme up shoe to back down with your
computer or maybe i'll be something
something new who knows but a way to
sync all of your contacts and videos and
pictures
over Wi-Fi will be quite nice imagine
just walking in the door of your house
have your phone on Matthew recognize
it's on your home network and sync up on
the computer that you have going to do
anything creating backups certainly be a
little bit astray on your network but
would be a really nice feature I think
to have simply something to keep in mind
and the left good information looking
off to the side here are some notes um
also going to be well we'll leave that
one until the end so let's talk about
some of the things that I think OS four
point oh is going to have and maybe not
have google maps is featured very
heavily in the iphone certainly the maps
one of the big things at apple tad when
they first launched the device and now
with the iphone 3g IV gps and 3gs for
the continuing that tradition maps are a
real big important part of the iphone
but if your company like google it's
providing the map software what's your
incentive for giving apple the ability
to use that you know Apple is now a
competitor of Google as far as the
android vs iphone OS i'm not sure what
Google is gaining by having the
applications on the iphone certainly
they're gaining market share but didn't
seem like Google's kind of company that
really needs market share that much
there's not much revenue i don't think
that driven from it unless there's sort
of a revenue share that Apple has with
Google but I wouldn't be surprised to
see a new maps application in iphone OS
four point oh seems like Apple maybe we
wouldn't want to rely on Google for
their maps and there's been even talks
of saying Apple bringing their own
mapping software and it would make sense
from a business standpoint to see Apple
sort of take off their their own and
shed at Google and really be able to
control the mapping software that would
probably see a turn by turn navigation
option if that comes to fruition and
certainly none of the Google things that
you're used to Google is still the
default search engine and the iphone
browser Mobile Safari I don't think
we're going to see a Bing search engine
in anytime soon or yahoo which uses bing
and certain they were not going to see a
go Jeeves be your default search engine
on the iphone this serves in speculation
that that I was thinking of so really
that's sort of what we're expecting to
see from iphone OS 4.0 the last thing
that maybe boy genius touches on that I
alluded to a bit
earlier was started this the specter of
something brandy that's not expected
those few things I ran through our
what's expected and sort of gradual
updates that you would anticipate the
evolution of a device these updates that
are coming supposedly are going to make
the iphone more of a mobile computer and
the tablet that's allegedly coming as
well as honorable allegedly and
speculations coming it's going to be
running a similar operating system so
the fact that we're going to have almost
a computer device on the iphone is quite
impressive the iphone 3gs runs a 600
megahertz processor certainly not a
snapdragon but it's definitely fast
enough for doing day-to-day applications
concern the capable of doing a lot more
than Apple currently allows it to do so
imagine having your iPhone suddenly be
able a to be a mobile computing portal
so not just running apps about even some
sort of multitasking be able to access
your actual computer you know built-in
screen sharing built in ScreenFlow you
never know what Apple might do being
able to have more computer functionality
right in the palm of your hand is
certainly exciting proposition this is
more of just a fun video to run through
what I think we might have might see
certainly just complete speculation I
always love this time of year when the
apple keynote you're coming up whether
you love apple or hate apple it's pretty
safe to say that they drive the industry
forward whether you have no interest in
a tablet at all to be very clear that
this tablet device is going to drive the
industry it's how what computers are
going to change once it's one is
released so again if you hate apple and
you're a big pc fan you're going to
benefit from these announcements like
apple did with the ipod previously and
with the iphone and yet same thing is
going to hold true with the tablet so
it's kind of fun just to speculate and
see and share thoughts with you guys so
i'm curious what you guys have to say
you don't leave text or video comments
and on a personal note I don't really
generally ever do this but there's a
thing going on right now called the
shorty awards where you can nominate
your favorite people at a ton of
categories that make short video content
I happen to make short video content in
the tech category so I love if you guys
would throw me your support and you go
to shorty awards calm and hit the slick
box and drag down to tech and put in
john for lakers which is my twitter name
and that's how you vote
it's pretty easy you can vote for more
than one person the great
soldierknowsbest is number one not be
happy just to get into the top five so
i'll put a link to that in sidebar if
you want to you know throw your support
i would certainly appreciate it anyway
guys jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo
with my rundown and probably rambling
crazy theories on OS four point oh hope
you enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
