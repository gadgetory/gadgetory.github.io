TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
forest PS 5 thought I wouldn't be able
to say and say that for another 10 years
or so speaker from forest this is my
third DTS play-fi speaker that I've
unboxed I'm trying to get speaker setups
throughout my entire house of God a 16
month old at home and I want to play
music in his room at night when he wakes
up so I don't have to go in there
speakers like this let me play music in
his room while also playing a different
song downstairs I don't listen to the
best of Disney in all of my speakers so
here is the for speaker gonna set you
back about 229 bucks but check the
retailer because prices are changing all
the time I'll walk you through all this
stuff here but it is cross OS compatible
so google play amazon kindle fire iOS or
Windows PC here it is for a speaker we
got some stuff on the back about DTS
play-fi but walk you through all that
and why I chose to go with DTS play-fi
speakers let's go ahead and open this
ma'am a jam up I will bring in my
unnecessary friend the large unboxing
knife and if you're thinking about
getting a speaker set up for your house
and you don't want to have to worry
about getting a sent receiver for
everything or your different speakers
anything that's got DTS play-fi Tech
will work so you can pick up speaker
from Polk and a speaker from forest and
any other brands that support it to make
it work it makes life really really easy
so I'll go ahead and slice that open
let's slide this sucker out
come out of there speaker there we go
and we are greeted with the information
on it Quick Start Guide for the gigantic
pictures ps5 speaker we're also gonna
have in this box hopefully have speakers
in here somewhere
ah found it there it is let's go ahead
and take this guy out here
all right so super fast and boxing all
right so why did I pick the force a
first it's got dual band Wi-Fi so I can
stream lossless audio and every room in
my house was what I was going for with
DTS play-fi can also send songs with
airplay or high quality bluetooth with
app text and AAC which is really nice
something you can do with you got a Mac
or PC you can use the best codecs that
either are going to support so I'm
trying to be an audio guy but if you are
a pure audiophile the PS 5 does support
high streaming resolution 24 bit 192
kilohertz flak audio files so pretty
high quality audio can come through this
without really having to use any wire
then to plug it in as I mentioned it's
pretty multi-platform the forest Android
app Kindle Fire app and iOS app which it
controls speaker obviously play music
from your own library or use things like
Pandora songs the BBC ESPN Radio Disney
which I will definitely be using you can
also use Sirius XM DS r QQ music or XA
connected DLNA music server which I
don't have yet set up but the idea of
doing it so I mentioned Wi-Fi let me
tell you a little bit more about that
it's multi room so you can play the same
song every room or different songs and
different rooms which is what I'm going
for here what I like about this is no
bridges needed speakers just connect
wirelessly via your home Wi-Fi network
which is a big deal for me it also keeps
costs down the audio fidelity is pretty
awesome play Phi is lossless
transmission so you get that high
quality audio that you'd expect and it's
open platform 2 so you know you have a
bulk speaker at home we'll have the
forest one here you got to pledge
allegiance to sort of any brand at all
as long as he has play fight technology
you are good to go so from a port
standpoint we of course have audio in
case you want to plug in whatever you
want USB in case you want to power
you've got micro USB and you've got
where your power cord is actually going
to plug into all right so we've got the
PS file which are kind of like saying
all set up set up is pretty easy as it
was really any of the play 5 devices I
just plugged it into the wall the Wi-Fi
light starts blinking I was able to go
into settings find that Wi-Fi network
this putting out connect to it did a few
updates and that was it
Veronica key a Bluetooth there's a
bluetooth button you just do that
directly to and all
of course there's audio in in case you
want to play music through the speaker
so in addition to all those wireless
technology it's also got a pretty sweet
dual-core DSP and Class D digital
amplifiers so it should sound awesome
from a teeny tiny little package alright
so as I mentioned reviewing speakers and
letting you hear what I hear is pretty
close to impossible because it's got to
come from here to my microphone and then
gets all compressed and comes out of
your speakers if you're using let's go
ahead and try this live and just take my
word for it how it's going to sound I'm
gonna stream music from my own library
but you've got access as I mentioned
just a ton of online streaming options
so in the past I've done these videos
I've lip synced my way to some Saved by
the Bell a little bit of frozen let's go
old school with their song let's play
some Kansas some wayward son' this is
actually for funny story what I sing to
my baby when I put him to bed at night
seems appropriate
all right so listen I know I cannot
dance but a tiny little speaker fills up
the room I was playing music from my
phone via play five DTS technology right
to it couldn't use bluetooth could have
plugged it in it worked pretty well for
229 bucks and get a speaker it's gonna
fill up the room speaker you can control
from your phone if you have other DTS
play-fi speakers you can play whatever
you want and then you room you on that a
bridge
it seems really nice and this is
hopefully please going to be able to lo
my baby to sleep with wayward son ever
elses have to play through it and I
