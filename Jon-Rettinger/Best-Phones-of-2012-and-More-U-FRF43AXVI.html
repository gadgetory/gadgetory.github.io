to you by the national campaign against
drunk driving welcome back to another
episode of ask the buffalo I'm your host
John wrenches the show you could ask me
any question you've got from the wide
ever-expanding world of technology you
can ask me personal questions tech
questions anything you want up this week
we're talk a little bit about
TechnoBuffalo some personal stuff and
we're going to talk about my favorite
phones of 2012 word this is ask the
buffalo gonna get started the 2012
brought what seemed like a new
smartphone or tablet every other day
we'd have a new version of a phone then
the max version and the HD version we've
had tablets would come out iPad and then
the max speed pad versions of them would
come out everything was coming fast and
furious 18 chalmers 3 ask John would
have been your favorite smartphones of
2012 certainly they were quite a few my
number one favorite these are no
particular order
is the Galaxy Note 2 I love the original
Galaxy Note and this one just upped its
game 5.5 inch screen it had a 720p
display and quad core processor blazing
fast Android 4.1 the iPhone 5 use again
no particular order would be up there as
well I love the build quality the larger
screen finally have LTE onboard and the
phone feels incredibly light I really
wanted to throw the Lumia 920 in there
or the HTC 8x but I had bolts with them
that didn't really make them the full
well around the package of other
smartphones if I was gonna throw one
more in there would be a tie between the
HTC One x+ or the galaxy s3 so put that
helped answer your question so the next
question is one that I've gotten quite a
bit over the past couple of months it
comes from Guerra Mott Oberoi what
happens to John Q's what's the apps
seriously missing them has he left
TechnoBuffalo no John Q has not left
TechnoBuffalo at all if anything he is
way more involved those that don't know
our new viewers John Kwok used to host a
show called what's the app suite feature
one of the best apple
occasions from this smartphone or tablet
world John said hey John are I like to
do some more work behind the scenes so I
stepped in now replaced what's the apps
with Rett endures rants junk watch
though does all the editing for the
division three videos he's the brain
behind the new redesigned TechnoBuffalo
3.0 if you see something that looks good
on the site chances are john Quach had
his hands on it or in it he does a ton
of stuff for us including editing all
these videos say hi John watch us this
one's a bit on the personal side it
comes from a William J who asks John are
you married if so how many kids do you
have
well I am absolutely happily married for
about two and a half years now I do not
have any kids at least not yet but I do
have a puppy
her name is Lucy you might see your show
up in some of the videos so for that
hopes into your questions and not taja
asks what is rooting why do people do it
what benefits does it have compared to
stock Android phones well that's a very
good question for familiar with iOS
devices for example similar to
jailbreaking what rooting does it gives
you access to the core of the phone
Android is open source and what that
brings a lot of really cool things most
people root to be able to put on custom
roms and what this actually means
they're custom operating systems so
folks that get a skin phone like
something with cents on it or TouchWiz
might want a root to put on stock
Android what you might find on a nexus
device they may want a root to put on a
ROM that's been tweaked or customize
maybe some features that were missing on
their phone they want to be included I
know before Android 4.1 with the big
features of rooting I was able to do
full automated backups and get quick
settings in your pull down menu now
rooting soft for everybody if you're not
so technically in clients stay far away
from it but if you do like to tweak and
tinker and make your phone really yours
Android phones and rooting is a great
way to go I've done some routing in the
past the Galaxy s3 I put on the stock
roms some of the most popular stock roms
you might have heard of from the
CyanogenMod teams you may have heard of
CyanogenMod 9 and 10 and usually they
bring the latest version of Android to
multiple phones hopefully they don't
answer your question so oftentimes on
these videos I think friends and
sponsors that put out great software
or have a great application this I know
I've got a really important message that
I want to share with you so I'll take a
break bantering the questions to tell
you a little bit about what's gonna be
happening on New Year's and for the rest
of your life so often times these videos
all thank sponsors to have a great
application or product this time though
I really want to thank to bring your
attention to something it's really
important don't drink and drive
especially with New Year's coming up the
place will be out in force nationwide
from now until New Year's Day a
nationwide effort to crack down on
impaired driving young adults are among
the greatest at risk for drunk driving
don't put yourself and others in danger
risk the terrible legal repercussions
drive sober or get pulled over really
don't be dumb don't be an idiot don't
get anywhere near car if you've had
anything to drink not only you're
risking your own life you're putting the
lives of others in danger even if you
think you're fine and know we're had a
couple beers don't do it it is never
ever worth it
even if you make it home when you're
okay doesn't mean you're gonna happen
the next time do not take the chance it
is never ever ever worth it call a cab
call a friend call your parents get home
any other way you can and get in behind
the wheel we've been drinking they are
looking for you dear self a favor don't
ruin the holidays for yourself your
family or some innocent victim again
guys drive sober or get pulled over
really important message so thank you

the buffalo I am again your host John
