by utstarcom is really aimed at the
messaging crowd those of text heavily
and those that occasionally use the web
it does have a Polaris built HTML
browser although it's not so fully
capable you're not going to have an
iphone as browsing experience but if you
use the internet passively it's
certainly passable and actually can be
quite useful so the device itself is a
little bit on the thick side but nothing
terribly bad it's certain a little bit
pocketable thank you guys a comparison
here with a few devices you might be
familiar with so here's the quick fire
against the iphone you can see it's a
little bit smaller and it's still it's
substantially thicker here we've got the
blackberry storm turn this around here
almost identical lengthwise and just a
hair thicker but nothing too bad go
ahead and move this back up as I said in
a hardware overview the QWERTY keyboard
which is really the meat and potatoes of
the device is very easy to use and
actually very finger friendly i found
myself adapting to the keyboard after
just a few minutes and i think that you
will too one thing to know about the
device AT&amp;amp;T is marketing this as a music
centric device but they don't include
any headphone adapters in the box and
there isn't a 3.5 millimeter headphone
port on this at all you have to go ahead
and buy that extra which is a little bit
strange for a phone centric device
however what this device is going to be
used for mostly is for messaging and
that's really where it excels mms text
messaging are a breeze the IM client is
a piece of cake to use even the built-in
messaging and email application is nice
and easy and you can set up yahoo mail
gmail very easily it uses a web browser
access it actually does a very admirable
job it is a full 3g phone which is nice
you actually do get very quick speeds
you also get simultaneous voice and data
which is quite handy it's got a 1200
milliamp hour battery and 18th is
estimating three hours of talk time or
two hundred and eighty eight hours of
standby time and actually the battery
life seems like you might get that i
used it for a few days and by end of the
day I still had over half battery life
and that's with a full 3g network so
again this is still a phone
good phone calls actually I have to say
this makes the best phone call out of
any phone up and tested recently that
includes the iphone blackberry storm you
know a few other the sidekick really
call quality on this bit actually
fantastic I was shocked it's crystal
clear the speaker volume on it is quite
loud the speaker phone on it is very
loud people on the other end really said
it sounds like I was on a landline so
and that's been the same network I've
used with other AT&amp;amp;T phones are really
kudos to AT&amp;amp;T and utstarcom for putting
a great 3g radio in here so again call
quality nice and easy if you guys are
looking for a sidekick competitor and
you're on the AT&amp;amp;T network and a qwerty
keyboard is important to you for texting
and you want to have I am when you want
a camera for fun an email is not so
important and browsing experience isn't
so important but something you like to
do passively this device is definitely
for you out of a one-to-five scale I'm
going to give it a solid three and a
half it's lacking just because of the
music player the navigation can be a
little bit squirrely when you hit the
buttons on it sometimes you have to
double tap to make sure really get at
the screen isn't as responsive as i
would have liked but i can overlook that
because the strong points of the phone
namely the keyboard and the 4-way
navigation make touching the screen not
necessity it's more of an added cool
feature to be able to touch the screen
on a phone like this so if this is what
you're looking for I can definitely
recommend it you won't be disappointed
just know what you're getting going in
it's available on eet eet EES network
for ninety nine dollars after rebates
