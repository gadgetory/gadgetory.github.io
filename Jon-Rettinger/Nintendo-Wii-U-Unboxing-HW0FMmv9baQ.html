TechnoBuffalo earth and unboxing that I
get to do about every six or seven years
or so we've got a brand new console this
is Nintendo's latest and greatest we you
ready to be opened played with and
manhandled this is the basic set it also
comes in a deluxe version I'll run
through all those differences let's go
ahead and see what Nintendo's console
looks like now that it's finally in HD
go and dig in alright so here is the Wii
U basic set this guy's gonna set you
back 299 bucks if you want to go for the
deluxe version you can tack on another
50 that's going to get you bumped from 8
to 32 gigs gonna get your stand for the
console and the control pad and it's
going to get you Nintendo land the game
let's go ahead and dig in here so go
ahead and peel off the plastic I've had
a chance to play some the Wii U games at
Nintendo events and III but very excited
to actually see the release titles and
give them a full playthrough and of
course they're these title that I am
most excited about is this guy Super
Mario Brothers you reviews are saying
it's pretty much the same Mario Brothers
game we've been playing for years but
that's all I want I love the Mario games
been playing for years so just like the
original Wii box you've got two little
shelves in here with stuff I think I've
got the Box upside down turn that one
more time let's see what we got in shelf
number one lots and lots and lots of
stuff so we've got join the club some
Wii U booklets a ginormous charging
brick and another ginormous charging
brick more power but rather amusing this
one's for the console this is probably
for the control pad which are all that
stuff off to the side also included you
got a Wii sensor bar hiding on in there
and nice to see included in the box an
HDMI cable and I see a Nintendo console
with HDMI this does do 1080p graphics so
sweet for that push that off to the side
let's get to all the good stuff traits
shoes where the axe
happens and boom here we've got the Wii
console all decked out in white deluxe
version is going to be black so if you
want a black console it's gonna be the
only way to get it at least right now
I'm sure we'll see special editions and
colors come out as the consoles life
goes on so here it is pretty heavy now
looking console but not gonna hold the
very out that's gonna sit in your
components and since we don't have a
stand it's got to sit like this let's go
ahead and open this up I've got two USB
ports you actually expand storage if you
want and of course you can pop in a seat
card expand your storage that way your
sync button eject button and power
button nothing on the left hand side and
on the back HDMI is so happy to see you
two more USB ports since where your
sensor bar is gonna plug in power and
you've got all your fan stuff there and
I don't think there are any sort of
hidden compartment compartments on here
either
no spot for your GameCube controllers
anymore
just some vents push that off to the
side for just a quick second super
excited to get my Mario on and here is
what makes the Wii U's super special
this is the control pad a weed control
pad at end of control pad tablet
whatever you want to call it finish
about three hours of battery life this
guy does some neat things so it's got a
resistive touch screen here obviously
you can actually play the game that
you're playing on your console right on
here someone else wants to watch TV like
let's say your wife doesn't watch
planning more Call of Duty for example
and she wants to watch cooking your
dancing shows hypothetically you could
play your game right on here and take it
with you supposedly if you're within 25
feet of the console I not kind of any
sort of slow down you can also use this
to interact with the games playing
football game for example you can see
plays that let's show up on here other
ways you can interact with it some some
games you can fling stuff right to the
television I like this I know something
Tendo line games let you do that and you
can use it to sort of add things to
games I know in the Mario for example
fifth player can add platforms let's go
through this guy which looks super under
go nama Quechua Lee feels pretty good in
the hands so here's we've got we've got
two
I'll get all these things you've got two
thumb pads let's say we've got a
four-way navigation typical an attender
right there
NFC the through your reader is going to
be embedded we've got a B X and y sort
of odd that the a buttons over there
I've got plus and minus power TV
controller can control televisions got a
home button for your charging and
syncing reports going to live
front-facing camera you can do video
chat on here as well on the top so we've
got AC port and that's three point five
millimeter headset jack and volume
button we've got buttons galore
left-right zr + ZL and we also have a
stylus because this is a resistive
touchscreen would've liked to seen
capacitive on there but in ten days had
good luck with resistive so why stick
with it and that's actually probably to
be for the doc the charging port lives
on top so I corrected myself microphone
as well but Dillon here built-in and LED
indicator so of course we're gonna play
this guy plug it in charge everything up
and get our Wii U on I'm very excited to
try this our own gaming editor Julie
Davidson we'll have an unboxing of the
deluxe in case you want to see what that
one's gonna look like but we here the
main technical offices like to keep
things simple let's take a look for the
deluxe version once that goes live we'll
put a link down below if you want to see
that but for now I'm John retinue from
Deco Buffalo and I will see you guys
next video bye
