brought to you by the LG twins wash two
loads at the same time all right put on
your tinfoil caps boys and girls we got
to have a chat about the bits and the
bytes everyone has that person in their
life who can't help but click you know
they don't even read anything and yet
there they go clicking on okay next
except don't be that person
let's take a minute to talk about your
phone and security or privacy we're
going to talk about three major things
here we're going to talk about
permission location and protection the
three major things that you need to
think about when you're asking yourself
is my phone even remotely secure but
before we get into that stuff I just
want to give you a quick disclaimer none
of this is going to make your phone
impenetrable okay there's no such thing
the whole point of putting security
measures on your phone is the same thing
as putting like a bike lock on your bike
when you leave it out on the street you
wouldn't leave it out there on its own
make it super easy for someone to take
it would you
same idea here we have a ton of
important stuff on our phones these days
and all you're trying to do is make it
that much harder for someone to get to
it should your phone become lost or
stolen alright let's start with a big
one
permissions permissions that are
actually much better on iOS than they
were on Android up until very recently
as a marshmallow they're basically on
par now apps need to ask for an entire
list of permissions that they're going
to need eventually right when you
download them so they're going to let
you know ahead of time these are the
things that we're going to need to be
able to do our job correctly the nice
thing is it won't actually grant that
permission to that component until it
comes time for it to actually be used so
if you download an app that needs your
camera then you'll say okay I know
you're going to need my camera but it
doesn't actually have access to until
you go to take a picture with the app
all the settings everything that you
agree to even after you've already
started using the camera you said yes
allow that's not final you can go into
your settings into the permissions area
of whatever settings whatever device you
have and you can allow and disallow
specific components for apps on a per
app basis if an app is going crazy using
some sort of background data then you
can shut it off here you don't have to
give it access to whatever it is that it
had access to if for example you don't
want snapchat to have access to your
camera
you can totally do that I don't think
you'd be very good at snapchat but you
totally could or you could use it to
turn off location access on a per app
basis location location location we're
not talking real estate we're talking
about phones it's a big deal and a lot
of us don't realize that a lot of apps
are tracking our location in the
background Facebook is one of the
biggest offenders Facebook tracks every
last thing you do on your Android device
and in fact even on your iOS device
uninstalling facebook has been one of
the best things I've ever done on my
Android device in terms of processing
and in terms of battery life I can't
even start to imagine how much of my
information Facebook has just because it
was running in the background just like
for permissions pay attention for what
is asking for your location you can turn
off your location overall for everything
on your device by just turning off the
GPS but then that means that you're not
going to get any of the functionality
that you need for things like Foursquare
Yelp Google Maps anything that requires
your location to function so what you're
going to need to do is again use those
permissions that we just talked about
pop in turn off location for the for the
apps that are behaving poorly the apps
that you would send to the corner
seriously like I said with physical
access to your device all bets are off
so make sure that you have a lock turned
on on your phone I don't care if it's a
pattern I don't care if it's a
passphrase I don't care if it's a pin do
something because at the very least
you're keeping people from just getting
straight into your text messages
immediately you're emailing it
immediately and if you're logged into
things like Amazon on your account they
can just start buying things and it's
best not safe not to mention then they
have your home address lock your phone
there's no excuse not to especially with
smart lock on Android it makes things so
much easier you don't get any of the
pain points from having something
locking on your phone with all of the
benefits of having a lot there if you
get separated from your phone you don't
have to worry smart lock will take care
of it it'll stay lock down but for
convenience when you have it on your
body you're in good shape you can still
get in there just as easily as you would
if it were turned off in the scenarios
where you do get separated from your
phone though Android device manager and
iCloud are two phenomenal tools that you
must set up install Android device
manager on your Android device and make
sure that iCloud Find My Phone
remote wife are turned on on iCloud if
you have an iOS device if you ever get
separated from your device you can
figure out where it is give that
information to the authorities or I
don't know if you want to go daredevil
on them just go track them down and if
you do get separated from your device
and you can't get it back you can always
remote wipe it so at the very least
you're only out a device and not your
whole life guys come on play it smart
play it safe be be the best audience I
want the teeth TechnoBuffalo audience
still eat just be the savviest about
being smart about what's on your device
speaking of the audience I know there's
a lot of you lurkers okay
I've seen a lot of comments our comments
are like are weird sometimes they're
great sometimes they're not so great but

never comments on anything do me a favor

want to galvanize the the lurkers the
people who are here and in good moods
