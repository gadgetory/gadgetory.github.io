to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back there episode of rettinger
if superheroes jon rettinger this week
is all about the fire phone jeff bezos
just left the stage and i want to talk
about it will go to the specs my
opinions on it when I think it's to be
successful not successful in everything
that has to do with Amazon's first foray
into mobile phones this is right in jerz
riffs start rifting before I get to my
opinions on the fire phone I'm going to
really try hard to not call it the
Kindle phone I may run through the specs
case you missed it and don't know what
this thing is rocking so it's got a
quad-core 2.2 gigger Snapdragon 800 chip
adreno 330 2 gigs of ram 4.7 inch
display which is 720 so that's 1280 by
720 available near 32 or 64 gig
configurations I've got a 13 megapixel
rear camera and one of the five cameras
on front that used to take your selfies
is 2.1 megapixel hell explodes as other
four cameras are for in a minute keeping
this guy juiced up is a 2400 million
power battery good for 22 hours for
standby time we're gonna get 285 hours
and 11 hours of video playback which is
crazy if I listen to music though you'll
get 65 hours you get free cloud storage
for all amazon content and photo taken
to fire phones and I've got to worry
about filling up your device pictures
you take and is running fire OS 3.5 it
has a lot of cool things to it great
frame is on content obviously x-ray for
music video book second screen free
backup and restore Amazon's really
awesome whispersync newly launched
amazon music Amazons and video kindle
ebooks and audiobooks from audible great
for audiophiles acclaim dillweed digital
plus and tangle free headphones a cool
thing about this device though is this
in a second you use it you've got a ton
of content already available you don't
have to go into you know iTunes and sort
of by what's there you already have
access to if you have amazon prime you
immediately have access just tons and
tons of movies one of the killer
features one of the things I loved about
the fire HDX is made a don't know what
made a is let's get just sort of watch
application on your phone and some
person will show up right on your screen
can't see you though they can control
your device you can teach you how to use
it on the head edit pictures you ask
Mayday and they will show you they say
I'll get somebody up on the screen in
less than 15 seconds and someone will be
available 24 hours a day seven days a
week no matter what time it is you just
hit it and they show up I gave my dad a
kindle fire HDX mostly for may day and
he loves any questions that he has just
goes ahead and ask them that's a killer
feature on the phone imagine having
question on your phone I wanted how to
use a new feature how to use a new app
you can just ask your phone and tech
support shows up and all they can just
walk you through it like they could over
a normal phone dick actually control
your device and teach you how to do
things and leave trails and draw arrows
you know how to work it it's really cool
but that is probably not the biggest
feature of the phone the biggest one is
dynamic perspective which is kinda 3d
ish so the phone has four cameras one in
each corner so depending higher whole
billion if you're living in portrait or
landscape or laying in bed essentially
is going to create sort of a 3d esque
effect so you can tilt the pan you could
tilt it left to navigate man you told us
the right to access sort of useful
information and shortcuts like attaching
photos to a text message viewing song
lyrics and a ton more now you can swivel
for access tube fortifications and quick
actions like made a flashlight settings
and much more they made a big deal that
it's sort of really cool for one-handed
use you can search scroll with your
phone but it's tilting it down and
tilting it up no regard to the fact that
features been around in other phones for
a while any phone you have you can
pretty much scroll with one finger
anyway so I'm really that certainly
helps that much with that I won't ended
use but they say it's great for one
handed so another cool feature of this
sort of crazy camera setup you can peek
which esta keeps your display
uncluttered by revealing additional
details quick actions only when you need
it which is kind of neat to stop for
just one quick second to thank our
friends and good peeps at GoDaddy they
want to let you know that it's go time
and they're here to help you kick butt
online start your website today with a
20 on 95 centcom visit godaddy.com enter
promo code techno 25-year dot-com for
trailers and ninety-five cents its kind
of start your blog go ahead and get back
to the video fireflight which is sort of
now sort of apt eyes if you have the
amazon app on
i phone you know what this looks like
little things for glitter on the screen
hold it up to anything and they'll
search it for you if you hold it up to
you know a box of crackers it will find
that box of crackers on amazon and let
you buy it it can out do it for music
you hold it up to advertisement it will
pull up the phone number it's kind of
cool what it does just another way for
you to buy amazon stuff to show you the
point of this sort of a fire phone
Trojan horse retune sams on ecosystem
all this awesomeness though is not going
to come cheap is an ATT exclusive least
for right now that's going to cost you
six hundred and forty nine bucks for a
32 gig off-contract 199 432 on contract
you can add a hundred bucks if you want
to get that 64 gigabyte version but for
a limited time you'll get the full year
of amazon prime so it does a lot of
stuff so opinions on the device it seems
neat i want to sort of see it and hold
it i've tried 3d phones before everybody
remembers and ones from HTC and LG they
were headache-inducing this one that
looks like the totally different
approach using your eyes and your heads
to determine where things are going to
go it's not sort of how you're looking
at it like stereoscopic 3d was practical
applications are saying other than sort
of way you can move it as your viewing
maps you can see building public is
coming up at you mean sort of peek
behind a building if you're on maps and
it's blocking your screen it's probably
a little bit gimmicky I'm wondering if
you can serve turn it off that sort of
has yet to be seen amazon does things
right and the very patient and they have
the war chest sort of stick things out
to let the audience center of their
folks that love amazon and get chance to
know their products the original kindle
didn't set the world on fire if they
stuck with it certainly now the kindle
line is pretty awesome and amazing and
it's crazy market wait for it
penetration so what can be successful
not really cheap feel people thought it
might be certainly had expensive
following the same price so there's
close the same price depending on where
you buy as an S 5 HTC One or even an
iphone 5s you get a little more storage
oh and realize that pricing the 32gb
model where the same as six teams are
for their competitors to get more
storage but you know how they're my
people going to enjoy it's going to
depend on the experience that 3d effect
is not going to be for everyone but Sir
they could be helpful they may take a
really big killer feature for folks that
maybe want to try a new phones based on
Android that had
use it you know have to worry about that
anxiety of getting a new phone if you're
not sort of tech bio or tech head like
we are getting your device there's a lot
of nerve to come along with I don't know
how to use this how am I going to do the
time I check my email made a sort of
negates all of that so for me that's
really kill a feature of the phone I'm
excited to check it out these devices

little bit of a wait they're available
