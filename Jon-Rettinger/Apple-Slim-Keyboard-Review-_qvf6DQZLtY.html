apple wired keyboard that I'm box for
you guys yesterday I know I've only had
it a day but i think i've used it enough
to be able to give a pretty honest
review first thing i want to tell you
before we get into the view is the
keyboards freakin sweet it's really good
now going to lie i well i think that
first off along time with questions that
I had in the unboxing like people want
to know how flimsy or flexible the
keyboard is well show you I'm putting a
lot of pressure on right now and
keyboards I've been bending it feels as
solid as any other keyboard if not more
so there must be a real thick sheet of
metal I know it's aluminum in there to
keep it feeling that solid and sketchily
got a decent amount of weight to it too
so it feels pretty substantial despite
how thin it is the next big question I
got was in that keyboard looks great but
we'll work with booklet by PC the answer
is yes it will work with your PC but you
need to get the drivers for it you can
get those drivers from Apple's boot camp
site people that have max along these
boot camp their monies are keyboard to
all the drivers in it no problem the
next question I had was I've got a the
same keyboard but my function keys don't
work two years work my keys do work they
all work great what you have to do is
you have to go to apple the Apple in the
upper left hand corner and do a software
update there's actually a new set of
drivers or software that will make all
the keys work no problem so let me show
you a little bit more a little bit more
about the keyboard and I'll tell you
about it as I do it with any keyboard
there's gonna be a learning curve you
know regardless I've got a 10 split
ergonomic keyboards Microsoft ones at
work and I still make mistakes on it
happy quite gotten used to it yet this
one I tagged on up about an hour made
some mistakes after the first hour I
really wasn't making any it's the keys
are spaced feely difficult to hit the
long
what I do all the time so you know it's
a learning curve like anything else five
hours a day max and you'll be typing no
problem the keyboard feels really good
people are asking if it's so small low
or you'll hurt your ribs to take that
low it's raised on the back you can see
by these pilots USB strip there and it
feels great to hurt my wrist I kind of
got some bum risk for type in a lot but
y'all didn't bother at all the keywords
so thin you're probably wondering how
much tactile heels are lost Julia as you
can see the space bar here yeah there's
a decent amount of push down you know it
feels great solid it clicks so there is
a decent mount of tactile feel that
feedback selection should be a concern
for it people ask why I got the wired
one instead of the wireless and you know
I can justify it by setting I wanted
extra function keys bigger arrows and
number pad but the truth is I didn't
really want to wait till sep tember or
so to get the wire on this one I need a
new keyboard now and the new keyboard
out I got it I don't regret it at all
the keyboard feels really really really
really solid types great yes really all
you want to keep work to do you want to
get some pictures of it too it looks
like better and go to the apple com and
they have some much better pictures of
it but I'll show you just kind of real
quickly here you know what we got all
right so here is your keyboard you got
the Escape key we got your brightness up
or down from Zach expose dashboard and
some function keys all of your music
playback so you got fast forward rewind
play pause volume up or down and eject
and what the wireless one pretty much
cuts off right there so all this stuff
here is done you don't have that but the
wired one obviously does you got some
function keys 13 14 15 home page up or
down delete and that full arrows and you
also have a full number pad with
function keys going as high as
s19 so guys um that's pretty much the
keyboard like I showed you yesterday one
USB 2.0 port there another ufb to point
their you can plug your mouse if you got
it or not I've got the wireless mighty
mouth so I'm not putting anything in
bugs you know that's that's pretty much
it guys keyboard is really thin that
showed you guys yesterday helping it was
with a singular sim card I've got the
ilife box here and for you guys probably
seen how thick the Apple boxes are you
know how big that is and compare be a
good exact there there yeah that's
really how thin thing is I mean it's
nothing the part look at the best shot
but you get the idea thing is tiny thing
is really really really tiny um it's a
great keyboard and like I said if you
need one I wouldn't hesitate to go get
it at all stores should have them in
stock now that's it guys thanks for
watching then get subscribing give any
questions as always ask them a try and
answer come and enjoy the rest of day
guys but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
