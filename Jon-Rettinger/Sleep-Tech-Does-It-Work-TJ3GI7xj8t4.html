TechnoBuffalo here and welcome to my
house we're here for a reason
for most of my adult life I have
suffered really severely from insomnia I
don't know what insomnia is it's not
being able to sleep not be able to fall
back asleep or any sort of sleep issues
sort of classified under insomnia it's
been a really hard for me to function as
an adult that somebody who runs a
business as a father for years it all
started back actually when I first
wanted to TechnoBuffalo so you guys
haven't been following us for that long
I would quit my job I had no safety net
I had very little money I need to take
up a little work we launched in the site
crashed within 10 seconds mostly because
I didn't know what it took to develop a
website at the time and we were down for
about six months before Tommy came back
it Birds through all of our startup
capital during that time we're really in
danger of never even existing and I
couldn't turn my mind off I was
technical had to work I had no other
options and ever since then I've had
publicly doing before then I used to
sleeps in like 2 p.m. classes and I was
in school asleep was never an issue for
me but something that I suffered with on
and off now for the better part of nine
years and that brings us this video I'll
talk a lot on social media about having
to deal with insomnia just to came back
you guys to give me a lot of awesome
suggestions things I've tried the patch
drinking more water exercise melatonin
other questionably legal options to try
before sleep and a lot of the things I
have tried with varying results most of
which are short-term success but nothing
really long-term its are cured the issue
so the folks from Beautyrest reached out
the product called sleep tracker to try
lets you subtract your sleep and I've
tried other sleep products before I try
things that I had to wear and become
very self-conscious of wearing something
well in quickly answer disrupts quickly
if I would get anywhere so this actually
goes underneath your mattress and if you
sleep with the partner you can put under
each side of the mattress and it can
track pretty much everything to check
your breathing
check your heart rate can track your REM
sleep through all the phases of sleep
contract and they'll learn your sleep
habits and give you advice and sort of
let you know what you
and what you're doing wrong and try and
correct it so it's been kind of cool so
they did sponsor this video those
opinions are hunt to set my own there's
a product that I legitimately need
aren't that many products out there it's
something I really wanted to try this is
definitely one of them so thank you to
them and I want to share with you guys
my experiences with it and what's works
and what's not work or they're not be
able to sort of cure my insomniac a
little bit so I don't think you can even
see me what it is right now about for
the morning I got up maybe like 20
minutes ago
I haven't able to fall back asleep since
so all right so just woke up I was up
twice a night once I woke up and walked
like 5:30 I - I look up string so that
was on each time it took mean it looks
like 40 minutes or so to go back to
sleep but I did fall back asleep
entually so that's the wind as opposed
some nights where I just kind of roll
around and watch the clock ultimately
I'll just go downstairs and start work
or watch TV or something
so looks like my sleep was pretty
efficient it was more efficient than I
thought it was going to be it's kind of
interesting scale to actually quantify
not just how long I slept actually what
kind of sleep I had so I was surprised
using the app for about the five nights
that I've been using it I actually slept
more than I thought I did
I'm a very light sleeper I'm not getting
that much heavier REM sleep it's been
helpful to know when I wake up and what
I'm falling back to sleep it's really my
issue I did fall asleep okay right away
but then at two kids at home one crying
I've got to get up in the night a Bing
Elvis or see a chart and get advice for
when to go to sleep have the app alert
me when it's a good time for me to wake
up but I've had my optimal Sleep Number
that's been really helpful it has not
cured my insomnia which is something I
was sort of hoping to get advice - how
to get to that point but has made it
better like I said it comes in way
serve now it's undulating back up I was
where I'm having trouble sleeping again
but being aware the type of sleep I'm
getting it's really helping me find out
what I can correct now that I know what
the problem is it's not just general
insomnia I can try and correct it I know
that it's staying asleep I know it's
sort of exiting REM sleep too early are
things that are really useful to me did
I suffer from insomnia if you have an
issue ever like I've been trying the
product it's really easy to install you
just slide each side on to your bed and
plug it into a box plug into the wall
and that's really it but you're like six
minutes to install it all go through an
app for either iOS or Android hope you
guys enjoyed this little inside looking
to my life and my house if you like this
personal style you let me know those and
I got a lot of issues I'm willing to
share until next time i'm john wright
