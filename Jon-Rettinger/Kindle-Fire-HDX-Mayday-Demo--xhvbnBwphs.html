TechnoBuffalo I got here the Kindle Fire
HDX 7-inch I just wanted to show you
guys the unique customer service made a
feature it comes with every HDX tablet
and basically it allows customers to
call Amazon customer service 24/7 365
any time of the day it's free with every
tablet and they help you with basically
anything you need whether it's you know
finding an app editing picture or just
changing settings on your tablet so
let's go ahead and check it out looks
like we got someone joining up hello
there let me turn the let me turn the
volume up really quick okay I'm sorry
what was your name Wendy I don't I don't
see your oh there you are hello okay
yeah I could hear you just fine um you
know I changed my screen orientation
lock and I don't remember where that
setting was so I wondered if I could if
you could help me find it and change it
back oh I thought it was somewhere
deeper in settings but I guess I must
have been looking in the wrong place
okay Wendy I also took a picture of
myself and I wondered if I could edit it
and send it off to someone through email
you can if you go to your photos where's
that look at we can actually okay you
could swipe to the right there okay yeah
there it is there we go there you go
is there any way I could move the little
chat window just pressing drag oh there
we go okay okay so if I wanted to add
like a little mean thing what does that
do I don't think that did anything now
what if I wanted to add like a mustache
or something to my bar like some
sunglasses is that possible what about
these stickers yeah okay so I see I
could just drag and drop and then resize
them right
I don't know those don't really suit me
that well but I'll just go with those
anyway what do you think all right if I
if I wanted to send this off to someone
how would I do that like through email
oh that's just fair about it okay all
right perfect no I think that's it Thank
You Wendy you too bye bye
as you can see Wendy helped me through
editing my picture and I I added some
very crooked clamors sunglasses and I
sent it off it was it was pretty cool
May Day I used it a few other times they
could help you with pretty much anything
so this is a perfect feature for aunts
and uncles or anyone else that doesn't
really know you know what they're doing
with their tablet all right so that was
