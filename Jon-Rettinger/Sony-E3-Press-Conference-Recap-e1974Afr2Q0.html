techna Buffalo and this is your sony e3
press conference recap all right I'm up
here in Northern California but Joey is
down in LA where he's been all week
covering III non-stop all kinds of
coverage on TechnoBuffalo calm and I
believe John renders with him today as
well so I'm doing this little recap of
last night's closing performance of the
day the sony press conference not much
in the way a new hardware nothing at all
really a little bit of talk about some
new vida capabilities but those are
features not new hardware instead it was
games games and more games as Sony
wrapped up Monday's day of e3 press
conferences first up the makers of heavy
rain Quantic Dream's took the stage to
talk about beyond their newest game
coming to the ps3 now you may have
gotten a taste of beyond when you saw
the Quantic Dream short cara a little
while ago stuff you saw on Cara is part
of beyond beyond a cinematic journey
game featuring the voice of Ellen Page
you used to know where Juno now you know
her as jodi but Ellen Page supplied the
voice as well as the well she did the
motion for the motion capture of the
character Jodie Holmes in the game
beyond and beyond looks to be a little
bit more of an action thriller than
heavy rain was and also really shows off
some of the facial mapping technology
that Quantic Dream has been working on
so beyond from Quantic Dream next up was
some never-before-seen footage from
Assassin's Creed 3 and I'm going to just
I'm going to pass along what I heard
because I'm not the hardcore gamer in
the in the buffalo herd but I've heard
Assassin's Creed 3 is a strong contender
for Best in Show at this year's e3 and
apparently they never seen before
footage was from this massive epic
battle scene that has assassin creed
fans talked in so Assassin's Creed 3
living up to the hype with some new
footage at the sony press conference
sony also showed off PlayStation
all-stars I kind of maybe a Nintendo rip
off here I don't know
but the all-stars battle royal
PlayStation all-stars battle royal I
think I misspoke the first time kind of
kind of a little bit of a Nintendo you
can see the influences let's put it that
way speaking of vita owners of a
bleeding edge portable gaming console
can play some old old old games coming
soon sony announcing that a psone
classics bundle will be hitting vita
this summer and that bundle will include
favorites such as tomb raider and final
fantasy also a Sony recently announced
that YouTube was coming to Vita and now
they've announced that crackle and Hulu
Plus are also headed to their portable
gaming device god of war ascension was
next but not last in the Sony lineup and
apparently this one impressed as well
with some very very organic fluid
violent violent violent scenes fans of
the God of War franchise seem to be
reacted pretty favorably to this one so
if you are a fan of there another a lot
of you out there stay tuned for that and
last up in the sunday press conference
was the last of us which apparently
quote blew the roof off the doors off
the press conference if you watch the
footage you tell me you hit us up in the
comments but off from what I've heard
the buzz on the last of us was very good
from gaming development house Naughty
Dog these guys took the cinematic format
apparently to a new level really
impressing folks with what they showed
off so a lot of ps3 titles couple of
Vita titles I think I didn't mention
that the assassins creed two for Vita
will come hand-in-hand with the first
ever White via the Vita available in
white and lots across console stuff
there nothing new on the hardware front
but we all know that's coming next or
even I know that the new hardware should
be previewed sometime next year but lots
of titles lots of new titles and some
old classics for Vita owners as well so
