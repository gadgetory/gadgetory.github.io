TechnoBuffalo here than unboxing for you
of the HTC first the very first phone
shipping with Facebook's brand-new skin
at Facebook home that's going to be
coming to other devices but this is the
only one right now that is going to come
with an experience right out of the box
so it's going to be available for $99
but by time you pick this up what we
have here might not be what you have is
Facebook is promising monthly updates
let's go ahead take a look at this guy
see how it stacks up item here is the
teeny tiny box for the HTC first the
only video were in the comments it'll be
acceptable to yell first alright so
we've got the 18 G globe agai HTC four
sort of Facebook looking font making a
Facebook there's Facebook's F letting
you know this is Facebook home this is
the first device that is shipping with
Facebook home right at the box would be
available to download on a myriad of
other devices but this one is fully
ensconced inside of the phone will have
some features that others won't
including some notification features so
I'll go ahead and slide off this little
sleeve and here is the HTC box as a
reminder this is shipping now for $99
from AT&amp;amp;T so here is the phone that's
4.3 inch 720p screen that is 1280 by 720
that's pretty nice so far in the hand go
ahead and peel off the plastic actually
before I do that and I get all excited
gonna push it off to the side I still
get super excited never I unbox new
phones so underneath the we've got some
serial numbers HTC stickers we saw this
with the HTC One it's kind of nice
you're doing that now so if you want to
show your HTC love you can do that sim
removal tool Quick Start Guide for you
guessed it and we've got nothing really
else in the box charging cord and wall
work pretty generic HTC stuff alright so
let's look at the reason we are all here
this is the HTC first texting and
driving it can wait that is a true
statement I was actually driving it a
day and there was a guy on the freeway
texting made me very nervous so don't be
that guy okay so here is the phone on
first blush it feels very similar to the
One X and the one X plus it's got sort
of us
off touch rubber feel to it it does feel
really nice HTC's devices I think have
some of the best build quality in
industry so I will power this guy on and
see what happens and I'll run through
the specs for you here in just a moment
hopefully we got some juice we'll see if
it does have juice it's coming from a
2000 milliamp hour battery see a nice
transition talking about specs you got
the little Facebook home logo that shows
up right there
so Android 4.1 at launched and Facebook
home is on top of it you can however
turn off Facebook home and really be
left with stock Android again that is
4.1 you can also turn off facebook home
and leave chat heads on if you want it's
one right here it's a very interesting
way to manage your Facebook messages and
SMS so it's being powered by a 1.4 Giga
to Qualcomm dual-core chip that is the
eight nine-30 double a if you are
keeping track at home
Giga RAM 16 gigs of storage but you're
not going to find here is any place to
put expandable storage because that
ain't an option look at that Facebook
log and that's something interesting you
don't see when you first turn on your
phone so it's got a five megapixel
camera living right there on the back it
is flush though to the back so you might
want to keep a cloth or your shirt
before use ik is probably going to
collect some Durst dirt and dust Durst I
just made that up
it's my combination word it's got a
front-facing camera as well at 1.6
megapixel shooter 802 11 a BGN so if
you'd expect Bluetooth 4.0 it does have
NFC and a micro SIM card slot which
lives right there so let's do our tour
of the device on the top there is a 3.5
millimeter headset jack noise cancelling
mic power and a lock button in the upper
right-hand corner of the phone on the
left hand side there is your charge and
sync cable that's the now standard
microUSB SIM card slot you got to stick
a pin into to pull out the little shelf
on the bottom we've got speaker grille
and on the left-hand side
very well pronounced volume rocker we've
got the typical Android controls here on
the bottom we've got back home and
multitasking or menu depending on how
it's set up interestingly we've got sort
of a circle button there though for home
I guess that sort of matches that circle
button
right there as well I'm going to go
ahead and login and we'll do a real
quick look at Facebook home of course do
a full review of the device and also a
full review of Facebook home showing you
guys what the heck it does I'll be right
back alright so here is Facebook home
interestingly enough when I turned on
the phone the only login and asked me
for was Facebook it didn't bring up
connect to Wi-Fi or any sort of Google
stuff it was just Facebook and this is
what I am greeted with and
coincidentally we've got Ava Choi who
hangs out at her office with Lucy as our
picture so on first blush you can do a
pretty decent amount with facebook home
it's your lock screen in your home
screen which is kind of weird so if you
want to like a picture you can just
double tap it and you get a big ol
thumbs up if you want to do that down
there as well they're shortcuts for it
or to see the comments you can hit that
little icon right down there so if you
hit the home button you get all of your
apps sort of right from your lockscreen
it's pretty standard apps one
interesting want to notice though is
this one right here called home settings
you can actually turn off Facebook home
if you want if you want to go back to
stock Android you could turn off
Facebook home but you can leave on chat
heads if you want which will pull up a
little chat notifications as you go with
a picture of the person that's talking
to you it's actually pretty interesting
to see and you can see pictures are
scrolling here from everybody on your
newsfeed as your friends on
notifications you just saw those guys
show up right there you can drag one and
throw it off the screen or you can stack
them together and throw them off
together so you've got a text message
from AT&amp;amp;T and let me know Wi-Fi networks
are available and there is your icon
showing you what you look like on
Facebook home so a few other things here
are kind of interesting as you go ahead
and scroll through you can see again all
the pictures no multi-touch is on here
if you want to zoom into pictures if you
want to see the whole picture
you can log pro long press and see it so
the big deal with Facebook home addition
to sort of making Facebook your home and
lock screen is as I just mentioned chat
heads so chat heads is a kind of cool
way to manage all of your Facebook
messages and a IMS so when a chat head
comes in and there's perfect time anyone
from ROI it'll show up and you can keep
that ever any application you could drag
it anywhere you want no matter what
application you're in so let's go ahead
and open up an app we'll keep that chat
head there let's say I want to go to
Chrome I can start browsing and see the
message from Roy
up that and continue in that chat head
stays there if I want to jump to that I
can always just tap it and I'll go right
to that chat if you want to go out of it
again you can just hit home and that
chat head will stay there for as long as
you want you can move it anywhere you
want it to be now you want to get rid of
it you just drag it right to the X and
you can throw that chat head right off
it's a pretty neat way to manage your
conversations I like you can move it
anywhere on the screen so I'm going to
try Facebook home and see how it works
and how it performs one interesting sort
of glaring omission from it though for a
phone that's meant to be very Facebook
centric done the way to access a camera
is to either go to your apps and go to
camera
there's sort of a camera shortcut which
is a little bit on the odd side to me if
you hold down your icon one other thing
you can do jump right to messenger go
right to Chrome or you can jump right to
your apps and that is really it for
facebook home this is the $99 phone it's
not meant to be their flagship you know
quad-core phone the HTC One is
definitely that guy but for $99 price
point or getting a very nice phone now
consider this if you're thinking about
something like a nexus 4 for example you
can get stock Android on here it's 4.1
you can take off a spoke home if you
choose to but you still get access to
LTE which is something that you don't
get on the Nexus 4 so consider what's
important to you you know you guys
anything you want to see about the
Facebook first leave your comments down
below I am John wrench from
TechnoBuffalo give this video a thumbs
up will most definitely appreciate it
I'll see you guys in the next video okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
