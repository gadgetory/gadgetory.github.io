TechnoBuffalo here I want to give you
guys a chance to win I think it's going
to be one of the most awesome phones of
the year
a Galaxy s8 or a galaxy s A+ pro
whatever they decide to call it whatever
version of the phone you want you can
win no matter where in this world you
live so I'll put all the details down
below and I'll tell you more about to
give away in a second but I teamed up
the folks from super screens to bring
this giveaway to you guys and if you
haven't heard about super screen you're
going to be hearing a lot about them
over the future it is an incredible
product a chance to go to their super
secret labs yesterday check out an early
prototype of the thing which is live on
Kickstarter right now for 99 bucks
essentially what you're getting for any
$9 the ability to completely replace
your tablets and stop that upgrade cycle
over five six hundred bucks every two
years
looking at my own tablet drawer and I'm
kind of embarrassed to admit it but over
the past six years I spent close to
eight thousand dollars on tablets which
seems completely unnecessary tablets
today are mostly larger versions of the
phone os well super screen is going to
do is going to take that OS and put it
on a larger 10.1 inch screen so the big
deal behind that is you're getting no
latency the same experience did on your
phone on your tablet so the uses there
are crazy thorough
so first the pairing process is really
simple if you open one app on iOS or
Android message you're not prepared
every time you want to use it if you
want to fly your drone for example let's
take a look at your phone screen I have
a larger screen to fly your drone with
sit on your couch browsing emails you
now can have it on a larger screen I
think you would use a tablet for and you
pay that 600 bucks for it you can now do
for just $99 other benefits you're going
to totally save your battery life uses
70% less battery life just using your
phone it has its own 12 hour built in
battery life
it's got cameras Bluetooth speakers
built-in you are getting a full-blown
awesome tablet experience with no
latency whatsoever anything that you
want to do on your phone you now get the
option on a bigger screen for me if they
used taken home automation
instead of getting home picking out my
phone launching the app I kind of my
super screen just sitting on a table or
mounted on the wall turn it on
immediately connect and I can access all
my home automation stuff so I want to
check them out I think you really should
link to them kind of
everywhere but available for Kickstarter
now for $99 and on to the giveaway which
I promise silca super screen gave us a
chance give away whatever awesome
products we wanted Galaxy s8 galaxy si
plus whatever color whatever version you
want along is under $1000 us you have
the chance to win it open to anyone in
the world giveaways going to run from
today which is March 20th for two weeks
which is April 3rd hit the link down
below go detective buffer comm all the
stuff there to enter will be available
and you go ahead and enter and will
contact you if you will made it super
simple thank you again to the folks
super screen and I talk about them for a
while because the product is
legitimately awesome something I could
see myself using I try to work with
companies to product I would actually
want to use and this is a great way to
save a ton of money you never used a
tethering part of your limited to add a
plan together to a tablet it is just
your regular data from your phone so it
kind of gets to be truly unlimited the
benefits are really big it's the process
I'm excited to actually use myself and I
think you guys are watching hope you
enjoyed all information is going to be
located in my pants region so next time
from John render from TechnoBuffalo
