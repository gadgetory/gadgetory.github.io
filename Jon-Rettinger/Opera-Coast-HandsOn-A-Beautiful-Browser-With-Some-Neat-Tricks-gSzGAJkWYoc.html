TechnoBuffalo here I have a smartphone
glued to my hand for many more hours a
day than I choose to admit and more than
my wife would like me to have I'm
primarily sending email but a lot of
these things I'm doing is work based and
I'm doing that in a browser on iOS I've
always just used Safari I know a lot of
you out there have used Chrome but
safaris what have you since what I've
gotten used to but that does not mean
that it's the best browser out there the
folks at opera asked me to take a look
at opera coasts and they wanted me to be
as honest as I could which I always am
so I want to talk about the positives
and negatives about the third-party
browser and help you decide if it might
replace Safari or Chrome for you guys
let's go and take a look avoid just by
default use Safari on iOS not just like
it's the best because it's just always
there and it worked well enough I've
been using opera Coast's as my only
browser now for five days and there's a
lot to like about it but not everything
is perfect let me go ahead and open it
up and I'll walk you through it first
thing you'll notice is that it looks
totally different than any other browser
that you might have ever seen
there is a iPad version as well that
looks just as gorgeous and of course one
optimized for the iPhone so there is a
bit of a learning curve here it's very
different than what you get with
ordinary browsers might be wondering
where the address bar is and why all
these tiles and things are here when
you've never used a browser before I
want to walk you bit to the UI which
I've come to really appreciate is very
well done
I've actually become very intuitive so
first to search the web it's pretty
simple just go ahead and slide that down
and go ahead and search for anything you
want what I like about it is they're
sort of giving news right in front of
you as you're searching so it might not
want it but it's nice to sort of see
something new and usually takes
advantage of unused real estate while
you're typing so you can type a question
or URL whatever it might be
let's go ahead and jump right in look at
TechnoBuffalo
so we'll type TechnoBuffalo if you
search a site before it'll start to
populate and it doesn't just pull up a
list it gives you the typical sort of
written options there but also give you
a title format which I really like if
you don't have an icon it'll make one
for you and telling you that it's being
searched with Google so quick search go
ahead and jump into Tecna
buffle for example it'll load the site
you get a bit of a splash screen as it's
pulling up and the site is there and
things load very quickly and we'll talk
about the SunSpider score and stuff a
little bit later using it though just
like using any browser you can scroll
around scrolling is really smooth on it
depending on what you're using with the
UI might look a bit unfamiliar here so
you've got an arrow you've got a grid
and then you've got sort of a smaller
line of icons so I'll show you at each
one of these is going to do on the left
is gonna sort of let you know what
you're looking at and also pull up your
share opps and sharing is really
important top or Coast and they've done
a great job making sharing really really
easy and also you'll see with opera
Coase things just look really pretty
let's go ahead and push that arrow it'll
tell you what's that you're visiting
it'll pop even a little thumbnail from
an image in there and you could share it
via any of the social networks that you
choose hit the X will close that this is
just gonna take you home serves as your
home button and you go ahead and jump
right in we'll go back to TechnoBuffalo
and the one on the right is going to
give you your cabs if you look at that
well look just like sort of a row of
rectangles is actually a visual
representation of what your tablet look
like so if you want to go ahead and
close one you just go ahead and swipe
right up and they'll close the tab for
you it's a very simple and easy to
understand UI if you want to browse
previous pages or back pages simple
swipe gestures will do that for you if
you swipe that way you'll go back to
your previous site if you want to swipe
to helps the direction and go back to
the site you are at it's again very
simple and relatively intuitive let's go
back and home I can show you some other
cool stuff that you can do here inside
of Opera Coast so first these pages are
gonna be here by default the Facebook
Twitter YouTube reddit on the rest that
kind of stuff you can choose to remove
them or not the pages you've just
visited will show up down here below so
all of your tabs will show up in little
squares so if you want to move one up
and go ahead and select it move it right
up and they'll stay there permanently if
you want to get rid of it you can do
that as well you can drop here to delete
so drag it up to the top delete it and
it's going to be gone from your history
what I like about opera Koch's that's
pretty much always in private mode if
you delete that tablet just to the
techno buffalo it deletes all the
history you've had with that site so if
secure is important to you
bear in mind this is almost always the
equivalent of being incognito mode as
long as you delete that tab then there
is no history of you ever visiting that
site something I really appreciated
another feature that was important to me
for a browser to have was ability to
have handoff certainly with iOS and
Yosemite a hand-up doesn't work here
just like any other handoff capable
application we launched got bluetooth on
on your computer it'll work pretty well
as I mentioned I wanted to check what
the SunSpider score was in that chest
JavaScript and how well a browser can
run JavaScript in that case it's the
lower the score the better it's got a
score of 1296 whereas Safari got a score
in the 300 so by that you might think
Safari is gonna be you know three to
four times faster that was not the case
this loaded page is really really fast
and I became to really appreciate the UI
and how well video played inside of the
application on how well everything
worked very personal choice it might be
one you've been used to maybe you like
to try new things I've really
appreciated opera coast for the way it
looks in the way it performs it's a
beautiful looking application and I
could appreciate the design effort that
went into it design language that was
used I really liked it viewing all the
icons and on my tab is no squares I like
the way it encapsulated things I liked
how I could sort of view a quick snap
other side I was in and share it very
easily on these social media that I
choose I also really liked that it was
always in private mode I could swipe
away and my history would be erased with
it not that I'm doing I think scandalous
but I just like someone should take my
phone or anything that it's all sort of
hidden something that I've come to like
with Opera Coast
so again browsers very personal choice
if you want to try something new I think
you kind of owe it yourself to try the
free opera coast not gonna cost you
anything give it a shot
it does have a bit of a learning curve
or like I mentioned so try it for at
least a day day and a half to get to use
it I don't think I really disappoint I
think you really like it and for me I
think Opera Coast might just replace
