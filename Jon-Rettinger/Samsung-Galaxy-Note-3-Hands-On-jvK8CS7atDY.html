here checking out the note 3 this is the
Samsung Note 3 the newest most beautiful
upgraded addition to the Galaxy Note
family we're going to be checking it out
here at IFA this week you can see we're
already using the s-pen we're looking
through it we're gonna talk about some
of the specs it's actually running
Android 4.3 right out of the box it also
has a 5.7 inch screen that's up from
last year's note to 1080p Super AMOLED
screen is gorgeous you guys I can't even
do it justice in this video there's no
way you're gonna have to see it for
yourself it's also 15 grams lighter so
they've definitely cut some of the fat
around the edges if you check out the
note 2 which I have in comparison you
can see it's definitely a little less
rounded it's a little bit more masculine
I would say but one of the other things
I want to talk about is the back of the
device it actually has this really
lovely sort of leather look to it and
you can see it's very tactile and
obviously feels really good in the hand
certainly a change from the standard
plastic back we're used to seeing on the
note and other galaxy s products but
yeah let's check out some of the device
so this is running it's got a 32 and 64
gigabyte model in some countries and
it's actually got three gigs of RAM on
board so this is a powerhouse this phone
phablet whatever you want to call it is
gonna be a workhorse for you
3200 milliamp battery and also a 13
megapixel camera but let's check out
some of the S Pen features because this
is really the big deal that is happening
with it so you can see we now have Air
Command happening so if you hover and
you click the little button on your S
Pen you have all these great options in
a wheel so they're making a lot more
easily accessible for people who are not
used to using the S Pen on the note so
we're gonna check out action memo this
is a really cool feature that they
showed us an action memo previously has
been
not useless but definitely basic so once
we circle it we're gonna get all these
options so we have all these options
that we can do we can call you can do
contacts we can email we can go at we
can do all sorts of things and this
actually works with email addresses it
works with addresses you can open maps
directly of an address which is a very
nice feature and definitely something
that's bringing notes into action notes
into in the 21st century so let's check
out something a little bit different I
definitely want to look at scrapbooker
so this is scrapbooker if you hover and
get your Air Command going you can
choose scrapbooker it's sort of a cross
between Pinterest and Evernote so if you
circle something you see a lake online
or you want to make a note of it you can
actually circle it with scrapbooker and
then you can add it to different things
like that very very cool stuff so swipe
up which is my magazine we blink fiesque
different areas personal here now social
news on everything of course the note
wouldn't be complete without a set of
accessories including a new wallet that
actually allows you to use the device
through it so you can take pictures and
navigate some of your device through
that little front pocket window and of
course we have the Galaxy gear the
newest accessory for the Samsung Galaxy
Note we have a separate hands-on video
for that but for now that is it for our
note 3 hands on at Aoife 2013 we'll see
if we can't get some more video of this
on the show floor but if not until then
we'll see you the next video bye guys
