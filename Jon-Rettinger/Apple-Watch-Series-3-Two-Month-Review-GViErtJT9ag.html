Apple watch Series three hit and during
that time I've had it on my wrist almost
every single day so I wanted to do a
full review of the Apple watch we didn't
do a review when it first came out I
wanted to get a chance to know it a
little better see if there were any
giant differences before I jump into
that I want to talk a little bit about
smart watches in general I am a ball a
conflicted emotion when it comes to
these little computers on my wrist part
of me wants to be like what's the point
apps on your wrist are stupid they're
slow they're hard to launch and it just
as easy to look at my phone it's but
it's a notification the other part of me
when I don't wear a Smart Watch super
misses it and I'm not sure which side is
winning so my approach with smart
watches is kind of like a question mark
are they useful sometimes
are they not useful yeah probably but
the app and watch Series three does
bring something new that takes it one
step closer to actual utility and that's
LTE availability you can tell you've got
an LTE model buy the real red on the
crown and that's pretty much the only
way you can tell you've got an Apple
watch Series three as opposed to wrap
and watch series two really the original
Apple watch so a couple things I really
like about this series story I think
Apple improved over previous versions
that is battery life hotdamn is battery
life good I went three days without
charging the Apple watch by time one day
went by use about 30% so 3% each day is
pretty awesome it's going for about 7:00
a.m. until about 10:00 p.m. the big
caveat though if you have LTE turned on
or leased LTE active so if you leave
your phone at home it'll detect that and
I'll turn the LTE modem on by your life
with LTE is not great I get a test of
able to make a one-hour phone call on
the watch with LTE and that drained the
battery from complete to zero if you've
got LTE on and just like out walking in
the park or something you can generally
get through maybe about five to six
hours away before the battery life is
gonna come pretty close to dead but I
don't think the use case is most people
using LTE all time
I think it's using LTE when you're going
for a run you're going for swim or doing
a workout that's when you want have the
benefit of how
LTE on those kind of things it works
pretty well one of the big benefits of
LTE and this wasn't there at launch
actually was the ability to stream Apple
music to wireless headphones when you
don't have your phone near you and I
tried it paired with some air pods it
worked really well as I went for my run
I could ask whatever song I wanted to
play I could play playlist anything I
wanted to do anything I could do it
Apple music for my phone I could just do
with my watch and if music is something
that's really important to you and maybe
you wanna listen to music at home or by
your bedside I want to thank the folks
at iHome for sponsoring this video
making it possible particular there is
16 and this thing does absolutely
everything it's an alarm clock it's got
alexa built-in it's got a USB port on
the back for charging your Apple watch
ever else you want to charge and most
importantly I think it addresses the big
shortcoming with an Amazon echo device
they don't have a screen so if you have
an alarm set you wake up in the middle
of night you want to know what time it
is you got to ask it and it's loud and
quake up the person sleeping next to you
this has a screen built-in it's got
really cool LED lights that will glow
when you ask Alexa question it does
everything in a really nice small
compact footprint I'll link to it down
below if you want to check it out the
Apple X series 3 seems geared towards
the Fitbit crowd the folks don't want a
SmartWatch this geared towards workouts
you've got a barometric altimeter in
here you've got new workout apps and
make it easier it automatically detect
when you are working out got a revised
heart rate sensor so if you need to
watch to work out it's still probably
the best going and mid will be a short
out a little bit more but and I did do
the workout it worked out great when I'd
start working out and I forget to set my
watch it would know and it would start
tracking and that was nice I liked the
added heartrate stuff that it does if
you aren't too working out then that
might be read to get the Apple watch
when it comes to me in Fitness I'm
generally only fitting this whole pizza
in my mouth
some other nice things versus previous
versions this one's way faster
the Apple watch series one was certainly
slow was launching the apps off to watch
you've got a little bit quicker the jump
from two to three though seems like it
three or four times as fast if you want
to launch apps and speaking of apps I
don't I don't use them on a smart one I
think it's cumbersome to find them when
they launch they're not that useful it's
easier for me just to look at my phone
no one kind of really ever use apps to
check like a football school or
something on ESPN but that was pretty
much it for me my use case for the watch
gently notifications being able to talk
to Siri and Shannel talks back to you
with the Apple watch search tree which
is nice and then being able to make an
occasional phone call and lt it using a
speakerphone so maybe for me the series
3 isn't necessary most of those things I
could do on series 2 but being able to
have LTE has been nice for that peace of
mind but all that peace of mind is damn
expensive you're starting at four
hundred bucks to get a1 to the LTE then
it's depending on your carrier about ten
bucks a month for the LTE service then
you gotta have an iPhone to go along
with that but time you get all this
stuff together if you've got a new
generation iPhone you're looking at like
1500 bucks just to get out the door and
that's a lot of money to have freedom
from your phone it's also kind of weird
that Apple's trying to sell you on
freedom from your phone while also
trying to tell you phone all right so
who is the Apple watch Series through
four first if you already know you're an
Apple watch fan and you want to upgrade
things yet you're gonna do it anyway
for coming from the first gen Apple
watch it's gonna be a gigantic update
for you not only for battery life but
for speed and overall OS and software
improvements it's a gigantic improvement
we're coming from a series to I mean
other than LTE there's very little
difference here there's some new band
colors but you can you can just buy
those from the Apple Store or buy a ton
of third-party bands from Amazon that's
who the watch is for other than that I'm
not sure who the target market is I like
it I don't love it kind of sums up my
apathy in general toward smartwatches
and not just the Apple watch and I think
having worn android wear for four years
now the OS that Apple's got on the Apple
watch
called
watch OS there's way better and more
intuitive than Android wear but their
heart they both do the same thing and if
that same thing that it does is for you
be great if it doesn't you can skip it
wait for next gen and hopefully we'll
see a design change and maybe a little
round screen or these sort of look
noticeably different than the very first
version that's hit all right so that's
the up and watch series three it's kind
of the same thoughts I've had for one
and two it's probably the best
SmartWatch out there without you need a
SmartWatch or you want a SmartWatch and
I came down to your personal usage if
you want the latest from Apple and get
it if you're a workout fanatic you wanna
be able to track your heart rate a
little bit better maybe you run up in
the mountains I don't want to know your
altitude it's nice to have if you're
coming from the first gen watch and you
want the waterproofing and you want the
speed nice to have that there as well if
you're rocking a series - I think stick
with your series - for another year
perhaps your patience will be rewarded
and let me know what you guys think did
you buy a series three if you did why
you're using LTE the next time I'm John
render from TechnoBuffalo dr. guys the
