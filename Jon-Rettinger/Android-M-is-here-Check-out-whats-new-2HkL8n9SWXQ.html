Sangin from technobuffalo and google i/o
just wrapped up a few hours ago and we
finally got our hands on the latest
developer preview for Google's X
operating system Android M a lot of the
bigger changes are happening under the
hood with a focus on quality and to end
but not everything google is adding is
just focus on performance let's find out
what else is new one of the major
changes Google made in a joy dam was
giving users deeper control of a
permissions in previous versions of
Android users had to agree to a bunch of
permission requests when installing an
app from the Google Play Store but with
Android M apps can trigger requests for
permissions at runtime for example a
certain app wants to access your photo
library you'll have to grant that at
permission to access your photo library
similar to what we've seen on iOS
Android M will each control eight
different app permissions click on one
and you'll see all the apps that
currently have access to permissions
like phone microphone location and more
another feature included in Android M is
chrome tabs in a planking which makes it
easier for apps to talk to each other
and link between different apps for
chrome tabs when apps give users links
to websites it will create an in-app
chrome tab rather than launching the
chrome apps separately even better the
in-app tab will still retain all of your
data including your profiles your
preferences and passwords a plinking on
the other hand eliminates annoying box
that pops up when there are multiple
apps you can choose to complete an
action for example when you receive a
link to a Twitter posts you can either
open it on Chrome or the Twitter app in
android m if you click that same link
it'll take you right into the Twitter
app rather than having to decide between
Twitter or chrome there's also Android
pay and fingerprint support Android pay
is Google's new mobile payment service
that's set up to compete with Apple pay
and it'll be available at over 700,000
stores across the u.s. the new service
will work at any payment terminal
equipment NFC Android M will also bring
fingerprint support to apps which means
devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note for
galaxy s5 and s6 are all set for future
apps that bring fingerprint support
Android pay in particular seems to be
dependent on devices that have
fingerprint readers so we should expect
to see more fingerprint technology and a
lot more devices in the future google
also updated google now to be smarter
and more efficient and Android M there's
a new feature called now on tap which
essentially is an assistant that listens
in on your activities and gives you a
supplemental info like store hours or
movie reviews right inside the app or a
website for example with a friend texts
you with
invite to a local restaurant you can ask
now on tap for reviews store hours and
other info mid-conversation all this
information will pop up as cards rather
than kicking you out of the app making
it super easy to get more information
without jumping around the OS
unfortunately we weren't able to try now
on tap as the first preview doesn't
offer it but once we have access to it
we'll be sure to keep you guys in the
loop now another big change in Android M
is doze android M's newest power saving
feature using the devices built in
motion sensors those will know whether
or not of devices in someone's hands and
we'll go into a deeper power down state
to say battery in a long run however
it's smart enough to not turn off
entirely since it'll still be able to
activate alarms or wake up for incoming
chat requests to UI changes that we did
notice when we install the first
developer preview of Android M on our
Nexus 5 was it app drawer and widget
drawer inside the app drawer instead of
scrolling through your apps horizontally
your apps are now scrollable vertically
and there's also a recent a place at the
top of the drawer which shows four of
your recently opened apps for quick
access as for the widget drawer it
changed a bit too similar to the app
drawer your widgets are now displayed in
a vertical list which in my opinion
looks cleaner well Google really didn't
talk about it on stage when playing
around with Android M we noticed that
there's a new feature called system UI
tuner which wait for it finally lets you
customize a quick settings menu this is
something Android users have been
clamoring for four years so it's a
hugely welcome addition the interface
allows you to drag icons around remove
settings and even add new tiles Google
makes a new feature difficult to find in
the Android M preview and there's really
no telling if this will be available in
the final version hopefully Google will
make it a part of Android going forward
the infamous easter egg inside the
Settings app unfortunately isn't working
yet on Android M but hopefully in the
next few bills will see something
exciting there right now you'll just get
to see this yeah there are a ton of new
features coming to Android M including
USB type-c charging auto backup for apps
simplified volume controls direct share
and more google announced that m preview
will be updated more regularly than l's
and specifically the updates will be
issued over the air so no need to flash
the updates yourself anyways thank you
guys so much for watching and if you
guys enjoyed this video make sure to
give it a thumbs up and we will see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
