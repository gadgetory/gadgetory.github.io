Loch Ness monster and the galaxy note 6
i'll have what in common if you said
I'll mythical and don't exist you are
correct it looks like Samsung is going
to skip the galaxy note 6 and just jump
right ahead to the galaxy note 7 they're
doing that presumably to fall in line
with the Galaxy S line of phones
throughout the galaxy s7 and then the
note 7 instead of the note 7 in the s6
which I guess would make the note seem
like an inferior phone we're did not
because it's usually a high respect
device so this phone is supposedly
coming at least going to be announced
early August so only about five or so
weeks away so I tell you what you can
expect from the galaxy note 7 decide
whether or not you want to wait not much
is gonna change on the screen size we
should have a 5.7 inch qhd display the
camera on the back is going to drop a
mega pixels from 16 to 12 but before you
fret unless you're blowing up gigantic
pictures you should get a much better
quality shot with the new sensor is
going to be found in the galaxy note 7
but it seems like the front facing
camera is equally important for for
adding like you know maybe you wanted
like a cowboy hat on your selfies ever
else filters snapchat wanted to give us
to be a 5 megapixel sensor it's gonna
stay right at you so I'm clumsy I'll
admit it I have dropped more than one
foot into toilet and looks like just
aside from just being super gross in
discussing if I did that with the galaxy
note 7 it would survive because ip68
water resistance should be here on board
as well Samsung does not like to be out
spect in really anything but the one
plus coming out with six gigs of ram you
could expect the galaxy note 7 to have
six gigs ram they're on board as well I
almost at seven but this is six-minute
abs have six gigs of RAM when the big
Knox and Samsung devices has been
battery but looks like Samsung gonna
make this right with a four thousand
million power battery found in the
galaxy note 7 also expect the other
standard stuff like fast charging and
fast wireless charging to be on board
powering the phone should be a
Snapdragon 820 one or in some regions
the XE knows 88 93 both of which should
sit power instead of just sticking a key
in it shotgun it
other things you can for sure expect a
redesigned s pen to be on board that I'm
guessing you could put in either way
without it just breaking the features of
the pen next remember really not sure
about they're gonna be two different
versions a flat version and an edge
version i would probably put my money on
there being one variant it just has
curves on both sides similar to the
galaxy s7 edge this rumors been getting
a lot of steam the galaxy s7 could
probably have an iris scanner to help
unlock your device we've seen that in
some Windows Phone device in the past
but first time I've actually seen it in
wide use in Android such of your kind of
cool white works really fast and she
looks like it's working like face unlock
but instead of looking at your face
doctor just focusing right there on that
eyeball which is creepy what works the
color standpoint should launch with
black silver and blue but expect just
different color options throughout the
year there'll be a white version
available only in swaziland they'll be a
pink version available only in Europe
there'll be a spider-man version
available whenever homecoming comes out
there can be a lot of special versions
so you don't like the color options just
just wait like the weather in seattle
it'll it'll change in like 10 minutes so
galaxy note 7 what do you guys think it
looks like it's going to be a beast of a
phone they usually are from samsung if i
keep a phone for years the note lines a
good phone and do that it usually uses
the most cutting-edge specs available
even specs aren't readily available they
tend to try and get access to a cram in
the phone that i think last a lot longer
than typical android devices what do you
guys think do you agree disagree excited
about the note 7 just mash a thumbs up
button I appreciate it tell us what
phone you're going to get down below
you'll be like nope one plus three for
me iphone 7 for me and waiting for the
next galaxy s phone you in the comments
located here in my pants I'll region and
while you guys are telling me what
phones you want to pick up and what
phones right for you may be in the back
your mind hole which is a gross way of
saying your brain I got an idea for the
next appt maybe the next project and you
want to confer and work with the team
but maybe it all spread out folks it
atlassian have you covered you can
assign and track casts with JIRA you can
create and share content with confluence
instant message or video chat with
HipChat which is a fun word to say hip
chat or you can test and review a
managed code in real time with bitbucket
