in the making if you're near the
TechnoBuffalo and new to the YouTube
channel periodically I'll do the state
of the site where I talk about
everything we've done right wrong share
some milestones to kind of pull back the
curtains but you know what it's like we
can do this because we are independent
we're not owned by anyone so we can sort
of share information or not beholden to
any sort of company we can share
whatever I want to share with you guys
what I want to share is everything so
let's start with the site the first
thing you'll notice if you go to the
site today is that it looks completely
different and again one of the points of
the video is to talk about we did right
and wrong and one thing we did wrong was
our ads for the past couple years and
give you some context we are again
independent site we're not owned by CBS
a AOL Vox or any other large even
publicly traded company so that means
all the ads that we run run through an
ad network we don't have the resources
to go out and do direct sales and in
those ad networks sometimes malicious
ads will get in you may have seen some
of those weird takeover ads that happen
on mobile horrible things that we never
signed off on or wanted but our hands
are sort of tied behind her back because
that's the only way that revenue comes
into the site is through those ad
networks we didn't have the ability to
sort of turn off certain networks we had
to sort of just go through one by one by
one and see the problem stopped and we
thought we'd isolate it and then it
would come back again and we heard the
complaints and we know it was a bad
experience I didn't like the ads on my
own website it was really hard for us to
find a middle ground between having to
make revenue but also be gonna provide a
really good experience so about seven
months ago we started building what you
see right now which is TechnoBuffalo 4.0
it's a fourth version the site we
started from code zero previously been
building on older code he's kind of
going as we went along we started from
zero and built the site all back up the
first thing you'll notice that it is
raizy fast way faster than our old site
in fact it's almost six times faster
than our old site and beyond that the
content on the site loads you for the
JavaScript for the ads or even go to
load so you will see content before any
ads ever show up on the site we also now
have the ability to pull ads directly
out of our stack if there's a malicious
ad or something's wrong we can pull that
out on our own about having to go to
somebody else and way
we can move things around the experience
isn't good we took control back of the
site and my hope is that we found a
really good middle ground between having
to have ads but also providing you a
really good experience or maybe you
don't even notice that they are there
but something that was really important
to me to Shaun Ani who sort of oversaw
the revision to the site and oversee
development we want a good experience we
know that no site with ads is ever going
to be perfect but I hope that what you
see now is better than what we had and
we're going to keep improving we're
gonna keep getting better you have the
ability to add new things we can move
ads around again we can take things out
as we need so check out the new website
you'll notice new logo new branding
everything about the site is brand new I
want the site to reflect the way I view
the company as professional and as a
voice of the consumer and I'm hoping
that from here on out we can do that for
you so if you haven't gone to site in a
while maybe you had a bad experience I
welcome you back to try it try it on
your phone right on your tablet try it
on a desktop we worked really hard to
create a good experience and know again
that we are independents and you compare
us to larger sites in our space we're
doing the best that we can with the
resources that we have without having a
huge ad sales team that goes out and
direct sales for us so I really hope
that we struck that middle ground chord
find a good experience now on the stat
side we have to hit a lot of milestones
on the website even before we relaunch
the new version we finally crossed three
million uniques per months over three
million people came to the website and
we passed a 15 million pageviews
threshold for money from milestones that
I really wanted to hit for calendar year
2016 as he moving to 2017 my goal is by
into the years to get us to four million
uniques and 20 million pages a month
that sort of we're all considered the
year a success for the website I'm going
to be branching out into other websites
you'll see sort of new things right to
pop up next three or four months I'll be
our first officially sanctioned
TechnoBuffalo satellite site we're
really excited about that and hopefully
I can share information with you in the
next few so again thank you guys for for
watching the website on the video side
you'll see things have changed the past
few weeks we re committing to video to
creating a really quality video and
product that I am proud to have on the
channel every single time about four
years we've been putting out for the
as per week and that's been a strenuous
schedule for us come March you'll see
that start to drop down to one to two
videos a week to where you can put up
videos when we feel they are done we
feel they are ready and where the
quality and topic is something I am
proud of and that we are proud to show
you sure saw that new trend start to
happen the past few weeks we saw it with
the tesla model x one and a half months
later and that's the standard that we're
planning on setting for video moving
forward and if you don't feel you've
lived up to that standard let us know if
you haven't watched it videos in a while
something I said at their website come
back watch them we are trying really
hard through the voice of the consumer
that's something that thing independent
gives us use this opportunity to talk
about whatever we want that having to
worry about sponsors or board of
directors it's freedom it's something
that I'd love to have so please come
back watch the videos give us feedback
we're trying to find new ways to engage
we brought on Jesse Ortiz I'm putting at
sort of leading some these social things
for us to see our social channels have
gotten way more active interact with us
we'd love to talk to you what I try to
push what we can do here at
TechnoBuffalo I'm hoping you'll see that
on the video and the website and if you
also you guys want to see or know let us
know in the comments down below I want
to just to give you guys a real candid
view of what's been going on and things
you've done right and wrong I think
we've done a lot right we've also done a
lot wrong and you have to sort of
recognize where you drop the ball to
move forward and to create a better
product that's sort of what I want to do
so long winded video notes for the
people who are dedicated to the channel
and maybe haven't seen us in a while
thank you for sticking with us those of
you that are new thank you for watching
until next date of the site's I'm John
