from TechnoBuffalo here with a full
review for you of one of the latest
flagship phones and Verizon's
ever-growing android lineup this is the
HTC built resound and for all intensive
purposes it's the spiritual successor to
the not-so-old HTC Thunderbolt let's go
ahead and dig in and see if this guy's
worthy of resounding reviews and bad
puns
all right so before we jump into the
full review let me talk about the specs
of this guy and there's a lot of specs
in here to talk about all right so
what's our price right now from the
carrier it's $249 although perhaps by
the time you're watching this review
we're going to the holiday season that
price is gonna fluctuate so you're going
to want to check on that it's running
Android 2.3.4 with HTC Sense 3.5 sitting
on top of it we'll talk about all this
stuff more in the review let me to
mention standpoint it's 5.0 eight inches
by 2.5 eight inches by kind of chunky
0.5 four inches the display though is
where most of the action happens that's
what you're looking at right now this
guy is a 4.3 inch which we've seen many
times before s LCD panel with the
resolution of wait for it
1280 by 720 that's right this is a 720p
display and for those of you that can
view quick math or have a calculator
watch handy that's 342 PPI which is
absolutely insane we're gonna spend a
lot of time talking about this display
in the review what's gonna keep this
display up and illuminated is a 1620
milliamp hour battery all being powered
by a Qualcomm built dual-core 1.5
gigahertz chip it's got a gig of ram 16
gigs of internal storage expandable of
micro sd on the backside dual LED flash
with a camera that can shoot 1080p video
it's got a 2 megapixel shooter on the
front Verizon LTE which we'll definitely
talk about as we go through the full
review bluetooth 3.0 and BAM beats audio
all right so now we ran through the
really ample specs of this device let's
go ahead and talk about call quality if
it's not gonna make good phone calls
it's not gonna be overly useful to you
like most Verizon phones I've reviewed
recently a call quality was relatively
good on this guy I did have about 3
dropped calls in notorious Verizon dead
zones where I am in Southern California
during about a twenty call test my
testing period with the resound was
probably on the shorter side around the
15 call tests so whether that typical or
atypical is gonna depend on where you're
located but when the calls were there
and not dropped there crystal clear I
had no popping noise and ebony white
noise and oftentimes a caller thought
that I was on a landline by the caller's
I mean I mostly just called my wife to
see how I sounded we were or as I was
driving through certain areas I did have
a bit of an issue though pairing it with
certain Bluetooth devices a job where in
particular I dropped the pairing twice
before it finally held onto it all right
so now as promised let's talk about this
guy
this display is worthy of several
minutes of a review so it's 4.3 inches
1280 by 720 342 PPI when you compare
that to what was considered one of the
best displays in the business that
Retina display that's just over 320 PPI
on the iPhone 4 and the 4s so you can
really appreciate the amount of pixels
that this guy packs in and it packs a
tremendous amount and it does it without
being a pentile display uses a standard
RGB matrix so what's that gonna mean for
you not all that much but images and
videos are going to look outstanding
you're not gonna have any pixelation at
all with the naked eye but don't take my
word for it let me go ahead and show you
so I'll jump ahead into gallery I've got
some images here queued up go ahead and
move it over I believe that is the bye
skyline and it is just absolutely
gorgeous here no pixelation at all and
images things really really really pop
the only thing that's gonna make the
viewing experience not so pleasurable is
the fingerprint magnet display I know a
lot of devices are oleophobic or can
sort of get some of the grease not to
show somehow this one it all tends to
sort of pool it's a gross word to say
but it definitely shows the grease there
see I pictured the New York skyline or
at least in New York City streets
absolutely beautiful
let me guys show me some video cuz
that's really where the 720p display
shines are one of the many ways 720
he really shines so go ahead and jump
into video go ahead and pick this guy
good here some of the audio coming
through it as well and it's gonna be
tough to appreciate the video coming
from the phone to the camera to YouTube
no matter what resolution you're
watching it on but take my word for it
it is absolutely gorgeous watching
videos on here is a pleasure as you'd
expect from a screen with this
incredible resolution you can see it
evenings by looking at the home screen
let's go and take a look at some text
and by the way you can be doing a lot on
this phone I was looking at websites or
reading so let's go ahead and look at
Netflix shares dropping so we're on
TechnoBuffalo comm and right off the bat
because the high resolution you might
notice that the text is a little bit on
the small side it's so crisp that the
text becomes a little bit smaller it's
the naked eye on because of that higher
resolution so I found myself at least
having to do a little bit of zoom action
to read now this is really gonna depend
on your eyesight if you have tremendous
eyes and you're not gonna have any
trouble reading the smaller text you are
going to love this phone if you've got
slowly fading crappy eyes like me you're
gonna find yourself again doing a lot of
zooming and maybe wishing for a little
bit of a lower resolution so the text
would appear a bit bigger I know I sound
like my grandfather when I say I wish
the text was gonna be bigger but often
times that was true but as you zoom all
the way in you don't see any sort of
pixelation at all the text here is
absolutely beautiful it's probably the
best display that I've ever seen you
don't have any sort of blue tint that
you get with some AMOLED panels it's
just absolutely gorgeous this is a phone
that you have to look at in the store to
appreciate so I'll go ahead and jump
back the next thing that I wanted to
talk about is speed how fast is this guy
well the answer is pretty fast I didn't
have any memory issues at all as I was
running through using applications on
first or second generation Android
devices oftentimes you had to install
memory killers or memory management
applications to control how much memory
you were using not so the case with the
modern
vices androids done a really nice job
and of course we're running Gingerbread
2.3.4 here managing memory you have
built-in memory management if you use it
but scrolling through applications
you're not gonna have any sort of issue
at all from a quadrants core which is
what I generally use to gauge my phones
I didn't put a blazing numbers this is a
stock rom and put up a score of two
thousand two hundred and sixty nine and
this is probably one of those instances
- we can see how high the pixel
resolution is I had a squint all the way
and to read that number really very tiny
but that was the score again 2269 speed
on this guy and one of the best things
about it is Verizon LTE network and
again it's gonna vary depending where
you are but I was pulling in blazing
numbers so I'm gonna go ahead and make
sure the Wi-Fi is disconnected you can
see one of the cents three point five
settings so Wi-Fi is turned off I want
to run a speed test live on camera I
don't generally do this
but I want to show you how fast these
speeds are you can see some my previous
results they're absolutely blazing and
I'd wager bet this is faster than most
home networks getting now in the in the
tens I was getting the 13s down pretty
regularly and I was getting about five
up which we're seeing right here is
absolutely incredible speeds to get from
a mobile network so my hats off to
Verizon again this is gonna depend on
where you are and whether or not you get
LTE I'm in Southern California but those
speeds are incredible so on this test I
got 11 down and about four up and
oftentimes my speeds were even faster
than that
LTE definitely gets to giant thumbs up
if you're looking to get a Verizon phone
right now for sure only get one that
offers LTE but what's gonna make all
this data speed show you stuff and
that's the software and this is running
HTC Sense 3.5 while running and show you
that it's actually the second phone to
run HTC Sense 3.5 the HTC Rhyme being a
previous one so since 3.5 Android 2.3
point four you can see all kinds of
other software there there's not that
much to report and since three point
five to get some niceties you get slow
motion video capture you can remove home
screens but the rest of the stuff is all
pretty standard HTC cents that we've
seen in the past including one of my
favorite features it actually made its
way to the official build of Ice Cream
Sandwich this does not have this is the
ability to sort of drag applications so
ice cream sandwich has the camera there
but it's nice you can drag applications
right in there and it will quick launch
for you so there's the camera for
example go ahead and close out of here
the next big selling point and one
things we mentioned in our specs
overview is the be on the back not the
buffalo this is Beats Audio and
unfortunately it's is something that
you're gonna have to take my word for it
cuz I can't really show you what it
sounds like but I will say that it comes
with a pair of eye Beats headphones can
see them right here with inline mic
built in all kinds of controls and
management and that kind of stuff do the
microphone there's the little pinhole
mic and all your controls here the eye
beats these do come in the box and are
about $100 value
so essentially their beats technology
it's kind of a skin to music player with
beats enable it's got a special sound
profile it sounds good I definitely
noticed a difference with the eye beats
but it wasn't a giant difference
I use the eye beats in a non Beats Audio
official device and I think it sounded
pretty good the Beats Audio is a fun
logo it wouldn't be a compelling reason
to go out and buy the phone unless you
want a really good pair of headphones
you're looking to buy anyway it's sort
of wrapped them all into one package so
let's talk a little bit about the design
kind of interesting and I do like that
these buttons are painted on here
they're not back but they don't
disappear your capacitive buttons across
the bottom pretty standard Android fare
here got your HTC home button which is
sort of like a what kind of shape would
that be so it's a I don't know look like
a house you've got a menu button a back
button and a search button
on the left hand side a device that's
where sharing is gonna live on the right
hand side is a sort of hard to recognize
with your thumb and difficult to push
volume rocker up and down you'll also
notice that you don't have a camera
button here just one designed cue I
really wish this head on the top three
point five millimeter headset jack when
you're holding it like you would a phone
my favorite position the power and lock
button there is in the upper right hand
corner you've got your microphones and
such on the bottom and top you've got
this rubber back I really do love the
HTC build quality whether or not they
use metal or rubber plastic and always
feels really high quality no exception
here this is sort of a kind of an HTC
incredible look with the different
layers of height on the side as you can
see that and all this makes for a very
heavy phone especially you compare it
with one of the other flagship phones
and horizons lineup here this is the of
course the Droid Razr of course at the
thinnest end and the thinnest end you
can see a huge difference but even in
the fattest end to the fattest end you
can see that it's still even a little
bit thinner so this is by no means a
thin phone it's also by no means a light
phone away five point seven eight ounces
I do wish that the bottom was all one
was at one altitude I guess about the
right way to say that but I do wish that
all had one perhaps it would have made
it for a bit of a thinner experience but
does stay pretty flat it's not gonna
have rock that some other older HTC
devices had so the praised a pretty
solid as you're using it if you want to
to type
speaking of typing the more I use it the
less of a fan I become of the HTC
keyboard here I don't know why it feels
cramped
maybe it's the screen size but I just
didn't like using especially with the C
of other great Android keyboards out
there even the stock Android want to
really enjoy but one of the nice things
about open-source operating system is
you don't like the keyboard you can
replace it with one you like I know
there are a lot of swiped fans out there
from the camera standpoint it's that's
pretty average camera nowadays takes
decent pictures it's got some
well some average a little light
visibility it was pretty good in direct
sunlight nothing to write home about
you're not going to necessarily want to
replace this with your point and shoot
but when you do want to snap a quick
picture - it's going to be fine for you
I'm not that much of a camera snob or
even a camera expert pictures looked at
decent I wasn't gonna blow him up and
make posters of him but if I wanted to
share him on Facebook the camera quality
was all right the battery I didn't want
to talk about it's a one thousand six
hundred and twenty million of hours
which sounds like a pretty big battery
but when you factor in a 4.3 inch screen
with that high of a PPI and dual-core
and LTE you're in theory you're gonna
have a recipe for battery drain and
disaster and while certainly not
disastrous I had a difficult time
getting through a full day with the HTC
Rezound and my day may differ than your
day but with two emails constantly being
pulled in about an hour and a half to
two hours of phone calls pretty regular
web checking on here I barely got home
around 8 o'clock and the battery was
just about to keel over so you may want
to keep a spare handy and one of the
things that this offer is that something
like the Droid Razr does not is that
battery go ahead and turn that off I was
actually using replaceable it's got kind
of a cool red look to it on the back as
well I'm go ahead and get this off it's
harder than it looks
peel there we go that's where the
batteries gonna live it's also where
your 16 gig extra external carton is
going to be as well so you can put an
extra battery you can get that extra
charge if you need you are gonna want to
be judicious though if you're traveling
and they're not gonna be near a charger
for a full day so do I recommend this
phone yeah I absolutely recommend this
phone if you're on Verizon and you're
looking for a really solid option
especially if you are looking towards
Android I'd be hard-pressed to not
recommend that resound certainly if size
is a concern for you I may be better off
looking at something like the joy razor
with its Kevlar back and sort of thin
design but if you're looking for sort of
raw specs it's going to be very hard to
beat the display of the HTC Rezound if
you have tremendous eyesight and I
started to mention this more and more in
reviews because this blaze get better
and better they're coming more important
you're going to really like this phone
if you wear glasses sometimes and your
eyesight might not be perfect 20/20 or
even better this is a phone you're going
to want to try accidently in the store
to make sure you can read the text when
you're browsing a website for someone
like me again with not the best eye
sights I could live with it and I could
be very happy you're reading text doing
my little zoom action but it wouldn't be
the most ideal I prefer a lower
resolution however if you watch a lot of
video or you look watch a lot of media
pictures or what-have-you on your phone
it's gonna be really hard to beat that
resolution so you sort of get both sides
of that coin beats audio is a nice sort
of addition but it's by no means the
reason to go out and get this phone I
get those headphones included which is
you know great
so this phone would definitely get
recommended if size is gonna be a
concern you want a bigger display you're
gonna want to look at some of the other
options in Verizon's lineup but I'm
looking for 4.3 inches really incredible
resolution fast phone us is going to be
a great choice HTC is said Ice Cream
Sandwich will be coming no official data
Stu when that's going to be what you
will expect to get some cold tasty
dessert on this sometime in 2012 and if
you're looking to get this again Galaxy
Nexus is also coming out so you might
want to do some cross shopping I am John
