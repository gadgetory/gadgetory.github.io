to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back the episode of rettinger
rants I'm rios jon rettinger and i got a
legitimate right for you this week i was
reading through comments i was checking
out twitter feeds and people have a
problem with just being dicks and trying
to hide the fact that they're being
jerks let's go ahead and talk about
comment etiquette respite when people
might think i read pretty much every
comment on every video at least for the
first five days and videos been up I go
through my read all those comments I
read all my Twitter feeds that come at
me anybody that replies that John for
lakers I read I read every comment on
Instagram I can't reply them all but I
do read every single one that I'm seeing
a huge trend so Internet's always going
to be filled with jerks I've accepted it
there's no problem with just a way of
good people I'd like to criticize you
based on sort of silly things that feel
brave behind a keyboard I've talked
about that before it's not let me talk
about now it's just always going to
exist and it's not going to change what
really pissing me off those people that
sort of hide behind it when they say no
offense orth all due respect and it
didn't say something totally awful and
hideous it doesn't make you less of a
jerk so here's some samplings i think
people have said to me over the past
month no offense but you're an ass how
could i not take offense to that that
that's an offensive comment no offense
we're the worst human being ever with
all due respect you should probably quit
your job no offense looks like you're
going bald no offense we've gotten fat
no offense but your face makes you want
to cry tears of blood how can someone
not take offense that if you're gonna be
a dick embrace it be a dick go out there
be proud where your dick hat have your
hands up high and big yes that's who I
am and this is the comment i'm gonna
make to you sir don't hide behind
something makes you seem oh no but I
said no offense so you can't take
offense so therefore it's your fault if
you get upset it is absolutely
ridiculous in ass tonight if you want to
be a jerk be a jerk this is where your
jerk at proud don't hide behind anything
else just go out there and do it you're
gonna troll troll is gonna troll anyway
but just don't do it with no respect
course all due respect or no offense but
you're probably the receiving being that
never happened history of people so to
you people let's say that
no offense cut it out let me exhale for
