technobuffalo here and this is screen
that we're looking at right now with
something that used to be a huge
annoyance for iphone ipod touch and ipad
users because we couldn't watch hulu on
our mobile devices the idevices as you
like to call them were not flash enable
they couldn't support the flash content
the flash video that who had so we're
left watching our TV shows on our
computer and in limited quantities for
hula would provide us it was really one
of the big things that was a cific and
knock on the iDevices so that is now a
thing of the past enter Hulu Plus which
is what i want to show you then give you
guys a bit of a demo so what this is
it's a free download right now from the
app store and it's going to let you
watch full seasons of Hulu show so shows
that we can only watched three episodes
on in the past for a 999 a month
subscription rate now it's not open to
the public right now but you can't take
it tour band you can see what stuff you
will be able to watch and you can still
get access to sort of the basic hulu
content so there's the icon hulu plus
it's going to go ahead and launch give
you it in landscape or portrait so you
can request an invite to sort of get in
there or you can tour the application so
right now we'll just tore it and it
looks almost identical to a food comas
look like on your computer so a few
things to note here about the hulu plus
i'm against this is just a minute first
if there is an applicant for the ipod
ipad or iphone and you can stream that
stuff over Wi-Fi or 3g depending on your
device and buy ipod of course I mean
ipod touch there's going to be support
for internet connected TVs and moving
players from samsung if you got the
samsung apps so if you've got one of
those you are going to be set and also
there's going to be support for other
devices to the coming weeks we'll see
support for vizio and sony tvs which
will be coming up probably around the
full support for the ps3 in july the
xbox is going to get it as well as part
of custom xbox gold experience and in
early 2011 and again it's going to cost
you nine ninety-nine a month you go to
watch full seasons of shows let's go
ahead and take a look here so here's
some stuff that really there's only
available a few episodes of let's take a
look
at what's there let's say I wanted to
watch lost and get caught up on what
happened the final season go ahead and
hit lost now I have all these episodes
here constituting the final season so
you can watch now in fit in just the
last three or four so if you can watch a
ton of other content and a lot of it is
there and going to be available for you
albeit at a 999 subscription rate
however if you're a netflix user or you
have some other video on demand service
that you use this is really a great
option if you rent one movie from Apple
TV per month or one movie from on demand
or we have a netflix subscription I know
you're probably paying more than this
and for ninety-nine a month it's an
all-you-can-eat thing I need be able to
stream this over 3g or Wi-Fi well you're
just we're going to want to watch your
data usage if you're doing this over 3g
wanted to give you guys a real quick
demonstration see what you thought this
has been rumored for a long long long
time and Hulu Plus is finally here and I
for one and very excited about it so
anyway I'm John the rettinger from
technobuffalo when I'll see you next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
