these days you see him in the bedroom
the kitchen the bathroom and we're also
starting to see them sneak into the car
this is the rove Viva and it's bringing
those Alexa features that used to
in-home into the car now you might be
thinking why would I want Amazon Alexa
in my car I'm supposed to be driving but
there's actually a lot of cool uses for
it so you can do things like control
your favorite music services like
Spotify or Pandora just with your voice
you can ask for directions and it can
open it up in Google Maps or ways you
can even order things from Amazon so if
you're driving and you're like prep I
forgot to order toilet paper you can do
that right from your car and because
it's connected to Alexa you can control
all the different skills you're already
using so say you're getting home and you
want to turn on the lights you just ask
Alexa in your car and when you walk in
the lights are already on so the way
this works is you take the dongle and
plug it into your 12-volt outlet in your
car and it looks just like a normal car
charger and it actually is it has two
fast charging ports so you can charge
your phone or your tablet or anything
you like then you head over to your
phone and download the Rho vive app
connect it to the dongle and then set up
your Alexa preferences and then you're
pretty much ready to go so you will need
your phone in order for this to work
whether it's an iPhone or an Android
phone but every time you get into your
car it'll automatically connect aside
from the two charging ports that are
built in you also have two microphones
that are built-in and that's so it can
hear you and I found that even when
driving around and you hear the road
noise it still picks up your voice
relatively well and if you don't want to
be heard there's a mute button right in
the middle and you just push that and it
has a little bonus if your car doesn't
have hands-free calling built-in you can
make phone calls through the vive in the
few days that I've been using the vive
I've really enjoyed it
I've used it for directions and for
asking things like the weather and the
location I'm going to and it works as
advertised although I will say that it's
a little bit better on Android just the
limitations that iOS has having an
Android phone will make this experience
almost perfect so why would you buy this
and I think there's one specific reason
and that's if you're already invested in
the Alexa ecosystem sure there's other
assistants out there but if you're
ready--you so using Alexa switching over
can be kind of weird the vive you can
use your alexis skills like you're used
to just in one more
in your car if you want to pick one up
for yourself it goes for fifty dollars
but if you use the code viva Cara you
can get it for $10 off through March
seventh week for that is down in the
description
