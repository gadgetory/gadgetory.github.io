technobuffalo here with a review for you
of the HTC hero for sprint we first took
a look at the HTC hero a few months back
when it had a monster chin and was a
European release only since then it's
been slimmed down d chins and ready for
release two US carriers so this is the
sprint version like I mentioned before I
get to the review I want to talk about
call quality as I do in all of my phone
reviews it's a phone first and foremost
besides everything else and it doesn't
sound good and doesn't make good phone
calls it's not going to be a good or
positive experience to you or for you so
I'm happy to report that my experience
with sprint service on the HTC hero has
been fantastic I'm in Southern
California and I had full evdo rev a
service wherever I went call called it
was outstanding people on the other end
of the call her no white noise in fact
on several times could even tell i was
on a cell phone it was crystal clear and
crisp and i didn't have any drop calls
so if you get sprint service don't worry
about the call quality i will say that
the radio on here was not the strongest
when I had a palm pre and I tested with
a few other sprint devices that people
bring the reception wasn't quite as
strong is probably one bar less it
wasn't bad but I didn't notice the radio
to be a little bit on the weaker side so
if you're in a fringe sprint area and
you're going to want to try it out to
make sure it works for you but if you
get plenty of sprint coverage you're not
going to have any problems so let's go
ahead and talk about the device first
let's talk about the design since like I
said earlier we've talked about the hero
when it was the Jay Leno of smartphones
it looks completely different but still
there is the gorgeous vibrant screen
highlighted by Android 1.5 but you
really don't see Android 1.5 what you
see is HTC's on skin on top of it called
the sense UI HTC makes phones and they
made windows mobile phones in the past
you may have seen touchflo 3d that's an
example of a skin essentially what it is
that sits on top of an operating system
so there's been a lot of concern over
this being an Android 1.5 device as
opposed
newer android 2.0 and i can tell you
that that is not a problem or even an
issue at all generally see much of
android you're really getting the full
sense UI experience there's improved
widgets like i showed you in my video
detailing the sense UI there's a few
more home screens you have seven home
screens as opposed to the three normal
that usually get the calendar
applications have been a reward
everything's been reworked for and
improved user experience the one thing
that two point O do have that 1.5 and
1.6 did not have was the google maps
navigation beta which was the free
turn-by-turn directions service but that
has now been released by google in the
android marketplace for 1.5 to 1.6
devices so the only gripe i had with
knocking a 2 point 0 device is
completely gone that being said sprint
nhcc of both on the record to say that
the hero will eventually get a 2 point 0
upgrade so don't worry too much so going
back to design the phone it is really
thin and really sleek it's got a 5
megapixel camera on the back and the
soft touch rubber finish we're seeing a
lot of phones that's a very good fuel in
the hand which is really important to
using a mobile device and its size i
think is just absolutely perfect guys
you've been able to put this in your
pocket without creating a massive bulge
in your pocket it's not going to look
weird women even throws in your purse or
even your back pocket without you know
creating any weird sort of lines it's
extremely thin you compare it even to
the iphone 3gs footprint wise just looks
very thin and to quite good looking
device so I've been very happy with the
design I didn't like the change gsm berg
i think getting a reward for US carriers
was a huge plus so let's talk about web
browsing suppose you to follow me know i
do a lot of my mobile work on my mobile
phone quite obviously so the browser is
really important to me one of the things
that the sense UI does bring to android
and HTC hero is multi-touch browsing and
what I mean by multi-touch browsing is
pinch and zoom and again I gave a
demonstration of that it might send to I
overview but if you've used an iphone or
if you've used a pre or pixi you know
what i mean by the pinch and zoom it
works really well on the hero I found
the
coming on stock Android whatever version
1.5 1.6 2 point 0 feel a little bit
cumbersome with those plus or minus
magnifying glasses so be able to pinch
and zoom really makes things nice and
using it definitely improves the web
browsing experience so if browsing is
important to you I think the hero is a
great way to look it's got the same
webkit browser that's Mobile Safari used
and that Android is used in the past and
that webos uses so you know you're going
to get a very native good-looking rich
HTML browsing experience that's one of
things that I look for most in the
device and I was very very very pleased
with the browser on the hero I would say
it's a very close second for all mobile
browsers probably tied with palms webos
browser and only second to mobile safari
so browser wise like I said fantastic
and because this is running sensor why I
had a lot of questions about people
wondering if they can use all the apps
from the android marketplace you can use
every app from android market place
without any sort of worry and it'll work
quite well on the device speakerphone
was very loud and i like i said overall
i really liked the sense UI experience
over the stock android experience he was
getting a better looking home screen and
much more customization options in my
opinion you know yours may vary I like
androids openness fact I've got the
ability to customize and tweak it and
certainly spread simply everything plan
makes it a fantastic value this phone is
going to run you 179 bucks after rebate
and a two-year contract so it's by no
means a cheap phone we are getting a
decent amount for your money now so
probably going to save a little bit in
the long run if you're a heavy data user
with the sprint everything planned you
get access to all their features you get
sprint navigation in their NASCAR that's
your thing mobile TV and a ton of other
things that most carriers actually
charge you for so I've always been a
happy with sprint for offering sort of
more value for your buck so guys have to
rape the HTC hero for sprint on a
one-to-five scale I give a very solid
four and a half the on-screen keyboard
is great easy to use and only missed out
on that little bit of an other half
because a little bit of sluggishness in
the processor and that's been the one
thing that's for hamper
hero if you've got a lot of applications
open and running you're going to notice
a little bit of a slow down the
processor is not the fastest one out
there but it's certainly more than
capable and that shouldn't dissuade you
the only thing that kept it from getting
almost a perfect rating anyway guys hope
you enjoyed I can absolutely recommend
the HTC hero for anybody out there
