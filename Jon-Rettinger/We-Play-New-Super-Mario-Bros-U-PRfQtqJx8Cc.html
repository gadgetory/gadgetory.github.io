gaming editor at TechnoBuffalo comm and
we are gonna play a new super mario
brothers you it's a brand new game for
the Wii U that just launched this past
weekend all right I'll show you guys the
world map at the end of this clip I just
wanted to hop into a level real quick
I'm still very early on in the game
pretty much within the first world I've
maybe played for 15-20 minutes just on a
few levels
I picked this level because it's a Yoshi
level and it's one of the few in the
game I don't really think that Yoshi
appears that often and kind of a point
of frustration with the new Super Mario
Brothers series versus the Super Mario
World which I'll still claim is the best
Mario in the franchise but a point of
frustration is that Yoshi does not carry
from level to level which is fine I
guess but one of the things that I love
doing or loved doing when I was a kid
and I used to play a lot of Super Mario
World was going back in do she's island
picking up Yoshi and then going through
each level with him it's just a
completely different game when you have
the ocean on board so it's a little bit
frustrating that these new Super Mario
games starting like new super mario
brothers you or we excuse me don't
really include Yoshi as a something to
take from level to level but I digress
this is an HD Mario everyone saying it's
a spiritual successor to mario world
which like i just says my favorite new
series if that's the case sign me up I'm
enjoying it so far it is very much a new
Super Mario Brothers game I mean
everything about it the mechanics all
that stuff feel the same so what's going
on right now with the gamepad you might
be wondering exactly what's going on in
the TV when you're playing the game in
single-player mode you're holding on to
the gamepad that's the controller that
has the screen in it you see the same
thing on the controller with the screen
as you do on the TV so
take that as you will I actually don't
necessarily like the fact that they
didn't swap something out and make it so
that you could switch between screens
and perhaps manager power-ups on the
base screen though you don't really
manage your power-ups in this game in
previous mario games you have one
powerup activated and then well there
are powerup kind of waiting for you to
use here you only have one powerup at a
time anyway so with the gamepad it's
definitely a wider controller you saw
that in John's unboxing the other day it
does feel comfortable though it's
surprisingly ergonomic which I wasn't
really expecting I've played with it at
e3 events and stuff like that but now
that I've actually had the controller in
my hands for several hours at a time
I'll say that I'm not feeling any type
of fatigue I was expecting I would
that's not the case so Yoshi also has
some pretty cool power-ups I don't know
if you noticed or if it's happened yet
but he can catch fireballs and actually
spit them so that when PD piranhas
appear the Piranha plant that pops out
of the pipes pops up there's one of the
fireballs Yoshi can actually catch the
fireballs and spit them back out that's
pretty cool and as you collect apples
and stuff Yoshi's food meter fills and
then he drops power-ups and whatever
else behind him for you to collect so
watch well disregard promise here he
breathes fire Yoshi catches it it spits
it back out see pretty cool so I'm gonna
let the game play for a little while you
guys know what Mario is and we'll be
back to talk about the miiverse stuff as
soon as the level ends
what that was fast so you see how it
says I cleared the course without taking
any damage then it gives me the option
to posted the me verse I cut that out
because the game screen is actually
black and you switch to the gamepad and
you can post little comments about the
what she just played and everything else
and I actually was able to say that I'm
awesome at this game and so posted that
for the world to see and you'll see that
on the game map when we actually zoom
around it at the end of this clip just
so I can give you a taste of how big the
game is picked up baby Yoshi here this
is an interesting level it's one that
antennas kind of been showing off I did
not play it in any events but I have
seen it in trailers and at other clips
that the company's been publishing so
again I'm gonna let this play out but
essentially this level is pretty cool
because it's probably the closest we're
gonna get to flying in the game the Cape
is not back neither is the raccoon tail
the closest thing to it is a gliding
squirrel suit but here with this baby
Yoshi you AK can actually kind of float
up at will for a very limited time
you'll see check it out it's pretty cool
level and I love the clouds and the
colorful designs in the background is
pretty awesome
all right and again it's gonna ask me to
post in the miiverse since I collected
all three star coins but I'm gonna skip
that for now probably will ask you at
the end of every level if you do
something significant either die a lot
or find everything or don't take any
damage like we already saw this is the
world map and these are not my friends
these are people in the public me verse
who have agreed not to post any spoilers
or anything disgusting I haven't seen
anything like that yet and when there is
a spoiler it's actually hidden so
there's a lot of people kind of joking
around and whatever and it kind of
creates a sense of community this sense
of that you're not playing the game
alone the world map is huge it's very
reminiscent of Super Mario World as I
said this game is supposedly the
spiritual successor see all the
different environments and supposedly
there's all kinds of secret exits
through each world can't wait to get to
this snow levels love those but yeah
that's new Super Mario Brothers to you
it's an interesting game and definitely
one worth picking up if you do get the
Wii U I will say that out of the launch
lineup it's probably the best or one of
the best stay tuned we'll be reviewing
this game in a few more and we'll have
more Wii U coverage as it comes thanks
