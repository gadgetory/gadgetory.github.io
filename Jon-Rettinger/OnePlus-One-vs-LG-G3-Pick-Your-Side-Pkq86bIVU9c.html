TechnoBuffalo here with a full head
comparison of the LG g3 and the oneplus
one for me this is like picking a
favorite child these are my favorite
phones that have come out the entire
year so I'm a little bit sad to have to
put these suckers head-to-head but we
will and we'll declare a winner
it's gonna get started so you know this
isn't a review but I'd like to give
disclaimer so you guys know everything I
know these phones both really well I've
used each of them on their own as my
daily driver for well over a month the
one plus we're testing is updated to the
most recent X and pH 300
of CyanogenMod with Android 4.4.4 and
both are being reviewed directly as they
come out of the box there's been no
routing or Rahming or anything that's
been going on with these films at all
it's just directly as they come out of
the box as you would buy them so I'm not
gonna get into benchmarks and that kind
of stuff here we cover those in the
review which wouldn't be linked down
below if you want to check them out and
they're both running the same Snapdragon
801 processor with almost identical 2.5
gigahertz clock speeds anyway so these
are two of our highest rated phones ever
but since we live in a competitive world
let's just make them fight or they're
gonna Duke it out in five categories
we're gonna go through screen design
build software camera and intangibles
and I know they're a ton of other
categories we can cover but this can't
be an eight-hour video so I picked the
five that I thought were most relevant
let's start with screen since they're
bones and you're staring at the screen
almost all the time anyway before anyone
starts screaming that this is over
before it even begins there's a lot to
the screen story here so first specs the
g3 has got a 5.5 inch 2560 by 1440 pixel
display that means it's got a 534 PPI
the one has a 5.5 inch display same size
it's 1920 by 1080 and a PPI of 401 so on
paper this would just be a total
slaughter same screen size better
resolution on the g3 round over but it's
not that simple
remember though the first time you saw
HD programming on a TV for me it was a
football game it was super drastic so I
remember seeing HD for the very first
time be able to see the blades of grass
watching standard definition was such a
big difference I will say though coming
from 1080p to the high resolution screen
the g3 it is not that drastic like it
was from standard to high-definition
just as it heads up it's nothing that's
gonna blow you away it's just not that
different from 1080p - the g3 it
definitely looks sharper but it could
easily be mistaken for a really good
crisp 1080p screen colors give you a
little bit washed out though but it will
play the video back in 4k the one plus
gives you options think since I engine
to adjust the screen setting is right
out of the box and to find the settings
that's really best going to suit your
needs the recent updates make the screen
a bit softer and the changes are really
appreciated
colors look an awesome whites look white
blacks look black the way they should be
about the general consumer here screen
resolution between the two wouldn't
better in to my opinion at all but
because I have a bit of a mental
disorder where I need to have the latest
and greatest specs and my tech bones
then yeah it's gonna be the g3 here so
maybe the results were predictable but
it wasn't a runaway victory that you
might have originally thought
consider it a moral victory for the g3
last note though both are really bad in
direct sunlight as most phones are but
the oneplus one is almost useless in
direct sunlight next let's jump to
design and build during my review of the
g3 I commented on how I thought the
plastic back with the metal coating was
a nice middle ground and I think it
still is but the material on the back of
the oneplus one is hands-down the best
I've ever felt on a phone and metal or
otherwise I'm sorry HTC One m8 its
section enough that it's got a really
good grip it isn't rough and it looks
awesome without attracting just crazy
fingerprints they completely nailed this
one I like how the screen appears to be
floating on metal I like that the user
gets to choose between on-screen or
capacitive buttons I just really like
how the phone feels in the hand it's not
perfect though I've got a creek down by
the charging port I do have some worries
about how it's going to handle sort of
long-term wear and tear they notable
drop and I'm gonna have I don't use case
Sonny my devices
the g3 though it was certainly no slouch
I'm still not a huge fan of the buttons
on the back but the near bezel design is
absolutely stunning the phone can be a
bit slippery but it's pretty gorgeous
overall it's like picking between Kate
Upton and Giselle here but I'm going
with the oneplus one alright next let's
talk about software so the g3 is running
LG's custom skin atop Android 4.4.2
where's the oneplus now confess I
enjoyed moderate injury
4.4.4 LG skin is not offensive to the
eyes like TouchWiz can be the fonts and
icons are pretty pleasant they have a
pretty elegant solution for running apps
on top of each other and for the most
part are pretty decent about pushing
updates out at least compared to the
other big manufacturers cyanogen though
is a customization freaking dream
everything from the theme you can even
pick a g3 theme you can easily tweak
anything here it can be modified and fit
your needs
not to mention supports LG's awesome
knocked unlock feature I could gush
about sigh engine for a really really
long time here this is my first really
extended time with it and I absolutely
love it I originally thought that stock
Google was the best OS going in the
Android world until I tried this and
it's not that there's anything wrong
with LG's UI or the software on its ion
engines is so great this one definitely
takes around two so next let's talk
about camera so during our review of
each we did full galleries again hit the
links down below to check them like if
it looks like a different lighting
situation is that kind of such specs
rarely tell the whole story here but
both have the same theme today based on
camera the recent update to the oneplus
added a really cool feature called clear
image which takes around 10 shots to do
them all together it looks like HDR on
steroids and the pics come out really
really good focused time is about
average the camera shots are pretty
decent it's solid in low-light offers
filters built right in and just takes
just generally nice pictures gg3 other
hand is the first film to offer laser
autofocus which sounds gimmicky but it
really worked as advertised
it is crazy fast and I'm startled how
quickly it can not only focus but also
snap a shot pictures also come out
looking really great I got a 10 and a
half month old at home who's just
starting to crawl and getting him in
focus is next to impossible and of
course as a parent I take away more
pictures than I should and the LG
absolutely nails it there I don't care
much for 4k video on a phone so focus
and picture fidelity matter than most to
me and for me
LG comes out on top and takes this round
so we were all knotted up too - lets go
into the final ride about intangibles
this for me is the most interesting
category the oneplus brings ain't Han to
the table most importantly it's
ridiculous price 349 bucks for an
unlocked phone that can square off
against the big boys is absolutely
incredible I love the way this one feels
in the hand obviously as we talked about
life is off-the-charts awesome and even
after the update though the call volume
is still kind of on the low side and
that's a bit of a problem for me
the g3 though bring some features of its
own it's got a removable back and
expandable battery you also add in an
expandable storage as well the option
for a Wi-Fi Wi-Fi calling if the
carrier's important is also there it's
got really really loud calls and
speakers and the antenna is crazy strong
if both these were on the table and I
can only pick one to use the next 12
months it's a tough decision about
picking the g3 the camera strong antenna
speaker and screen really sell it for me
even despite the higher price both
phones though are really incredible and
I think these are two of the three best
phones on the market right now if you
want to throw in the HTC One m8 you
cannot go wrong with either of these
devices but the big determination for me
is which one I would pick thought I was
gonna use one for 12 18 24 months I
would just pick the g3 it was not a
runaway victory at all
I love the oneplus one I think it's an
incredible phone and a little more
budget-conscious
I mean this is you're gonna get a killer
device with the oneplus one assuming you
can get one which is always really hard
to do they're invite systems a bit silly
suppose it'll come out and wide release
for the end of the month early September
but I think LG absolutely nailed the g3
and I think it's one of the best Android
phones ever to be made so what are your
thoughts what do you guys think do you
agree disagree if you disagree tell me
why if you agree tell me why which one
would you pick up if you got both on a
table you had to use one for a year I'd
love to hear your thoughts on it leave
your comments down below the next time
I'm John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo see
