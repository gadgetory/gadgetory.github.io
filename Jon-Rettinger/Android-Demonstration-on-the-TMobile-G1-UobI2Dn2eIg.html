lakers here and i've got a demo for you
of the t-mobile g1 done via an emulator
on the t mobile site this is an official
emulator that t-mobile has put out to
show the features of Android and how it
works in conjunction with their g one
handset i'll put a link to the emulator
in case you want to play with it up in
the sidebar but this is just a
demonstration not a review I'll hold the
review until I actually get a chance to
play with the device alright guys enjoy
and I will talk to you soon the way here
we have the emulator of the t-mobile g1
running Android version 1 point 0 now
while this is running on a t-mobile
branded phone this will give you a nice
sense of what Android will look like
when it comes to your service provider
or whether or not you're looking to get
AG one yourself so we're greeted right
here with a simple home screen with a
myfaves which is a tmobile exclusive
email dialer contacts browser maps and a
big clock and over here we've got an
arrow that if we click we get a list to
different applications and programs will
go through each of those shortly go
ahead and click back you can also take
your finger and swipe over and be
greeted with a simple Google search
where you search and it launches the
browser go back to the home screen here
on the device itself down here you've
got a hang up button which doesn't do
anything around this emulator you've got
a back button which will take you back
and lock the screen we've got your
trackball here which controls the motion
of advice home screen which will take
you home and a dialer which will take
you to the dial pad so the screen is
locked right now press menu to unlock
and there we go back at the home screen
so for those of you that are looking to
get the g1 and notice a familiar my favs
it's not functional here since its
adjusted emulator so like the home
button to go back we've got your email
you can see what the email looks like on
the g one inbox inbox drafts you can
scroll spam and trash can see what a new
message looks like here this is just a
sample on the emulator read the text
reply and it is full HTML email let's go
back to the home screen
your dialer use a keyboard to dial so
you use these buttons here and dial and
get the green button to send also across
the top you've got four tabs the dialer
your call log where you can see what
calls were missed or sent or received
contact you can scroll through the list
of contacts very similar to how you can
all in the iphone and a very familiar
favorites which is with the iphone
pioneered and replace for speed dials so
go back to menu I should go back to home
Cuban so we just show up at the dial it
looks like and there is a contacts yet
again the browser not functional here
unfortunately on the emulator but you
can see what the browser does sort of
look like it is a full HTML browser all
the iphone and supposedly is very good
from the demos I've seen it's a little
bit chopping on a smooth as the iphone
but still is a very nice alternative so
we'll go back home here maps she brings
obviously not functional because again
an emulator but here you would have
access to full google maps as well as
street view which is something unique to
the g1 right now so if we hit that
little arrow pulls up all the different
features and functions at it has it's
got an alarm clock for example which you
can set open its back up here the
browser again it's got a calculator not
functional but it is a simple calculator
your calendar the calendar looks like
again not functional this will all be
functional of course on your actual
device camera this is what you see when
you want to take a picture go back
contacts we saw dialer we saw email we
saw now one interesting thing about
android is that it syncs all your gmail
applications there's no way to sync it
from a computer to your device has to be
all done through google's proprietary
gmail services so here's what email will
look like on there there's a built-in i
am application with obviously google
talk windows live messenger yahoo
messenger and am this all comes standard
the maps we saw android marketplace is
similar to the App Store on the iPhone
you might be able to view and browse a
variety of applications without any
filtering from google themselves anybody
the rights to application can really
have it up here so you run the problem
of possibly getting some malicious apps
but also developers have a lot of
freedom to create applications music
artists albums playlist pretty simple
you can see what it would look like go
back albums what the album's would look
like there was albums are they invisible
right here playlist playlist like you're
used to let's go back to the home screen
here there are a few more things to show
you this menu button right here if you
click pulls up a five tabs menu across
the bottom you can add a contact or at
an application or shortcut folder
bookmark contact gmail labels really
where you go to add anything it so you
can add widgets to the home screen for
clocks picture frames add wallpapers and
you just browse through the pictures to
where they were let's go back to the
menu so you saw wallpaper you can pick a
wallpaper again there's a separate
button for that in the menu bar can
search just pulls up the google search
bar that you can scroll to with your
finger notifications tells you to have
any notifications if you have new emails
from voicemails and such let's go back I
can move that right up which is kind of
neat it's with your finger you can flick
that right up and go to settings and you
can see all your different settings here
of your wireless controls you know your
Wi-Fi settings Bluetooth Bluetooth
settings airplane mode mobile networks
you can set for streaming networks and
apns call settings voicemail call
forwarding operator selection all the
things you'd expect that a mobile device
sound and display ringtones volume
ringers audible touched homes brightness
screen timeout and alike data
synchronization
you choose what you wanted to sink again
it does it with Google's proprietary
system right now I assume a desktop
sinking client will be coming security
and location manager applications your
sdcard date and time text and about the
phone go back to the home screen here
with your finger you can slide that
across and you go right back to your
home screen here this had just been a
very quick demonstration of Google's g1
and the partnership with t-mobile I hope
you guys have enjoyed a very quick
walkthrough and get a sense of what you
will expect when the g1 officially
launches later on this month personally
I'm going to withdraw or withhold my
opinions until I get a chance to see the
actual device I am very impressed with
got brain system so far but it does seem
very 1 point 0 to me but I like to see
what it looks like when device is
actually in hand so guys this is jon
rettinger with john for lakers with a
real quick overview for you of the
t-mobile g1 talk to you guys soon bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
