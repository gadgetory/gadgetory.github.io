the episode of asta buffaloes the show
where I put my butt on this your couch
and answer your questions on whatever
you got going on from will to tech
there's a lot of new stuff that just
came out or just coming out so we're
going to talk a lot of mobile let's jump
right to the questions first one comes
from at time warp 2 303 at John for
lakers you think Microsoft is any
advantage left in the smartphone game
hashtag s to be the answer is yes I
definitely do the rumored leaks of the
Lumia 615 and 650 XL look pretty badass
but I think Microsoft's ace in the hole
is Windows 10 having both platforms used
the same app store and also be built on
the same infrastructure is huge there's
a lot of Windows users already out there
and I think the Windows Phone platform
the big issue was app support I think
that will very soon be mitigated when
this one is a really robust to great OS
but it never got the attention I think
it deserves just based on on app support
certainly the market penetration have
already Android and iOS so I do think
that Microsoft definitely has a few
bullets left in their proverbial gun so
to speak next question comes from at f1
Mercedes wo 3 ass hey at john for lakers
to use a case on your personal
smartphone a good question i am usually
not a case guy view gel√©e just I like my
phones with the way I sleep totally
naked just not really but I usually
don't use cases right now I'm testing
the iphone 6s plus and I did put a case
on it and I'm really glad I did because
I dropped it now my case has a giant
gash on the side the phone underneath is
totally pristine so i probably will be a
case guy from from here on out just
because I'm clumsy I got a two-year-old
at home with always grabbing and things
in my hands and then just throwing them
so yeah I think I'll err on the side of
caution now or maybe I didn't before
threw caution to the next one comes from
ads texts asked at John for lakers how
often do you change devices a good
question personally whenever I'm not
testing a device which is not that often
usually I'll change of Isis once a month
or so you'd go back and forth between
iOS and Android but when I am testing
usually it's a new phone ever
week I generally try and spend at least
five to seven days how about the new
phone as my daily driver to get to know
how to use it also I'm switching phones
very quickly I've got it down to a
science now switching from android to
android usually i can switch completely
have everything over and working in like
15 minutes i can transfer everything
over and syrup have it all done you guys
don't know how i do it i can make a
video showing how i tranfer phone the
sort of learn through trial and error
which work best for me so maybe if you
wouldn't want to know we're looking to
make switching Android device easier
leave a comment down below and I'll up
yup and the last question comes from our
friend Kristin Singh who asked at John
for lakers do you think three touch will
change the mobile industry honestly I've
forgotten most of the time that my phone
has 3d touch or force touch I think it's
going to rely on the hands of developers
if there are apps that come out that
only you can take advantage of force
touch 3d touch then yes I do peasant
stands right now it seems for like a
nice add-on that's not necessary these
in the way that the current iphone 6s
and 6s plus exists it's nice but it's by
no means a necessity and I should say it
working on a review of these phones i
want use it for a few more days before i
put out the final review of apple's new
phones look for it very soon I don't
think you guys for watching hope you
enjoy the episode of ask the Buffalo be
nice to each other in the comments they
love making videos isn't my favorite
sort of way to talk to you guys and you
guys talk to me so please keep the
questions coming until next time jon
rettinger from technobuffalo see you
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
