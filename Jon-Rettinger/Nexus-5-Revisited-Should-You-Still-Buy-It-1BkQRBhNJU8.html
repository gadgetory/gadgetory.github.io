to you by lynda.com what's up everybody
John retina from TechnoBuffalo here you
do a series years ago where I'd revisit
old devices and months later see how
things change out my opinions on the
device changed thought I'd bring that
back with the Nexus 5 actually been
using this with my daily driver up until
last Friday for the better part of a
month and my opinion on it and
everything I thought about it initially
I think has changed a little bit so
let's go ahead and revisit the Nexus 5
so working at TechnoBuffalo I've got the
distinct privilege to be able to check
out any phone that I want and using your
phone I want while I'm testing I don't
get the opportunity all that often sort
of beaten between testing phones just
review use the device just because I
want to use it and I really started the
side that I wanted that pure Android
experience again I just finished testing
they all gg3 we'd had the galaxy s5
before that HTC One m8 I think the iOS
got a little bit stale nothing really
new from Apple coming out for a while
and I want to just pure unadulterated
Android experience so I thought I would
go back and try the Nexus 5 and I gotta
say I've been really impressed with it
now this phone came out back in October
so buy my mat it's like nine and a half
ten months old which my phone times Y
already be like well this thing's a
dinosaur it's antiquated who would buy a
Nexus 5 right now but I'm gonna sort of
challenge it this is still I think one
of the best phones available so there's
been like ten months ministry fresh you
real quickly on the specs it's got a
four point nine five inch screen it's
about five inches 1920 by 1080
Snapdragon 800 two gigs of RAM on board
in megapixel camera on the back the
price thing that was pretty sweet
16 gig is gonna be 349 or 32 was going
to be $399 alright so things I like
about the phone and I wish more phones
had this I loved wireless charging I
know that you can buy
she adapters for all kinds of phones but
I love that it was built in and gives
you wireless charging I've got a charger
at my desk wanted homie just throw it on
there and forget about it
I never charged my devices at work
usually I do every night at home but
this one I just sort of sat on there and
let it charged I never ever had to worry
about battery life so that was cool that
Google included that also I realized
that I you need like Android the way
Google intended now this is the way the
phone ships take it all all the stuff I
know you can route it
put on custom roms and you can do
different launchers all that's up with a
ton of different phones I get that I
know that but out of the box experience
I love that this is pure unadulterated
Google I absolutely adore the Google now
launcher actually put it on my other
Android devices that like you can swipe
over to the left and see Google now
right there which is really fun I'm
using way more than I thought for sports
scores for weather for Direction tonic
it's like me to get home Google now is
getting more and more useful to me also
I think the 5-inch screen size is really
perfect I like bigger phones I've always
said that I'm excited about a larger
iPhone and when I stopped using this
actually I started using the oneplus one
which sounds weird to say it's a I'm
using the 2 which has a 5.5 inch screen
but I think the 5 inches is really a
sweet spot the phone feels really really
good so despite being now almost a year
old it's still pretty powerful I never
once had any slowed I never had any lag
everything I threw at it worked
perfectly
everything was smooth phone just worked
well it's kind of making the analogy
something guys the office it's like the
Acura of phones might not look at it
dick
wow that thing's absolutely gorgeous but
just does everything really well every
part of it just works and works well
together with one exception and it's
sort of been one that's a lot of people
talked about the camera
Google's tried to make it better but can
only put so much lipstick on a pig
before I realized and sober up that it's
still just a pig a megapixel camera
should be fine the pictures are just
still not good I'm not saying by not
good by that cameraphone standards I've
gotten way way way better you can
supposed to Instagram Twitter Facebook
and I still like absolutely fine but
you're not gonna want to use these
pictures of blow up and put photos on a
wall things get totally blown out in a
lot of light situations and low light
don't even think about it think it's
like really really grainy out-of-focus
is not very quick that's my one and main
complaint the phone oh that's a thing is
absolutely incredible you stop for one

lynda.com slash TechnoBuffalo that's ly
NDA comstock TechnoBuffalo back to the
video she's built really solid too
I don't generally have cases on my
phones I've been pretty lucky in that
break one I was walking with just normal
walking height and I dropped this thing
screen down and I didn't get that
sinking feeling like happened in slow
motion just like and I picked it up and
I was for sure thought the screen is
gonna be cracked and it wasn't it looks
fine there's not even a dent on it so
that was super duper happy about that
build quality seems to be really really
solid on the phone so hats off to LG for
that I do still wish that it had
removable storage which I could have
popped an SD card in there the biggest
you can get is 32 gigs and that's just
not that much storage to consider you
know maybe 26 or so actually accessible
to you I feel a lot of pictures andnot
sorting the cloud that can go very very
fast but for the price it is a still a
bargain I know this exists in a world
now at the oneplus one you know for same
price actually a little bit less yet 64
gigs and then the option to put an
expandable storage is still a great deal
but this phone on its own I just really
liked it it's something about using pure
Android as Google intended that I really
like so I'm saying this if you look to
get a new phone you want to get a new
phone on north to get you don't spend a
lot of money maybe you can't get an
invite for the oneplus one look at the
Nexus 5 again this is a really good
phone this is a year later I happily use
this phone I could pick any phone that I
want to try and I'd love love the Nexus
5 I'm a guy who just loves phones like
I'm still I can't believe that I have
the chance to pick these phones for a
guy who has a passion the love for
phones this is the one that I picked up
I think that should say something if
you're looking to get a new phone you
already have a Nexus 5 and you're
thinking about Nexus 6 is gonna be or
looking at what ever an HTC or Samsung
the next iPhone be really happy with
what's in your pocket this is a great
device great price running an incredible
operating system that really smashes all
the priests misconceptions I think about
Android you had it like the cupcake and
donut versions at slow and laggy which
it was at the time that so what a lot of
people think and so haven't picked up
Android device since then
blade the Nexus 5 give it a shot it
could be really impressed how far
Android has come it is an incredible
operating system on great hardware
I think LG actually nailed it there's a
few exceptions so what'd you guys think
my off my way off you like the series
you want us to bring it back you know we
did it about two years ago I really want
to hear your thoughts on a leaf in the
comments down below we just didn't talk
