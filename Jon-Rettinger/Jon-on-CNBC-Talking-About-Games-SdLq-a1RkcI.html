this evening and we're looking at here
to find out which company is going to
benefit from the holiday season Don
rettinger editor-in-chief of
TechnoBuffalo is here to tell us what do
you reckon John well thank you for for
having me video games like any other
industry go through trends and this year
we have three big trends the first one
for better or worse is violence the
second one is motion controls and third
we have sequels all three consoles are
bringing pretty big exclusive titles as
Sony is probably bringing the biggest
guns with God of War 3 the
much-anticipated gran turismo 5 which we
saw previewed last year at CES and the
new game called Fight Night Lights out
which uses their new motion controlling
system to actually do some real fighting
you put a controller in one hand the
control on the other and as you punched
actually recognizes your movement by
using what's called the PlayStation Move
Xbox is bringing sort of their big gun
as well with Halo Reach which came out
just a few months ago gamers were really
really really excited about the upcoming
Gears of War that's been pushed back
until 2011 unfortunately and if violence
isn't your thing don't forget about
Nintendo they are bringing more of a
kid-friendly party games to the table
with the game called epic mickey which
actually get a play the famed a Disney
character Mickey Mouse Donkey Kong is
making a return with donkey kong country
and we party and there are some great
sort of cross platform games like black
ops 2 call a new call of duty game rock
band 3 and Assassin's Creed Wow it
silences they may wish quit Mickey
admitted a ring and just let them fight
it out this really quick in terms of the
actual companies themselves sounds like
everybody's got an offering for this
holiday season what do you think is
going to be the most popular which
company is going to win out you know
Microsoft is really has a huge gun so to
speak in their holster with the Halo
series those are some of the largest
selling video games in history Sony is
really bringing it together as well
companies like blizzard are always
tremendous with their new starcraft 2
platform and of course there's the world
of warcraft which it just generates
money left
right it sure does i get John thank you
very much for joining us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
