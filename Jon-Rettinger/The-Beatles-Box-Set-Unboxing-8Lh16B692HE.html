TechnoBuffalo here with a non techie
unboxing for you this is the Beatles box
set all 13 of their studio albums
digitally remastered in stereo I talked
a lot about this on Twitter you guys
helped me decide whether or not to get
the physical discs or just go iTunes so
I thought I'd have some fun and unbox it
for you let's go ahead and get started
alright so this is going to run you
about a hundred and twenty nine dollars
and that's versus about 150 it's going
to cost from iTunes this way you get the
physical media you get the box you get
sort of the inserts and the extras but
you are going to have to import the
discs ourselves so we will go ahead and
use big ol knife for this and go ahead
and dig in you know I had other albums
and I had some of their songs but I
didn't have them all and I really kind
of always wanted the collection and with
the release on iTunes to start going
through and playing all the songs and
listening to those previous they have I
remembered how much I loved the Beatles
so I thought it would be fun to go ahead
and actually have the entire box set
sort of has everything are remastered
some of the stuff I had wasn't in stereo
was from very old copies I thought it'd
be nice to sort of have the legitimate
discs let's go ahead and open this thing
up just a a turn receipt pull out the
box it's pretty heavy actually I'm much
heavier I thought it was a mini it looks
like we have a yet another box to get
through with some zebra security tape go
ahead and slice that still looking for a
good name too for the big knife here but
until I set one more time and if you
don't want to go the iTunes route again
you will save about 30 bucks and you
will have the physical media to have in
case you want people borrow them or
whatever so there is the Beatles let's
go ahead and dump this out it's a much
heavier than I expected but I guess for
13 albums that would make sense of
course it has the Apple on there that
the original Apple
Apple Records not Apple computers
beetles beetles on the side deals on the
side and some information on the back
the original studio recordings 217 songs
remastered for superior sound deluxe
packaging and a bonus video so this set
contains sort of all of their 13 albums
and along with some of the past masters
and mini documentary DVDs kinda neat
go ahead and cut this plastic out
cutting the box these try to well I've
gotten sort of hacky with my nice
recently I keep cutting all the boxes
I'm trying to open so I'll try and be
extra careful to not do that here and it
looks like I may have succeeded in not
slicing the box or my finger bed and
peel off all the plastic there we go
just push all that aside okay let's
slide this out see what this is going to
look like if you want to buy this from
Best Buy sort of other our retailer is
gonna cost much more upwards of $200
from a lot of places some places had it
on sale for 170 but Amazon really has
the best deal running it's hard to get
out than I thought it was gonna be when
just shim down if I can out slicing this
it's very nice packaging but packing
gently so good if you can actually get
to the products inside go and see if we
can rip this thing open and I say rip
metaphorically come on
alright took a decent amount of work we
got that sleeve off it looked exactly
the same underneath as it did on the top
then pull that back and here are all the
album's it look likes looks like and
they are just kind of a stack so a
magical mystery tour is the white album
yellow submarine so everything is just
here in the individual CD is kind of
nice and there's a looks like there's a
big one here as well let's see what this
one is oh that was the white album go
ahead and push those back let's take a
look at what else we're going to have
looks like it's just a lot of disks
probably some of the remastered stuff
here you can see all of the the albums
here hard day's night the Beatles or so
on sort of some of the stuff that maybe
you haven't heard in a while so I'm
really looking forward to checking out
so this is an unboxing of the Beatles
box set not so tech related but I was
talking about it a bit on Twitter and
you guys really helped me to go that
physical media route and our guys I'm
John Rangers and TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see you in the next video bye bye hey
guys so I wanted to clarify a few things
in the box that I want to show you what
you get in the actual disc pack you can
see the difference in the physical media
and just a digital so there's a lot of
information here to get some pictures so
here's a hard day's night album for
example you get a lot of original
artwork some photographs that were taken
during the studio sessions so
information about that album particular
when it was recorded some quotes from
the band and just a lot of information I
don't know how often you're gonna
actually look at these but certainly as
I'm importing the CDs it's nice to sort
of thumb through and have something
physical to look at put it right back in
and every disc sort of follows the same
format you get a picture you get the
book then you have the disc inserted
inside and this is actually not the
white album this is just the Beatles and
I guys hope you enjoyed and I'll see you
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
