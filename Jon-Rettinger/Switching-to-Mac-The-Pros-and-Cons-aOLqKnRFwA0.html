all for the well wishes I am feeling
much better now I get a lot of email
from you know viewers in general and
people who check out the website telling
me how excited they are to get to new
mac or they're saving for the new mac or
they're folks are getting them the new
mac or something so i thought i'd put a
question out there to you guys and find
out why you switched why'd you guys
decide to go from Windows to Mac or
Linux Mac or whatever you were using
before to back why'd you switch and
froze you that haven't switched yet why
do you want to switch and for those of
you that don't want to switch that want
to stick with your windows or Linux
machines why do you want to stick with
them what it is about what is it about
windows that you guys that you like so
much that it's going to make you not
want to change so the money thing you
don't want to buy a new computer is it
you like the applications on Windows you
like the operating system as it as a
whole yeah I'm just kind of curious you
know have some discussion your guys and
keep everything civil and friendly make
a video response if you like leave some
in the comments but you know let me know
why you and let everybody here know why
you switch to mac or why you won't
switch to mac so am I guess that's it
just a general video more of a question
haven't really done many of these before
but I think it'd be interesting to see
see what you guys say anyway I'll give
you guys my reason the reason i switched
i've been using i had been using windows
my whole life and I'm sure like a lot of
you i was getting fires had a virus my
computer after a year and a half just
got so slow and it got bogged down i was
using all the Norton stuff to prevent
viruses I firewalls I was scanning it
all the time I just got to be in you
almost unusable and after year and a
half it should have been the case so I
went into the apple store I checked out
some of the computers that they had
there at the time i went to a buddy's
house throughout a mac and it seemed
really nice and user friendly and i was
i thought i had essentially mastered
windows and i thought it could be kind
of cool to learn something new and so i
decided to make the switch and I'm very
very very happy that I did I haven't
looked back once i love i love my mac i
love OS 10
and the i guess the eloquence of its
design it's just done very well and you
know not to say that windows is bad it's
not what I'm saying just saying I think
for me and for what I use a computer for
the Mac was a way to go so guys let me
know what you think and don't forget to
check out the website at wwu Lakers calm
and we are always looking for some new
writer so send me an email if you're
interested with a sample post and will
you know get back to you anyway guys
hope having a good day night the
afternoon wherever in the world you guys
are and talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
