sponsoring this video it's been almost
exactly two months since the iPhone 10
came out and drinking that time I'm
using it on and off as my daily driver
at least one of the two phones that I'm
carrying and my opinions and thoughts on
the device have changed a little bit
since my initial review so I figured
let's revisit the iPhone 10
so the big thing for me in my review I
said I was gonna go case free I was
gonna stop for Apple care and if I broke
it or drop it I was gonna bite the
bullet pay the fee and fix it and then I
dropped my phone without a case on the
carpet and I got a little bit scared so
I did put a case on my phone it's just
the Apple silicon case in black I still
wish I could not have a case on it but I
am way too paranoid and I got too many
kids in my house to do it I love the way
their phone feels but it's certainly
fragile when it dropped even on carpet
the sides still ended up getting a
little bit scratched that was a bit of a
bummer the phone is not appear to be as
durable as Apple is saying they're
claiming it's the strongest glass ever
on a phone but there is no way I am
going to test that one of the things
about the device that seems to have
gotten worse over time it's ever great
to begin with what's battery life in
fact in the office here we have seven
different iPhones and for the people up
to the experience the same thing battery
life is not great on the iPhone 10 I
don't know I don't want to pile on
apples batteries just for going on right
now but it seems that it's worse than
when I initially start testing the
device generally my usage on any iPhone
or any thought I can get through a full
day without any problem with my iPhone
10 generally I'm at 20% or lower by end
of the day and sometimes I have to plan
on charging to get through it I'm not
even doing crazy usage the battery life
has not been outstanding
with the iPhone 10 I've also noticed
some fit and finishes use with the
iPhone this might be unique to mine what
am i screws on the bottom for example
isn't fully screwed and it's kind of
rough when I touch it something I've
never experienced any other Apple
devices so maybe it's small issue at the
iPhone 10 maybe it's just mine but
little things like that certainly you
notice as you use the phone more and
more well if I launched I had two big
concerns the first was that not being
really annoying in fact I don't notice
it anymore at all I was a bit of
annoying when I first started watching
full screen video when I first are
testing the device the more I use it
honestly I don't notice it at all I
don't think you will either that
something that's holding you back from
buying the iPhone I wouldn't worry about
it and then face ID so we did a lot of
tests on it and faced ideas works pretty
well actually it's worked pretty well in
almost all situations for me my wife has
thick sunglasses and she has an iPhone
10
it won't work through her sunglasses so
it works as advertised for a lot of
people but I wish there are some
redundancies look at what Samsung has
with their galaxy line got iris scanning
got face scanning you got a fingerprint
sensor I wish there was something like
that that worked have different options
and layers to sort of make your phone
unlock and it's a mind-boggling skid if
you're wearing an Apple watch it won't
automatically let you know your phone is
safe to be unlocked until has to see
your face or even something other things
that Android has if you're on a Wi-Fi
network that you label that secure it'll
unlock or if you want to use geolocation
when a particular area phone should
unlock I wish those things were baked in
to iOS to give you some sort of
redundancy to unlock your phone if
you're laying in bed on the side for
example it's not going to see your face
it's not a giant issue and face ideas
work as well as I could have expected
but I'd like to have some sort of other
option at least a face ID wasn't working
a particular situation one opinion that
hasn't changed is the camera the rear
cameras on these things are absolute
incredible portrait mode is great
portrait lighting has actually improved
since my initial testing it's still not
great but the camera itself the pictures
look incredible in any situation whether
it's low-light whether it's normal light
whether it's almost in the dark the
pictures here look absolutely beautiful
one thing that was surprising to me when
I bought the phone I thought I needed
the bigger store now I figured I have a
giant photo library it's like 16 gigs or
something but for the first time in a
while I set my iPhone 10 out from
scratch and apples got a lot of new file
systems here new file management
pictures are stored in the cloud with
this new phone setup from scratch I am
using less than 20 gigs of storage
they're looking to maybe save some money
from already a really expensive phone I
think the smaller storage opt is gonna
be fine for a lot of people if you're
worried about storage on your previous
device try setting it up from scratch
might be really surprised how much space
do you actually have on your phone
this next one's kind of weird I love
wireless charging up and hoping wireless
charging was gonna come to Apple for a
while and assume you guys don't care
about it but for me it's a convenience
that I really like about the phone
Apple's got an issue with the wireless
charging whenever I wirelessly charged
my phone at night I turn it off so I put
it on the charger let it start charging
and then without moving it I'll turn the
phone off and usually almost everything
there any other phone I've tested will
charge overnight I'll take it off I'll
turn it on and it's fully juiced up the
iPhone will turn on at some point during
the night no matter what and it's not
just my phone happens to my wife's phone
as well we test it here in the office
we've tested with four different
wireless chargers and for some reason at
some points the phone will turn back on
which is really annoying I like to turn
my phone off and I take notifications
throughout the entire night I can
obviously put it into nighttime mode or
Do Not Disturb
but I've opted now just to plug my phone
in I'll even use wireless charging so
for me that's been a bummer I don't like
that my phone turns on at night it might
not matter for you but that's something
that's really been an issue at least
personally a lot of stuff was new at the
iPhone 10 when the big ones was gestures
and there was a definitely own learning
curve getting used to it
but now two months in I feel really used
to the new gestures and they feel like
second nature to me in fact I went back
he's an older iPhone and I felt weird
double tapping the home button so I kind
of gotten very used to it it's a really
elegant way to use the phone and to
navigate around it so if you're worried
about the gestures don't this video
wouldn't be possible without nuclear
this is where those product we've
actually been using a ton in the office
it's super helpful if using one of the
new MacBook or MacBook Pros and to add
seven extra ports including two USB a 2
USB seaports SD card reader and way more
it was important to use all the ports at
once and actually the color matches with
the Mac books and IMAX that support USB
type-c it's an awesome accessories
you've got one those laptops I
definitely pick one up if you want to
learn more link to it down below so
overall I've really enjoyed the iPhone
10 I loved a new screen I wish a battery
life lasted longer but minor quibbles
aside and certainly the gigantic price
point aside it's been a really good
phone it's really the best iPhone
Apple's ever made as you'd expect from
the most recent iPhone Apple has ever
made if your experience has changed
would you buy it when the phone came out
let us know down below you're holding
out from my going forever reason again
let us know and of course subscribe hit
that little
next to it so you notified when new
videos are coming up with a lot more
iPhone coverage coming up and more
versus videos coming hope you guys
enjoyed until next time i'm john r
