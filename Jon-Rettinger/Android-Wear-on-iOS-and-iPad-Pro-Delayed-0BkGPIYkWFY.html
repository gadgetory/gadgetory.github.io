to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hey what's going on guys the
mark and sanger from TechnoBuffalo and
in today's episode of rumor roundup
we're going to be talking about Android
wear on your iphones the oneplus one
successor and last but not least we're
going to talk about Apple's iPad pro
this is rumor roundup so let's get
started so the first one on our list is
the one plus two now we know one plus is
hard at work on a follow-up device to
the one and a new report is shedding
light on some of the devices more
important details Business Insider
reports that the one plus two is going
to be a much more premium phone than the
original one featuring a more
customizable build and some big hardware
surprises now if you remember the
oneplus one tried to push it style swap
feature on the one but due to
manufacturing issues it never happened
sources told Business Insider the style
swap will make a comeback when the
oneplus two hits giving the device some
fun customizability there are also
rumors that the one plus two is going to
be a bit more expensive than before
though it should still be cheaper than
the other off-contract Android devices
what do you guys think are you excited
for the oneplus 2 is the higher price
tag gonna sway you away from the device
let us know in a comment stone I don't
know about you guys but I really like
the Moto 360 Android wear as of now only
works for Android well at least that's
always been the rule but a new report
claims Google is almost ready to add
iPhone support to Android wear a french
site 01 neck claims Google is hard at
work on a version of its Android wear
app for iOS devices this update could
potentially be announced as soon as
Google i/o in May just a month after the
Apple watch launches next month either
way this is going to be a big news for
any iPhone fans interested in trying out
Android wear but what do you guys think
are you guys excited for Android wear on
iOS do you think it's going to happen or
are you more excited for the Apple watch
let us know if you've been waiting for
that rumored iPad pro you may have to
wait several more months until you can
get your hands on it according to
sources talking to Bloomberg Apple is
massively delayed a larger 12.9 inch
iPad pro pushing production back until
September at the earliest there are
rumors we're going to hear about the
ipad pro at apple's event on march 9th
but sources claim apple ran into some
supply issues for the larger display
panels now if you were anticipating the
ipad pro you'll have to wait much longer
than we initially thought which
definitely disappointing so what are
your thoughts are you upset that we
won't be seeing apple's ipad pro anytime
soon are you thinking of picking one up
when it comes out let us know in the
comments down below and if you like this
video give it a thumbs up make sure to

I'm marking sanger from TechnoBuffalo
