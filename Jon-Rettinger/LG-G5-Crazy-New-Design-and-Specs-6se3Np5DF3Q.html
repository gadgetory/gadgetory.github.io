really really quickly we've heard a lot
of rumors specifically today concerning
a handful of different things about the
device f leaks actually posting on
VentureBeat way last month at the end of
december so some of that was conflicting
with some of what we saw today or at
least this week the week of the
seventeenth eighteenth of january you
know we're getting close to Mobile World
Congress and there's a lot that's
starting to come out of the work where
would work so let's get into it so the
g5 like I said we've seen some
conflicting reports about the size of
the screen some folks are saying is
going to be bigger some folks are saying
it's going to be smaller we're not
seeing conflicting reports on is the
resolution of 1440 x 2560 that we're
pretty sure it's going to remain the
same as it sits right now the other
important thing that you're going to
want to know about though is that the g5
is supposedly going to have that cute
little tiny display at the v10 had
thought it was super cool thought it
seemed super useful wasn't sure about
the placement but I'm excited to see
what the implementation looks like this
year the g5 should be running
marshmallow have 32 gigs of on-board
storage three gigs of ram a Snapdragon
820 yeah an 820 and good old US v see
the back of the device supposedly sports
a 135-degree dual lens wide angle camera
that seems like overkill to me but
underneath that camera you're gonna find
a fingerprint reader now that should
come as a surprise to those of you who
know what the G line looks like from LG
because that's usually where LG puts
their buttons volume rocker and power
buttons well looks like this is going to
be a pretty big departure for them they
need to make room for some new biometric
hardware and that's totally fine by me
i'm kind of ambivalent about the
placement of those buttons anyway
unfortunately it does look like the
battery's going to take a little bit of
a dip we're going to twenty eight
hundred million powers away from last
year's three thousand milliamp hours
though bear in mind we are dealing with
some slightly less power-hungry
processors some less power-hungry
components in general so it really
shouldn't be all that big of a deal
there's also no microSD card slot for
any expanded Billy but what you are
going to get is a magic slot and magic
is way better than regular technology
anyway isn't it supposedly the g5 is
going to sport this slot that's going to
treat it almost like
a slightly modular phone it's not going
to be modular in the traditional sense
but you should be able to stick things
in like an audio amplifier or a 360
camera for 360 recording things like
that or since you're missing a little
bit of battery you can stick in an
external battery in there or I guess in
this case internal I mean it was
external and you put it in the slot B
comes into yeah internal you can stick a
battery in there to extend the battery
life of the device between magic slot
and bringing that tiny little display
from the v10 this year to the rest of
their flagship line for 2016 this might
be a big year for LG they might be able
to actually shake up what a lot of other
manufacturers are doing and I'm excited
to see that from them because I was I
thought they were doing here really good
job and then the g4 came out and I was
really disappointed and then the v10
seemed like the perfect experimental
device and and it looks like they're
starting to bring a lot more of their
sort of moon shots to their flagship
devices I'm very excited to see where
this takes algae in 2016 anyway you can
check out all that info and more on the
site keep it right here for news on the
g5 and whatever other tech stuff you're
into let me know what you guys think
about the g5 in the v10 and even the g4
was it even worth your time or money or
attention in 2015 let me know over on
Twitter at mark beam will have a quick
little chat little powwow about it thank
you guys so much for watching be kind of
one another and I'll catching the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
