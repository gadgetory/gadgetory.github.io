technobuffalo here and i have crazy hair
I didn't plan on showing my face hole on
camera today but his whole stuff about
Sony network user information being
hacked I felt like I had to talk to you
guys and at least let you know what is
going on if you are a playstation
network user and you haven't been online
all day you need to launch this video I
am getting this information from
TechnoBuffalo via the PlayStation Blog
the playstation network has been down
since the middle of last week you can
sort of read along with me the result of
the outage as users were being notified
on saturday was a rebuild the network
security in the light of an unwanted
external intrusion so you figured that
okay maybe people are trying to hack
sony i wouldn't necessarily think that
they were getting in now sony is sort of
come forth and given the honest answer
to what's been going on you got to
figure if they didn't come out and say
it this is going to come out anyway so
according to sony and this is an exact
quote i am reading threat here we
believe that an unauthorized person has
obtained the following information that
you provided name address so including
your city state and zip country email
birth date playstation network /
curiosity password and login and handle
PSN online ID it's also possible at your
profile data including purchase history
billing address city state and zip and
your PlayStation Network curiosity
password security answers may have been
obtained if you have an authorized sub
account for your dependent the same data
which respects your dependent may have
been obtained so if you're a parent and
you've acts put your kids on your
account their information is also going
to be in there and concerning credit
card data sony has a few more gems for
you while there is no evidence at this
time that any credit card data was taken
we can't rule out the possibility if you
provided your credit card data through
the playstation network or curiosity and
curiosity is there online music and
content network out of an abundance of
caution we're advising that your credit
card number excluding security code and
expiration date may have been obtained
so that's pretty
sony sang well maybe we took your stuff
or maybe somebody got your stuff we're
not sure sorry head tilt um so they
should be finished with their work on
the PSN network and have it online
within the week the lack of being able
to game online on your playstation 3 is
so minor compared to the bigger problem
here for those that have lost a personal
information or may be subject to
identity theft and credit-card fraud the
news is that the PSN will be up by which
conclusion is likely less than warming
so that is very true it's advice early
go in and do whatever password changing
you can if you can't go in and change
your Sony password you use that same
password for another system so if your
email address or YouTube whatever it
might be change all the passwords you
can even though not associated with Sony
that's just a good rule of thumb hacking
unfortunately as a reality of digital
world but what you can do is take the
best precautions to prevent your
information from falling into the wrong
hands and ultimately we end up trusting
companies like Sony Amazon Apple
Microsoft remember it might be they give
you information to keep that stuff
secure and occasionally it does get out
especially in giant huge ways like it
has right now so were you guys affected
by this where you're not affected I
certainly was affected I've got a ps3
and I use the PSN and I'm super happy
that all my information is out there
what do you guys think sort of want to
hear your thoughts quite upset about
that especially for people and monitor
their credit very closely and those
don't wanna their credit very closely if
you're going to ruin your own credit you
want to be the one that ruined your
credit you don't want someone else to do
it for you want to hear just your
general thoughts on this guy's i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo I'll see in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
