to you by audible what's going on guys
I'm m√§rklin saggin from TechnoBuffalo
and today we have this bad boy right
here the LG G watch and we're here to
show you what Android wear is all about
and how it can compete with other
smartwatches in a market right now so
let's get on with the video Android
where's google is the wearable platform
that sort of acts like a companion to
your Android smartphone heating you
notifications and other important
information that you can view at a
glance on devices like the G watch it
conveniently serves as a second screen
for your smartphone funneling simple
smartphones has straight to your wrist
stuff like reading and coming text
sending an email setting a reminder
checking on traffic or the forecast and
many many more you do however need to be
running Android 4.3 and hired a pair of
your Android phone so you better get
those updates rolling probably Android
wear as biggest features the ability to
respond texts emails and messages with
just your voice along with deeper google
now integration which helps separating
it from competing devices using just
your voice you can say ok Google and as
simple questions like where's the
nearest post office you can also control
your music playback right from your
watch check your how many steps you've
taken check the weather and more without
ever having to take your phone out of
your pocket when you receive something
like a text message it'll show up right
on your wrist where you then have to
free Dan ignore it reply or even open it
directly on your phone it's really
simple and intuitive though it does take
some time getting used to as of now
Android wear also supports a handful of
apps like e 24 Evernote and lift just to
name a few with Evernote you can see
your to-do list in recent notes and AB
notes on the go Google actually has an
entire section on its App Store
dedicated to just Android wear and there
will surely be many more in the future
despite robust functionality Android
we're still missing a few pieces for
example when I asked Android wear what
song is this or what's playing just a
false to a web search let's take a quick
break from our Android wear video and
thank our friends at audible audible com
is a leading provider of downloadable
digital audiobooks and to have hundreds
of thousands of book to choose from
whether it's science fiction thrillers
drama comedy and more I just started the
golden finch by donna tartt not to
long ago and it's so good I'll listen to
it on my iphone when I'm driving home or
when I'm editing videos go to audible
podcast.com slash techno to get a free
audiobook download of your choice when
you sign up today and again that's
audible podcast.com slash techno to get
your free download today I also can't
get where to recommend a good place to
eat nearby these things are sure to come
soon whether from google or third-party
app or both right now these emissions
make where feel like it's still not
quite fully developed Google is
promising a lot with Android wear and
even though it's only just released
things are already looking bright the
current crop of smartwatches offer
plenty of functionality and are perfect
for feeding at a glance notifications
but will google now integration and the
ability to control experience with your
voice android wear has the potential to
blossom into a really powerful platform
if we can't wait to see how it evolves
in the next few months thank you guys
