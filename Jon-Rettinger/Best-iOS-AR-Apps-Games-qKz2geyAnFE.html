brand-new augmented reality framework
the creatively called AR kit and the
first app stick advantage is that new AR
kit tech are starting to filter out so
we play it with a ton you hear a
TechnoBuffalo to bring you eight that
are fun useful and kind of show off what
the tech can do so we tell you and I
think the top eight AR apps are all
rights let's start off with measure kits
it's a free app if ou you wanted to tape
measure and if you want to use it as
just an AR tape measure it works
actually really well if you want to
measure or anything you just use your
phone with your tape measure at home but
if you want to pay some money like $2.99
they're gonna supposedly unlock some
more features and because I don't want
you spending $2.99 of features that
don't work we tested those features so
it'll do things like trajectory to tell
the distance of an object one of the
coolest things reason I wanted to try it
was it'll tell you how tall a person is
you can use it to measure to measure
person didn't work we're just kind of
kind of a bummer and I included on this
list I think it shows the potential of
AR actually replacing physical tools you
can measure things like cubes you can
use a level all those things worked but
the one I wanted to try again measuring
a dude or or lady didn't quite function
properly so I think for right now save
yourself the three bucks and its use it
as a tape measure and as technology gets
better and you want to be able to
measure a person then go ahead and in
the box
alright coming in at number two this
one's existed in various AR formats for
a while but now it got super legit it's
not just for delicious meatballs anymore
and Swedish Fish IKEA IKEA is in the
game with a really awesome AR app called
IKEA place it actually lets you put IKEA
furniture in the real world space it was
really cool to see if we wanted to buy a
couch for a set look envision what are
we going to look like here we want to
sort of add chairs to different other
sets we've got in the studio it's really
cool and I picked it not only excited
thought it was really useful but it
shows a legitimate use of technology
that can actually help technology not
just for tech sake it's you go to an
IKEA Story one and you know something's
going to look in your home you had to
buy it you had to either carry at home
and then build it and see how it looks
get it delivered now you can actually
see it and be like oof
I got bad taste or your wife can entire
box the orange couch idea which has
happened but now I wouldn't have had a
have a couch delivered in that area
I took games a ours pretty pretty fun
for games as Pokemon go taught us this
one is appropriately called stack AR if
you've played the stack game it's it's
the AR version of that it's free so you
can now stack things in the AR you can
sacks up on a desk you'd stack stuff on
Bertos head you can stack stuff on your
friend's head it's EXIF on on whatever
you want it's a really fun game game was
fun and fine without AR but it's there
and you can you try it are so next one I
think might be the coolest this is world
brush and so on a very like high level
you can take different kinds of brushes
and you could paint in a real world and
then after you're done drawing and
painting your Matisse inspired
masterpiece you can use your spoon
around and actually view it in 3d it's
really cool to see the app is also gonna
serve tag stuff a GPS so if someone
comes back to they can see what you drew
other people because the Internet's a
really friendly place can definitely
like your artwork if you choose to let
them do so they can like it they can not
like it that you comment on it you know
you look at sort of what things look
like in the real world you had to draw
it out on a flat surface or a model out
it's for a CAD program but now you're
gonna shoot your finger and a phone this
and this best friends for life next app
is gonna cost you that's 209 called sky
guide AR and it gives you a guide to the
sky obviously you hold your phone up
it'll show you the constellations as
things are happening it's a really cool
way to sort of see the sky above you and
know what's there if you're wondering
what that blinking light is it'll tell
you it's a plane not a star you're gonna
have that really bright thing in the sky
is as a planet with the North Star this
will tell you it's only worth the money
if your amateur astronomer or you want
to be a mature astronomer or if you have
a four-year-old who's fascinated with
the Stars and why they are there then
you're gonna want to give this app a
shot again not three but it's not super
expensive I think it's worth a try
specially if you want to see what a Arc
because I know you love free the next
one is free this is hallo this is a
pretty simple concept brings a our
characters to like life on your desk or
ever you want it to be you can pick
superheroes my favorite was like the
super swaggy spider-man and you can sort
of interact with them you can put
yourself in their it's again I keep
bringing my kids into this but to let my
kid have a conversation with spider-man
was it was pretty cool to see to go
wizards and other other characters you
might want it's not like so useful i
wouldn't pay for it but it's like a good
like 10-minute killer if you're like oh
man i got to wait for my wife to finish
shopping give it a download and get some
business ye spider-man so - good news
bad news on this next one the good news
it's free the bad news is gonna have to
get your butt up off the chair it's
called an AR runner and the name should
probably give it away it makes you move
and it makes you run it creates little
dots and a course that you want to set
out presumably outdoors got a lot of
space indoors you can run from
dot-to-dot and jump around and create
different obstacles it's a fun way to
get moving you're definitely gonna want
to look up from your phone turn right
into something like I did while I was
trying this it didn't get it look some
people do it outdoors because you're
literally running around like this
alright and last but definitely not
least this is $0.99 well-spent and if
you only pay money for one of the apps I
mentioned make it Atlas and it's not
like a like a Thomas guide come to life
it's an atlas of the human body so being
able to seed the nervous system the
endocrine system see a skull and move it
around they've got 3d renders and bodies
of anything that you would want to see
and learn it is awesome to see this and
probably the coolest use of AR today and
it probably doesn't need a are it could
be awesome you could have done this
without judgment the reality part of it
it's just really cool from a science
standpoint from a curious about the
human body standpoint it's a really cool
app I definitely recommend you give it a
shot
so before I end my top eight AR abs
video I want to thank our sponsors and
good people like Kingston and tell you a
little bit about the bolt and the bolt
is pretty cool it plugs into your
lightning port it's really small it's
not gonna create any sort of wiggle or
waggle you put it on a table it's gonna
sit flush
they'll been 3264
twenty eight gigabytes sizes it's going
to serve essentially as a backup for all
your photos or videos you can take
pictures or videos directly to the bolts
you can save space on your phone you can
backup certainly videos or pictures that
you want it's really customizable the
Volt is a really good way to go and I
think I must have accessory for almost
any iPhone regards whether or not you
need more storage let's do it down below
you want to check it out these are our
top eight air apps probably couldn't
make the list a lot longer because there
are a ton out there pick some that were
fun summer silly some that means you did
you get your butt up off the couch and
move but if we missed anything you think
we should try leave the comments down
below and let us know
I will try your AR apps are using a are
kid at all do you care did you even know
your phone could do it I want to know
your thoughts on it leave a comments
down below give the video a thumbs up
you always appreciate it until next time
