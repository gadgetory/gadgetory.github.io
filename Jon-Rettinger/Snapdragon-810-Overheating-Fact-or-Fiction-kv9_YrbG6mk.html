from TechnoBuffalo here as we continue
our test of the oneplus 2 I got a ton of
questions about the Snapdragon 810 if
the rumors of it overheating or the
processor getting really hot were true
so I figured what better way to do this
than to actually test not only a 10
processor with a 10 processor in
different phones and different
iterations as well as a ton of other
devices running different processors
with different screen sizes and made of
different materials so here is what we
did we took seven phones it sort of a
smattering of flag if we didn't use
every one but seven that I thought was
an example of all the devices so we use
the LG g4 powered by the Snapdragon 808
and that does have a 2560 by 1440
resolution the LG G flex 2 which uses a
Snapdragon 810 that's 1920 by 1080 we
brought in Samsung's Galaxy s6 using
their own XE note 7 series and that has
a 20 56 by 1440 resolution as well the
Nexus 6 sympathizes Snapdragon 805 and
also 2560 by 1440 the HTC One m9 using a
Snapdragon 810 has a 1080p screen the
iPhone 6 using Apple's a 8 which is 1344
by 750 then of course the 1 plus 2 which
is 1920 by 1080 using a tweaked version
of the Snapdragon 810 so a few caveats
keep in mind here obviously screen size
resolution build material are going to
depend how hot things are going to get
and obviously processor different
locations so we did 5 quadrants on each
phone the upper left corner the upper
right corner the bottom left corner at
the bottom right corner and the middle
we ran the same video in pairs there's a
9 minute video and as soon as that ended
we did keep tests and we did an average
score to get the average temperature
that that phone was running all phones
have screen brightness turned all the
way up volume turns all the way down and
we just let them play we had no apps
running on any phone except for YouTube
that was playing that one video without
further ado let me give you the results
of our tests before I do maybe pause the
video think to yourself what you think
the hottest phone is going to be we did
it here and none of us got it right if
you guys want to see the whole actual
test see how it ran just wait till the
end of the video and we'll put that
there so you can actually see for
yourself how all this ran so coming in
at number seven the hottest phone was
the metal Snapdragon 810 rock
an HTC One m9 with a temperature of
eighty nine point six number six was the
LG g4 the temperature of eighty eight
point eight number five the iPhone six
of temperature of eighty eight point two
number four the LG G flex 2 with a
Snapdragon 810 coming in at eighty five
point eight number three the Nexus 6
with a heat score of eighty five point
zero and the number two the oneplus two
84 degrees and the coolest phone out
there is the Samsung Galaxy S six at
eighty three point eight degrees
it seems the heat issue that people
thought was everything 810 doesn't seem
to be present perhaps the initial batch
of chips had some issue with them but it
seems the one that made it out to the
mass populous does not have any server
overheating issues so whatta guys think
of the test you want to see us do those
with more phones we'd love to hear your
thoughts on it are always working to
refine our processes so of course leave
comments down below we try to take this
as fair and impartial as possible so to
duck this test we have our laser
thermometer grip he does point and it'll
digitally tell you a temperature I
mentioned the intro we're gonna test
seven different phones with some varying
processors some the same as if there's
difference from phones to phones
obviously we didn't want to pick every
single flagship it just wants it
sampling some of the flagships out there
so let's start with LG's we've got the
g4 the Snapdragon 808 should mention
screen resolution is going to be
different on some of these so let's see
if that's can result in a higher test
you've got 2560 by 1440 on the g4 and
it's little brother the G flex 2 with
the Snapdragon 810 and a 1920 by 1080
screen no other apps are running here at
all we've got the brightness turned all
the way up and volume turned down just
so not only blob everybody here in the
office and I'll show you this one has
nothing else running as well that's it
so I'm going to go ahead and start play
the video we're going to play is an
almost exactly nine minute video that we
did that's why I switch carriers so
we'll go ahead and let these play and
we'll move in the next two when the
video is done at just about nine minutes
we'll do a temperature test on them so
push the
or to the side let's bring in our next
two which is going to be the galaxy s6
and the Nexus 6 so the Galaxy s6 is
running Samsung's Exynos processor at
the 7 Series and the Nexus 6 is running
a Snapdragon 805 both with 2560 by 1440
solo show nothing else is running the
background there which is the same on
this guy mr. everybody is aware that
it's a level playing field
I'll go ahead and hit play on each and
both almost exactly the same time we'll
push these two guys back in and we'll
bring out our next two we've got so next
we've got the HTC One m9 and the iPhone
6 the m9 is running a Snapdragon 810 in
1920 by 1080 the iPhone 6 is running
Apple's a 8 and that's 1334 by 750 let
me just show you again that's no other
apps running here on both phones so got
it see that one's a back full screen
there's the iPhone nothing else is
running save for you
go ahead and play on each and last but
definitely not least we've got the
oneplus 2 with a slightly tweaked
version the staff dragon 810 and in 1920
by 1080 screen go ahead and shrink this
and show you that indeed nothing else is
running on here as well except for
YouTube and that video again the 9
minute why switch carriers video push
play on that push this guy in frame
they're all facing the same direction
and we will let them play these to start
at same times the same ad so we're going
to let them run they'll end it exactly
the same time so at least it's time
release the same alright so we're going
to let all these play and when the 9
minutes are up we'll do our 5 quadrant
test and we'll check the number
yep all right we're testing in G for
upper left corner 94 right corner 89
turnarounds they're closed the
temperature bottom left 88 bottom right
89 middle 88 g flex upper left 88 right
88 bottom left you - bottom right 85
Middle East
okay let's go s6 upper left 86 upper
right b5 bottom left 82 bottom right 82

upper-left 87 up right 87 bottom-left 83
bottom right 83 middle 85 clearly tell
the processor is Nestor all right
