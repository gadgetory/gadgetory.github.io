to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of rettinger
rants i'm here with jon rettinger and if
you've watched before you know this to
show or i get irrationally mad about
things that are going on will the
technology up this week galaxy gear come
on samsung threatened judge grants run
get started
let me preface this video by saying I'd
like new technology like when companies
try things new I love when there's
taking a chance on something whether it
works or doesn't work I appreciate the
effort having said that galaxy gear it's
been rumored for quite a long time and I
had huge expectations of a watch it was
gonna do something that I didn't think I
needed on a watch I was equate these new
technologies to the iPad before the iPad
tablets were kind of clunky devices that
were kind of a novelty I never saw I
needed in the world for a tablet then
the iPad came around then I got it I get
why I would need that I was hoping that
a watch whether it's by Samsung Apple or
some other company would give me a
reason for why I want to wear a computer
on this year wrist so Galaxy gear was
announced and I was all what the hell so
first it only works with the galaxy note
3 know obviously other phones will be
supported down the road but seriously
one phone is like it's a companion
device it's not really a SmartWatch it's
more of a extension of your galaxy note
3 that happens to be on your wrist next
is the price $300 or something that's
only a companion device for the galaxy
note 3 come on if you want to buy a
galaxy note 3 presumably it's gonna be
two hundred or so bucks on contract that
another 300 on top of that for thing in
your wrist I would definitely give it a
pass on that third and the big one for
me is battery life 25 hours is really
not enough time what are you forget to
charge it or what if use it especially a
lot for that day in a drain battery life
even fast you got to be able to easily
get through a full 24-hour period
especially for a watch or peripheral
device and this thing just don't do it
so the galaxy gear essentially just does
what your phone already does it takes
pictures for it you can just go like
this and take a picture you can browse
all your photo galleries you can make
phone calls by going like this and I'm
sorry who is gonna make a phone call
like this you already look stupid enough
holding your 5.7 inch phone up your head
you're gonna make a call like this and
what's the point of buying a 300 ollar
phone if you're gonna make a call like
this that made that part of what the
hell are you doing samsung and doesn't
do anything that my phone doesn't do it
getting notifications that's fine i
can't really do much with it instead of
going like this or turning it on and
going like this i could just as easily
pull my phone out of my pocket and look
at it and say
$300 it just doesn't do anything new or
unique that my phone doesn't do it does
a crappier job of what my phone does
that's to me it sums up the Samsung
Galaxy gear does a worse job what my
phone already does so the big monkey in
the room here is that I haven't played
it myself yet Ashley was at IFA and
maybe I will be blown away and i will
come back on rutgers ransomed be like
Samsung I am so sorry ever dad as you
this year galaxy to use absolutely
awesome but until that my first
impressions are what seriously dude come
on am i way off base here am I getting
crotchety do is there some value to the
galaxy gear that I just don't see it I
really want to hear you guys thoughts on
this is maybe you could open my eyes and
be like John you missed the point it
does this crazy thing I understand those
fitness stuff and all that kind of other
business but as a companion only device
it just seems silly to me but maybe even
convinced leave them in the comments
