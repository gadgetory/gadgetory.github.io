tell you about hut hut calm is actually
started by two very close friends of
mine one arm in talak who is echo fish
on YouTube you may have seen me tweet
about this earlier in the day the site
is like i said earlier cut hut calm and
it is a URL shortener so all you do is
you go to cut up calm you put in your
URL you hit shorten and then you can
paste that on Twitter and anywhere you
want now right now what they have
planned isn't anything you know totally
revolutionary to shorten drew URLs but
since the new service it shortens i'm
using only one to two additional
characters which is kind of neat so you
can get your youtube page your Twitter
page to be cut calm / d1 something
pretty short like that so you can always
have a link to it but they did that mean
on their business plan I've seen what
they have coming out for what they're
calling phase two and actually is really
cool and I think it's going to probably
change the url clipping industry so I
want to let you guys know about it more
of it as a favor to Armand who by the
way is his turning a telling how old is
going to turn but today's actually his
birthday because it's after midnight on
May seventh in the UK so this is my
birthday present to Armand is actually
telling you guys about kayak com which
is actually a really cool website I've
been kind of watching them build it for
a while and a put a little bit of input
in but I really think it's a really
solid site so guys help support the
little guy yeah this is built just by
two friends kind of in their house you
know going up against some real big
fishes and they're trying to change the
industry so I'm sure you've been that
position we append the underdog going up
against you know the big boys soap
support cut hut you know use it for your
url trimming use it when you go into
Twitter you know really is a cool
service and you know give me some
feedback to either the feedback button
on the page and pointing to the scream
of you guys can't see that there's a
feedback button and since it's been
developed by just two people you know if
you have opinions on it they can
actually put that in and definitely stay
tuned for what they have coming up for
Phase two I also know they have some
giveaways coming up on their site as
well I think they've got a ton of codes
for iphone apps it's definitely a stay
tuned for that
so guys including to be sure to check
out cut huh calm and to Armand happy
birthday buddy I hope you have a good
one be sure to wish Armand a very very
happy birthday that's ease echo fish on
