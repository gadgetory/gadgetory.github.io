pad here and I ran into these two jokers
who are blocking everything what's that
t-shirt saying intervening in some
mobile I think I think I heard of you
guys don't know yeah that guy wills all
right anyway everybody's crowded around
the LG sakers they just released the
Optimus Pad it is there in person oh
yeah by the way i'm noah for a much
TechnoBuffalo it's the first 3d tablet
computer and now this one does not new
3d on the screen glasses frame you need
glasses to view the 3d content but it
does capture 3d we've got the
stereoscopic camera set up on the back
there jewel 5 megapixel cameras with
flash it's also got a 2 megapixel camera
on the front and 84 video chatting and
all that kind of stuff it's Android 300
honeycombs with the Tegra 2 NVIDIA Tegra
2 chipset inside and one of the big
things that LG saying about this is that
then go didn't go 7-inch like the Galaxy
Tab the original Galaxy Tab they didn't
go nine point seven inch like the iPad
they didn't go ten inch like the new
Motorola Xoom and Galaxy Tab 10.1 they
went 8.9 inch with a 15-9 aspect ratio
which makes for kind of a long skinny
tablet but according to them and I'll
bear it out it is easier to use
one-handed kind of hard to really tell
because you know these things are all
together down to the stands so people
like me don't run off of them people
like me people like those guys are into
mobile but it is kind of lightweight
it's narrower so it's easy to hold or
easier to hold with one hand for sure
but you have a larger display with more
resolution full WXGA 720 or 1280 rather
by 768
so more resolution than the smaller
screens but much lighter weight then
something like an iPad for sure even the
galaxy type 10 one that I saw last night
at Samsung's event you know this
definitely feels a little bit lighter
more portable I would think yeah and
they also mentioned for typing purposes
it should be easier to type with nothing
as well if I don't manage to break it
but when you're back in the stand these
demo units are not production and so a
little bit wonky with some of the some
of the apps here screen but if we go to
the web you get the keyboard and
definitely narrow be easier for
two-handed type two thumbs typing then a
wider unit like an iPad and then if we
rotate it big enough I think my hands
are too big I don't think I could really
comfortably dual hand to type but you
know I haven't met a tablet yet that can
really two-handed type on maybe those
ten inches lots of people waiting to see
and again you know not everything's
working fully under a tiny comb so you
get all the Google services your
multiple homescreen Google Voice Search
the widgets you know all that stuff and
then if we go into apps here which we go
to 3d camcorder they get this one
insufficient memory we'll go to 3d
player competition with a and but here's
the Terran player I crashed as well I
don't know all right well the glasses
anyway so you have sticker so this is
the 3d camcorder mode on the Optimus Pad
and again you know I don't know if you
can tell watching the video at home
things look without glasses on they
might like a little blurry but that's
because it's recording in 3d so I'm
asking with glasses you can see this
live in 3d as you record the case this
without that you've gone through our
chicken 3ds in 3d mode so it's put the
HDMI connection TV
right you can see the 3d content
you gotta let them know Freddie can i
watch this with glasses and see 3d on
nobody with with putting them with them
do golf but it's not to James maybe not
directly to YouTube you can also be a
recording and you can share it share it
to YouTube yeah
first look again at the LG Optimus Pad
LG's new tablet computer to a core
NVIDIA Tegra 2 inside Android Honeycomb
Sri dato 8.9 inch display and of course
the dual camera setup for 3G recording
from home World Congress 2011 in
Barcelona Spain
I'm Noah from TechnoBuffalo comm much
much more on all the tablets all the
phones including LG's new 3d phone the
Optimus 3d TechnoBuffalo non-conscious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
