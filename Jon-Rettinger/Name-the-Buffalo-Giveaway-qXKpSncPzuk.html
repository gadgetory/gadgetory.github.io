holidays quickly approached thought this
would be a fantastic time to give back
to the community the community that's
made my youtube channel a success the
same group of people let's Mei
technobuffalo a success and I really
couldn't have done anything that that
I've done or even dreamed of without you
so I paired up with AT&amp;amp;T Wireless to do
sort of a fun giveaway so before I tell
you what you have to do for the giveaway
because he had got to do something let
me tell you what we are giving away I've
got in front of me three brand new never
opened a TNT fuses this is a windows
mobile smartphone built by HTC running
touchflo 3ds for the full feature it's
got Wi-Fi GPS it's really got everything
that you could want in a windows mobile
smartphone and brand-new and can be
yours now so here's what you gotta do
you guys go to technobuffalo you've seen
the logo on my youtube channel i've seen
on the website the buffalo is lonely
he's getting make fun of its cool no
one's talking to him they just call him
kid he doesn't have a name so I'm asking
you guys to do is help me name the
Buffalo all you gotta do is hit the link
in the sidebar for Watkins on the
YouTube channel and leave a comment on
this article on TechnoBuffalo with your
best idea for the name for the Buffalo
so is that one more time don't leave the
comments with your name idea on the
youtube channel make sure you leave it
on technobuffalo on the link that will
have the sidebar on the article that's
discussing this overview i will pick in
the top five we'll let this run for a
week so let this rod until let's say
december seven so let this run until
midnight december seven i'll go through
all pick the top five and i'll put those
top five choices in the daily poll and
i'll let you guys vote for who you think
number one should be so but i've got
three prizes one person shouldn't win
you know three phones so third place is
going to win n HTC fuze second place is
going to win n HTC fuze first place is
going to wind n HTC fuze but shouldn't
place when something more than the other
two as well they should the first place
is also going to win a bright view
multi-format media streamer look at the
back this is the thing that i unboxing
viewed a while ago it lets you download
and stream really any content from
anywhere it's got a built in torrance
pete and pete client you can stream
really any sort of file you want from
your mac or pc right to your TV it's
like an apple TV without the
restrictions this is a pretty cool
device so first pride is going to win
both of these in second place just a
bone third place just the phone and
fourth place just a hearty handshake so
if we go over this one more time just
make sure everybody understands you got
to name the Buffalo come up with your
best name for the Buffalo you can enter

as you want but you have to leave the
comments on the TechnoBuffalo site on

watching us on YouTube hit the link in
the sidebar to go over to the article
now all our giveaways in the past might
open to everybody anywhere in the world
we give it away Xbox of playstation 3
giving away a ton of really exciting
stuff but unfortunately since these
phones are just us phones we have to
limit this contest to unfortunately just
those folks in the United States
building you that are not the US I
apologize and all the giveaways we can
do in the future will include the rest
of the world as often as we can but this
particular time it's got to be just us
based you are welcome to enter if you're
not in the US and if you win you know we
can give the prize to the next candidate
but unfortunately you're not gonna be
able to get one of the phones if you're
outside of the US and our guy just kind
of a fun way to give back we got a ton
more giveaways lined up as a holiday
sort of ramp up but I wanted to thank
the folks at AT&amp;amp;T for helping us out
with this definitely give them a shout
out in a check i'll put a link to their
Facebook page which are they trying to
push the social networking aspect of the
phones and also it's a great way if you
have ATT questions to ask them they got
some great people that are built there
on the staff to answer your Facebook
questions really anything has to do with
your phone so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed and
I will see you in the next video and
enjoy the contest and the Buffalo really
needs a new name
