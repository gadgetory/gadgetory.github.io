device and rim takes a trip to Venice
that is what's up next on the tech
TechnoBuffalo fun time our show how's it
going guys Marber Steiner here I'm super
stoked to be bringing a weekly news
recap back to the channel but I don't
have a name for it just yet I thought it
would be super fun as a kind of like
first act of solidarity with you guys as
the community to work together to come
up with a name for the show so just to
get your juices flowing like the
download the sink news night with Mark
burst iron fun time tech our ville you
know stuff like that so let me know in
the comments what names you guys think
will work will start narrowing it down
from there in the meantime let's get
started first up Android M continuing
with their delectable tradition of
naming major releases after sweet treats
Android M is now officially Android
marshmallow while I do like the name I'm
a little bit disappointed that they
didn't go with another partnership like
they did with KitKat I would have been
all too happy to buy bags of M&amp;amp;MS for
just a chance at some play store credit
this week Intel unveiled a brand new
flagship project tango device featuring
their new 3d real sense tech obviously
they partnered with Google to do so
project tango is a google project and
this dev kit should bring really really
powerful 3d imaging capabilities to a
lot more folks if you don't know what
project tango is let's get you up to
speed it's a really really cool google a
tap project and they use a multitude of
cameras and sensors to turn a smartphone
or a tablet running android into a
full-on 3d imaging device it's really
really cool you can use it for mapping
out stores for google maps to be able to
walk through them or you can even do
really cool stuff like create full 3d
environments for games I love chrome you
guys it's my default browser and I'm on
a Mac but on a Mac it can get really
really heavy and sluggish at times
luckily chrome 46 which you can
currently test drive through Chrome's
alpha channel Chrome Canary seems to
have alleviated the major memory leaks
and sluggishness that are associated
with chrome for the most part which
brings it up to par with safari in terms
performance of course you can go ahead
and grab canary at the link right down
there below in the description remember
canary is indeed an alpha so not
everything's going to work it is an
early look at what's coming around the
bend if you don't want to be running an
alpha you can also run the chrome beta
or you can just stay on the normal
chrome Channel and it will come to you
eventually Android wear is just getting
better and better google just announced
this week an update to android we're
enabling interactive watch faces
developers can now make watch faces that
have interactive elements like calendar
events fitness tracker info you can even
link up with another person right from
your watch face you can send fun photos
emoji you can draw some stuff as usual
this is Anita staged rollout so if you
don't see it on your device right away
just hang tight or of course you could
just keep bashing the system update
button all right I'm gonna say something
polarizing here if blackberry were to
put out a device running Android I would
be first in line I've always been a
really big fan of their hardware but
bbos really kind of never matured enough
to really take on the big boys
thankfully that is exactly what we
should be seeing very very soon doesn't
seem like they're going to let Android
be Android but if the software is
tolerable the specs that we're seeing
should make for a really strong entry
into the Android arena and I got to be
honest I'm stoked and lastly in a
surprise move this week google announced
on hub a brand new smart router that
intelligently manages bandwidth based on
usage habits for each device it's
managed with an app too so you don't
have to know any of the combinations of
blinking lights on your router and it's
got a whopping 13 yes 13 and tennis in a
circular array around the top to make
for some ideal coverage and reception
not to mention it's kind of speaker
built in we're really really stoked to
take this thing for a spin in the office
I'm really really stoked to buy one for
myself you can pre-order it right now
for 200 bucks and google says it'll ship
in the coming weeks but there is no
actual solid date just yet
let me know what you guys think about
the format of this new show I really
want this one to feel like we created it
together so I'd really love to be able
to give you a quick snapshot of what
happened in the world attack for those
of you who don't really have the time to
keep your finger on the pulse throughout
the week so let me know what you think
longer shorter more stories fewer
stories you want to see gaming stuff you
wanna see entertainment stuff too and
definitely don't forget to let me know
what you think the show should be called
down there in the comments you can catch
links to all the stories that we covered
today in the description and you can of
course just go ahead and leave us a like
if you enjoyed the show and you can hit
that subscribe button if you'd like me
