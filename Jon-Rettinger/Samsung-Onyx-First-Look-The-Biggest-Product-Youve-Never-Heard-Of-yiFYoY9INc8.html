for almost five years now if you haven't
heard of it it's the annual convention
for movie theater owners I know it might
not sound as sexy is like a comic-con
but for those movie buffs it's the
absolute place to be it's generally
where upcoming films get showing off new
trailers get released and the movie
loving fans of the world get to see the
latest tech that makes those movies
possible this year alone said makan was
where the new venom trailer drops
Aquaman was partially shown and we
learned that Wonder Woman too was going
to take place in the 80s it's awesome so
when Samsung asked if I wanted them to
sponsor us to go to cinema con I could
not reply yes fast enough it's in Vegas
which meant I could essentially make a
day trip out of it so I had to wake up
around 5:00 a.m. which was not awesome
to cachi 7:45 AM flight which was
slightly better to get to Vegas the city
was pretty sleepy especially when you
consider the usual CES craziness that
I'm used to after a quick taxi ride to
Caesars Palace and picking up her badges
we were ready for the show like I said
this is a totally new experience for me
so I was kind of just geeking out and
walking around and checking out the
displays and really just being a fan
some of the movie stuff I saw I can't
even talk about yet doo doo serious
embargoes but let's just say a movie
that rhymes with schwa qualms and is
going to be awesome when that unnamed
movie does eventually hit theaters
chances are you're probably be watching
using some old-school tech you know a
theater with a giant projector room in
the back and black levels that kind of
look great if you look at it close
enough it's a weird time when most home
viewing looks better than what you get a
typical cinema so since Samsung
sponsored this trip I obviously had to
check out what they were showing what
they had to show is the answer to a
traditional movie screen it's the
world's first cinema LED screen called
onyx I know what you're probably about
to say I read the comments on YouTube Oh
John you have to say how awesome it is
truth is I really don't I'm sure at this
point Samsung is sweating the video but
I was not overly optimistic so to show
off onyx who rushed it into a mini make
sure it's movie theater which led cinema
display and sound from hardened all
around us we're given some active 3d
glasses and asked to just sit and watch
to experience they're about to show for
the next 30 minutes so I took the
glasses i sat down
and first thing to know is this is a
giant LED displays on a giant screen
he's a projector think of it kind of
like a giant TV built in to do some
movie theater wall
we saw some STR on HDR clips and various
resolutions and they kept it they were
gonna show us a secret and while it was
an infinity war like I hoped it was
still pretty awesome since it's not a
projector the image called it doesn't
start to look super faded any sort of
ambient light kind of comes in from the
side
it's imagined to be pretty good for like
some dining situations or even some sort
of eSports gaming and they decide to
call it onyx because onyx is black and I
kind of get it now black levels were
like they should be super black to make
the images and pictures really start to
pop then they switch over to some 3d
content traditionally cinematic 3ds bins
like garbage lose a ton of brightness
with those stupid tinted glasses and 3d
effects that supposed to show the depth
look completely laughable but because
this is LED you can get things way
brighter and the act of glasses and the
depth of the three actually showed was
pretty good they talked a lot about how
it's way cheaper to install for theater
owners and how the LED array has modules
that can be easily replaced another
theater owner jargon that went way over
my head what a boiled down to was that
the fidelity of the picture
coupled with the killer audio just made
for a better movie watching experience
and I was actually pretty relieved that
the tech here didn't suck and it was
good
and I'm guessing Samsung knew it they're
gonna show is pretty good which is
probably why didn't any restrictions on
what I could say or not say if it had
been bad this would have been a really
uncomfortable video to publish it boils
down to this onyx made a difference
movies look better if you never see a
movie on onyx screen you'll never know
what you're missing once you do struck
notice the deficiencies of regular laser
projectors it's kind of like the first
time that I watched a football game in
HD and I can actually see the blades of
grass
it made watching standard def after that
just looked basic if I had the option to
see a movie and the theater that had
Onyx Tech or one that didn't I'd go at
onyx and that is the honest truth but
for now there's only one theater that's
got onyx and it's worth of that way so
probably not taking my word for it at
least for a while so my CinemaCon
experience was awesome unlike comic-con
that was mostly just dudes and suits not
guys dresses wizards and various Spider
Man
but a sort of really cool experience I
felt closer to the movie industry kind
of like an insider which was which is a
neat feeling
Marc and I finish up our filming and
headed back to the airport completing
one of the longest and most satisfying
days for me in recent memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
