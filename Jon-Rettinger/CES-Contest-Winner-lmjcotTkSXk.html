technobuffalo here after many weeks I am
ready to finally announce the winner of
our come to CES with TechnoBuffalo
contest if he entered stick around see
what Co so first let me thank our
sponsors at AT&amp;amp;T they've been awesome to
work with this is a contest that I've
been wanting to do for many many years
I've always wanted to give someone the
chance to sort of get a head start in
the world to check journalism it's
really hard to break into it yourself
noticed something that I would have
loved had the opportunity to do when I
was first starting something that I'm
really really proud to be able to have
offer to our audience we had hundreds of
entries we're looking for someone either
as a writer or a video producer really
didn't matter who we tried to pick the
winner we had again had several hundred
entries are able to limit it down to the
top about 16 then I went to the top 10
the top 5 and finally the top three and
the TechnoBuffalo executive team voted 1
2 &amp;amp; 3 without anybody knowing who they
voted for results were just sent to me
we assign point values to places 12 and
13 tabulated a winner and we have our
winner I like to congratulate mr. David
Taylor on coming with us to CES David is
on the video side of things he has a
youtube channel called Robo 13 link will
be down below if you want to check him
out on the rest of technobuffalo staff
i'm making this video for the video
response to the contest to go to CES
with you guys in january and i'm making
this quick little biography right before
my I think my personal best review of a
product my ipad mini review this is just
something to go right before that I
actually called him before I film this
video so if you want to see his reaction
and hear that conversation went it's
going to be after the video so stay
tuned after the outro to hear how
everything went down David did an
absolutely awesome job he is studying
video production in college right now
he's 19 and the sophomore in school so
really excited to have him be there with
us to cover videos for us and you'll see
his videos up on our YouTube channel
throughout CES probably do about 3 and a
lots of his videos is going to be a
recap of his experience what it was like
going to CES what did he expect not
expect what's it like to actually go to
a tree
Joe working and not go just to explore
all the fun stuff that is there guys
thank you so so very much for all the
entries well we can only pick one winner
other words several folks who really
shined up to us I may reach out to
actually for jobs in the future so it
was this contest great to give people
opportunity to come to see yes it's also
great for us as a company to see some of
the great writing and video talent out
there and a few people are really going
to look to hopefully higher over the
next few months I'm hoping that
something we can do every year and give
someone fresh a chance to win and to
come to CES I'm sorry we couldn't pick
more than one winner we can only pick
one but it really was a very tough
decision there are a lot of great talent
and it was very fun contest to be able
to run we're giving out anything like an
iPad or a phone or a tablet we're giving
out this time as an opportunity and a
chance to grow to grow your brand to get
