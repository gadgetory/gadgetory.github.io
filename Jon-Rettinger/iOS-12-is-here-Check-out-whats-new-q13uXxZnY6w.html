it we got a new release of a new version
of iOS and every year we hope for a
couple of things maybe a fresh coat of
paint some speed improvements under the
hood and maybe some better things coming
to Siri and though we didn't get all of
those things as iOS 12 there's a lot
actually to unpack and a lot of cool
features that you're probably gonna be
interested in so let's talk about all
the interesting cool and new features
coming in iOS 12 so the first thing I
will talk about with iOS 12 is kind of
doubling down on performance especially
with older devices so iOS 12 will work
on devices from the 5s generation of
Apple devices from 2013 up on and it's
gonna bring improvements to devices that
are usually are running slow on iOS 11
so things like taking a photo searching
on your phone and Siri bringing up the
keyboard launching apps are all gonna
get much faster on older devices in some
cases even doubling the speed making it
almost 2 times faster to do things on
these older devices hopefully
eliminating that sluggishness that we're
seeing now of course it wouldn't be an
iOS in Apple Keynote without talking
about AR and they did talk a lot about
it in this keynote they talked about a
new file type they developed with Pixar
this you SDC file type which are
basically make it easier for developers
to create these immersive new AR
experiences that you can enjoy on your
phone there's a couple of new features
in AR the biggest being this new shared
experiences thing would you basically
allow two or more people to jump into a
virtual world in AR interact together
and see the same thing but control
different components the stock Photos
app on iOS also got some updates kind of
mirroring what Google has done on Google
Photos and now has smarter search
suggestions where you can search on
place person and event type a little bit
better and also this new for you tab
which basically shows you recent photos
you've taken and suggest people you can
share them with with just one tap we'll
see how well this actually works but it
looks pretty cool
of course every year with WWDC we hope
with a new version of iOS that Siri gets
better and though we didn't get a lot of
under the hood details on improvements
we did get one cool thing coming to Siri
and that's the ability to do shortcuts
it basically lets you the user creation
or cuts in a very simple drag-and-drop
editor so for example let's say I'm
going home from work now my way home
from work I want Siri to do a couple of
things for me I want to get the fastest
travel time I want to be able to turn
on/off lights at my house so when I get
home my lights are on I want to set my
thermostat I want to get my favorite
podcasts playing in my car all that can
be done in this shortcuts app and I can
just say one thing to Siri like hey Siri
I'm heading home and it'll trigger all
those commands in order do everything I
want and I can get in the car and go
with the Apple Maps running my podcasts
playing and everything good to go look
sure the cool looks super customizable
and it should be kind of a cool addition
to Siri that gives you a little bit more
control we talked a lot at Google i/o
about this whole digital health
well-being lifestyle monitoring kind of
thing and Apple is kind of mirroring
that with this new kind of similar
digital health initiative in iOS 12 and
it starts with do not disturb one of the
things we've been long waiting for is
group notifications and that is here in
iOS so those notifications will look a
lot better but also you have a little
bit more control over how you see those
notifications and do not disturb so you
actually have the ability to turn off
notifications from apps for a certain
time period or altogether if you choose
and also toggle do not disturb on and
off by location by time or just trying
it off together at night and when you
wake up you're not gonna buy
notifications but do not disturb kind of
eases you into the day gives you a
little glance of the day ahead and then
gives you the rest of the notification
it's just a little more control there
for Do Not Disturb like I said that
whole digital well-being thing is a big
part of iOS 12 and in iOS 12 you're not
going to get these weekly reports and
also daily reports that show you how
you're using your phone what apps you're
spending your time in how often you're
checking notifications what apps are
actually sending you the most
notifications and based off those
reports you can do a couple of things
you can set time allotments for how long
do you want to spend in certain apps and
the phone will kind of nudge you out of
those apps and the timers up you can
tell an app to stop sending you
notifications for a certain time or
altogether and if you're a parent you
can have even more control over your
children's iOS apps basically using this
report to see how your child is using
their device what apps are using where
they're spending their time and you can
even limit what app they're using at
certain times if you want to right from
this whole new dashboard let's move on
from that to a new version of messages
for iOS 12 and there's a couple of cool
features in this new messaging app the
first bing if you're a big fan of an
emojis there's now tongue detection so
when you stick out your tongue your an
emoji will mirror that character which
is kind of cool and also this new thing
called
emoji which basically is kind of like a
3d version of a bitmoji you can use your
facial characteristics to build your
virtual and emoji basically your hair
style glasses skin tone so you can use
this meme og in a variety of ways you
can send it like you would an ant emoji
you can use it as a sticker you're able
to send it to friends you're also able
to use it in a new feature of this
message of gap which is group FaceTime
call so you can use your MIMO G to talk
to your friends 32 friends if you wanted
to all at once and it should work pretty
well assuming that your friends are
using an iOS device or Mac some smaller
miscellaneous iOS updates also came
updates to the news app are here there's
stocks now on the iPhone and iPad that
have been redesigned with Apple News
integrated there's a new voice memos app
that is now on the iPad hey carplay now
supports third-party maps app so if you
want to use Google Maps or ways you can
natively so that was kind of it for iOS
12 we saw the big things like serious
shortcuts and me emojis and this whole
digital well being dashboard but besides
that that was kind of the biggest stuff
coming from iOS stuff of course there
should be improvements under the hood
your phone should feel faster but that
was it so what do you guys think is this
new iOS 12 update a big deal for you are
you gonna jump on the bandwagon download
the beta or get on it as soon as it is
released or you're gonna kind of weight
off or are you a little bit disappointed
