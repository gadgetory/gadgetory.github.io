unboxing for you of the new motorola
droid for verizon wireless this is one
that I'm really excited to get my hands
on you've seen the ad campaigns with
droid does all over TV
it's supposed to be Motorola Savior in
the second coming of Android and I'm
really looking forward to checking this
sucker out so without further ado let's
go ahead and rip into the package just
came from FedEx and of course we'll use
the obligatory big ol knife thyself ends
up slicing my finger off so far so good
alright let's see what we got in the
pack we've got looks like a pretty
substantial press kit we'll take a look
at that a little later this is actually
one of the one of the bigger press kits
that I've seen and here we have the
Motorola Droid with my name on it it's
got a very small box this is a looks to
be new for Verizon packaging it's very
minimalist it seems to be the trend now
it is it's got a picture of the Droid
right on the front that new sort of
Droid logo now while this phone is the
Droid it's not going to be the last in
the Droid lineup Verizon is branding a
whole series of phones under the Droid
name this is just the first one I
haven't been this excited about emraan
Motorola device since the first Razer so
hopefully a lot of people feel the same
for Motorola stock holder shake so we've
got a picture of the Droid on the front
full QWERTY keyboard and that little
creepy I tell you what the package
contains we're gonna see what the
package contained in just a minute and
the device closed with the Droid like I
and this is a with Google experience
phone so there is not a skin on top of
this this is just running the newest
version of Android 2.0 so take the
device out of the box and it's sort of a
mangled screen protector on it go ahead
and take that out and put it off to the
side for just a second feels a little
heavier than I expected and let's see
what else we get in the box pull off the
top not that much in the box you get
charging cable and this charges by micro
USB so hurray for non proprietary
formats and some getting started
information in the box but the box is
probably not what you're here to see
here we have the Motorola Droid let's
peel back this crazy-looking screen
protector to reveal a massive 3.7 inch
capacitive touchscreen this thing is
huge
let's go over some of the specs just
real quickly the ones you probably care
most about the battery is a 1400
milliamp hour so that means you're going
to get about six point four hours of
talktime and about two hundred and
seventy hours of standby time screen
resolution is pretty good at 480 by 854
pixels and again a three point seven
inch screen this does have a five
megapixel camera on the back which
motorola and Verizon are claiming is
capable of shooting DVD video ad shoots
video at 720 by 480 and 24 frames per
second it's got full autofocus image
stabilization and a flash which is
pretty cool and this does of course have
a micro SD card in it so let's go ahead
and take a look at the device so here
you've got your ridiculously large and
I'll do a comparisons in a minute 3.7
inch capacitive touchscreen with four
capacitive buttons down below on the
SATA device you've got your micro USB
charging port on the right side like
you've got your camera key and your
volume toggle up and down on the back
there is your very impressive five
megapixel camera and of course when you
slide the sucker out which is not a
spring-assisted slide you got to slide
it all the way up you get a full QWERTY
keyboard with directional d-pad on first
blush the keys are very flat they don't
seem to have any sort of dome on them I
think it's one of those keyboards that
will take some time to get used to but
certainly having a full keyboard is a
huge advantage least in my opinion let's
do a quick size comparison and then
we'll power this sucker on throw the Box
on the floor here it is with the iPhone
3GS you definitely see that the screen
size on the droid looks just a little
bit bigger and one of the other hot new
devices
for Verizon Wireless you may be
considering the blackberry storm2
you can see how these things stack up
now from what's what I hear what's most
impressive about the Droid is the
thickness take a look at that it's not
that much thicker than the iPhone 3GS
yet it does have the full slide-out
keyboard which is fantastic and of
course running Android it's going to
have a on-screen keyboard as well and
the thickness compared to the storm - I
think the storm - yet storm - is even
thicker than the Droid so it really goes
to show what a very impressive job
Motorola did let's power the sucker on
I'm really excited to see what it looks
like oh and on top you've got a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and your power
and lock button I'll see if this has any
charge to it oftentimes these things
come totally dead see if it's at least
has enough for a boot up and it looks
like it does so you get the Motorola
logo and if those of you that are
wondering why this has a little bit of a
chin this is where all the other radios
are and that was one of the ways that
Motorola is able to keep this device so
thin if you get that new sort of Droid
boot up screen with that redeye and now
we are welcome to joy touch the Android
to begin and we're going to go through
the main setup process that you're
familiar with on other devices so guys
this is a John render with an unboxing
of the Motorola Droid gonna have a ton
of coverage on the Droid we're going to
go head-to-head with a lot of phones

going to put this thing through the
paces so be sure to stick around to the
