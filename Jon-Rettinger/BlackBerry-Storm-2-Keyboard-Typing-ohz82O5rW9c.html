to give you a demonstration of the
keyboards and text info methods found on
the blackberry storm2 I'm new to the
storm family so I'm not an expert typist
on it so this is going to mimic the
experience you would have if you just
picked up the device if you use the
storm one and you're a pro your
experience is going to be even faster if
you're curious how the new storm sure
press technology and the screen works
I've got a video explaining that on my
channel so if I check it out and I'll
put a link to it in the sidebar the
storm 1 typing experience was not that
accurate for me the screen just never
seemed to hit what I wanted to hit and
the wait time between waiting for the
screen to come back up make the typing
experience a little bit choppy so let's
see if that's improved with the storm 2
we'll go ahead and open up a new message
to compose an email close the wizard I
don't have an email associated with this
yet and here we are so you've got your
typical sure tab key word that you've
seen on the storm 1 now you find on the
Pearl and the pearl flip let's try and
type out a message here we'll type out
this is a test and see how it works
this is a test I made a mistake but it's
spelling correction picked it right up
this is the tests able to type that no
problem and the screen does feel nice
and natural now it does feel like you're
just pushing a button which I assume was
the experience that RIM was going for
with the initial blackberry so this
being a full QWERTY device and having an
accelerometer when you rotate it you get
a full QWERTY landscape keyboard I think
the landscape keyboard was one of the
places that the initial storm was really
efficient it was just very hard to type
on and like I said very inaccurate so
let's see if it's improved with the
storm - I'll type the same thing this is
a test I always hit the voice command
button on the bottom there and it
corrected me again and this is a test I
can tell you that this is a keyword that
I think that I could definitely get used
to it was relatively quick and pretty
accurate typing as well so if when your
concerns with the storm - is how the
keyboard was going to work if you can
see the storm one Andy Ward impressed I
think your concerns can really be offset
with the storm - it seems to just work
and respond much better overall than the
storm one and the new sure press green
technology really seems to be a big step
forward from the last generation making
this a really worthwhile upgrade or new
purchase if you're looking to hop on the
touchscreen blackberry bandwagon so guys
this is John Rhett enger' for exclusive
content check me out on Twitter
twitter.com slash John for Lakers and to
learn more about the TechnoBuffalo
check out TechnoBuffalo comm links to
all that business will be up in the
sidebar and I'll see you guys in the
next video and stay tuned for just a
pond of storm 2 coverage buh bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
