from techno Buckham the reason I said
hola is because we are in Spain and I
don't know any other Spanish covering
Mobile World Congress 2016 on day one we
covered the LG g5 video link above and
for day two while it was a beautiful day
outside we didn't want to be trapped in
the subway system so instead we rented
some bikes to peddle our way over to the
show one of the first things I wanted to
take a look at at the show floor was
actually the Ericsson booth it was a
Volvo and Ericsson collaboration what
Volvo has designed is very simple it is
digital key technology and it is exactly
what it sounds like it removes your
physical key and replacement for a
digital key on your smartphone now I
know this seems incredibly simple and
incredibly obvious and you must be
asking why hasn't this happened before
or earlier I'm asking the exact same
question then again better late than
never so I'm not going to complain the
technology is very simple it runs via
bluetooth it connects to your car you
can unlock your doors you can lock your
doors you can start the car remotely all
via the Volvo app based on what the
representative told us Volvo is going to
be rolling this feature out to their
rental service only so you can rent and
drive away in a car only using your
smartphone this kind of service is
common in parts of Europe but I would
assume that this would be rolling out to
regular consumers and buyers very soon
as well hence why they installed a
sharing feature this allows you to share
your key with potential other drivers
and owners of the same car so it's very
simple again via using your smart phone
you would send a key to another user or
driver they received the digital key and
they're good to go
one thing I was surprised by was the
fact that this technology does not use
touch ID or any kind of fingerprint
recognition considering a lot of smart
phones now how that technology would
have been nice to see Volvo implement
that as another layer of security this
could be something we see with other car
manufacturers in the future though so
that's pretty much it for this video
guys let us know what you think in the
comments below we love chatting with you
guys give us a thumbs up if you liked
this video and if you're interested in
what Volvo is doing hit subscribe for
more awesome Mobile World Congress
coverage and I'll see you guys in the
next one side note the bike ride back
was very difficult given the doughnut I
eat in the hospital</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
