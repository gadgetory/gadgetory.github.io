talk a lot about consumer electronics
here on TechnoBuffalo but what those
represent these were digital footprint
and it is kind of a frightening time to
be online your inbox probably filled up
with hundreds of privacy policy updates
we've got things gdpr going on in europe
zuckerberg testifying in front of
Congress it's hard to figure out where
to put your information how to keep
information secure so we've teamed up
with a company that has what I think is
a pretty awesome solution to this the
company is in turn X and the first
product is called X cloud and to
commemorate its upcoming launch we are
giving you a chance to win a smartphone
of yo dreams any phone you want under a
thousand bucks long as you live on this
planet Earth you can win it will link to
information down below if you want to
enter I'll give more information at the
end of the video but first let me tell
you a bit more about in turn X and X
cloud so X cloud is their first product
offering and it is offering a
decentralized way to store your
information and in turn X is a company
has kind of the baller plan to go
toe-to-toe with the tech giants in
Silicon Valley in the world so your
Google your Amazon and your Apple and X
cloud is a way they are going to do it
it's a lower cost more secure version of
like a Dropbox or Google Drive or Amazon
s3 if use any of those services so I'm
gonna try to not get like super
technical but explain it simply as using
a decentralized internet I know that
sounds like a Silicon Valley plot
because because it was but the thing
that's actually coming into existence
and their beta is gonna be available in
q3 and it's gonna come out to market in
q4 and what's gonna do is essentially
store little bits of information across
host computers if you want to be a host
you can store a tiny little fraction of
decrypt a bit of information and they'll
actually pay you to do so in their own
token which is pretty cool and if I want
to use a service you pay to do it
there's a host you can actually earn
tokens you can put your unused system
resources which are usually more than
you think to good use and actually make
some cash from it if you want to keep
your vision secure them back your stuff
up with X cloud you can either do it in
tokens or in dollars then you convert
those dollars to tow
and that's how that system is going to
work your information will be stored
across thousands hundreds of thousands
of potentially more computers and all
the files will be end-to-end encrypted
think of it like this you've got one
documents a piece of paper with whatever
password for something on it and you're
gonna tear that piece of paper up into a
thousand pieces if somebody sees one of
that piece they can't read the entire
document that's what X cloud is doing
tiny little encrypted pieces living on
different computers all across the globe
presumably that when you decide you want
all those pieces put back together X
Files going to let you do that so
Google's servers get hacked your
documents and your passwords eventually
acceptable anything with Amazon or Apple
any other traditional backup option with
X cloud it don't matter if one of those
computer get taxed they can't access all
documents and we have a tiny little
nugget of a piece of it it's a really
cool way to take the power out of these
giant corporations hands and put the
power and security back in the people
that matter like you and and me so get
started you don't have to like do any
coding or anything it's really simple to
download application so I mentioned it's
going to be available in beta in q3 is
currently a wait list but if you sign up
you can get access to it hopefully first
and again it's gonna be coming out to
the market in q4 and this is a giant
deal
so I also mention that we're giving away
your dream phone but you can also win
more stuff if you want to sign up for
the way this you eligible to win over 50
I NXT tokens each week until the beta is
going to launch again later in q3 and
then one winner each week will be sent
tokens directly via airdrop just by
signing up for the waitlist you're also
eligible to win 500 bucks each week so
go to internet comm to get started
so cash tokens information is secured it
seems like a pretty win way to me so
that's internet next cloud something
that's really cool and a decentralized
internet has something that I think is
long overdue so I give them credit for
finally getting something out to market
this year but give it weight I'll be
like Oprah but like you get a phone you
get a phone except only only one of you
is gonna get the phone of your dreams so
again any phone you want under a
thousand bucks we will send it to you
you
we live in this world we will send it to
you it's gonna be available these dates
right here and put all the information
also down below so that's in turn X next
time I hope you guys enjoy I hope you
guys get a chance to win the phone of
your dreams let us know down below what
phone you want to win and why until next
time I'm John Wagner from TechnoBuffalo
happy entering and information secure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
