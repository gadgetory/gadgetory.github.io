to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
john r ng from TechnoBuffalo here so did
a little show called rumor roundup and
we obviously round up all the rumors
from the past several weeks and over the
past few weeks we have heard a lot about
the Samsung phones a note for obviously
the s5 was big yield we didn't hear much
about their curved display technology
earlier this week though I think
surprised a lot of people and Unleashed
the Samsung Galaxy edge what's up
everyone
Jon render from TechnoBuffalo here
earlier this week Samsung unveiled a
crazy curved phone called the Samsung
Galaxy edge it's also some note brandy
in there but it's unsure if it's gonna
be part of the note line that aside it's
a pretty cool device so it's rocking
pretty much spec 4 spec or what they
just announced the Galaxy Note 4 it's a
little bit small on the screen size is
5.6 at a 5.7 it's got a qHD display so
it's under stay a 2k screen it's 2560 by
1440 which is a ridiculous 525 PPI we've
got a quad HD Super AMOLED screen a
beastly processor it's 2.7 gigahertz
quad core 3 gigs of ram 32 give you 64
storage expandable all kinds of other
goodness 60 megapixel sensor on the back
of optical image stabilization but that
is not the big story the screen is
freakin curved and it's not curved like
you know the LG G folks with curved it's
got a whole like separate screen on this
side of the device you probably saying
yourself John why would I want that and
that is a very valid question before I
get into what that can do I'll take my
hat off the Samsung if I was wearing one
I would tip it rights now I've been
tough on Samsung over the past few years
I think they haven't really done much
the innovation department until now they
are trying something different not
sacrificing specs for it they're not
making it weird and useless like to add
a field continuum with the second screen
on there this is a totally new take on a
smart phone that's giving a whole new
way to access information that gives Dan
some credit for trying something new
they're using premier premium materials
they're sort of going through one by one
understand the concerns people had with
their products okay so now on to the
weird
little curvy thing if you want to see
more about it we've got some hands-on to
that Todd did who's in Berlin is a links
that'll be right down below of course
you'll have some footage popping up as
I'm talking so you can do all kinds of
cool stuff with it let's say you want to
use an alarm clock you can just turn
your phone off and the time will show up
right down there and there's your alarm
clock but if you want your Twitter feed
to show up right there you can go ahead
and see that if you want settings or
news ticker to show up there a stock
ticker
I thought your screen having to be on it
gives you a lot of flexibility what I'm
really excited about when developers get
access to that little tiny screen and
they can do a lot of cool things with it
and if you don't want to use it you
really don't have to here so getting the
specs of their latest phone which is a
galaxy note 4 but you've got something
extra on top of it you can choose an
that you want to use it or not this is
all of the same s-pen that's on board I
think Samsung's in a really cool job and
also it's gonna be coming to every major
US carrier so presumably we'll be coming
to it ever carrier you're on let's turn
on an MVNO or you live in another
country it'll be coming to you know your
care so be widely available which i
think is great no Karen civet II it's
got that crazy screen on the side which
can offer a lot of information and they
do be kinda nice to have my Twitter
feature up there sports scores I know
how the Angels or when the Lakers lose
because they're going to a lot this
season and I like that Samsung's trying
something new they've been talking a lot
about curves acknowledged they showed it
behind closed doors e a slasher an even
the year before that but now I actually
seeing in production devices I like they
didn't put it on the note 4 and instead
of cramp down everybody's throat like
this is what you're gonna use take it
you can keep people options and I big
fan of options if you want to try
something new we have it if you prefer
the old form factor prefer just a big ol
screen the gorgeous display on it they
try that note for if you wanted try
something different we got that for you
to take a quick second think our friends
at lynda.com which always makes me laugh
I've got an Aunt Linda and she can
barely check email so it makes me kind
of chuckle that there's a website called
Linda not related not a funny story but
I still thought I'd share lynda.com

slash TechnoBuffalo that's ly and da
calm so that sec no buffalo scene have
to worry you can do it anytime you want
they're not even gonna care if you're
not wearing pants hopefully they're not
gonna you know do all Samsung it up and
release an updated version in three
months I didn't think that are really
cool thing here and I've been again very
rough on Samsung in the past and I want
to give them credit where credit is due
I don't want to ask you guys to what do
you think about that weird curved screen
on the edge would you use it would you
not use it if both phones are sitting
side by side and I said you pick one
you're gonna use the next year you pick
the note for or would you pick the edge
I I think I would unequivocally pick the
edge because I'd like to try new things
and I also like big screens to get the
best of both worlds but that's just me
I'm weird like that which one would you
pick
tell me cuz I I want to know we could
just have a discussion I'll leave in the
comments I'll reply and we could talk
and this is what it looks like when I
talk on the Internet
