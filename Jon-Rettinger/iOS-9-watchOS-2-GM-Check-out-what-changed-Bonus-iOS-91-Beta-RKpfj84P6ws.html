from technobuffalo and Apple this week
held a huge event where it announced the
iphone 6s and iPhone 6s plus the iPad
pro and even a brand new Apple TV
there's a lot to mull over if you're an
apple fan headlined by the inclusion of
3d touch which adds an entirely new
element to iOS we actually got to try
out 3d touch at apple's event and it
works exactly as advertised will it be
the iPhones next killer feature we're
not sure but we'll find out when we have
the opportunity to spend more time with
Apple's new devices on the software side
of things apple said iOS 9 and watch osu
will arrive next week but before that
the company released the golden master
builds for iOS line and watch os/2 along
with the first beta for iOS 9.1 today
we'll be checking out what's new in iOS
9 watch OS 2n iOS 9.1 beta 1 starting
off with iOS 9 golden master there's not
a whole lot of changes here mostly under
the hood performance updates and bug
fixes but we did notice that the hey
Siri function now features a setup
screen it's essentially a wafer Siri to
train herself to answer to your voice
properly there are five steps in total
that you need to go through which are
pretty straightforward and that's about
it for the golden master of iOS 9 if you
want to check out some of the other
major changes in iOS I'm who made a few
videos while the OS was still in beta
and you can check those out over here
Iowa sign is exciting because it
introduces a lot of new features that
will make the user experience richer and
some of the big updates include an all
new proactive Siri that is conceptually
aware of what you're doing and what your
schedule looks like true multitasking
features on the iPad and the addition of
an all new news app well the Apple watch
and watch osu there are two features
that have been added in the golden
master build wonder are a few new color
accents when customizing certain watch
faces that will match new Apple watch
sport banzet Apple announced during the
event lavender walnut vintage rose stone
and antique white lastly there are quite
a few new animated emojis in watch OS to
that you can sense your friends and
family if you're sick for example you
can send this animated emoji or if you
feel like being cool you can send this
animated emoji with an aviator maybe
you're sad that your crush doesn't like
you back you can send this black heart
I'd emoji other than that there's not a
whole lot of changes from previous watch
os/2 betas we check that watch OS to
weeks back so if you want to check out
some of the newer features that Apple
included in version to check them out
over here watch os/2 is exciting because
developers can now take advantage of the
Apple watch sensors and run native apps
directly on the Apple watch some of the
big updates include a new night stand
mode a very cool time-travel feature and
brand new watch faces last but not least
apple also released iOS 9.1 beta 1 which
we assume will launch alongside the iPad
pro in November so far they're not a
whole lot of changes from i/o sign gold
master but probably the most exciting
feature that's been added in this beta
are the new emojis and there's quite a
few of them including taco burrito a
block of cheese a unicorn and even a
middle finger emoji almost every
category from food and drink to travel
to animals have added new emojis iOS 9.1
probably won't be out until later this
year but if you're an apple developer or
in Apple's public beta program you can
start downloading iOS 9.1 beta starting
today and iOS 9 golden master and watch
os/2 will be out next week September
16th anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
