technobuffalo and today we'll be taking
a look at iOS 8 beta for Apple just
releases today to developers and we're
here to show you something to the new
features that was added into iOS 8 beta
for first thing we have is a tips app
this is the new app that's now included
in iOS 8 so you can't really delete it
basically what it does is that it gives
users tips on how to use iOS 8 on a
weekly basis so every week you get new
tips from the app on how to use iOS 8
and as of now they'll give you tips on
quick notifications sending voice
messages using notifications for mail
responses activating Siri hands-free and
more the second thing is a control
center control center is a redesigned
look that removes the black borders are
on the icons on top and the bottom and
it reminds me a lot of Yosemite which
gives it a nice implicit flat modern
look and if we go to the messages app
the Texas type option and messages now
display spoken text in real time rather
than waiting for the entire message to
be completed before displaying the text
so let's give that a try hey Ralph
what's going on ? so that's a really
nice feature to have it's very similar
to what series doing now in iOS 8 and
another minor UI changes that the emoji
keyboard icon has been updated with a
much happier smiley face rather than the
globe icon and when we first tried is a
beta there was always a notification up
at the top for you to tap the report any
type of bug and you can't really swipe
it away which was really annoying I'm
glad this iOS 8 beta that's no longer
present the rest of the new features lie
beneath the Settings app so in the
Settings app you have a new option for
display settings and this allows the
user to change the brightness change the
text size and activate bold text if we
go back we can go to messages you can
now choose how long the voice and video
messages are kept you can choose to keep
forever or for its expire out to two
minutes because obviously that takes up
a lot of storage in your device and if
you want to delete it you have that
option to do so if we go back to the
general settings we have an option for
handoff and suggested apps basically it
allows you to toggle on and off the hand
off feature which allows you to
seamlessly continue your work or
conversation on your Mac running OS 10
Yosemite and the suggested apps are the
ones that were your new your business an
app icon will show up on your lock
screen and you can launch the app right
from your lock screen so you have that
option to turn on or off and if we go
back we can go to mail contacts and
calendars there's a new option to toggle
favorites in recent
acts with an app switcher so if you turn
it off you get the old iOS 7 look but
I'm really starting to like this feature
so I'm going to keep it on we also have
a new option for mail swipe actions you
can choose from what actions you'd want
to display within a mail app so you can
change the swipe left action and swipe
right action and that's about it for
this quick iOS 8 beta for video if you
guys have any questions make sure to
leave it down below and as always I'll
see you guys in the next video thank you
guys for watching if you like what you
saw please subscribe they'll be the
first ones to know when new videos come
up we have a ton of stuff we do unboxing
to do hands on reviews cars and
everything in between the Nets do
consumer electronics we love to have you
stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
