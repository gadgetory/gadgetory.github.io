to you by audible.com hello Internet
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley it's gather any question you
might have in the wide world of
Technology every Tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo comm
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise you can send them to
me any time of the day or night at
TechnoBuffalo or at Ashley ask either on
Twitter make sure you use the hashtag
ask the bee so I can see it and I'll
usually answer between 3 and 5 questions
every episode let's get answering
because this is ask the Buffalo
TechnoBuffalo poster Paul asks hi Ashley
should I upgrade my HTC One X to HTC One
or butterfly ass or should I wait one
more year a lot of people ask these
questions about upgrading their phones
but at the end of the day if you keep
waiting for that next upgrade that next
upgrade you're gonna end up with like a
five year old phone and you'll have
never upgraded it which is a super big
bummer
so I say live in the moment upgrade now
if you have access to the butterfly it's
a great device they just reviewed it but
if you don't the HTC One is just the
delightful it really boils down to two
things
number one if you like aluminum and that
beautiful machined unibody that the HTC
One has go with that if you really like
plastic but you also like having
expandable storage and a huge battery go
for the butterflies ocurro's asks hi
there Ashley do you think that the HTC
One Maxx will have a removable back for
more storage and the option to switch
batteries like the leaked images suggest
or do you think that it will maintain
the full metal unibody design that the
one and the one Mini has I don't know
that HTC would go out of its way to make
something that was different than the
design language of the one in the 1 Mini
however the butterfly ass has a plastic
back but it's still not removable you
can't remove that battery on the HTC
butterfly yes so I don't know I think
that they're gonna stick with what
they've been doing thus far which is no
removable battery but I do think they'll
have expandable storage on something as
large as the HTC One Maxx fancy tape or
Vita says considering the iPhone already
has mid-range specs will the
phone 5c be a low-end phone or even a
toy well I don't think it'll be a toy I
don't think I'll be considered that
however I do think that if it does come
to the US which I would imagine it would
this will be the phone that replaces the
iPhone 4s so on the spectrum you have
the iPhone 4s for free once the 5s comes
out then you have the five for $99 on
contract and then the newest iPhone 5s
for 199 on contract to me it would make
sense for Apple to replace the 4s with
the iPhone 5c because the production
cost for the iPhone 5c are gonna be way
less than the iPhone 4s or equivalent
and it would also make it extremely
attractive for parents to add that extra
line on an account to give a phone an
iPhone to their kids without having to
say god I'm spending $200 on this phone
and I think you're probably gonna break
it or you know leave it at school but if
it's really an expensive and even off
contract I think it's one of those
things that's really gonna catch on like
wildfire here in the States Josh asks
hey Ashley are you excited for the jobs
movie coming out soon in a word no next
question Andrew asks do you think there
needs to be more mobile os's
it seems that only having the few basic
os's iOS Android Windows and Blackberry
make the mobile markets stale after a
few years besides Linux OS Steve predict
there will be more OS in the near future
to shake things up a bit add competition
and to give consumers more options
thanks well there are other OSS I mean
we have Tizen we have Firefox OS there
are other OSS out there but really what
it boils down to is developer
willingness to develop for a platform
that isn't established and the other
part of it is is all of the OSS that
exists right now are from huge companies
blackberry aside because I think they're
in a little bit of trouble it's been
very tumultuous for them and they're
going through a lot of change Microsoft
Google and Apple are huge companies that
back these OSS so I think that there's a
lot of trust involved and a lot of time
and energy that goes into developing
these things and especially after the
history of webOS even getting bought by
a company like HP and then crashing and
burning in flames after their CEO at the
time Leo Apotheker I will never forget
that name ruined
HP's chances at making webOS a viable
operating system I think that there
definitely sort of a hesitancy to sort
of latch on to anything new so it'll be
a while but I definitely think there's
always something that comes up I mean
years and years ago we thought myspace
would just be at the top of social media
for a long time and we all know how that
ended I love about 60 miles from
TechnoBuffalo headquarters it's a huge
commute every day and you know it keeps
me sane audible.com they're the biggest
audio book site on the web with over a
hundred thousand titles to choose from
that's a big deal for someone like me
who listens to a bunch of books in my
car every single week and it keeps me on
my toes because I'm always looking for
new things to read fiction nonfiction
spoken-word it's all on audible even
better they just released their iPad app
so you can use audible services finally
in a beautiful and specifically designed
for iPad interface no more scaling up I
think I'm gonna recommend to you Aisha
