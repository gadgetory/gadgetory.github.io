segment from technobuffalo and today
we'll be talking a bit about what we can
expect from Google's September event on
Tuesday September 29th unless you've
been living under a rock you know that
Google is probably going to unveil two
new Nexus devices an updated Nexus 5
known as the Nexus 5x and an updated
Nexus 6 known as the nexus 6p the Nexus
5x which is apparently being
manufactured by LG is apparently packing
a 5.2 inch 1080p display a 3180 milliamp
battery a Snapdragon 620 processor 4
gigabytes of ram 64 gigabytes of
internal storage a 13 megapixel rear
camera with OIS and a 5 megapixel camera
up front the Nexus 5 could also feature
a rear power button with a built-in
fingerprint reader wireless charging and
a USBC port would quick charge 2.0 the
design allegedly includes a metal frame
with chamfered edges along with a rear
plastic shell just like the original
Nexus 5 it's apparently set to cost as
little as three hundred to four hundred
dollars which might explain LG's
decision to use a less powerful
processor we still love the Nexus 5 and
we know we're not alone because the
device was so beloved perhaps that help
Google make the decision to bring the
device back the Nexus 6p which is
apparently being manufactured by Huawei
is the real powerhouse of the two we're
expecting Huawei's Nexus device to
feature a 5.7 inch qhd display
Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 820
processor a fingerprint reader in the
back a USB type-c port and the phone
will be available in 32 gigabytes 64
gigabytes and 128 gigabyte models in
terms of pricing we're not exactly sure
how much the Nexus 6p will cost but
we're assuming it'll be the same as the
Nexus 6 when it was first announced last
year which was priced at six hundred
fifty dollars for the base 32 gigabyte
model for Android marshmallow we should
also expect to see the final build of
Google's latest mobile OS which were
expecting to see appear on the new Nexus
devices before rolling out to other
handsets we've done a few videos
showcasing some of the newer features in
Google's latest OS which you can find
over here but as a quick refresher
expect to see now on tap better power
management the ability to grant or deny
individual app permissions and native
fingerprint support lastly we're also
expecting to see the second generation
chromecast which is rumored to spore
faster Wi-Fi connectivity and a slate of
new features one of those new features
is called fast play which could make
connecting to your TV quicker and
simpler than it has been in the past
according to 925 Google the new
chromecast will support content fees
which means when your chromecast is in
its screensaver mode you'll be able to
display social media feeds or images
though there's no confirmation yet on
whether this feature is actually legit
but I personally love the idea of having
my twitter feed show up on my TV since I
use Twitter on a daily basis now last
but not least there's chromecast Audio
which 925 google said is indeed a second
chromecast device chromecast Audio will
apparently like you add a Wi-Fi
connection to your speakers through the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack according
to the documents chromecast Audio will
have multi room support and bring high
quality audio to your desired speakers
we're about a week away from Google
September event and we'll be covering
the entire thing live as it happens over
a TechnoBuffalo calm and let us know in
the comments down below what you're
excited to see a Google September event

Nexus device let us know in the comments
