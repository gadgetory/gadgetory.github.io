technobuffalo and this is my review of
the gopro HD hero 2 and the contour plus
let's start your engine this review is
for all my fellow motocross enthusiasts
bikers skiers skateboarders snowboarders
and extreme walkers in this video I'm
going to be comparing the contour plus
and the gopro HD hero2 now we'll start
with the contour plus this is listed at
five hundred dollars its contours top of
the line camera the contour plus
features GPS for tracking and it also
has bluetooth connectivity the contour
plus shoots 1080p 30 frames per second
and even shoot 720p 60 frames per second
like the contour plus the gopro HD hero2
has 1080p 30 frames per second video
recording but it also offers standard
definition video recording there's also
720p 60 frames per second so the high
definition shooting modes are basically
the same on the contour and the HD hero2
now contour offers the rome and the gps
the gps is priced at three hundred
dollars while the rome is 199 that's
important to note that all three
versions of the contour have the same
imaging sensor and record at the same
format now the main difference between
these models comes down to design the
gopro HD hero2 retains that fun lovable
little brick design while the contour
plus has brushed aluminum accents and
looks much sleeker kind of like
something you'd find in a James Bond
film one of the advantages the GoPro too
has over the contour plus is that you
could actually control the width of your
lens right out of the box of the gopro
HD hero2 offers you a couple different
housings including a waterproof housing
the downside to the contour is that you
actually have to buy an accessory you
have to buy a fifty-dollar waterproof
housing for this camera now while I
admire the fact that the contour plus
a mic jack I will let you know that it's
proprietary and that the gopro HD hero2
has a full size 3.5 millimeter audio
jack so that is definitely something to
consider now it's time to lace up the
skates and head towards the pond for the
durability test one of the benefits of
the contour plus the design is its low
center of gravity I took both cameras
strap them to a hockey puck and took a
slap shot both cameras emerged unscathed
if I was going to do any kind of
specialty shots I definitely used the
contour to mouse on the puck because
mounting the GoPro to the hockey puck
was like watching a pelican on still to
run the 100-meter dash another thing
you'll notice about the contour is that
its mounts are more versatile while the
GoPro only allows the camera to lock
into place and shoot straight forward
the contours can be shifted all the way
a full 360 degrees now on the contrary
the contour lacks the ability to tilt
forwards or backwards and that's a key
element to the success of the gopro HD
hero2 one thing I do like about the
contour system is that it's super easy
to mount and unmount the camera all you
do is slide it into grooves snap it in
place and you're ready to go with the
GoPro you have to fiddle about with a
screw system the unfortunate thing about
the system is that these dome nuts are
free-floating and they could fall out
easily and be lost as far as interface
the gopro HD hero2 is a lot easier to
understand and operate the new refreshed
LCD screen on the front is a lot more
intuitive they put a secondary record
light on top of the unit while the
contour plus lacks an LCD of any sort
and requires you to make button
combinations in order to make certain
adjustments the one thing I did like
about the contour plus was the fact that
the record button was so easy to operate
and access all I had to do was flip the
switch and we were rolling and ready to
go with the GoPro you have to press
these little buttons and sometimes they
could be a pain in the keister another
thing worth mentioning about the
mounting system is the fact that while I
was shooting this video I accidentally
tipped my helmet over the contour landed
on the ground and this mounting bracket
broke right off so that's something to
put under your hat now even though both
cameras don't offer any sort of LCD
monitor so you can see what you're
filming right out of the box the gopro
HD hero2 has the backpack LCD which is
bought as an additional accessory and
just plugs right into the back of the
camera there the camera actually gives
you a menu system you can see what
you're filming exactly and the backpack
comes with a larger housing to
accommodate it on the contrary the
contour plus has a pretty nifty system
if you download the contour application
you can hook up the contour via
bluetooth and you could use your
smartphone to view what your camera is
viewing now that is pretty dang cool and
now it's the moment you've all been
waiting for image quality HD hero2 or
contour plus i'll give it to you right
now HD hero2 the sharpness and detail
was superior and the auto white balance
performance Trump's the contour plus i
found the contour plus warmer and softer
overall I had a better experience with
the HD hero2 when it came to image
quality and that's the bottom line so
now it's time for my final answer while
the contour plus has a lot of nifty
features I have to go with the HD hero2
number one for its image quality number
two for its mounting system I also love
the fact that the HD hero2 is pretty
much ready to go right out of the box
while the contour plus if you're going
to do any water sports you're going to
need to buy the additional waterproof
housing I think the HD hero2 is the
winner in this department for the full
review including all the samples and fun
action you can handle go to
technobuffalo calm in the meantime I've
still got a little dirt biking to do
