to you by the air force collaboratory
what's up everyone welcome back their
pursuit of renters rants
I'm Rios John renters to show her I get
mad and scream about something that
doesn't do with technology this week I'm
using a handheld mic because makes me
feel more professional I'm gonna answer
one of the questions I get more than
anything ever this is written just rants
let's go and get started I read every
single email that comes into the contact
us form on TechnoBuffalo and I can't
respond to all of them I do spend the
time to make sure I read every single
one the one question I get more -
anything on those comments and in the
comments on TechnoBuffalo youtube
channel on the website isn't what
telephone should you get isn't what
tablets should I buy isn't why is Apple
better than Android or why androids
better than Apple
it isn't why Fatman XXL is still making
comments it is what happened to John
Quach where'd he goes is still with
TechnoBuffalo and I'm sick of answering
this question I do it all the time I
reply to all the emails that ask this
I've got it copied right into a text
document just paste it into the emails
cuz I write it so often so I figure I'm
gonna put the rumors to rest I'm gonna
tell you what happened to John Quach
hi junk watch hi
everybody wants to know what happened to
you what happened - what's the apps
where did waffle John go where you been
at all this time well I had to take a
break to you know find myself you know
took a couple of years need to take some
personal time to just explore the world
within the vicinity of my home you know
with internet everything I didn't want
to depart my cell but yes I had to find
myself in the way of not doing videos
because I just didn't enjoy it anymore
what was it about videos you did not
enjoy anymore I am I mean when I did
videos I mean it was fun because I got
to write a lot of things and it was fun
because I got to learn the video making
process and editing and all that kind of
stuff but the only reason why I was on
camera before was cuz I had to be dude
you miss the process hmm I'm still
pretty much involved in the process or
at least afterwards won't have to edit
your stuff what's your favorite part of
the process Oh editing your pretty face
Oh
so I think that you would have probably
been one of the greatest tech youtubers
ever if you stuck with it and people
asked like are you still with
TechnoBuffalo did I just say you can't
be in videos anymore that couldn't be
anything farther from the truth truth
truth I couldn't be anything farther
from the truth
I still beg you to come into videos and
just to show up and say hi so the
audience can just see your preface so
maybe tell the folks what you do for
TechnoBuffalo now that maybe they don't
realize you know everything that you do
for the site aside from just being on
video umm well basically I do a lot of
the design and development work nowadays
so Allah by a lot you mean all of it
well I don't want to take all the credit
but yeah I don't know I just do a lot of
the design and development work nowadays
I do some of the video editing and I
work with yourself and their TV folks
you know get their ideas to fruition for
example we released a lot of you know
the big pretty feature like Joey's
Assassin's Creed post and stuff like
that so I'm I'm behind that I guess
John's a little humble anything on the
site that looks nice whether it has to
do with the homepage or an article or
formatting it's all Roy
as is junk watches handiwork John also
is done John also does I'll be editing
for all the revision three videos so he
edits asked the buffalo he had it yeah
at this one it's gonna air get it the
hell out of this one yeah he's from
rumor roundup and he edits threatened
his rants and he's also gonna edit an
upcoming show that we haven't announced
yet fourth show it's secret so if you
could say one thing to the audience and
I can already see the comments saying
how much they miss you and begging you
to come back what do you say to your
legions of fans who are throwing their
undergarments virtually at you right now
oh okay um you should throw them this
way you do not yes they're used make
sure that they use that that's like the
best one user like soiled huh used or
soiled
is a little gross but soiled yes so it's
the best one okay
yeah so what I just reason them to you
know remember what I have to say oh yeah
um I'm still alive don't worry I'm gonna
be here for a long time hopefully um you
better be yeah and I'm still very very
much involved with TechnoBuffalo just no
longer in the video side of things but I
mean I did a CES video this year I'm
probably gonna do another one popcorn
popcorn yeah if people ask enough in the
comments for you to show up in a video
every few months would that be enough to
persuade you to show up in a video every
few months possibly I don't know I guess
you guys have to leave a lot of comments
and and not just this video all of our
videos so if people just not just all of
our videos other videos telling them to
watch our videos so if people just wrote
in the comments for example we want John
Q and if you saw that enough we want
John Q you John Q would show up he'd be
like a genie like or Beetlejuice if you
say your name enough you will appear
sure no one has to rub your lamp though
right huh at least twice twice twice
twice to rub your lamp yes why not three
times what happens after the second time
you know what you know one gross
yeah you take a break from the video for
just one minute to thank our friends at
the air force collaboratory visit the
air force collaboratory at Air Force
comm slash collaboratory work with real
Airmen to solve some of the air force's
toughest science and technology
challenges your idea could change
everything
this hasn't been a very fun episode of
ret injure trance where it wasn't so
Randy but I just wanted you guys to know
that John's still here and I do read all
the questions John is still more
involved in TechnoBuffalo than have

involved in it all so I want to let you
