flagship the u ultra there's also also
you play and it looks like they borrowed
heavily from the V 20 but they got some
cool stuff here I'm not sure what angle
to take on this you know what you have
to do HTC doesn't want you to call to
come back they've been here for years
and they're back with you and they've
got a lot of reasons why they wanted to
call it the you because you just a
letter you do stuff you argue they've
got a whole list of other things that
you do which is why that's their new new
flagship so number one just you because
you are someone something special so let
me tell you about the phone first thing
to highlight feature it's got a two inch
secondary display all of the b20 and
just like the LGB 20 it doesn't
secretary displays do you use it as a
dock you can have it show other
information it's kind of always on it's
pretty cool to have the phone itself
though is a 5.7 inch qHD display which
is awesome you probably like boom I'm
gonna pop that bad boy my daydream Hetch
that get my VR on I got some bad news
for you
and gonna work it's not not daydream
ready so bummer there but on the good
news front they decide to opt for the
128 gigabytes views also a 64gb version
you get a sapphire crystal display so
that's awesome pretty destructible you
go for that 64 gig version though you
are getting the already pretty durable
Gorilla Glass 5 other stuff you'd expect
Android 7.0 out of the box four keys Ram
is going to be standard it's being
powered by the Snapdragon 820 1 which is
a very powerful processor its own right
but certainly it's not the 835 or the a
30 series that we're going to see become
standard and flagship in 2017 so
regardless whether or not you go to 64
or 128 you'll be able to expand that
sucker with micro sd so thumbs up for
expansion dual thumbs up
one for each camera
the camera front HTC's got some nice
sensors built in my sensors HTC I'll see
you on the back it's a 12 megapixel HTC
ultrapixel two sensor so that's nice
also has laser autofocus and OS for all
your way see stuff and the front-facing
camera is higher megapixel edge at 16
megapixels so you could see your your
zits when you take your selfie and like
really high resolution you can blow them
right up make like a wall size picture
of like that's it you got going on like
right there I have I'm sure you already
pointed out the comments so all that
stuff is phone specs you pretty much the
other phone is gonna perform but what's
new here is HTC Sense companion it's an
AI living in your phone it sound like
replacing Google now or any other
third-party says that you want to put on
there since it's going to work with your
phone through notifications and give you
other information you might need
throughout your day so let's say you've
got a full calendar and you're heading
off for a drive to go meet your next
appointment your phone's gonna know that
you've got appointment out there putting
out your appointment it's gonna tell you
hey I might want to charge if you want
to get through the day and you can
charge quick charge 3.0 to get it 6000
power battery up up pretty fast
if it knows you're leaving again it will
advise you on whether and I'll sort of
tell you what's changing throughout the
day it'll learn what you do give you
notifications on that second split
display presumably so that's pretty cool
so the phones do look really nice but
have a chance to get some hands-on with
it at CES but we couldn't take video we
were forboden so the pictures are all
you get on HTC is taking pre-orders
today for the phone again 749 unlocked
we should get a unit in next week but I
wanted to tell you about it here's a
phone let you know if you guys want to
preorder it I'm reserving judgment
though until I get a chance to actually
use the phone phones you guys know in a
perfect print all technologies more than
some of its parts it's more than a spec
sheet it's more than just Rams how the
whole thing comes together in a package
and it looks like HTC II is gonna be a
really nice phone and of course it's
also the Play version I forget some more
information on that will link to it down
below I need you guys also want hands on
with that will do that too we get the
phones and presumably sometime
early February so let us know what you
think about the U is it before you I've
been saving that one in my back pocket
they started the video let us know down
below if we like your comment or it's
especially funny or telling me not to
worry about the zit on my face well pin
it to the top and you can get more
subscribers people will be like hey that
commenter is clever so leave it all down
below make sure your applications are
turned on so you know when you take them
buffalo biffle o TechnoBuffalo videos
are coming I'm gonna let go now if you
see you come too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
