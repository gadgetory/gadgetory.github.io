review for you of halo wars for the xbox
360 I don't do many game reviews in fact
this is my first one but this game
really piqued my interest enough that I
wanted to share my thoughts with you
guys so the game are reviewing is halo
wars it's an RTS or real-time strategy
game made specifically for the xbox 360
it was made by in sample studios the
same folks that did the age of empire
series and flows you that may not know
what a real time strategy game is
similar to starcraft the upcoming
starcraft 2 in the original Warcraft
games before the world of came out
essentially what it is you manage
resources you build armies you build
defenses and you go and attack other
people and it's each game is really a
new experience you can build different
armies you can have different strategies
and you really get a chance to
strategize hence the strategy part of
the game so unfortunately I can't show
you gameplay video but plenty of that is
available if you just do a quick search
due to legal reasons but I can't share
our pictures of the game and I'll show
kind of them talk me and reviewing it so
the premise of the game is really very
simple there's a level that you can play
through but the plot is really
non-existent essentially all you do
build your armies and you attack people
the strength of this game really lies in
the xbox live on my integration you can
play with one two three four friends you
can join up one on one or two on two or
even three on three in some maps and
more maps are supposedly coming as well
so you have to learn to manage your
resources and you learn the maps you
learn the best attacks and you can go
ahead and proceed that way so the box
for the game I kind of did a silly
unboxing for Halo Wars almost as a joke
and it turned out I really ended up
loving the game yeah I don't have that
much free time but the time that i do
have when I'm not reading I am you guys
will see me online playing this in fact
I'm even plate with some of you out
there I'm not saying whether I won or
lost but I did play looks like you guys
if we have some more experience than I
do so again real-time strategy so what
you do in Halo Wars you can play as
either a covenant the
bad guys from the original Halo games
one two and three or you can play as the
USMC which is the American British and
kind of good guys against the bad guy
aliens and the very cool thing about it
is during the original Halo series their
only was once part and left and that was
Master Chief now you can control up to
40 Spartans if you like and they have a
lot of unique abilities so that's a lot
of fun and then you go when you build
your defenses and you can like i said
earlier attack other units now you can
also play as a covenant which is very
neat as well they have their own
strengths and abilities you can choose
between three different this covenant
troops or a UNSC troops each of them
have their own strengths as well really
use a lot of fun guys it's not that much
talk about when those games really have
to go out and play if you don't want to
go out and buy it I definitely recommend
downloading the demo really is something
that I enjoyed and I think you guys will
like it too now wait just a real quick
