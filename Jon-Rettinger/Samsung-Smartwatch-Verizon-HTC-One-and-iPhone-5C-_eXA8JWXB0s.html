to you by AMD what's up everyone welcome
back to the episode of a rumor roundup
I'm your host John render and listen I
know the tech world comes at you fast
and rumors come out quicker than
unreleased Tupac songs that's why we've
got rumor roundup will take all the
rumors from the week and condense them
smash them bash them and serve them up
to you on a silver platter of rumor
awesomeness up this week the samsung
Smart Watch just won't die I have bad
news for you verizon HTC One hopeful
owners iphone 5cs getting more legit and
the note 3 specs are getting more and
more official this is rumor roundup
let's go ahead and get rounding up Dick
Tracy taught us anything again I fully
realized sixty percent of you aren't
gonna get the reference it's that Yellow
Jackets are damn cool Madonna can't act
and wearable technology is the future it
looks like Samsung wants to usher in
this brand new era for us rumor mill is
telling us that Samsung Smart Watch may
already be in testing according to a
shipping record published on very
reputable Indian website zabba the
report notes that three copies of
Samsung's watch were shipped on july 24
for R&amp;amp;D purposes from south korea to
bangalore india where the company runs a
software operations unit we also see
that each unit is valued at 24,000 442
indian rupees which do your math what is
it equal to four hundred and ten dollars
though the final price for samsung Smart
Watch will likely be significantly less
I want this mass produced at least I'm
hoping it will be whether we like it or
not wearable tech is coming and it looks
like it's coming pretty fast you excited
about a samsung Smart Watch I'd guess
it's gonna have a lot of water drops
sound effects in it then I'm probably
gonna find a way to turn off the note 3
specs are starting to leak out earlier
in the week we got some new benchmark
hotness that I wanted to share is
published by gfxbench allegedly
confirming some of the phablet specs the
samsung galaxy note 3 is expected to
support a 5.7 inch display which is by
my awesome math point 2 inches bigger
than the note 2 1080p on a giant screen
yes and I Audrina of 330 GPU and run the
latest Android 4.3 jelly bean all the
test model appears to be running
android 4.2 point2 i am excited about
the galaxy note 3 i'm also excited to
put cyanogen mod on it and use some pure
android awesomeness but I love big
phones on I cannot wait to see the next
Galaxy Note which will come hopefully
right before or at IFA amberlynn which
we will be at in attendance and taking a
look at it hopefully in person Verizon
folks waiting for HTC one you might want
to sit down grab a cold glass of water
and just kick up your feet she got a
while to wait remember earlier this
month when Verizon leaked roadmap
unveiled their carrier would finally get
HTC One in August first well yeah not
gonna happen so with really now it
already being August first I probably
passed by time you watch this video the
rumored release date it looks like
verizon has bumped the launch back yet
again another two weeks two extra weeks
though should give the network plenty of
time to build some hype for the already
popular handset and coincidentally one
of my favorite phones of the year but
it's possible the release was pushed
back so i won't be overshadowed by
Motorola's Moto X the iphone 5c is the
big rumor and at this point it's really
shouldn't surprise anyone so add more
fuel to the rumor fire we got tim cook
in China he's not there for delicious
food we know already that he met with
china mobile the world's largest
wireless carrier and now he's back in
china talking up the low-cost iPhone 5c
I've what really needs a renewed focus
on China particularly as local vendors
and Samsung rude run away like crazy
with its market share iphone 5c is
expected to be the company's more
affordable I back post more affordable
budget handset which should make it way
more attractive to consumers who
otherwise just either can't afford an
apples product where's our interest in
spending that money for it so China
Mobile meanwhile hasn't offered an
iphone yet will likely launch in other
emerging markets such as India and will
be offered any variety of colors hence
the Steve does not stand for cheap
whatever you guys might say it and for
multiple colors do you excited for the
iphone 5c i also want to hear your
thoughts leave them you know what to do
we step away from the rumors for a
minute to thank our friends and sponsors
at AMD i've got in front of me the acer
aspire v5 touch and the coolest thing
about this guy is how portable it is the
a5 chip is so tiny can literally fit on
your fingernail which means you're going
to get pretty ball or battery life with
also awesome
Mormons so for me we go to events all
the time need a laptop is gonna last for
hours and hours and hours i type in live
blog and make really bad jokes and this
is the perfect computer processor combo
for me so if you're a college student
you're a journalist you just want a lot
of battery life but also the performance
fire up a few games are to look no
farther than AMD's a five series of
chips step away for just a quick second
remind you that I host another show
called TechnoBuffalo driven where I do
not talk about smartphones or tablets
but I talk about cars and this week it's
all about the electric BMW i3 the first
and BMWs knew I lied and it looks pretty
sweet it looks like a European people
mover if you want to know all about it
