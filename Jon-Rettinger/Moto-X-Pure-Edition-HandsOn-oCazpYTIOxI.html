Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo taking a
first look at the Moto X style also
known as the Moto X pure edition in the
United States so in the u.s. pure
edition outside the style really awesome
looking phone here so you get a 5.7 inch
display here it's quad HD and it comes
in at a 520 pixels per inch so really
really sharp I'm trying to bring it in a
little bit but I got the focus lock any
case you're looking here in Android 5.5
or 5.1 one swift really quick the whole
point is motorola wants to keep any pure
experience as you already know but they
add in some of the other things like
motorola assist where you can talk to
your phone have a reading a text
messages stuff like that let's go around
the body so you get this nice metal
border
3.5 millimeter headphone jack up the top
and it looks like that's gonna be the
SIM card tray on the back of 21
megapixel camera with the dual LED flash
switch true tone on the right you've got
the power button and the volume toggle
controls on the bottom regular micro USB
port so no USB see here and then on the
front you've got a 5 megapixel camera
right up top there with its own LED
flash which is pretty neat and you also
have front-facing speakers so great for
a stereo experience but otherwise real
thing like I said the 5 megapixel camera
up front has a f-stop 2.0 aperture
wide-angle lens the 21 megapixel camera
on back Motorola's promising is going to
be one of the best in the industry so
they're really going up against the
galaxy s6 iPhone 6 g4 and stuff like
that which is pretty incredible under
the hood you've got a Snapdragon 808
processor so moves around pretty swiftly
that's the same thing that we had in the
Jeep or and you also get three gigabytes
of RAM which isn't too bad again when to
with the light Android skin like that
you should be pretty good 16 gigabytes
32 gigabytes or 64 gigabytes of storage
that's expandable not sure where perhaps
you can bring off the top or maybe it's
doubling up right there with the SIM
card slot which we've seen before I
haven't really taken it apart but again
the highlight is going to be the 5.7
inch
quad-hd and all the specs that come in
at a starting price of 399 which is
pretty awesome now you can expect that
price to go up as you customize the pack
with different covers there's a lot of
premium materials available through moto
maker you add in more storage and all of
a sudden that's going to cost a bit more
but a really nice device and playing
with it here you know no bloatware
pretty sweet so this is Todd Hazleton
with TechnoBuffalo checking out the Moto
X style also known as the Moto X pure
edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
