technobuffalo here I sent out a post on
Twitter to ask you guys to send me
questions to see what it is that you
want to know me that about me or about
technology I get a lot of questions
overall whether it be a Twitter personal
email or YouTube email this is nice
opportunity for you be able to answer
some of the questions that I think maybe
others might have as well so let's go
ahead and get started the first question
I'm looking over here it's cuz i'm
reading the questions comes from QB
universe John how long does it usually
take for you to make a video well Q
universe it depends on the video if I'm
doing an unboxing for example generally
that something I gotta do in one cake so
in a film it let's say take six minutes
to do my editing really depends on what
I'm putting in I'd say editing probably
about 45 minutes to an hour maybe
minimum sometimes a little bit longer
than exporting time so usually per video
i'm probably looking at a good 2 i'd say
two hours is a fair estimate / video so
I hope that answers your question the
next one comes from user xle de Kamp
nut-brown surname Exodia John what was
the main goal during the creation of
technobuffalo and I talked about this
during the introduction video the main
goal was really to create a place where
you could go to get original technology
content to learn how to do things that
maybe to know how to do so how to's and
to learn more about news in a very video
centric way I think that the technology
blogging is evolving I think the
standard text and a few picture format
is dying and that people like the
interactivity and they like to be able
to really see a product kind of 360 I
want to create an immersive environment
that was really what Brandon I we're
looking to do create a platform where
people could talk to each other so the
social network but also there are a lot
of aspiring tecra viewers out there and
I get a lot of messages from them so
technobuffalo is going to give them a
voice give them a platform to make their
own site and if they do a good job you
know we'll post that that content on the
techno
main site getting them more exposure and
also you know since they're doing the
work and putting out the content have
them get a chance to make some money
from it too it really just only seem
fair so moving right along the next
question is from user young ace LX John
what do you think is under apple the
battle for making an iphone to replace
the iphone HTC windows mobile blackberry
or android liquidy saying is what i
think is going to possibly usurp the
iphone in terms of usability and finger
friendliness and I think the best
candidate for that has got to be Android
saying what HTC has done with the hero
saying what Android itself as we come
with the mytouch 3G with the g1 and
these new samsung android devices coming
out you know it's very impressive i
think the android has a ton of potential
so I really gotta put my weight behind
Android it also has one thing going for
it that the iphone doesn't then it can
be released on multiple carriers the
iphone right now is locked to AT&amp;amp;T there
could be a hot android device for
tmobile for sprint for verizon and for
AT&amp;amp;T really just broadening the user
base which would be quite nice for the
developers might be the android
marketplace even bigger so i think that
android probably has the best chance
let's move right along that question is
from Aaron Cook what your favorite shows
to watch well what's on my DVR right now
and what I watch probably a little bit
different since shows are on hiatus I'm
a big fan of true blood I like entourage
I'm a big fan of madmen I like the new
show hung on HBO I just started watching
californication i love the office I like
I used to like my name is earl till it
canceled it you know there are a lot of
shows that i like summers were popular
than others but over all those are kind
of my my highlight if you will i'm sure
i missed a few oh and lost God love lost
ok so the next question comes from user
keither 24 at this point what would you
do with your map would you buy a mac pro
well if i was getting a new computer
right now
I would buy a mac pro ch because I do a
decent out of video editing having extra
horsepower would certainly help however
I'm quite happy with my imac I have no
plans right now to purchase a mac pro
but if I was to get a new one it would
be probably be mac pro so the next
question comes from Rafael same deals as
a Mac user do you think max can be used
by professionals like for example
engineers or should they stay with
windows it's actually a really good
question first I think max can
absolutely be used by professionals and
the fact that they can't i think is a
very common misconception I think
anything that you could do on a PC could
you want to Mac in the OS Ted
environment I found that there is almost
an equivalent for every piece of Windows
software on the mac side the argument
that max couldn't be used for
professionals I think is a dying
argument I think people are starting to
realize that as I start going to the
apple stores I start learning more about
Max that being said if there is
something that windows only the beauty I
think about Mac especially the
intel-based Macs is that you can run
bootcamp you can have the best of both
worlds you can have a full native
windows machine sitting right next to
your Mac machine so really you can have
both options I think in that respect the
mac is absolutely the way to go the next
question comes from Adrienne law one
where do you think palm will go with the
webos do you think palms App Store can
become strong enough to rival apples I
am a huge fan of the palm particular the
webos I've gone on record for saying it
said in my reviews I think it's a
fantastic platform that is in its
infancy i think is only going to grow
think they need to be more devices need
to be on more carriers but i absolutely
think that the larger the user bates
similar with android the more apps are
going to be in palms app catalog and
that just a natural progression i think
that the larger it's going to get the
more we're going to see I think once the
exclusivity from sprint ends and we see
the pre on verizon and hopefully
ultimately on ATT and tmobile I think
we're definitely going to see their app
catalogue start to grow so the next
question comes from bo go ad what is the
biggest reason you would tell us about
to switch to mac as opposed to the PC
elaborate please well the biggest reason
that I generally tell people to switch
to max is well this for the average user
who doesn't always defragment their
computer doesn't go through and do this
is the pc user but does it go through
and do pc maintenance their computer is
going to slow down so take your parents
for example or a nun techie friend it's
going to slow down and you're going to
get crashes biggest reason I tell people
to go to Mac is because you're not going
to get that slow down yours least
exactly that pronounced and you're not
going to get those regular crashes
certainly if you monitor your pc and you
take a care of it with utilities and
tools you can keep your pc running
fantastically fast but like i said
photo/lee that don't I think the match
for the stability standpoint is a better
way to go you certainly can get viruses
for the mattock but the odds of getting
one are much less because aren't as many
viruses that are written for OS 10 so I
think stability I think it's a lot
easier to use as well a lot easier to
learn I think the learning curve is not
very steep so those would be the biggest
reasons i would tell someone to switch
to mac / pc plus you can run all your pc
app fight on your mac either virtualize
it or just boot camp it somebody you can
have both that kind of helps people
transition so the next question comes
from fie on d John do you know where I
left my Swiss Army knife I believe it
was in your jeans pocket on the floor so
go ahead and check it out anyway guys
