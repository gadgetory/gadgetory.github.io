boxing i just want to give a big thank
you to the youtube community I can't
believe that in just about seven months
you know we've hit over 2,000
subscribers here and over 85,000 channel
views it's unbelievable you know thank
you I never would have expected when I
first started this that it would be this
far reaching and we'll have hopefully
helped as many people you know I just
started off with an account just find a
way to review some or get some reviews
for Mac videos i was looking to buy my
computer my first mac and i want to
build least some comments people asking
questions so really nice to have that
opportunity you know the first guy
interacted with on youtube here is guy
named danny is ace still making great
videos he had a macbook pro at the time
so he answered a lot of my questions and
hopefully i've been able to do the same
for other people i know i'm not always
the best to the entering your questions
that quickly unfortunately i do get a
lot of them i get about 50 or 60
questions a day so i do try and get to
them all just takes me a little while
please be patient but really perverse
this video's to thank you guys you know
thank you for supporting me thank you
for supporting my channel and the blog
now and you know just a general thank
you guys you know without your support
and without your questions and that your
suggestions this never would have been a
never been a success so trying to give a
big thank you guys and yeah that's all I
got I got some more videos coming up i
also have a way to actually give thanks
to you guys that I'm working on so look
for that maybe the next week or so

community and help people get some get
some exposure so anyway guys I hope you
