audible the best way to take your audio
books with you anywhere you want to go
on any device you want to use two phones
seemingly identical looking we got the
iPhone eight plus and the iPhone 7 plus
if you can't tell the difference between
these two phone by looking at the front
you are like most people because I was
kind of lying to you this is the A+ and
this is a 7 plus they look identical
from the front the back and the
internals are another story I know a lot
of you guys are debating whether or not
to upgrade to the 8 maybe you want to
wait for the iPhone 10 or maybe you're
coming from an older iPhone or Android
so I want to take these two phones and
compare them head-to-head and decide if
you should pick up the iPhone 8 stick
with what you've got
or perhaps wait for the 10 or another
device let's jump in I'm gonna focus
mostly on the plus miles here since
those are the higher end of the devices
but the non plus models almost
everything when to talk about it's going
to be pretty close to identical so
looking at these phones they look very
similar in fact the iPhone 8 is the
fourth iteration of the iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 plus design that we've seen not
say it's a bad design but it is a very
familiar design but it's definitely the
best version of it and I mentioned the
Front's of these devices look identical
but I was actually surprised how
different the backs actually look with
the glass back and the glass back brings
one big difference with two phones you
are getting qi wireless charging and
I'll talk about Apple's air power thing
that's coming some time next year this
is true wireless charging I put this
phone on my samsung wireless fast
charger and it wirelessly charge which
is really nice to have about having to
deal with a third party case wireless
charging is a big deal for me it may not
be a giant deal for you but if out the
convenience was putting your phone on a
pad huge props to the iPhone and I guess
the apples monitor here is was better
like than ever but it is definitely here
another surprising difference between
the phones is actually the colors so the
iPhone eights are available in silver
space grey and gold and all three colors
look vastly different than the last gen
phones so I've got the silver right here
which i think is actually a beautiful
color but it doesn't look silver looks
more eggshell white the goal
as more of a muted gold the space gray
is kind of a darkish black gray hue
different than sort of the straight and
matte black we had with the last gen the
colors are very different I imagined by
designs the phones can look different if
you want a phone that's going to sort of
just aesthetically appear to be a
different device it did a nice job with
the eight actually really liked all
three colors I'm gonna get the same
things out of the way about these phones
the big disappointment for me other
screens the same 5.5 inch 1080p 401 PPI
screens we've seen for years it's not a
bad screen they just don't look just
crisp you flock what's the opposite of
crispy soggy soggy I mean it looks a
little soggy if you used a modernist
Samsung device you can see definitely
see a difference in the screen and
that's where you may want to wait for
the iPhone 10 it's getting a higher res
screen there's actually going to be made
by Samsung it does bring a true tone
display which is nice it doesn't do that
much for me you can sort of change the
way the screen looks spending on your
environment it's fine
it's not gonna be a differentiating
factor we're not you should buy the
phone or upgrade from the seven so the
mortal here despite true tone display
the screens our screens are pretty much
identical from purely spec standpoint
these phones read almost identical at
least on paper same camera hump and all
they both had the same from 12 9 pixel
sensor the same set of megapixel sensor
on the front the same wide-angle F 1.8
aperture in the same 2.8 telephoto so
the a 11 Bionic chip inside which we'll
talk more about it's gonna do a lot more
processing than what the a10 fusion chip
could do so the pictures are going to
look different despite the hardware
being relatively similar so bear that in
mind
there's obviously a big difference on
paper with the a 11 chip versus previous
generation I thought what's that going
to mean to the end-user Apple's not
about raw horsepower about user
experience and it's a fast user
experience on the iPhone 8 I never
thought the 7 plus was a slow foam but
you see the difference here opening up
apps opens up faster on the iPhone 8
plus that's something you gonna notice
and perhaps will add up over time to a
lot of time other things you're gonna do
like gaming of course are here a Ark
it's gonna be nice and fast I think
you're gonna be very quick on the iPhone
8 and if you want a phone that's going
to last you for years
I get the feeling the iPhone 8 and 8
plus are going to be a foam that's going
to be quick for a long time the
difference appears to be drastic over
the iPhone 7 plus the A+ has a bit of a
smaller battery but supposedly processor
improvements on the a11 will know that
milliamp hour difference they should get
the same battery life on both devices
price a big trimming factor now if you
pick up any phone the iPhone 7 and 7
plus are still obviously less expensive
options starting at 549 or $6.99
depending on the 8th of 7 or the plus
the 8 got a $50 price bump or what they
used to be when the 7 and 7 plus was new
it's now at $6.99 or $7.99 as your
baseline I want to thank my friends
audible for making this vs. video
possible you probably know audible
chances are already using audible but if
you are not you should definitely check
them out this is what I use anytime I am
in my car right now I'm listening to
James Patterson's black a book it's my
third book by him I really like the guy
who's doing the narration on it but I
change phones a lot so I love the fact
that I can always pick up where I was in
my audio book for that I'm using the new
iPhone 8 or the Galaxy Note II transfers
all the books over for me went on a bit
of a kick with historical fiction now
I'm back to kind of regular fiction I'm
waiting for the new
Dan Brown book to hit sometime next
month it's the next one in the Robert
Langdon series so I'll be my next book
we've got more than books there -
they've got original audio shows they
got news comedy kind of anything you can
listen to audibles giving away a free
30-day trial you also get a free
audiobook to go with that if you want to
check it out go to audible.com slash
techno we link to it here and also down
below so that's my opinion on the iPhone
8 and a plus but what I think doesn't
matter when you think of what you do
with your dollars do and are you gonna
put that hard-earned cash towards a
brand new shiny phone let me know in the
comments down below
find a comment that gives a good insight
we'll pin it to the top and you can you
can be be well-known there until next
time I'm John Ranger and techno-bubble</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
