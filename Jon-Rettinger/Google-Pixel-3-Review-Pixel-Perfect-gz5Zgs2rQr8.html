from TechnoBuffalo and if you couldn't
tell this is the pixel 3 XL this is our
review of it so this review went through
a few different versions so my initial
thoughts changed after a few days and
that changed after a week now after 3
weeks of using it I think I know the
phone pretty well your perspective
that's gonna be a bit different I also
think it's a testament to the quality of
the device and the importance of really
using a phone or anything you're
reviewing for a long period of time
because it totally changed my mind for
me there are two reasons somebody would
really buy any pixel through 3xl
included a kick-ass camera and a pure
Android experience with guaranteed years
of updates so I'm gonna kind of work
backwards here if one of those to your
top reasons to buy a phone then just go
out and buy the pixel 3 or 3 XL
you're gonna get exactly that but if you
don't fall into that box keep watching
this may or may not be the phone for you
and so while this review is gonna focus
mostly on the XL the 3 is pretty much
the exact same phone save for screen
resolution size and and no knotch but
most of the points that I'm gonna
mention here are gonna work for it it's
not jealous little bro 2 so it's making
a notch let's just do it the notch it's
there it's deep it's like myriad of
emoji and takes or otherwise be a pretty
classy looking package and kind of hugs
it up my issue with the notch though
isn't it's very existence like some it's
how Google used it it's not housing some
sort of crazy advanced facial scanning
it's just a front-facing cameras and
speakers and few ambient sensors things
that pretty much every phone pre 2016
had at the top if you aren't adding
something new why bother adding the
notch at all just take the Samsung
approach with slim top and bottom bezels
and also a nice side effect you'd make
that gigantic chin it seemed a little
bit less less Chinee and if you're
buying this phone chances are you're not
gonna care about that notch at all and
to be totally honest I can deal with the
ugly design because the software is so
good I just wish I didn't have to and
also a small note start I feel kind of
antiquated it using the fingerprint
unlock in the back with phones now going
facial unlocking or in
Green but to its credit despite its
location didn't lock pretty fast the
only other real negatives the pixel 3xl
aren't what it has it's what it doesn't
have 4 gigabytes of RAM for a flagship
it's gonna be the current model until
like around October 2019
by then 1 plus 7 or 70 is probably gonna
be up to 32 gigs of ram or something
just ridiculous like that so it's a
phones credit the lack of RAM doesn't
sell the experience down although I did
notice that some apps what happens to
reload again if I try to opening the
apps that opened up earlier in the day
the overall software experience though
was gonna be crazy smooth and things
come along as quickly as any other phone
on the market like it sir mr. Ram though
isn't today it's more of the future
you're planning on keeping this phone
when Android Q or R hit I'm going to bed
you're gonna feel the lack of gigabytes
data so that's it those are really the
only negatives you're gonna find here on
the pixel 3 XL this is a really good
phone as it exists right now towards the
end of 2018 so the pixel 2 XL took a big
hit for the screen and Google righted
that ship this time around the 6.3 inch
qHD plus panel looks really good
it's not like a Samsung level but it's
good enough you're not gonna notice it
but being bad colors look great and
since it's OLED blacks or black games
movies whatever you're doing you're
gonna look good there is a slight blue
hue I only noticed it when I held it
directly to another phone so unless
you're walking around like this with
another phone you're not really gonna
notice it so the screen isn't the only
area where Google really stepped up
since last year wireless charging is
here and also improved water resistance
and with wireless charging you're gonna
get a glass back makes a device feel
awesome in the hand and to me it feels
way better than the aluminum on the two
than 2 XL I kind of just really liked
holding it well the glass bag does look
and feel awesome I don't care how strong
any company's gonna claim their glasses
it's going to scratch and eventually
crack if you drop it especially the
black I love to panda look on last
year's phone so I just slapped a deep
brand skin and arse to protect the back
between evitable scratches and I kind of
dug the aesthetic try to put one on
yours we'll just link to them down below
but oh that's sweet sweet sweet camera
we actually did a whole video delving
onto the camera and how it compared to
the iPhone 10s but here are the
highlights it's good like really good
and at this point after all the camera
success the pixel to you'd expect this
to be amongst the best in the industry
and Google did not disappoint their
colors and sharpness and details are all
pretty close to perfect low-light was
awesome as well it's really good in
every situation so the default settings
you're not gonna get oversaturated
colors like you get on kind of most
Samsung but the colors are pretty close
to lifelike but the most impressive to
me though is portrait mode even with the
single lens the camera shines this is
restart to see the advantage of Google
with their crazy magic machine learning
it's incredible how it handles things
that other phones regards to how many
sensors they have struggle with things
like hair and edges in if there's a
cutout in the subject it's just
impressive how well it handles
everything without that second sensor
that most phones rely on for depth those
aren't the only cameras there's two
living in that notch so you've got one
regular selfie camera and one wide-angle
camera which is pretty killer for group
selfies portrait mode predictably works
which is not nearly as well as a rear
one if you want a selfie in portrait
mode at least doesn't have kind of an
over aggressive noise reduction that
gives you that weird beauty mode there
were some occasional though
inconsistencies with portrait mode on
the front-facing camera
so check this out I swear I'm not that
orange in real life and it wasn't like a
crazy sunset and another shot when I had
to make two kids on my lap I had a
really tough time finding focus other
things you might care about battery life
and the 3430 million power battery was
really solid leaving me with about 35
percent end of the day the most screen
on time that I had was 7 hours but the
moral being
it's a dare it'll get you through a full
day no problem don't expect like two or
three days just plug in at night or
wirelessly charge
last and probably most important to a
lot of you the software Android PI
out-of-the-box is amazing I wasn't the
biggest fan of gestures at first then I
got used to them and kind of start to
appreciate the nuances it's incredibly
smooth if not totally intuitive at the
beginning so it's got the squeeze for
Google assistant that's a feature to
easily laugh off heck I've been laughing
it off since HTC they booted a few years
ago but the last week using the phone I
started using it and I found it kind of
useful but what is probably the best
feature of the phone is call screening
so for a while I was averaging about
three spam calls per day actually pay
for a service to block them while I was
using the pixel 3xl I would like wheat
for a spam call to come and just like it
see it in action
this alone is like a low key reason to
buy the pixel although it should come to
the pixel to family as well if you got
one of those speaking of two or two XL
you can probably safely hold off for
another years you've got one of those
phones but if you're coming from the og
pixel any other Android phone or an
iPhone this is a perfect entry level
into Android that's almost guaranteed to
give you an amazing experience and
almost all I said here is true again for
the pixel 3 and it's also gonna save you
a hundred bucks you get almost exactly
the same phone if you don't have to have
the high resolution and the bigger
screen they make the same experience and
performance just just not too low this
time around so that's the pixel 3 XL if
you want a phone that's not just the
best Android phone on the market but
arguably one of the best phones you can
buy give it a look I don't think you're
gonna be disappointed
so for me there are two reasons somebody
would buy a pickle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
