to you by jack threats welcome back to
the episode of rumor roundup this to
show we take all the tech room is from
the week we condense them into one
little can of Awesomeness so of this
week we're gonna talk about newfangled
version of Wi-Fi and may be coming to
max Samsung's teasing a new TV design
iphone 5s might start matching its iPod
Touch brothers are coming in different
colors but also might come in different
sizes Samsung he was aiming to sell at
least one teasin tizon based iPhone in
2013 this is rumor roundup let's go and
get started you finally have new IMX
already there are rumors of the next
generation Mac computers coming out soon
according to a new report apples and
talks with broadcom to add 802 11 AC
Wi-Fi support to 2013 lineup of new macs
you might hear that being referred to as
5g wireless don't confuse that with the
4g LTE this is a fifth generation of
Wi-Fi technology so if you see 5g it's
802 11 AC it's follow-up to 802 11 n
particular cases I would appear that the
broadcom chips are not yet ready for the
deal but shouldn't be too long until
they are as with each new Wi-Fi standard
it takes forever for it to catch on so
don't expect 802 11 AC to come on right
away the standards actually not even yet
finalized with rumors of refreshed
MacBook Pros and macbook air models
coming in june seems like a pretty
logical time all those rumors been
proven false in the past but maybe at
some point it's got to be proven true so
with the introduction of 802 11 AC i
wouldn't be surprised to also see
airport extremes it's an AC action as
well so if you're like me and you bought
a new samsung TV in 2012 you might be a
little disappointed it looks like
Samsung's getting ready to unleash a
brand new TV design at CES which is
coming up in just a few days Samsung is
dropping some super cryptic clues about
what we can expect to see from the
company in the way of televisions at CES
2013 LG has been spewing off information
left and right and center but what TVs
will be showing at CES next week Samsung
has been a little more
Destin of what they're going to be
announced all they really said so far is
that they're gonna be an overhaul to
their smart hub which yay the first
thing to show up with the image you see
right here and a post along with the
following text a true innovation of TV
design is coming up with an
unprecedented new shape and timeless
gallery design that was solid up by this
weird video so who knows what's going to
come maybe a crazy new design TV maybe a
TV with wireless power of some sort of
inductive charging chances are though
the thin bezel we see on samsung tvs can
get even thinner maybe they'll go 20 LED
and look call it a new fancy design and
that'll be the day but only a few
minutes until we know the answer the
iPhone 5 is only a few months oh but the
iphone 5s might not be that far behind
it Topeka Capital analyst Brian White
recently published a note that suggests
that apple will launch the iphone 5s in
a variety of colors with multiple screen
sizes according to him our checks
indicate the next iPhone will have more
choices for customers so although apple
offers a four-inch screen on the iPhone
and a 3.5 inch on the 4s and the iphone
for the company has never offered
multiple screen sizes for a single model
white continued so take all that with a
giant like head size of grain of salt
we'd love to see apple launched iphone
5s color choice is currently available
in the ipod touch line but i'm not quite
sure i'm ready to believe the rumor
quite yet it seems more likely to me
that the hue options will remain white
and black and that the multiple screen
sizes likely a reference to the iphone
4s remaining on sale alright and lastly
let's jump back to samsung evidently
samsung is aiming to sell a teasin based
iphone in 2013 going to a new report
from japan's daily yo memory samsung is
preparing his first teasin based phone
for released in japan in various other
countries throughout Asia and Europe in
early 2013 which last time I checked is
kind of now a speculation seems to be
focusing on the device make its debut at
Mobile World Congress ass up coming
februari in spate and of course will be
there to cover it isn't the first time
though that T's and releases seemed
imminent as recently as this past May it
was said we check to see devices in the
second out of 2012 but certainly that
didn't happen so there T is inter Tizen
I'm not gonna try and get involved in
that I'm gonna stake Tizen the only
second pounds of both ways and be right
one of them Tizen is Korean
developed by ntt docomo samsung intel
core vodafone group france telecom
Panasonic NEC and other assorted
European mobile service companies in the
hopes of making a more open operating
system currently some of the carriers
are feeling restricted by Android which
was supposed to be open and iOS because
difficult to impose their own add-on
music services app stores and other
potential revenue streams the plan for
the new OS is to be truly open allowing
anyone to work on it and release some of
the grip us-based firms have had on the
burgeoning smartphone market NTT DoCoMo
in particular said to really be pushing
hard for the new OS dude with being the
only one of the three Japanese carriers
not to carry the iphone due to this fact
though the company has been losing
subscribers in droves just as past
November it's not more contract
cancellations than new subscribers for
the first time in five years markets
already getting super crowded with OSS
you got a android iOS Windows Phone an
upcoming blackberry 10 can sustain
another one that sort of has yet to be
seen so let me take a minute to thank
