at unparalleled in design for most of
the year 12 months though can bring out
the best in the competition and the s9
enters a competitive flagship world
filled with high-end specs and just
notches everywhere can the STI and the
s9 plus keep Samsung on top most
importantly is it worth the premium
price I'm John retina from TechnoBuffalo
and this is our review of the galaxy s 9
for full disclosure most this review is
going to focus on the s9 Plus which I
use for almost two and a half weeks
before filming it was super important
for me to get to know the phone before
rushing out a review I really liked the
s8 but there were two major problems
with it no stereo speakers and the
mattingly place fingerprint reader
Samsung clearly listened to consumers
and fix both of these making the
earpiece work double duty as a speaker
and moving the fingerprint reader
where it should have been all along
below the camera or cameras depending on
whether that you've got the s9 at the s9
plus speakers here are 1.4 times louder
but what matters is that they actually
sound decent and now I can actually find
and use the fingerprint reader it's
starting to be less a matter of opinion
and more matter of fact that Samsung
makes the best screens in the business
and for the most part the 5.8 inch and
6.2 inch quad HD Super AMOLED panels are
unchanged from last year the resolution
is the same at 29 60 by 1440 but now
they get 15% brighter
making the screens way easy to see
outdoors and I get it might not sound
like much but in the real world testing
it makes a gigantic difference though
the brightness improvements aside the
screen still look like there's a sticker
on there not real screens colors a
Samsung likes to do or oversaturated a
bit but they look incredible in black
levels as you'd expect our killer it's a
pleasure to watch videos on but gaming
can kind of be a bit squirrely do the
super thin bezels but I am happy to make
that trade for the slim design which is
also slightly trimmed down from the s8
it was a curious decision for Samsung to
essentially fork the s9 line with the s9
plus getting the second camera and 6
gigabytes of RAM versus 4 gigabytes on
the s9
I loved that was essentially the same
phone safer screen size on the
seyton ESA plus I don't agree with it
but no the phones are not the same both
phones are the first ones on the block
to get the qualcomm snapdragon 845 chips
javis you're gonna benchmark well but
synthetic scores don't really matter in
real-world usage they forty-fives other
claim to fame aside from performance and
battery improvements it's supposed to be
what Qualcomm is calling ultra HD
premium which supports a wider color
gamut such as REC 2020 that's gonna give
you more colors considerably more shades
of existing colors in ten bit HDR which
is a mouthful those improvements though
Wortley noticeable either but maybe it's
more to do with the content I was
watching what this boils down to those
aren't that many improvements right now
at a 45 which is kind of supporting but
I would imagine start to see these
changes in the coming months as software
carts take advantage of what I think is
the awesome hardware in here and
speaking of software its Android eight
point out of the box not eight point one
which is kind of a bummer
Samsung has been a bit better at pushing
the point one updates in the art pushing
the full new Android versions but if you
decided to pick one of these up resign
yourself to only getting Oreo and be
pleasantly surprised if and when Android
P ever comes but you are gonna get
though with the s9 s9 + is the latest
version of Samsung experience it's quick
and that's far I have had no slowdowns
at all I get that's a preference thing
but at least be open-minded going in
I don't think gonna be disappointed so
well good it's not perfect though
there's no duplicate apps but Google
offers which is kind of annoying I'm
looking at you internet browser nobody
uses I also don't like having a separate
galaxy app store I've covered Samsung's
UI at length so I won't go too much into
it here Bixby is also here same with its
nan a reprogrammable button that is some
new tricks like calorie counting some AR
makeup stuff the ability to translate
words which you look in the corner it's
just gonna say it's using Google
Translate it is free solid
over-performing like phone tasks but as
an assistant and slow to respond and
doesn't always answer the questions
right all the time
so Samsung is getting into the live
emoji game with a are emojis think of
them like HD versions of the Nintendo me
and it's super easy to just view the
uses an emoji knockoffs but a lot of
ways they do more is a few seconds
they're gonna create one of your face
and the facial tracking is pretty
impressive even the ability to track my
face that's my individual dancing
eyebrows I like get a create to Jeff's
automatically for different situations
it can be used in any messaging app
it's a pretty cool implementation that
feels more custom than emoji but in all
honesty I forgot they were there after
just a few days anyway
the biggest change of the s9 and s9 plus
is with the camera Samsung is touting
dual aperture as a flagship feature
which both the SI and s9 plus you have
it's a big Hardware change but it
doesn't really have significant impact
in the real world like a pareo ts8
you'll notice a slightly sharper
background outdoors but that's probably
also due to 2.4 aperture indoor
sharpness and background look very
similar the dual camera set up on the s9
plus just adds the optical zoom and
looks and feels identical to the note 8
it works well and it's my preference to
have the extra flexibility the biggest
changes over from the s8 is an image
processing photos look way less
processed less artificially sharp less
saturated and just more natural noise
reduction is also way better in low
light which I can't overstate enough
this is an incredible camera in
low-light slow-mo video on these phones
is pretty awesome
in theory 960 frames per second at 720p
capture some crazy cool moments full
records 0.2 seconds so be sure to time
it exactly right it's a cool novelty but
it does come out a bit grainy despite
the resolution as a party trick or a
look at my phone can do type feature
it's it's pretty sweet a crazy cool
thing to mention with the cameras this
time around is they actually have their
own RAM to help with capturing all these
images sure if you give it a few years
we'll be complaining that my cameras
only got 6 gigs of RAM but Ram is in the
camera module it's kind of cool so the
bottom line on the camera it's not
surprisingly the best camera system
Samsung has ever used but it's
definitely not world's better than the
s8 or even the note 8 so Samsung has
improved the iris recognition and the
facial scanning system and this time it
gives you the option to combine the two
so what it's calling intelligent scan it
gives you the ease of facial unlock
security of iris and it works pretty
close to flawlessly with light behind me
in dark rooms and pretty much every
other scenario I threw at it it just
worked what's always the fastest but it
was damn close to working 100% of the
time battery sizes are unchanged from
lashing at 3000 3500 milliamp hours
respectively a my actual usage was
slightly better than the si+ after full
day for me I had about 35 to 40% issue
left it looks like the a45 is about five
ten percent more efficient on battery or
maybe app just got better optimized
throughout the year so I gives him some
credit
they really check almost every flagship
box ip68 expandable storage Snapdragon
840 five six digs a ram dual cameras 64
gigs of internal storage Samsung pay a
freaking headphone jack any beautiful
design without a notch
we also finally have some good colors
making their way to the US in the form
of coral blue and lilac purple so along
with the now staple midnight black
I wish the gray was coming to the US but
hey colors so the final verdict on the
s9 the s9 plus they are not surprisingly
awesome phones and the best Samsung has
ever made
swimming you don't need a stylus if you
have an SI turn si+ hold off I don't
think even Samsung believes you'll need
to upgrade but for coming from s7 or
older just coming from nother
manufacturer it's a huge leap forward
and gives you what I think is the best
of Android my experience was so positive
with the SI and the s9 plus I actually
bought a coral blue s9 plus for myself
which is a biggest stamp of approval I
can give a device putting my own money
behind it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
