technobuffalo here having to be able to
say that for a while because I've been
gone I just got back late last night
from Asia I was in Vietnam in Hong Kong
they'll be a plenty more about that in a
later video but this morning when I was
going through all my websites and
checking out the things that I'd be
regularly i saw the Apple put up a ton
of walkthrough videos on the iPad which
of course is finally shipping later this
week so as I was going through and
washing each one of these videos and
i'll put links them in the sidebar i
started to get much much more excited
about the ipad initially i thought when
i said this in videos that it looked
like just a bigger iphone or ipod touch
however after watching all these
tutorials getting much more excited
about the device i think i'm getting
much more of a desktop experience and I
initially thought so let's start with
safari for example and again go through
and watch these videos link again will
be in the sidebar you get a more desktop
browser experience so you can go through
and you have actually have a tool bar
across the top and you can bookmark
right tool you can get drop-down menus
get many more options than you do get
right now on your iPhone and iPod Touch
probably due to the larger screen size
it's more real estate for many years at
options you actually hit as opposed to
dealing with the smaller three and a
half hitch free and found on the iPhone
or the ipod touch mail is another
example of words that we're seeing some
improvements again at the drop-down
menus the mail Mick handle navigation on
the left hand side and the preview on
the right you're still missing some key
mail features I want to be able to sort
folders are wanting universal inbox none
of that is still present another that's
so bear and fortunately I'm application
but you are getting a bit more options
photos is another getting way where
we're seeing a bit more desktop like
functionality you can right there were
these stacks you can pinch them out of
pinch them in sort of a neat new feature
that we're finding just on the iPad
another way where I think we're getting
closer to a desktop experience because
again this is running the iphones
outbreak system is in Apple's sort of
bored processing graphic sweets
we're talking about keynote Pages and
Numbers sort of apple's version of
microsoft office so in each of those
you'd ability to going to actually
create your own spreadsheet PowerPoint
presentation or word ask a document and
if you had to open up all the Microsoft
formats with these applications now
you're gonna have to buy them I believe
they're going to be 999 each from the
app sure we are against capability to
actually create your own documents on
the go when the ipad has turned in
landscape you supposedly and again i
haven't seen you on a person you get a
keyboard almost this size which
shouldn't make typing a relatively
easier it's easier then you know we've
seen in the past on mobile devices
something to look forward to we still
don't have any terms multitasking which
is a big negative but you are getting
the abilities now safe things natively
on your device to download them so you
can download images pdfs and word
documents and pages documents whatever
you might have from your mail so we're
getting closer to that desktop operating
system I think the chip that's being
found in the iPad Apple's new a4 for the
whole architecture on a little piece of
silicon it's a big step in the right
direction perhaps this is a preview of
what we can expect from the next
generation of iphone maybe a more
desktop experience the ipad again
something that I'm starting to really
look forward to even it's I bookreader
it looks to be a lot of fun so are you
guys any more enthused about the ipad
you have no more interesting ipad 2 down
a fit waiting for generation to are you
going to preorder you're going to wait
in line at the store did you order it
really curious what you guys want to
think about the ipad certain news is
trying to hit a fever pitch and i want
to start a dialogue about it so guys
leave a comment leave a video leave
whatever you want about the ipad i'm
really curious what you guys have to say
i'm jon rettinger I'm back and I'll see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
