you of the motorola droid those need to
follow the channel you'll know we put it
through a series of tests I've compared
with the iphone I've done browser speed
I've compared it with the storm two I've
gone over the feature set now showing
you the turn-by-turn navigation but now
for the review I'm going to get down and
dirty can talk to you about the phone as
a whole how all those little bits and
pieces come together too well you can
give a positive or negative experience
so first and foremost the droid is a
phone despite the marketing hype it's
got to make good phone calls it's not
just for internet and all the other
things that the droid does it's got to
make quality phone calls I'm happy to
report that it does whether that's
attributed to motorola's hardware of
verizon's network I'm not quite sure the
radio in here is a very strong was able
to get five bars of verizon's 3g signal
whereas on the storm two is only able to
get three or four so quite strong and
you should be able to get pretty good
reception anywhere you go call quality
was fantastic people reported no white
noise on their end and it sounded almost
a landline like on my end speakerphone
was quite left quite loud which I
tribute to a very large speaker in the
back one of the louder speaker phones
I've heard probably second only to the
AT&amp;amp;T tilt two so the speaker phones
important to you you're going to really
enjoy the motorola droid so all the
phone stuff aside it makes good phone
calls how does everything else come
together this is a very hyped device and
there's a lot of interest behind it so
let's talk about it first I am extremely
impressed with motorola's design team
the fact that they got a phone with a
3.7 inch screen and a full qwerty
keyboard to be that thin is amazing it's
starting to make other devices which
used to look thin look downright fat
looking at you i phone one of the things
that I really like about the screen is
obviously that it's capacitive it's very
bright it's responsive and it works well
I'm a big fan of the capacitive
navigation buttons on the bottom eyelid
it takes some getting used to there's
some haptic feedback which means when
you touch it they vibrate but they do
work quite well and they're your
standard array of droid buttons of
Android button rather your back button
your menu
your home button and even have a search
button so if you're worried about how
that would work without being actual
buttons to push don't be concerned so
one of the downsides five megapixel
camera motorola was claiming it's
capable of shooting full DVD quality
video which let me tell you it is not i
did a sample of a video where i showed
you my cat you can see the video quality
was not fantastic things like say the
HTC hero or even the droid eris for
verizon have the same sort of camera
sensor but take much much much much
better video so perhaps how we fixed the
firmware upgrade the picture quality the
video is average not as good as
Motorola's claiming just wanted to give
you a heads up browser wise is fantastic
this is the closest browser i have seen
two matching mobile safari on the iphone
which i've got on the record is saying
is i think is the best mobile browser
this is a really close second it renders
pages in natural true HTML it looks like
you'd see on your desktop computer the
only thing i think it was missing that i
really got accustomed to with
multi-touch but i'm able to forgive that
completely because this phone renders
pages quickly and does a fantastic job
you can tap to zoom and you can zoom in
or out using the navigation sorry the
magnifying plus or minus it works very
well and of course you have
accelerometer so you turn it it'll
rotate and you can view the pages that
way as well one of the tests that i
always run is how quick scrolling is on
a lot of devices if you're viewing a
pretty intensive web page and you scroll
through real quickly you'll see sort of
a checkerboard pat on the bottom as a
processor is sort of struggling to load
what's coming below it i did not have
that problem with the droid it always
loaded what i wanted to unload it very
quickly which is a fantastic benefit to
the device because it does do a lot so
let's talk about android to point out
which of course is the operating system
that's running the motorola droid it's
un-- skin that means is doesn't have
sort of a layer on top of it like the
sense UI that you see it to HTC hero and
the droid eris or even touch flo 3d like
you see on HTC devices that are running
windows mobile this is running Android
to point out as Google created it and
enjoy two point oh really brings android
into its own I think it was always sort
of a fun project and
was never really up to snuff for some of
the other mobile platforms to point o
really brings it up to par with the rest
if not above them it's easy to use it's
relatively easy to navigate I think it's
intuitive the widget functionality is
great the home screens fact you could
have three of them and customize them
any way you want it's really fantastic
and as an extra bonus the fact that you
now get free turn-by-turn directions
with google maps navigation which is
still in beta is great great to the
ladies voices super robotic but it works
really well and have a free navigation
option really nice you know cell
companies love to charge you a few extra
bucks for the TeleNav surface service
whether it's verizon you know maps or
ATT navigator sprint navigate or
whatever it is they'd love to charge a
few extra bucks and Google is actually
saying no and I give Verizon credit for
letting motorola and google put this on
the device let it be used certainly
taking money out of pocket that's
increasing the user experience so very
happy that they allow them them to do
that so guys in conclusion I'm broken
down everything about the device in
previous videos this is probably the
single best device and verizon stable if
you're a Verizon user I would have no
reservations about recommending this to
you one of the big downsides that I do
want to bring up though is the full
qwerty keyboard and I've talked about
this in previous videos not sure why but
the motor oil engineers decided to put a
full very large nicely functioning d-pad
next to the keyboard which makes it keys
a little bit smaller if you can see
right there there's no doming on the
keys at all but almost feel like a flat
surface had a very hard time getting
used to the keyboard now I'm using this
phone for about two weeks so it's been a
very hard adjustment process now I'm not
saying you won't get used to it it just
takes time and sign as accurate as you
would like actually found myself using
the on-screen keyboard more than I was
using the physical keyboard so one
little downside is the full qwerty board
not the best but in a sea of positives a
few little negatives are not going to
track from a device think it's
absolutely fantastic phone probably the
best phone i've seen since the iphone i
think it rivals the iphone which is
what it's been compared to obviously in
commercials in terms of quality OS
features fact it's even more open I
didn't say that this could possibly even
be better than the iphone it is a
fantastic device one that I can
wholeheartedly recommend and this is
only the second phone on a one to five
star scale i have given a full five
stars can't recommend this phone enough
if you had any reservations about the
droid don't check out your verizon store
and get a chance to use it about several
i think you're going to like it I
certainly know i do if i was a verizon
user i would be using this as my daily
driver it would be in my pocket all the
time so guys hope you enjoyed for
