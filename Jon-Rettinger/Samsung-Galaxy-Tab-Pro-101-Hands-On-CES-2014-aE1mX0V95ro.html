reporting from CES 2014 we're taking a
look at two more the new Samsung of
tablets that were announced here in Las
Vegas this week first up we're taking a
look at the galaxy tab pro 10.1 and
eventually the 8.4 over here to my right
these have the same design architecture
that we saw introduced last year Aoife
in Berlin with Samsung is again going
with the faux leather backs on all of
their devices as you can see the galaxy
tab pro line is going to be following
the same magazine UX that was introduced
on the Galaxy Note pro 12.2 it's going
to have the same functionality all
devices are launching with Android 4.4
KitKat and we don't have any idea yet on
the exact release dates but it is
supposed to be sometime in the first
quarter we have not heard pricing yet on
these either so this has been the 10.1
over here we have the 8.4 which is also
going to be using the same magazine UX
style now what's interesting is that the
12.2 miles are definitely not supposed
to be used in portrait mode although you
can use them edge it's not going to be
very easy with the 10.1 in the 8.4 it's
gonna be a little bit easier so if you
want to really use your tablets and
important mode this may be the models
you want to look at both of them do also
support Air Command but they do not come
with S pen's but there will be an
additional mouse that you can purchase
that will bring that functionality so
this is mentioning would take my Buffalo
take a look at the new Samsung Galaxy
Tab pro 10.1 and 8.4 and we'll be back
with more coverage from CES 2014 what's
