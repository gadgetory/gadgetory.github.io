let's talk about WWDC a little bit I've
got some ideas about what I want to see
what will likely see and setting
expectations for the keynote my wish
list is always the same an apple all the
things at once it's been almost a year
since we've seen a new piece of hardware
so I want to see all the new stuff but
we won't get that but if I would allowed
all the things we're expecting to see
like a Retina 13-inch MacBook Pro I'd
really love to see a new mac pro from
Apple but that's a little far-fetched of
course the fabled i watch is the unicorn
everyone's hoping to see at WWDC so I'm
curious if Apple will take the time to
announce it here it would make for one
heck of a one more thing developers will
be on hand to check it out and learn
about developing for it in any of WWDC
workshops unfortunately the iWatch might
be one of those insanely great products
Apple wants to give its own event too so
that's probably unlikely boo as for
software changes I think the biggest
hope is that Tim Cook sticks to his guns
with what he said at d11 and opens up
Apple more in terms of their API
specifically my biggest wish is that
will see the ability to choose default
apps for male navigation search and
browser but that might give too much to
Google in terms of mindshare on the
iphone since they've been working really
hard and doing a great job of stealing
users away from Apple's default apps my
prediction for the keynote is eighty
percent software and twenty percent
hardware the macbook line is solid and
probably won't see any major redesigns
it's kind of like a Porsche you don't
need standalone events to announce new
models every year you just tweak
everything slightly to improve
performance and let people enjoy the
good design software is the name of the
game at this year's WWDC and I'm
personally really excited to see some
movement in the often glacial progress
of iOS there are tons of people online
demanding a full revamp of iOS though
unfortunately software design changes
have to inherent issues with that whole
full redesign thing number one they
freak out legacy users who aren't tech
fiends like we are and those people
would panic if one day they updated
their iphone to find a whole new
interface that's scared and confuse them
with this
unique relationship people have with
their iPhone we take changing it really
seriously Johnny I've will have to
update iOS by turning up the proverbial
heat on it over time so while this will
be an interesting wwc don't place your
bets on iOS looking completely different
sure we will see changes and it'll
probably be a little flattered but it's
not going to suddenly look like Android
tomorrow number two software design
takes time and as we all know Johnny ive
is a perfectionist and he will not
launch hardware software until he feels
it's ready if there's one thing we're
all sure of its that apple's keynote
will have that same mixture of expected
launches fresh updates and one or two
surprises get out your keynote bingo
cards and make sure you check out all of
our WWDC coverage starting Monday June
tenth at ten a.m. pacific time see you
then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
