in a car driving to a little tongue to
Canyon little tongue of candy for those
of you who don't know is a beautiful
Canyon driving Road here in LA for car
enthusiasts much like myself and I'm
shooting on a wall 89 right now so what
are the two have to do with each other
well it's very simple
Bob Way is making huge claims that this
camera was co-developed with Leica or
the dual camera on the back was
co-developed by Leica and so this is
gonna provide you know superior photo
quality to any other phone before I
think those are huge claims given how
powerful the like a brand name is in the
photo community and I want to really put
it to the test I want to drive up to the
top of this Canyon get some beautiful
photos we're gonna see if it lives up to
the hype if you like a brand name means
anything or versus marketing gimmicks as
usual and I'm gonna bring you guys along
with me let's go do this so right out
the gate I know that a phone camera is
never going to be able to compete with
something like a DSLR I don't need you
guys yelling at me in the comments I'm
aware of that this was just a fun
interesting way for me to test out the
camera in a different way and also have
an excuse to drive up this Canyon at
disgustingly fast speeds so in terms of
specs on the back we're looking at a 12
megapixel or two 12 megapixel F 2.2
cameras with BSI CMOS sensors and dual
tone flash
according to far way the two sensors
capture more light one is dedicated to
capturing RGB and one is dedicated to
capturing monochromatic light it then
uses a special algorithm that Huawei has
designed which will intelligently
combine the colors and supposedly give
you a stunning looking image it is
rocking to Leica lenses on the back and
comes with like a thumb mode so that's
sort of the contribution from Leica if
you will right off the gate the film
mode doesn't really mean anything to me
if you want to color grade your photo in
a million different ways you can totally
do that throwing a post-processing on in
camera and then calling it a Leica gray
doesn't really make a difference to me
so first off we have the speed and the
responsiveness of the shutter when using
the camera and while it is really really
fast I wouldn't say it's any more or
less faster than any other flagships out
there it's about on par it's very very
good
it just doesn't blow out the other
phones out of the water I will say the
burst mode however is pretty good as you
took to 16 frames per second and it's
very very fast great for capturing all
sorts of fast-moving objects I shot a
couple cars that
driving by me when I pulled over to take
pictures and the burst mode worked
really well and to spice this video up a
little bit more we went straight from
this Canyon to reviewing low light at a
macklemore concert and this is probably
where the huawei p9 impressed me the
most as a camera at least in one aspect
which was noise in low-light there was a
very minimal noise now whether this is
down to two camera sensors picking up
more light than one or a flyaway and
like I have developed a really good
algorithm to reduce noise and post or
maybe a combination of both either way
it works really well however I did find
myself getting pretty blurry images
because of shake and balance and that
didn't really work because I'm assuming
the shutter had to stay open longer it's
definitely not perfect in low-light but
where a lot of other phones may fall
apart
the p9 definitely holds its own
especially from a low noise perspective
and to overall at the end of the day is
like a just a branding move here or is
it something more honestly while it is a
good camera and it holds its own against
all other flagships and definitely wins
in some categories while losing in
others I still think the like a brand
name is just a marketing gimmick but
then again am I really surprised given
that Henry Cavill and Scarlett Johansson
are part of the marketing campaign
please bear in mind this was not a
scientific test I like to do real-world
usage just pick up the phone and use it
as I would a regular user and I'm
judging it based on that if you guys
want to see more technical tests please
let us know so let me know what you guys
think in the comments down below do you
like this sort of video where we take
you along the journey with us on how we
test the phone rather than just sharing
the results at the end if so let us know
give us a thumbs up if you liked the
video that's also a way of letting us
know please subscribe for more tech
coverage and content we love bringing it
to you and I'll see you guys in the next
one thank you so much for watching
before leaving you guys I want to give a
quick shout out to our friends over at
