few alpha builds for a while now but at
Google i/o then build the first
relatively stable beta available for
anyone to download if you want to check
it out go to android com slash beta
available for any current gen Nexus
device and last gen Nexus device few
caveats here it's still a beta operating
system so they're bound to be bugs bound
to be memory and battery drain certainly
there's going to be some third-party app
instability there are hundreds of new
features but here are some of my
favorite things that were added and also
a few disappointments things that were
taken away from the previous builds
first new wallpapers are here the
primarily ocean-themed if you like stock
wallpapers you can now relax and enjoy
the waves system UI tuner is also
getting more powerful this time around
you now control notifications way more
grain early than you could before you
can determine when they peek whether
they interrupt your screen you can go
way more detail and you ever could be
for you have an enabled system UI tuner
it's pretty easy hold on notification
shade hold your finger over that little
gear icon they'll start to spin and jump
with the settings go all the way down to
the bottom and there you will see system
UI tuner hit other and you are off to
controller notifications my favorite not
useful but cool to look at feature is
now aiming in the default google
keyboard you can now pick a ton of
colors and if that's not enough for you
you can now pick any photo you want used
as a background on your keyboard so if
you want a picture your cute little
french bulldog and go and have that now
on your keyboard next one is going to be
a huge benefit if you want to use this
beta as your primary phone you can now
run android pay on Developer Preview 3
that obviously didn't work before on the
Alpha builds but it's here now so tap to
page your heart's content Google giveth
and Google taketh away there are a few
things missing from this third build of
Android and night mode has gone bye-bye
or taken a nap if you'd rather we'd also
seen circle folders in previous versions
of Android and those are gone replaced
with the more classic familiar folders
that we see in Android M one of the more
requested features of Android is now
finally here in multitasking scroll up
to the top right hand corner you can
clear all everything else we loved about
the first two builds of Android and are
here highlights include suggestions and
settings more detail in your settings
application and also double tap
multitasking to go to the app you were
just using so what you guys think about
Android and you're going to be brave and
install it on your primary device you're
gonna try on a secondary
by yesterday of no interest at all or
maybe you're going to wait until a full
release I want to hear your thoughts

appreciate it and of course subscribe
