technobuffalo here 3d is coming and it's
coming quick and the latest addition to
the glasses free stereoscopic 3d craze
is this guy right here the LG Thrill
coming sometime in the coming weeks for
AT&amp;amp;T Wireless let's go ahead dig it
so regardless of what you think about 3d
technology whether you love it hate it
or totally ambivalent there's very
little denying the appeal of this phone
it is a fully SPECT superfone coming in
at a ninety nine dollar price point
which really puts it in a class by
itself so this came right from the folks
at LG letting me know it's active and
I'm letting you know that the phone is
textually active so practice safe
texting go ahead and pull that thing off
that means it just has a sim card in
here so here is the LG Thrill let you
know there's a new little 3d icon right
there all the boxes LG throw what's in
it picture of advice a lot of cons of
other stuff but it's more fun instead of
reading what's in the box actually look
what's in the box so I'll go ahead and
open it up AT&amp;amp;T logo welcome to AT&amp;amp;T
quick start guide and here is the LG
Thrill a smudge marks on the screen
looks like the PR folks put in the sim
card went like this when they get it
we're going to push this off to the side
for just one quick moment and while I do
push it off to the side I will boot it
up say if the batteries got a charge and
it does alright so that will boot up
let's see what else we got in the box I
had a chance take a look at this guy two
weeks ago when I was in New York and I
was came away pretty impressed the 3d on
here in it so you've got your plug into
the wall charger with the USB port blah
blah blah pretty standard we've got a
micro USB charging cable pretty standard
and this guy not so standard for
inclusion in the box this is actually
the hdmi data cable so it's midi hdmi to
standard hdmi it's nice that AT&amp;amp;T and LG
included this so this comes standard
with a $99 phone you get the hdmi cable
which generally can run you twenty or
thirty bucks crew to buy it separately
for phone doesn't have it so all right
enough of the accessories let's push all
that business off to the side and here
is the LG thrill let's go ahead and step
in a little bit closer coming to come to
my office all right somebody run through
the specs real quickly this guy was
probably a crazy zooming you're all
super nauseous right now slide up to
unlock hey look at that we slowed up to
unlocked in the sim
is not provisioned all right whatever
that means okay so let me run through
the specs real quickly it is a 4.3 inch
screen as always measure diagonally it's
a TFT display the resolution of 480 x
800 it is running android 2.2 not 2.3
presumably 2.3 will be coming the LG
folks told me so but they didn't give a
time frame for it it does have a dual
core processor it is a Texas Instruments
built dual-core chip with one gigahertz
on each core it's got 512 megabytes of
ram 8 gigabytes of storage space inside
of course you can throw in a microSD
card 32 gigs and up that 240 on the back
which one it is one of these is a
5-megapixel rear-facing camera which can
shoot video at 1080p I can record
obviously in 3d I always think that the
stereoscopic 3d cameras with the two and
the flash in the middle or just
commenting a robot face don't put like a
little smiley face right there but it
does have that it's got in addition to
that a VGA front-facing camera micro USB
2.0 and all the rest of stuff you'd
expect being powered by a 1500 milliamp
hour battery so let's do a quick tour
and walk through what zoom out a little
bit more a little slower this time so I
don't make anybody sick let's see what
we got on a device so on the left hand
side there's rural reports live under
doors there is your charging port micro
USB which is now standard there's at
HDMI port when the cable is going to be
included go and slide all those doors
back nothing else lives here on the left
hand side though you might confuse those
for the volume rocker so I've gotta get
used to the phone on the right-hand side
there the volume rockers I can see it a
little bit smaller but there are two of
them for up and down obviously
microphone on the bottom top 3.5
millimeter headset jack and the power
and lock button in the upper right hand
corner that's my preferred location I'm
just used it sort of hitting it there
that's definitely sort of me I might
vary with you this is being cold the
thrill 4g does have support for hspa+ so
if you're in hspa+ area you should get
some faster download speeds the back is
sort of a soft touch rubber feel a big
AT&amp;amp;T logo this is metal it is not a
kickstand it's just sort of a nice
little accent I suppose
grill letting you know a stereoscopic
and then there are the two little
cameras so this guy bring some unique
stuff to the table and whether or not
you're interested in 3d are not
interested in 3d just from a phone
specification standpoint this is a
pretty powerful phone and the 3d is just
sort of an added bonus and you're
getting a whole list for ninety nine
dollars are looking at this and compare
it to something like the evo 3d which
can run you about two hundred dollars
depending on where you get it sometimes
a little bit less you're getting a
pretty nice value here so it is android
2.2 and LG has been a little bit of
tweaks to it so if you knew your little
pinch to zoom anything here you can go
ahead and move around all the screens or
you can see all the screens you can do
what you want with them so a little
trash can as you hold it one more time
click it and there's a little trash can
so of course you can just drag that to
it if you want you can also rearrange
icons and add icons it's go to a screen
doesn't have that much on here there we
go you hold it down you get sort of a
grid view in the background hopefully
you can see that on camera and you get
some of the stuff that you can do so
finance and all dressed a sort of LG a
little tweaks here social and there's
some kind of customization that LG has
done to it and the standard stuff so you
got widgets shortcuts folders or
wallpapers I'm going to exit out of this
let me go and show you this 3d space and
obviously the 3ds not going to translate
and you're not going to see 3d but this
does do some kind of cool things here so
the resolution on this is 480 x 800 it's
not the highest resolution screen this
might be an instance of where a lower
resolution is actually better
stereoscopic 3d so you're going to have
little larger pixels so text might not
be as crisp as clear as other phones but
that larger pixels are actually going to
make the stereoscopic effect pop out a
little bit better and you can actually
see it when use the phone a 3d here well
I wouldn't use 3d all the time it's
still probably a little bit of a gimmick
this is probably the best implementation
I've seen of stereoscopic 3d so LG's got
these for who knows how long and
exclusive with YouTube 3d so you can
film video in 3d on this you can upload
directly to YouTube 3d as opposed to
having to take a video tenda to your
computer and that's when your computer
go to youtube so 3d guide so I don't
know that is going to check it out
creating viewing
cheering and connecting so that's regale
your 3d content I should also mention
too that there are four capacitive
buttons here on the bottom typical
Android ones you got your menu they
light up and you touch them home back
and search 3d games and apps this is
going to take you to 3d games and apps I
believe it comes going to come
pre-loaded with some games so you've got
asphalt Nova let's golf movies and go
over is T I'm assuming his Gulliver's
travel so you can see some game games
here at our 3d games that are going to
come pre-loaded on your device let's go
ahead and go back 3d camera you can you
guess what that is 3d gallery and
YouTube 3d any questions you guys want
to see the thrill you know be sure to
let me know I'll let me do a real quick
size comparison for you here it is with
it's AT&amp;amp;T stablemate the iphone 4 go
ahead and stack the side by side this is
by no means a light phone certainly has
a little bit of junk in its trunk it's
not too heavy to carry it around but
it's not the thinnest phone on the block
here is another 4.3 inch device this is
the hd7 s also for eighteen eighty
you've ever seen one of these guys you
should get a good sense of what the LG
thrill 4g looks like almost identical
the thrill definitely being a little bit
heavier and finally the last phone here
is the HTC status and see these two guys
next to each other and kaboom so there
you go unboxing of the LG Thrill it's
going to be available sometime that
coming weeks for that ninety nine dollar
price point i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys or
talk to you at least in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
