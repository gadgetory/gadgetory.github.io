here january's a fantastic month for DS
it's when we get to see all the gadgets
and gizmos that are going to be coming
out this year and this January is no
exception as CBS gets into sort of high
gear it's also a developer's conference
that goes on in vegas and this year
ralph de la Vega the CEO and president
of AT&amp;amp;T Mobility gave a keynote speech
where he revealed a lot of cool TTT
details that i thought i'd share with
you i'm an AT&amp;amp;T customer the iphone is
my daily driver so this affects me what
phone i might use thought you guys may
be interested as well first he announced
that ett is going to be caring to webos
devices and flew see that are wandering
webos is the operating system that
powers the palm pre and the palm pixi
it's the new OS that's been developed by
pond it's been around for about eight
months a little bit less than that but
it really is a fantastic offering since
I mean my review of the pre and the pixi
i raved about i think it's multitasking
and cart interface second to none it's
app store is growing and i think it's
got a lot of potential utilizes
multi-touch probably second only to the
iphone it really has a ton of attached
so i'm very excited about it so we're
looking forward to what AT&amp;amp;T is going to
be doing with webos it did not give any
phone details but it'll leave 12
probably think that we'll be seeing a
sequel to the pre launched on 88 pre 2
or a prequel or sequel who knows what
they're going to call it but it should
probably have that same form factor as
far as the other web OS device your
guess is as good as mine it probably the
more hyped announcement was that 18 t is
finally joining the open handset
alliance which means that they will be
carrying android devices as it stands
now 18 to use the only major US carrier
to not be offering any Android devices
so I will be seeing upwards of five hour
release in the earlier part of 2010 they
gave a little bit of detail what we're
going to see they said we're going to
see device from Motorola with a unique
form factor which probably would be the
backflip that we've seen a rumor it's
got a typical Android touchscreen device
but the keyboard sort flips out from
back running Motorola's blur which we've
seen on the moto cliq it's a custom skin
on top of Android which is very social
networking friendly we're also going to
see a custom device built adjust for
AT&amp;amp;T by HTC HTC is probably one of the
biggest manufacturers of Android devices
they made the original g1 they made them
my touch the nexus one or all
manufactured by HTC certainly have a
reputation for building quality devices
so cure to see what they come out with
next we're going to see the dell mini 3i
or maybe three depending on what they
call it it's really delves first foray
into the smartphone market we've seen it
released in China earlier in the year so
let me be coming to AT&amp;amp;T it's sort of a
middle-of-the-road handset that's got a
3.5 inch display with 640 x 360
resolution it's got 3 megapixel camera
and of course microSD expansion and GPS
and all that other stuff you'd expect
from a modern smartphone especially a
modern smartphone running Android so we
can tell them I'm very excited about the
possibility of android and webos being
on ATT things going to be fun to
actually try phones that I might
actually use on a daily basis the phones
that test you don't have to use for a
week or two weeks tense and back now
these actually be able to test using my
own sim card as my daily driver for
weeks and months I think it's going to
be quite fun so are you excited about
webos or android if you are which one
looking forward to more webOS phone or
an android phone and me personally i'm
looking forward to webos but certainly
is a personal preference so leave
comments or video responding really
courage to what you guys think anyway
jon rettinger for technobuffalo and i'll
see you the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
