at CES it's kind of a showcase of their
latest concepts that may or may not hit
the market last year we saw a crazy
three screen laptop this year they're
back with a new take on an old idea that
you can just dock your phone inside of a
laptop ish thing and give you a brand
new experience aside from what your
phone's going to give you meat project
Linda and before I get into everything
that this is let me just say that razor
was super clear that this is definitely
a concept and they may or may not make
it which is surprising because when I
held in use it actually worked really
well so first looking at this thing it's
essentially a blade stealth a bit of
extra thickness on the bottom to account
for the dockable razor phone you push a
button and a retractable USB Secor just
does its business with the razor phone
with a very cool noise and then you get
a full desktop ish OS so there's a lot
about the software blink tell you about
the hardware first when you put the
really beautiful 2k 5.7 inch screen
razor phone inside of that dock it
becomes a trackpad in the second screen
and because it's a glass display
actually feels pretty good and the
responsiveness was also really good you
can do normal desktop ish stuff to
fingers to right-click and scrolling was
actually really smooth on it the version
we saw was clearly not final like it's a
concept but razor's ultimate vision is
to give you kind of one-to-one versus
the phone versus a big screen that
you're looking at so they want it to be
13.3 inches in 2k 120 Hertz so that
it'll match what's in the razor phone
but I'm going to put 200 gigs of storage
inside of Project Linda so that if you
use a video editing app for example you
can have all your files loaded up there
or you wanna watch the movies on an
airplane you can put whatever you want
into that on the other i/o side also has
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack they
wanted to point out so if you missing
that on your razor phone you're gonna
have one option there as well it's also
a webcam built in the dual array mic so
you can do Skype or video chat you want
of course USB C is gonna charge this
thing and it's got a fifty three point
six kilowatt hour battery pack so
they're saying you can treat it almost
like a portable battery bank you plug it
in and it'll be charged cool design Q
that razor did was the power button on
the razor phones on the side so when it
gets docked that's the power button for
Project Linda
also means you can use a fingerprint
reader as well to keep it a little bit
extra secure so on the software side
you're getting like a desktop ish OS
it's actually kind of razor worked with
Sentosa to make this experience but it
should be pretty familiar so this is
where things get tricky I'm not sure who
this would be for certainly the
Chromebook set might be interested but
you gotta have a razor phone in order to
use this so perhaps it's more of a proof
of concept for what the razor phone can
ultimately do there's the kind of
product that usually companies don't
develop publicly so I give raise your
credit for showing something that may or
may not ever make it to market right now
if it does ever make it to market how
many people are gonna be lining up what
I imagine will be an expensive offering
has yet to be seen but it is really cool
and it's cool to see a concept and a
company develop out in the open so we
got a ton more CES coverage up of course
so be sure to subscribe int that little
bell icon to know and the next CES
videos are coming at you let you guys
think about project Linda down below
until next time Jon render and
TechnoBuffalo
