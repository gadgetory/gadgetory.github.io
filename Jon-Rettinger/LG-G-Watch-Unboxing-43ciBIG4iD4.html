technobuffalo here and android wear has
a riot it's arrived in my android we're
checking out hands we've got the latest
from LG G watch go ahead open it up and
see what it's all about so here is the
LG do you watch straight from the google
play store if you want to pick this
sucker up it's going to set you back two
hundred twenty nine dollars in the
shipping in 122 days nothing too
exciting on the box LG G watch we've got
some specs we're going to run through
all that stuff and letting you know it
is made by the folks at LG telling if
the seal is broken don't accept it but
our seal is not broken then go ahead and
have one too many drinks and break a
seal there we go that is dawn to go
ahead and take the sucker out I like the
way this looked a lot at Google i/o and
I saw it in person now it's kind of fun
to see the retail packaging and get a
chance to actually play with it so there
it is it looks surprisingly like every
other smart watch that we've seen go
ahead and pull that out of the box there
it is push it off the side for a real
quick second and then we'll see what
else we're going to have inside we've
got a charging and syncing cable and it
is pretty standard microUSB but that
does not plugged directly into the watch
imagine that some by the dock in
there this regular wall wart with USB
and here is probably that sort of dr.
we're just talking about go ahead and
pull this sucker out watch i'm guessing
rests on this USB port is right there
and it charges they probably going to do
a decent amount of charging the battery
in this is 400 million powers which is
actually 100 milli amp hours more than
its counterpart the samsung gear live so
push all that stuff off to the side for
a quick sec and here is the watch itself
think of this is sort of Google now on
your wrist good peel off plastic come on
whooshing noise boom the
it is ok so specs on this guy are pretty
simple it's a 1.65 inch LCD IPS display
at the resolution of 280 x 2 80 it's got
a Snapdragon 400 chip inside of it four
gigs of internal storage in 512 of ram
and again that 400 million power battery
being powered by Android wear to work
with any Android device it's 4.3 and
above definitely sort of check your
specs on your phone it's got bluetooth
40 it's got a sort of a 9 axis gyro
accelerometer and compass in it
available in white gold or black Titan
you got black Titan here it is dust and
water-resistant its IP 67 in case you
are wondering and the watch band size is
a standard so you can serve replace it
with any other sort of watch band
somebody get this guy all powered up I
will do a real quick walk through what
the OS looks like and then we'll cover
much more in the review so you've got
the g watch all powered up there isn't
have a power button on if you want to
turn it on you've got connected to power
and throw that on dock so here it is
looking kind of an oculus like any other
watch but it's got some secrets if you
double tap ok Google and I'll start to
look up we decided ok Google star that
again remind me to bring milk
tomorrow
and now I'm gonna get a notification on
my phone reminds me to bring milk it
essentially google now here on your
wrist so a couple of things to know
about the UI since doesn't anybody feed
a bit confusing pulling gallant will
either mute it or unmute it depending on
what you want to do if you hold it down
sometimes it working with it doesn't you
can access all different watch faces
that are available there's some kind of
on here I like sort of the old classic
watch look which is funny to have a
super smart watch it looks like an old
watch but that is indeed it there are a
ton of apps they're also going to be
available so I paired this with my Nexus
5 you can see all the apps are available
for Android where it's growing it's on a
giant catalog but there are sort of some
big ones here maps a lot of the airlines
are here pinterest i talked about during
the keynote lift you can call a car with
just your wrist cloud magic i don'ts a
really popular email app more will come
very soon so if you got things to note
here is sort of the size of its not the
thinnest watch in the world it's not the
thickest I'll show you it looks like on
my wrist looks like any other sort of
watch on a wrist kind of like a colorful
pebble so this biggest one has a bit of
a more boxy look to it then we see with
some of the other Android wear devices
shared applications look like so if I'm
wearing my watch and say I get a tech
match for example I'm just out and about
I presumably it'll show up right on my
watch you can have the app option to
open it up if you'd like to on your
phone directly so there's one from Iran
preet and saying hi and cab it he'll
open back up I can reply directly from
here and it opened it up on my phone to
reply to Ron you can do little replies
to from your resting you know be back
later or hold on mostly I just sort of
gets you into the Google now type
world's anyway it's been a real quick
overview video of the LG G watch and
unboxing of course will cover way more
interview they learn how to use it it's
a whole new OS one they're kind of
excited to dive in so next time i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo see ya the
next video bye bye thank you guys for
watching if you haven't yet please
subscribe will be the first one to know
