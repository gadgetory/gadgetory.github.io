to you by audible welcome back to other
episode of ask the Buffalo I'm your host
Jon renders to show where you could ask
me any question you got from the ever
expanding growing world of technology up
this week we're going to talk about the
next iPhone the ps4 the rumored X phone
and some thoughts on the Xperia Z if you
want to see your question show up in a
future ask the buffalo episode every
tuesday on technobuffalo com will put up
an article and if you want to leave a
question you can do so in the comments
otherwise if tuesday ain't no thang you
go ahead and send me a question a
twitter either send it to me at john for
lakers or at TechnoBuffalo and use
hashtag ask the be so i know it's for
the show let's get started blake adam
asks do you think the motorola x phone
available d throne samsung and the
dominance it has over the android OS
it's going to be really hard to
overthrow samsung samsung's not just
dominating android there dominate the
entire phone world they are selling
handsets left and right they offer
multiple phones in multiple sizes and
multiple price points in multiple
regions across multiple carriers and all
that aside their marketing has been
borderline genius you look at how
they've been sort of undermining the
Apple mystique over the past few years
with the waiting in line and the
geniuses I do think that the x-phone
abilities aren't familiar with it
supposedly is going to be motorola built
and might perhaps end up being the next
Nexus and could have the latest flagship
features and specs have been running
crazy on it anything from a 4.3 inch
screen to a 5-inch green from quad-core
to eight core most surprisingly though
so we haven't seen any mr. blur akkam
shots of the phone yet it's really hard
to determine what's fact and what's
fiction do I think it's going to
dethrone Samsung probably not even if it
ends up being the best phone out there
samsung really has now a mindshare
Martha chair and the budget to back it
up this one comes from Twitter user at
gaming Josie 34 asks at John for lakers
what do you think Sony will show with
the ps4 at
three I think they're sure absolutely
everything that they didn't show at
their event two weeks ago so what is
that particular I think their first
going to show the console itself what
it's going to look like the specs on it
the actual design further I think
they're gonna tell us the price how much
it's going to cost well it's gonna come
in different bundles variants I think
they're also going to show with the
launch title games might perhaps be I
think we'll see some actual gameplay
being run off the console as opposed to
off a developer unit so last I think
there's gonna be a lot of talk about 4k
and the role that the ps4 is going to
have in Sony's pushed behind 4k whether
or not games could at some point
hypothetically show 4k content whether
or not it's gonna be shown just for
movies or TV shows the venue sort of
upscaling for potentially streaming
content years down the road the
PlayStation and the Xbox really video
game consoles now have such a long life
span that what they'd be able to do 10
years from now really pale into
comparison what they can do at launch so
if you're game right now is a really
exciting time to get jazzed up about the
future games tech fire or deck fee asked
at John for lakers what do you think
Apple need to do in order to improve the
iphone hashtag ask the be so it serve a
double-edged sword when it comes to the
iphone the iphone just works it's very
soon will operate system we've seen two
2007 but things work very well on it for
the most part the operating system
functions as it should I think what iOS
has had going for and actually made it
unique at least in the past has been
application support and that's really
been their calling card over the past
few years but during that timeframe
androids come on really strong so I
think Apple needs to do to improve the
iphone is iOS in particular I think the
hardware that Apple uses is incredible
the phones look great they're beautiful
specimens of industrial design the specs
matter less on Apple device and since
they make galperin system to go along
with the hardware there so they don't
need you know huge huge huge clock
speeds to make sure things run buttery
smooth I've talked at length about what
I think Appling to do with the next
version of iOS iOS 7 I think they need
something to be fresh need to be that
Apple mystique they used to sell devices
in bulk I think Apple needs to regain
some of that mind share it certainly has
taken a toll on their stock price as
well despite having almost record
numbers of device sales so if it helps
answer question this one comes from
Twitter as well one user at gurps Singh
asks at John for lakers John what do you
think of the Sony Xperia Z reviews are
say
it's reinvented the phone but how so any
reviews that you're saying aren't extra
reviews the production units aren't
really out there and available quite yet
we're still just a little bit away we
had a chance to see the experience d at
CES and I can't wait in fact it won one
of our best of CES awards the design of
the phone weight feels in your hand sort
of very intangible thing that's kind of
hard to communicate the phone felt great
it felt like a really powerful slab the
phone that really looks good and Sony
hasn't had that flagship competitive
phone especially in the US market almost
ever so I'm very excited to see the
experience you're probably a week the
two weeks from having a review unit in
but as soon as we get it I would be
happy to show you and share and anything
you want to see about the experience d
you guys excited about it do you want to
see it experiencing jazz for an
experience here are you waiting to get
