technobuffalo here they full review for
you of the LG expo for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless
this phone is going to run you 199 you
may see commercials of this device all
around touting its pico projecting
ability however I was unable to get a
projector of attachment to show you
provider 18t or LG so we're going to
focus on just the phone itself
surrounding windows mobile 6.5 or
Windows Phone it's got a 3.2 inch
resistive display which has a resolution
of 480 x 800 I can show 16 million
colors it's got a 1500 milliamp hour
battery which is more than substantial
to get through a day with heavy usage
weighs about four points for six ounces
and that only has 512 megabytes of
internal memory but of course you can
expand that up to 16 via microSD card
what makes this fun unique because it's
one of the few on the market that's
running the Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor meaning it's got a full
gigahertz powering it windows mobile or
windows mobile 6.5 here is a bit of a
resource hog so you don't see the speed
as much on the Expos you do want other
Snapdragon devices like for example the
nexus one so before you get into all the
software and finish talk about the
hardware let's talk about how this thing
works as a phone that's always sort of
the first point that I mentioned when I
do a phone review I can tell you that
from a phone sim point phone call
quality was quite good I heard no white
noise or static on Mayan colors for no
whites always are static on there and
able to pick up a signal very strongly
some areas where another test of ice
that might only have two or three bars
of 3g this would pick up four or five so
the radio that LG put in here is very
strong and that's important if you're
infringe 3g areas or fringe edge areas
we really want to make sure that the
strongest device possible to get
whatever exception you may be able to so
if using is just the phone you're going
to not be disappointed so the touch
screen here in this case e 3.2 inch
resistive screen as a bit squishier than
i would have liked those you don't know
resistive touchscreens work by making
contact between two pieces of film
that's why it sometimes up squishy
filled with this one much squish sure
there were nearly I found on some
touchscreen devices not the biggest fan
of these
green here so it does come with a stock
build of windows mobile 6.5 it also
comes to sort of an LG skin which I've
got right here you've seen windows
mobile 6.5 plenty of times you can pull
up an LG menu icon and you can scroll
through these rotating menu see it to
where you want to go you also from the
home screen have access to this cube
which you can scroll through you can add
some favorites scroll back and you can
go right to your picture of you so you
can customize these ads you one that's
really the extent of the LG skin from
another hardware perspective there isn't
a physical d-pad yet this fingerprint
reader right there which serves as
security for the device but also if you
want to go up and down or left to right
that will take care of it from the rest
of the hardware buttons you only have a
send an end key and a back button on the
left side you've got just your volume
rocker on the right you've got a lock
button and a camera button and your
microSD card which does remove the
battery to to get to which is quite nice
is externally accessible on the back you
have a 5 megapixel sensor with LED flash
the picture quality was actually really
impressive on the expo very impressive
on the top you've got your power and
your lock button and god you're charging
port notice missing from here a 3.5
millimeter headset jack that is done via
and adapter unfortunately and it's
locked but on that side can be
programmed to be any sort of key that
you like so one of the other advantages
of the LG expo is the slide-out keyboard
that's sort of a big thing for a lot of
people when you solve a screen reorient
itself here the keyboard on first blush
felt very nice nor I used it through the
gradually my opinion changed join your
fingers overseas you can hear this it's
noise the keys make when you move it but
almost feels like you're crumpling a
piece of plastic and that noise I didn't
think it's going to bother me but became
quite annoying as you type on this for a
little while the keys are flat with no
space between them so it's a little bit
hard to feel where you're typing the
keyboard is by no means bad it's
certainly better than having saying
imperfect on-screen keyboard
but certainly not the best as far as a
tMT's offerings you can look at save
their HD HTC touch pro2 which has a much
better physical keyboard probably one of
the best on the market so this one is
its average best definitely usable if
you require a physical keyboard you
won't be disappointed but be aware of
that no way does can get a little
lighter playing music on it so overall
the phone was good but not great average
not fantastic throw your run-of-the-mill
windows mobile phones if you need
windows mobile if you need to exchange
connectivity and some of the openness
that the platform provides it have to be
disappointed if you're looking for a fun
smartphone for for apps and playing
games this is not going to be the phone
for you so really it's going to come
down to which market you are and which
phone suits you best and I guys hope you
enjoy a short review of the LG expo for
18t wireless i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you the next
video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
