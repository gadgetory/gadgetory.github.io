to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back there episode of ask the
buffalo i am senior buffalo and this is
the show we could ask me any tech
question you've got from the world of
technology whether it's inside the world
or even sometimes outside you don't know
what phone to get not sure what tab we
should pick up or you lost your phone
don't know what you should get while you
wait for your contract and this is the
place you can ask up this week we're
going to talk about some iphone 6 rumors
even those isn't rumor roundup or talk
about the brand new HTC One m8 and what
phone you should get if you just lost
yours is that's the Buffalo let's start
asking the Buffalo first question comes
from our friend Josh hey John with the
rumors of the iphone 6 having to assess
configurations which of these two sides
would you prefer and you think apps will
have more issues with the screen sizes
so the rumor is that Apple is the least
evaluating two separate screen sizes a
4.7 and a 5.5 in case you forgot the
current iphone the 5s and a5 both shared
a 4-inch Retina display screen so the
rumor has it that will be going full
1080p on the new retina and it'll be the
same screen resolution on the 4.7 the
5.5 mean the apps will just look a
little bit bigger on the larger screens
developers won't have much to worry
about I do think that we might have some
issues with the older generation phones
but apples in a really nice job of
scaling applications or at least you can
play them inside of for use the
applications inside of black borders
think that's going to be how this is
going to be solved it's unfortunate when
you sort of have that sort of
fragmentation your phones but at some
point Apple clearly has to make a bigger
phone the markets going bigger and
bigger and they're not necessarily you
know 6.3 inch Galaxy mega but certainly
bigger than 4 inches i think 4.7 is
really becoming the new norms or the
small end of the phone spectrum i do
hope that we get a 5.5 inch iphone i
love giant screen sizes and i would
really enjoy to have that throw in some
hopefully new if i'm a broken record
here iOS 8 not be a happy fellow next
question comes from twitter user
at Tech mob reviews asks at John for
lakers do you think the HTC m8 is better
than the galaxy s5 hashtag ask that be
so before answer that question let me
say that of course when we get the
galaxy s5 and not hot little reviewing
hands we will bash them together and see
who rings supreme into these smartphone
mashup bash up supremacy battle but we
don't have the official release galaxy
s5 yet Todd was at the Samsung event so
i have not had a chance to actually see
the galaxy s5 much like you've only read
about it and watch the videos I will say
though with the last generation I
preferred the HTC one's design over the
galaxy s4 perhaps it'll be the same
thing with the galaxy s5 I really do
like though the duo cameras on the HTC
One but removable batteries also nice on
the galaxy s5 I'm not sure how the new
TouchWiz are going to hold up against
sense 60 I really want to try them and
see him but you know I could be swayed
either way the camera on the galaxy s5
is supposed to be awesome as well so who
knows I'm excited to see them go
head-to-head though which one would you
pick up if you haven't touched either
one right now and you walk into a store
blind and you gotta pick up the phone or
guns your head gotta pick a phone which
one are you picking actually could be
kind of a fun question leave it leave it
in the comments down below and while
we're talking about the HTC One let's
continue with it user at a me yak
underscore cast at john for lakers what
did you think of the HTC events
yesterday what was your fav feature the
new HTC One what do you think of the
camera so this video being filmed on
Wednesday they after the event you can
tell by the question being yesterday I
really like the new HTC One m8 in fact
I've got it in my pocket I can finally
show it and be like this is it I've been
using it since last Friday I've really
really enjoyed it when my favorite
features is totally stolen from LG but
the double tap to unlock never even have
to touch the home button I will say I
take a lot of pictures of my kid that
say it's over and over again and he's a
little guy quick move on you squirmy too
big no to focus afterwards is really
really helpful the shutter speed also on
the new HTC One m8 is super fast you can
take really quick pitchers so I've been
really really really happy with that so
I think it's been a great announcement
for HTC although we're it's going to
stack up by 10 the years over and how
it's going to sound
with Samsung and Apple is really yet to
be seen it's up for just a quick second
to thank our friend sponsors and peoples

next question comes from Twitter as well
at Kristen's sis off asks at John for
lakers i recently lost my phone bummer
involved in there man what is a great
but cheap phone i can get when I save up
for a new one the answer is very simple
two words moto X you can get one for a
killer deal you can customize it you can
find when you use on ebay if that's even
that may be too much for you the Moto G
is still a great phone it's a little
less expensive to get some of the nice
features of the Moto X you can't
customize the colors and stuff as much
but one of those two is an awesome way
to go the Moto X was almost unanimously
the smart front of the year here in the
staff I like pick the HTC One people
loved it I loved it you can get a great
deal on it I can pick it up unlocked and
you can sell it when you save up for
your new one use that money to buy the
new phone you can sort of help yourself
as you go and plus you're going to get a
really really nice phone soap it up at
your question so thank you guys for
