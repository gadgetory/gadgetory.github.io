burst I never TechnoBuffalo and oh man
one of my favorite things that I have
seen this year at CES is this little
nugget right here this is the razor
blade stealth and it looks like an
ultrabook because it is an ultrabook
it's $1,000 Ultrabook which is specked
out as much as you would expect it to be
expect the specs that's what I always
say razors been slaying the game lately
and this year is really no exception but
you know what this isn't just an
ultrabook
this is compatible with another one at
razors new products the razor core and
the razor core is essentially an
external enclosure for a high-end
graphics card we're finally at a point
where we can treat graphics cards almost
like hard drives where we can just take
an enclosure stick in a graphics card
whatever it is that we need and then
plug it right into the computer because
you know what
io is finally there it's finally caught
up and on that razor blade stealth you
get thunderbolt 3.0 I cannot wait to get
one of these in the office to test this
thing's gonna be able to come with me I
can take it to wherever I need to go get
an assembly cut down and then when I'm
ready to get down and dirty with the
editing I can just get right to the
office plug in that razor core and
suddenly I've got an Nvidia 980ti at my
disposal if I want it it's pretty darn
incredible and I gotta say I tried it
firsthand
and it was running fallout 4 flawlessly
fallout 4 flawlessly that's right on
those two giant displays that you see
right there in front of you I can't wait
for this thing to start shaking up the
Ultrabook industry we're finally there
with i/o it's super super exciting this
is easily one of the coolest things I've
seen at the show the razor blade stealth
comes in at a grand and the core is
gonna cost you another $500 of course
that's before you pay for the graphics
card yourself so you're still looking at
paying about as much as you would expect
to pay for a fully spec doubt PC with
the added benefit of this thing being
portable not to mention that display
it's
okay let me know what you guys think
about the razor blade stealth and the
core and the whole lineup and razor this
year easily one of my favorite favorite
things at the show in CES 2016 thank you
guys so much for watching be kind of one
another and I'll catch you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
