lines of phone used to be waterproofing
and extra durability but with the Galaxy
s7 s7 edge gaining ip68
the only improvement decipher a little
bigger batter you're getting with the s7
active is durability so we figured what
better way to test durability that to
tie it up to some drones take it up 50
100 200 400 feet and if it survives at
400 feet onto the soft surface see how
it does on some concrete we journey rate
the release system on a DJI phantom4
hopefully it's all gonna work
so our first test is at 50 feet let it
drop
all of it the case looks perfect
most absolutely perfect still rolling
survive 50 feet let's see how it does it
100
we definitely have some scuffs on the
rubber on the sides but kind of clean
this thing off this foot would still
look brand-new nothing at all on the
screen 100 feet no problem for the s7
active TOS and 200
200 feet I think it still works still
works phone still looks brand-new
so far so good let's take it up 400 feet
and see how it does
Oh was that in the concrete
so our 400 feet test in the field did
not go according to plan the wind
carried it on to the concrete let's go
to see what happened from 400 feet
if the s7 active survives it looks it's
still recording 400 feet onto concrete
hardly a scratch the screen scratched
you could easily use this phone so this
is the phone after the four hundred foot
drop you can see it looks really good
I'll do a proof here that's tearing the
camera and recording myself so after
four hundred foot drop onto concrete yes
seven active is still kicking we brought
the s7 active back to our studio we
noticed it sustained a decent amount
more damage and we originally thought so
for instance the screen is slightly
popping out on the bottom of device so
audios waterproofing and u2 are
accidental four hundred foot drop onto
pavement the back button and
multitasking buttons no longer work
although surprisingly the home button
still works perfectly and the
fingerprint reader still is good to go
there's a small scratch over the
front-facing camera so if you want to
use any snapchatting or anything that
front-facing camera it's gonna come out
super blurry go away meet your internal
damage that we could tell what sustained
damage to the charging port
unfortunately the active will no longer
charge via micro USB or transmit files
although wireless charging still works
the phone's not as perfect as initially
thought in the field but it held up we
passed our expectations so I think the
moral is here as long as you're not
dropping your active 400 feet onto the
pavement chances are you will be okay
obviously every drop test is different
few drop it from your pocket hits just
the right angle still potential for
damage but the s7 active looks to be way
more durable any other phone we tested
in the past we want to do another
concrete test just to see how it does
clearly landing directly on it worn to
your feet off the concrete seems pretty
good but we're gonna try it again x
marks the spot on the concrete until the
s7 active does
we had no idea how this was gonna go we
totally just journeyer eggs with tape
and a paper clip on to the Phantom 4 and
it worked so I guess if you want to get
a durable phone I think you have it a
better endorsement than 400 feet onto
concrete I was not overly optimistic but
durable what do you guys think about
this style of drop testing it's
something that you want to see us
continued do you give us suggestions for
another way to contestir ability of
supposedly durable devices we'd love to
hear your thoughts on it it's been a
really fun video for us to make to try
something new
leave in the comments down below just
mash that thumbs up button go ham on it
you always appreciate it until next time
I'm John render from TechnoBuffalo see
you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
