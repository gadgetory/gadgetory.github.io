to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of rumor
roundup i'm your host jon rettinger is
the show where I take every tech rumor
from the weekend I look at them all on a
smash room and I pick the three to five
that I think are the most interesting up
this week it's top of my mind because my
imac's on the fritz new I'm actually
becoming g-watch specs whenever the lg's
gonna pack in turn a little risk
computer might be getting legit if you
look at your brand new HTC One m8 you're
like my phone's the newest I love you
phone looks like you might not be the
newest for long because the m9 prime is
coming and frickin bendy phones and
tablets might be coming soon you think
cuz rumor roundup let's start just
rounding them up group hug there's a
quick report before apple's WWDC last
week suggesting apple was going to be
leased a new and more affordable imac
computer during the show now obviously
was all about softwares that didn't
happen but that rumor sticks around for
a while and much like herpes hard to get
rid of it doesn't seem to die Mac
generation said recently that Apple
plans to upgrade its imax next week
which is pretty awesome this video comes
out on Friday for watching this sometime
on Monday or so this week the new
computers won't launch iOS 10 Yosemite
of course at OS still super Beta we've
been trying at it's very beta I'm set to
launch sometime this fall however fret
not they suggested Apple was gonna break
from ordinary tradition pronouncing the
refresh earlier in the week on Tuesday
and will instead release the device
during the second half of the upcoming
week computers are set the ship was
slightly newer and slightly faster
Haswell processors speculation though
they might pack Thunderbolt 2 ports as
well not giant upgrades really Apple
probably quietly released these though
we do hope predictions of a cheaper imac
might come to fruition apple also
dropped the price of entry level macbook
air k99 so it seems possible the same
kind of move but reflected in the new
imac family which was always be nice
less money is always better although
persistent rumors of a Retina display
imac coming very soon or
so very enticing if you're like me to
get a new imac because something's up
with my wife I it will not connect I'm
gonna wait to see if a retina one comes
out if you can wait you know probably do
it a you know a little speck bumps
talking like that big difference but
yeah that's your money you do what you
want with it I'm not here to tell you
you make the decisions with google i/o
coming very quickly we're expecting a
lot more information to drop about
Android wear and of course about devices
like the super hot LG G watch and the
one I can't wait for the freaking Moto
360 but we probably don't delete all
that long because the leaking faucets
didn't turned on and we might know the
full spec sheet of LG's upcoming
wearable along with new pictures of the
back side of the device and I always
gotta trust the back side it's got a big
one we know that they don't lie so let's
go ahead and dive in on what the specs
might be so first the device is going to
hear the square form factor LG is
repeatedly keys in the past giving it
additional kind of just regular
SmartWatch feel on the inside though
it's what a lot of folks are going to be
paying attention to including this folk
according to the document the G watch
will sport a 400 million power battery
with standby time of 36 hours the LCD
screen will be one point six five inches
or 280 x to a wall of ice itself
reportedly be 37.9 but for 6.5 x 9.9
five millimeters that was a lot of
millimeters to remember diving further
though the g wat reportedly feature four
gigabytes of on-board storage estimated
to our charging time bluetooth 4.5 pin
microUSB contact on the back Mike and
let that slip out of my mind now the
spec sheet also further confirmed some
devices functionality through Android
wear like the ability to take memos send
SMS dictate email all through voice a
Google actually shared a kind of a cool
glimpse what it was like for designers I
using these different wearable form
factors and it seems like we're gonna
get the full unveil up coming soon an
eye out into the month and i will be
there i'm excited so coming very very
soon but that moto 360 I just I can't
like get another SmartWatch feel like
I'm cheating on that moto 360 I'm
wearing a pebble and I feel dirty I feel
like my moto 360 was gonna know what i
did i put my pebble on in a dirty motel
room motor tics you don't worry baby you
know
love you so you're a brand new HTC One
m8 you're just like oh look friends I
got a new phone I waited two years and
my phone's the freakin newest so boom
not gonna be the case very long we've
been hearing rumors that work an m8
prime was going to be coming but it
appears that's been put on indefinite
hiatus according to a recent report but
don't worry I Bentley HTC is hard at
work on a successor to the existing em
matin pencil launched its neck flagship
during key 1 2015 which is still kind of
far away so according to the pretty
reliable eveleigh HTC will launch its m9
and M nine Prime devices as an ex full
refreshes to the m1 family although
inexplicably the prime burgers likes to
launch first so that should be the
flagship phone and the regular I made
sort of not to flex your phone I don't
know it's gonna work with smartphones
advancing it's such a just a pretty easy
clip at appears handset makers might
sort of adopt a new approach and release
behind devices figures rumors to be true
and every it's this really good track
record HTC might start to trend by
unleashing a superphone type device the
highest and possible specs possible for
just the hardcore fans and then released
sort of a normal flagship that which
consumer doesn't need like 97 cores I
know not possible John you can't have
mini seven coolers I know Addison
exaggeration please don't yell at me
right now companies like to release a
flagship and then follow that up with a
mid-range device with water down specs
this newest approach though could
essentially replace the flagship with a
prime iteration and the mid-range a
typical flagship so that was a lot of
stuff are you still with me the crazy
model but more phones more specs more
better and more quickly releases so I
don't know you just you can always get a
new phone in a few months it seems like
should I wait and not wait something new
is always coming it's hard to pick the
best phone I think we have to get used
to knowing that you're not going to have
the newest phone for like you know a
week you go back a couple years you know
you can get a new samsung comb like
honestly every other week it kind of
seems like spaced out a little bit now
it's every two weeks and maybe HTC is
kind of going down that same road I
don't know but looking like it's gonna
be kind of soon I was really coming
forward to the MA Prime with a lot of
shipping into saw pictures of and all
that kind of stuff I don't know what the
reasons are bud
happy m9s coming new phones me new
things to play with and I love to play
with toys I have bad tech ed and like
more shiny this screen has that much
resolution so I'm excited are you
excited you know at HTC I love to hear

Linda calm select technobuffalo that's
ly ND a calm so I TechnoBuffalo back to
the rumors the last definitely not least
freedom bendy phones could be coming
Samsung is hard at work developing
flexible AMOLED displays already see
this tech though used in the galaxy
round in the gear fit but according to a
new report samsung could take a gigantic
leap forward next year with a get this
folding tablet smartphone hybrid just
take a second that fit but that just
sink in folding tablet smartphone hybrid
so this fresh rumor comes to the korean
web portal down da um which might just
be damned an anonymous industry insider
which always the best kind details
surrounding samsung's revolutionary
product though we're still super scarce
those sounds like the nice to get
transformed from a 9 inch tablet to four
or five smartphone by literally folding
in on itself which is crazy dumb also
claims that's going to line up in the
earlier patents for a trifle device that
samsung had a little while ago the idea
of somebody a tablet smartphone to one
device
isn't super new look at the asus and
it's odd phone line but Samsung could
pull this off it might take the market
by freaking storm a lightweight tablet
transform this into a phone is crazy i
met you know freaking cool it's going to
look also imagine if we do it itself
push your button like transforms be kind
of awesome obviously the caveat concerns
how thick is it going to be what do the
hinge is going to look like that kind of
stuff are all sort of to be determined
but it's the idea that we're living in
the freaking future we got google
showing cards drive themselves we got
tablets folding just crazy stuff I
wouldn't get too excited that this is
going to come you know next year this is
probably 23 years down the road if it
ever does happen but awesome that
they're trying it weird rumors at CES
last year at Samsung was showing off
early versions of the technology but no
one actually got to see it all these you
know live to see the day after they saw
it but it could be coming very very soon
