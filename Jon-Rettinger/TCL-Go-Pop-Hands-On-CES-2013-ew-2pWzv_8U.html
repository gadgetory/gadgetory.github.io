technobuffalo and I'm here at CES 2013
it's day one we're on location in Las
Vegas I'm hanging out with will ferrell
a cup of coffee also the OneTouch T
puppets an alcatel device and it's
manufactured by TC oh you know what
don't write these devices off because I
know you're probably looking at this and
if you're in the US market you're like
at a low rain low-end device not to
worry about its a prepaid device don't
write these off because I am convinced
that in 2013 we're gonna see a
resurgence more than we already have in
the prepaid market I think the challenge
with the prepaid market you're gonna see
this come to the state's most likely at
some point it's launching in Europe
right now launching in other countries
for somewhere you know between 79 and 99
euro so right there in that competitive
price point so yeah you know what it
doesn't have the highest and
specifications of packing gingerbread
android 2.3 a 3.5 inch hvga display it's
not that exciting from a spec standpoint
or I think you'll really see this pickup
is in the prepaid market in the US when
you see a device like this for 50 bucks
or a hundred bucks it brings people into
a smartphone realm for the first time
maybe people that had credit issues or
maybe just wanted a prepaid phone
because they didn't want to spend so
much on their postpaid plan cheeks the
android 2.3 you can see that i tried to
swipe from side to side because I'm so
used to Android 4.1 specs wise one
gigahertz CPU micro SD card support I
for 32 gigabytes you got a wide device
here on the back 3.2 megapixel camera no
flash on that but again android 2.3
suspects why it's a little bit older
kind of a custom look and feel here
looks like dual-sim support here as well
with the to non-existent
little things up there are non-existent
signal strength indicators assets turned
off right now but that's not awesome
option huge in other countries huge in
China Japan some of those countries
dual-sim options so it's nice to see
those devices come to market just for
the u.s. because we have to remember you
know what we're not the only market
there's a ton of different markets and
then a show like CES there's a ton of
stuff being showcased keep it locked on
