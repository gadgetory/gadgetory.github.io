TechnoBuffalo here it's an unboxing of
the mid-2011 refresh of the macbook air
this is the 11 inch model it's got the
upgraded core i7 chip with 256 gigabytes
of solid-state memory with 4 gigs of ram
and the newfangled Thunderbolt port
let's go ahead and dig in
I've been a big fan and admirer of the
MacBook Airs ever since the last update
I do almost all of my editing on iMovie
and now Final Cut Pro and lots of times
when I'm at trade shows or events I see
a lot of my editing on the fly the only
knock that I had on the last generation
MacBook Air was that it would take me
forever to export videos to export a
10-minute video but often times it took
me 30 40 minutes when I'm sitting there
at a trade show floor waiting to get to
the next thing that 30 40 minutes can be
killer so I'm hopeful that this guy is
going to increase my video export speeds
I am very very hopeful so here is
fingers crossed that's gonna do it I'm
gonna try this couple with one of those
Elgato little thumb drives that plug
right in there we should get some pretty
fast speeds so enough of my jibba jabba
let's go ahead and bring in and scene
you were stabbed you haven't seen senior
stabby in a while or else stab oh if
you'd like so MacBook Air MacBook there
in the front all kinds Apple logos and
serial number on the back let's go ahead
and cut its plastic go ahead and do this
very ceremonially I hope it doesn't hurt
I gave it in a seizure beforehand so
it's not even gonna feel anything boom
plastic is cut and if this doesn't
increase my video rendering times well
then maybe we have a really fun giveaway
on our hands so we'll go ahead and open
all this business up peel back all the
plastic this was a special order you
have to say build to order option so
I've got to build it online or build it
in store and have them send it to you go
ahead and lift off the top got that
little bit of foam that we've seen the
packaging here looks identical to last
generation and the computer itself looks
identical to last generation go ahead
and lift up this tab it is lifted up and
the computer is sitting in there upside
down there it is a little wedge shaped
glory this is again the 11.6 inch model
with the 1.8 gigahertz i7 chip and twin
256 gigabytes of solid-state memory okay
your typical MacBook Air accessories
here you got your MagSafe looks like a
MagSafe with the extension cord and this
guy does have Lion pre-installed last
generation that had Snow Leopard
actually came with the operating system
on a thumb drive this guy
it has no thumb drive hello I am your
computer and it's talking to you all
about the computer does not have a
FaceTime HD camera but you get your
Apple stickers as a consolation so if
you want to restore this guy you're
gonna do it completely online or make
your own bootable install disk
but blah blah blah accessories aren't
exciting even to me I'm not an accessory
guys don't push that stuff off to the
side let's take a look at the MacBook
Air go ahead and peel off all this
plastic I'll make it 15 for you if I can
get some romantic music here done oh no
no no it's a attend over to 21 and over
it's 21 and over it's a whole thing just
came off all right my bad news plastic
is pulled let's take a quick look we've
got the MagSafe charger when USB 2.0
port there's the headset which is also
the microphone in a little bit of a
speaker there on the other side we've
got the Thunderbolt port only way to
tell the difference between a
thunderbolt port and the old mini
DisplayPort is this one's got a little
bit of Thunderbolt logo and another USB
2.0 port battery still sealed in this
keyboard is now back --lens both the
last generation go and open it up boom
there it is it's a keyboard and it's a
monitor alright let's go ahead and turn
this guy on hey there no problem we're
going to use the button that's the
proper way to turn the computer on and
we get the first little dingdong you can
see me dancing I don't need any sort of
like startup language here or anything
that's even exciting you don't get any
fun songs that come up here I'll sing it
for you though doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo you see you can pretend
that it's saying welcome vocal Mun and
all kinds of stuff
hopefully it boots up looks like it's
been something fingers crossed every
time I turn on a new computer or
reinstall the hard drive I'm always a
bit skeptical up things are gonna work
you never quite know but I do have a
mouse and have a cursor so it's very
simplified version oh there we go yay
use English as my main language its own
language it I can speak fluently so we
will use that we'll go ahead and I am in
the United States of America I am in the
US and so to go through and do all the
setup business I'll come back in just a
minute not gonna make you watch all this
and I'll see you guys in just a second
all right so here we are in OS 10 lion
this is about as clean install as you
can get let me know I've got some there
with only some apps to be uploaded or
updated rather let's go ahead to the
start let's go about this Mac and let's
see what this Mac has in store so there
is the 1.8 gigahertz intel core i7 4
gigs of ram and it's got the 20 50 60
gigabyte hard drive so of course I will
put this guy through its test so I'll
run everything through it and I'll see
how it works and see what's worth the
upgrade it certainly doesn't come at an
expensive price so whether or not you're
considering an upgrade or considering
picking up your first MacBook Air
hopefully that can help shed some light
for you if you have any questions or
things you want to see leave them down
below we know what have you I'm John
Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo I'll see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
