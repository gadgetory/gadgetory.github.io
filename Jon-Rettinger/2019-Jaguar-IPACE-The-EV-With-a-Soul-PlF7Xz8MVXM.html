straight-up better than others you've
been following TechnoBuffalo or me you
know I love Evie's in fact I have an
Evie driver for the past five years and
about four months ago I put a deposit
down for the brand-new Jaguar eye pace
so when Jaguar sent me an email asking
if they could sponsor a video where I
could essentially take the car for a day
and drive all along the northern
California coast
I could not reply fast enough so come
along with me as I take a look at the
brand-new 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds
2019 Jaguar Ivy's Jaguar is known for an
iconic design and usually what that
design is is a gigantic hood to put in
those big engines that Jaguar usually
has in their car boat you've got an
electric vehicle you don't have an
engine so it did a bit differently with
the iPay since there isn't a big engine
in the front they actually moved the cab
forward it's it's appropriately called a
cab forward design didn't give you a lot
more interior space inside the car but
they kept a lot of the iconic jag
iconography that you get from Jaguars
lineup still with the eye paste you can
start by that big old grilles there a
lot of v's don't have that grill because
they're not always necessary
this one's got a foreman function it
keeps the car in line with Jaguars brand
identity but it also sends air to the
radiator to help cool it it's a lot of
cool things done the design is actually
a hood scoop right above that front
grille that's gonna send air all the way
up from the car over and then all the
way back down and kind of interestingly
you're not gonna see a wiper on the back
of the car and you don't need one
evidently now it's not rainy and I can't
test it but because how this car handles
wind the wind would send the rain or the
water droplets right off the back so
Jaguars done a really good job trying to
use wind and at least get the drag
coefficient down as little as possible
to maintain the range a lot of tech
inside and outside the car obviously 360
cameras you got Park Assist and hope you
park in the car the eyepiece is the
first time the in-control touch pro duo
made its way to jaguar you might
seen it in some of the Range Rover
products but is here now essentially
it's just screens it just
screens on screens on screens you've got
a 10-inch screen you've got a 5.5 inch
screen the knobs to change the climate
have screens there's a screen in the
dash and it all worked together pretty
well kind of a cool feature so the knobs
I mentioned they've got screens like
everything else but they do different
stuff obviously you can turn them but
you can push it and that'll give you the
see controls to turn on either the
cooling or the warming if you pull it up
towards you that I'll control the fan
speed they made them sort of multi-use
which is neat bTW here overall is crazy
premium it has soft touch materials it's
wrapped in the leathers it just looks
and feels really nice inside of it then
that system definitely has a bit of a
learning curve you know but over the
past now I've been driving for about 60
miles we start to get the hang of it it
is pretty highly customizable
there's just cubby storage everywhere in
this car you could put water bottles the
main center console here is big enough
everything expected is here from from
memory seeds to safety to whatever you
would want from a modern car you're
going to get it soon pretty comfortable
in the front we take a couple seats in
the back and there's plenty of legroom
for anywhere you want to go and you
don't have that hump in the middle so
you could really put three people in the
back pretty comfortably obviously there
are different trim levels available it's
gonna start just under $70,000 at about
69 five and then you've got the first
Edition which has every option checked
off assuming you're not getting a first
edition the more letters you have in the
name the more expensive the car is gonna
get so the eyepiece is all-wheel-drive
you've got two electric motors sitting
in between the front axle and the rear
axle that's gonna get you to 60 in four
and half seconds and is an incredible
amount of torque it's 512 foot pounds
and 394 horsepower it is insanely fast
so you think about driving a normal car
to get the torque to get which is the
pulling power you didn't sort of wait
for the gears to start to spool up with
the electric vehicle all that torque is
there pretty much instantaneously it's
right it's analogy of using an electric
drill as the new
you pull that trigger the drill bit is
spinning as fast as it's going to ever
go sitting at the car as soon as you
punch the accelerator pedal all that
torque is there so you really can go
fast very quickly especially from a stop
and when I say fast I don't mean like
casually meandering the 60 I mean throw
you back in your seat
gels pinned back type speed this is zero
to 60 and four and a half seconds so the
90 kilowatt hour pack is gonna give you
about a two hundred and forty mile range
so I think when people think about
driving electric cars and when I started
the first thought that came into my head
was a range anxiety you don't have
certainly have that precedes convenience
of going to a gas station and just
filling up but you've got a car that
gives you 240 miles of range
we've been driving 50 miles through
hills and canyons and it seems to be a
really accurate sense of how much range
you're going to get V's by nature are
quiet it's one of their hallmark
features Jaguar did a really nice job
with noise dampening if you want that
quiet
evie ride you totally get it you barely
hear any wind noise it kind of comes
through the scoops up front and goes
over the windshield but Jaguar has done
something called active sound design
where you're going to get a sound that
you would get if you're an
internal-combustion car when you step on
the accelerator or the gas you're gonna
get that noise and it sounds awesome it
sounds like the future and it sounds
like this
the 90 kilowatt hour battery packs it's
like a skateboard across the bottom of
the car well that's gonna give you as a
50/50 weight distribution which means we
are going around these turns the car
it's going to hold the road incredibly
well you're not gonna feel any sort of
body roll that you might get in a car
with a big weighted engine in front
there's only so much we can test and
check out in just a three and a half
hour ride with the ipace but I did come
away super impressed I'm hoping to get
some more time behind the wheel do a
proper review of the IPA so something
you want to see us cover that we did in
this video leave in the comments down
below
but overall the car was really
impressive this didn't strike me as a
rookie effort from Jaguar at electric
vehicle the car was fast a car was
nimble the car handled well and most
importantly the car kind of had a soul
but something you can't really say with
most electric vehicles overall in just
my short time with a Jaguar I pace I
came away incredibly impressed
