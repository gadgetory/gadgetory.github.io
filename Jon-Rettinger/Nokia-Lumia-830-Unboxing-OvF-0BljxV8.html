TechnoBuffalo here for you lumi acts out
there I think I just made that word up
I've got some good news for you this is
the latest from Microsoft this is the
Lumia 830 might be one of the last phone
sexually sport that Nokia Lumia branding
let's go ahead open it up take a first
one so here is the box for the Lumia 830
all dolled up in AT&amp;amp;T s orange and white
you've got the globe on the top picture
of the device on the back this one's
black but I'm kind of hoping we got a
green winning here available obviously
for AT&amp;amp;T i will use send your stab ease
made a comeback my old unboxing friends
go ahead and cut this open I've sent to
us courtesy of our friends at Microsoft
but open this up and there is the nokia
lumia 830 quick start guide but we
should know all this stuff we don't need
paperwork let's go ahead and pull this
up and there's a phone feeling very thin
and spelt we've got a sim card in there
else inside of the box we got a green
back plate so i can make it green black
is so yesterday we've got a wall warts
we've got the battery it's kind of an
interesting shape battery and we've got
a micro USB cable and that is about it
let's go ahead and take a first look at
the phone alright so here is the phone
itself let's take it out of the plastic
oh it's just just a bag and i can get my
whooshing noise that i love this one
feels really nice probably feel super
light because you know no battery in it
let's go ahead and pull that off looks
like they're telling me it's just do
this i will do that the back comes off
and there's a very clearly display for
where the sim card goes and where the
battery goes i assume we got to pull
that off a pretty unique shape quickly
battery 2200 milliamp hour so i'll go
ahead pop this in i will turn the phone
on and i'll tell you all about alright
so we got the Lumia 830 all booted up
and ready to go and you are
looking at a 5-inch screen that's a
clear black IPS LCD panel it's got a
resolution of 1280 by 720 which gives it
a ppi of 294 it's a weird warped world
15 inch screen on the phone almost feel
small just a fun fact I'd like to share
a fuse when a larger screen size it's
just crazy to think that now this is
kind of a smaller to average size phone
it's covered by Gorilla Glass 3 so it
should be able to handle all your drops
pills anything else that might come your
way 1 gig of ram gonna keep this thing
coming along 16 gigs of internal storage
but you got a microSD card to expand it
up to 128 gigs if you'd like powering it
is a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon
400 chip Windows Phone 8.1 of course the
big story as is the case with a lot of
Lumia devices lives on the back and it
is that guy right there it's a 10
megapixel PureView camera with Zeiss
optics also has optical image
stabilization should be able to take
pretty awesome pictures and video not
the only camera though can't get all the
glory there's a point 9 megapixel
shooter right on front let's take a
quick look at some of the apps that are
going to come on board here we just want
to give aunt reddit recently has a
really nice app support it's come a long
way over the recent years so a few new
things here you might not have noticed
if yeah it's been a while since you last
use Windows Phone first you have a
digital assistant called Cortana we've
done a ton of video coverage on her she
is one of the best assistants out
there's a credible job also to get them
to humor ask her to tell you some jokes
one day also we now have folders the
cool thing about folders that they still
sort of keep their live tile going on
here so you see it's got music and
videos I select that you can see all the
music and video things in that folder I
think Microsoft did a really good job
with folders continuing our tour here
it's also going to come into our home
screen you've got amazon keeper and
yellow pages I'm who's really using that
anymore else you're going to have built
in we've got a lot of a TD specific
things Calendar camera Cortana some of
the financings see what else is going to
be on board here of course Microsoft
Office podcasts and a ton of other apps
built right in a wallet the stylus
support for a formerly called Isis now
soft card support folks and microsoft
also sent us a Fitbit flex letting you
know there's now Fitbit support for
windows phone so if you want to sort of
track your sleeping track your health
you can out do so with your Windows
Phone also you now have notifications
you can pull Dinah she had a phone
notification center which shows your
battery life and sort of jump into quick
settings alright so that's the software
what about the buttons and things around
here say Windows Phone always has to
have three buttons you've got your back
button you hold that you can survie your
tomb stoning and you could sort of
select between your apps your home
windows button or your search button on
the left hand side of device very easy
because you got nothing on the
right-hand sides where all the action is
gonna happen this is the party side I've
got your volume rocker up and down
you've got your power and lock but and i
love that Windows Phone requires you to
have a dedicated camera I will say
despite being a mid range from this
phone feels really high-end Lumia build
quality and Nokia's build quality has
always been outstanding oh this metal
ring around the outside spike have
removable back it feels really solid no
indentation you press it at all exposed
speaker grill as we didn't showed you in
the unboxing it's gonna come in green or
black depending on what's your feeling
that day because pop it off and put a
new color if you'd like i also can have
wireless charging out here so in case
you want to you know cut the cord you
can go ahead and do so and i spent a
quick unboxing and first look at the
brand new Lumia 834 18 thank you guys
