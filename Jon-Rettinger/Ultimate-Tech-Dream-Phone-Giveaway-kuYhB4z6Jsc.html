have brought you the latest and
sometimes unexpected best technology
we're taking a look at million-dollar
sports cars we've seen the latest
smartphones tablets and laptops but
today I am showing you the latest in
connected toothbrush technology from the
folks at Philips is the Philips Sonicare
FlexCare platinum connected and it might

awesome toothbrush that I want to tell
you about and we teamed up the folks

Sonicare FlexCare platinum connected
keep your grill clean because you
probably should brush your teeth though
as we're getting ready to film this
video Philips sent over a toothbrush for
me to check out Odette I was like just a
toothbrush with a nap so we went over to
my house and we started filming me
brushing my teeth and I literally
brushed my teeth to get this video right
for about 15 minutes
my teeth were so shiny like I spent an
hour - dentist chair but I did learn a
couple cool things by the toothbrush and
it does a lot of things you wouldn't
expect from a toothbrush so first has
its own companion app which I know it
might sound like something you're not
going to use but the more I try the more
useful became it'll actually give you
guidelines to how you're brushing your
teeth that's clean your teeth well let's
lie you're using too much pressure in
one area when I should move on to the
next area mouth kind of breaks it up
into six different quadrants on I found
that if actually I followed the steps
and did it as the app suggestion my
mouth actually felt way cleaner now that
accuse a lot of things in my life but I
definitely can have a bit of a dirty
mouth fur guys ever use a Sonicare
toothbrush it's kind of a different
experience
it delivers 31,000 brushstrokes per
minute which is an insane amount of
brushstrokes your teeth are going to
feel absolutely incredible after you use
this brush for me kind of boiled down to
this I know a toothbrush is kind of a
different topic and we've covered but
something that kind of I always feel
strong about I had braces for at braces
or three years not as young and I want
to keep my keep looking clean I wear
retainer every night
choosing the Sonicare was kind of a cool
experience I was able to learn a ton
more about my brushing habits it checked
if you missed any spots you can go back
and do touch-ups and also it has three
different modes are kind of cool it's
got clean white and
for deep-clean then you can do different
sort of levels inside of that so after
you brush your teeth it's going to start
aggregating data and it's going to
display a three-beam mouth I'm going to
show you how your behaviors change over
time so you can see like we did here
your dirty mouth you go to a clean mouth
you actually move it around and see all
the different areas in your teeth to see
where you miss and we've gotten better
we've got a smart brush head monitor to
tell me when I got to swap out my brush
head based on my personal usage patterns
also one thing I learned about tooth
brushing and me included was we don't
brush our teeth long enough there's a
smart timer in the power toothbrush that
time is each brushing session make sure
that I'm brushing for the dental
professional recommended two minutes
that's the Philips Sonicare FlexCare
platinum connected it is a lot to say
but is an awesome product I want to keep
your mouth clean you want to have some
cool use of new technology if you
haven't used in the past you should
definitely check it out and while you're
