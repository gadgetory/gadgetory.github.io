loving friends and big ipod touch
wanting peeps the day is upon us Apple
has bestowed us a ship date for their
tablet dubbed the iPad it is going to be
delivered and arriving in stores
simultaneously on saturday april third
pre-orders are going to begin March
twelfth which flows due keeping track at
home depending on what they are watching
this is one week from today which is
februari fifth a non 3g version is going
to be available in late april if you've
been wanting a 3g version through AT&amp;amp;T
as a refresh for pricing the non 3g
version so Wi-Fi only the 16 gig is
going to run you 499 the 32 is gonna run
you 599 and the Big Daddy 64 is gonna
set you back 699 dollars if you do want
to wait until late april for the 3g
version the prices are going to be 6 29
for the 16 gig 729 for 232 and 829 is
topping the charts for these big biggest
of them all the 64 gig 3g version so you
kind of time to sort of think about the
device and let it simmer so what it's
going to do and what it may do are you
excited about the ipad will you be
shelling out your hard-earned dollars
for me it looks like the 32 gig non 3g
version may be the sweet spot be nice to
have a decent amount of storage are you
excited about the ipad you still think
it's just a big ipod touch or are you
may be a change your mind about it you
know i think the future of advice is
going to lay in the hands of the
developers we've seen some
representations about what ebooks might
look like and how they're being a bit
more interactive than just flip a page
flip a page flip a page there's pictures
and video embedded personally i'm most
excited about the possibility of hulu
coming to the ipad which is just rumored
at this point would be a fantastic
device to be able to watch TV shows and
potentially movies on as well and that's
what
subscription would really be pretty
kick-ass I think that there's a lot of
again potential for the device for a
magazine reader i think is going to
change the way that we consume media I
think really witnessing a paradigm shift
whether it's the iPad itself that sort
of brings that about or another device
the ipad is definitely going to drive
the tablet market and drive the
innovation so for that i am looking
forward to it so guys again will you be
buying an ipad do you not care you're
gonna preorder you're gonna wait in line
you're gonna wait and see what the
reviews are we gonna wait till
generation to when you may get who knows
front-facing camera video chat and
whatever will make you lunch i'm very
curious what you guys have to say so
leave a video response or text comment
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
