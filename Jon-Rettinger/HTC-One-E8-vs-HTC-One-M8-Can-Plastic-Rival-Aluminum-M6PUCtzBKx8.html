to you by lynda.com what's going on guys
a Marklin segment from TechnoBuffalo and
it's another Tuesday show so that means
we'll be comparing the HTC One m8 and
the HTC One EA tand see which one we
prefer more when the HTC One m8 came out
earlier this year it was probably one of
the most anticipated Android smartphones
to date due to its sleek design and
overall look the m8 is definitely
hands-down one of the best-built
Android smartphones out in the market
it's carved from a single piece of
aluminum which curves perfectly in your
hand and there's barely any plastic in
sight the HTC One ei tone the other hand
is made out of polycarbonate so it looks
far less premium than one m8 however at
the front of both devices look really
similar as both phones feature a 5 inch
full HD display and they also have the
boom sound speakers above and below the
screen that we all know and love and we
didn't really hear any difference
between the two when we tested them
they're both equipped with a 2.3
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 801
processor 2 gigabytes of RAM 2600
milliamp battery the jareno 330 GPU and
it's running Android 4.4.2 KitKat with
HTC Sense UI over it probably one of the
biggest difference between these two
devices are the cameras the HTC One m7
and m8 is known for its portrait pixel
technology and this year HTC opted to
put in a second camera above the m8 s--
primary camera and its job is to create
a depth map of your scene which allows
you to add high-quality rendered effects
such as background blur or bokeh as some
photographers like to call it and it
essentially allows you to refocus your
images after the shot was taken sort of
like the Lytro camera that was released
a few years back and we found that the
you focus effect on the One m8 works
really well in terms of camera
performance the colors on the One m8 is
a bit washed out and under saturated for
our taste even though it's using bigger
pixels the four ultra pixel just isn't
cutting out for us photos aren't as
sharp as we'd like it to be and you
won't be able to crop an image to your
liking since it's lacking the megapixels
indoors and low-light on the other hand
are pretty good compared to the EA and
we're pretty satisfied with the results
we got with the One m8 now the other
thing I'd like to point out with the
inmates camera is that the auto white
balance isn't as accurate as the one on
the one e8 the auto white balance is
completely off in certain lighting
conditions and we really prefer the e8
more accurate white balance now the one
I ate on the other hand is equipped with
a 13 megapixel sensor instead of the
typical ultra pixel technology that's on
one m8 and we found that it's a hit or
miss shots were definitely sharper but
the colors were a bit too saturated
compare that one and mate and we noticed
that some shots came out a bit
underexposed and usual which is a bit
disappointing to us low-light shooting
on the e8 is decent it's not bad though
not the best either it's definitely not
something like the One m8 which can sort
of shoot in complete darkness camera
software is the same - you get the same
features on the one that made except for
the you focus feature that allows you to
refocus an image after you take a shot
but other than that we found everything
else was about the same Zoe's still
present here so you're really not
missing out on much in terms of video
both can record in 1080p and slow-motion
720p videos and they both perform very
similar the audio is clear and we didn't
notice any difference between the two in
terms of video let's take a quick break

TechnoBuffalo the other noticeable
difference between these two is the
overall exterior design the One m8 like
I mentioned earlier in the beginning is
made out of a single piece of aluminum
while the one I ate is made out of
polycarbonate also known as a
high-quality plastic it's naturally easy
to see the difference between the one m8
and the one EA aside from their colors
and finishes the One m8 has that dual
camera system on the back with its dual
LED flash well the one I ate single
sensor is apparent along with its green
glass that partially wraps around the
side of the phone's body when he comes
to pricing both the HTC One m8 and E's
price fluctuates they're both going for
around 600 to $650 unlock right now
based off of amazon's pricing even than
the one i ate is prices sound much
cheaper than the m8 they're around the
same price range here in america
technically the one i ate is only
available in Europe and parts of Asia
and we don't know if we'll ever see a
use variant of the e8 with proper LTE
bins though if you want to get one for
yourself you can buy it on amazon now
but don't expect to get the LTE speeds
just yet as we could only get ours to
run on HSPA so to wrap things up for you
guys I'm still gonna have to go over the
HTC One m8 on this one it's just a much
more premium phone in my eyes aluminum
finish is great and it's available in
every market with the proper LTE bands
even though it only has four ultra
pixels that'll do for the average
Joe and that's it for this video guys if
you guys have any other questions let us
know in the comments down below I'm mark
