John retina from TechnoBuffalo here with
another smartphone Smackdown for you
this time again featuring the iPhone and
the Google Nexus One Lewis you're
keeping track at home we put the iPhone
4 up against the HTC EVO 4G with the Evo
knocking out the iPhone we put the
iPhone 4 up against the droid incredible
with the iPhone smacking back taking out
the droid so now we're going to put the
Nexus 1 in the Iron Throne head-to-head
and see who comes out on top we've got a
leathered around you're gonna cover
obviously there are a ton of things we
can discuss and sort of focus it for
brevity we're gonna cover display power
and battery storage price features speed
browser keyboard UI and navigation looks
camera and call quality so let's go
ahead and get started and talk about
display one of the big features touted
about the iPhone 4 is its Retina display
and Apple really doesn't disappoint here
it's got a 3.5 inch screen the same size
as previous generations with a new
resolution of 960 by 480 making it to be
really highest quality screen on the
market the Nexus One is no slouch coming
in a little bit bigger a 3.7 inch WVGA
AMOLED screen as amo LED with an 800 by
480 resolution whenever I first saw the
Nexus One I thought it was the best
looking screen I'd ever seen and that
sort of held true until I saw the iPhone
4 screen so the iPhone is going to
narrowly take this round because it's
Retina display and high resolution which
really does come to play you're looking
at video pictures and movies so let's go
ahead and continue the tour here and
we're going to talk about power and
battery so the iPhone is using the Apple
as a four system-on-chip the same
processor found in the iPad batter
you're going to get seven hours of
talktime on 3G and 14 hours on edge the
Nexus One certainly has a lot of power
behind it using stuff the snapdragon 1
gigahertz processor by qualcomm which is
a very fast capable processor you're
going to get 10 hours of talktime on 2g
and 7 hours on 3G so a processor or
processor I think
draw before putting a problem sir and
battery together the iPhone is going to
take the edge here because gets an extra
almost well well almost about four hours
extra talk time on and to admit you may
actually end up meeting so the iPhone
that once again is going to take this
round let's go ahead and move on to
storage so store desert an interesting
story here with with the iPhone you can
get two configurations either 16 or 32
in price went to talk about a little bit
later up $1.99 $2.99 on the neck is one
further on the other hand you're going
to get well different storage options
are gonna get four gigabytes microSD
prior in the box it's been going all the
way up to 32 so you can really determine
what size is best for you your journey
that comes in for a gigabyte chunk so if
you only want a 4 gigabyte phone you
have that choice if I want an a gigabyte
phone you have that choice as well if
one all the way up to 32 and pay the
money for the expensive card you have
that choice as well so storage is going
to go to the Nexus One
not only did for the size difference but
also because it's removable so if you're
a photographer you want to pinch our
pictures to your computer you go like
this pop up a card and put it in an
adapter and plug it in or give the card
to a friend about that music it's a
certainly storage I think the Nexus One
is going to get the edge so let's talk
about price tear the iPhone is going to
run you $1.99 for 16 gigs or $2.99 for
32 and the Nexus One you can get two
different ways either on contract or
unlocked for 179 bucks you can get it on
contract you can get it with t-mobile
Sprint or Verizon and it's going to cost
you about five hundred $29 if you want
to get it unlocked so if it expensive
there and then it's going to get you
just a 4 gigabyte microSD card if you
want to expand all the way up to 32 so
the cost you about another $200 making
the 179 entry price point a bit higher
so for price and if you're going to get
a little bit more with the iPhone 4
certainly for $300 you're going to get a
full 32 gigs where if you're going to
get it for 179 on contract there's $200
you're gonna be looking
at almost $100 more expensive but for
price I think the iPhone represents a
bit of a better value so next let's talk
about features because there are a lot
of features to love about each of these
devices so the iPhone we got a
front-facing camera for FaceTime you can
see that right there for video chat I
hide the resolution Retina display that
we talked about and 802 11 N for really
fast data transfers the I far the Nexus
One brings a lot to the table as well
with haptic feedback Google Maps
Navigation speech-to-text which is
fantastic live wallpapers and widgets so
when you sort of put the features
together head to head spin depend on
what's important to you
this round is going to be a draw so now
let's talk about speed speed is
important everyone before we get into
these tests we go ahead and close all
programs so you can see we're starting
sort of from well comparing apples to
will say oranges here so go ahead and
use task killer I killed all the
applications on the Nexus One make sure
everything is killed here on the iPhone
4 and it is indeed snowy so we're
starting from basis to basis so let's go
ahead and jump right into the browser
the Nexus One doesn't have a sim card in
so we're going to test Wi-Fi speed and
we're going to test feed on two websites
that's what I visit on a regular basis
so they've already been loaded on both
devices here we'll start with
TechnoBuffalo and my youtube channel
youtube.com slash John for Lakers then
go ahead and get that queued up you're
ready to go and we'll do the same thing
on the Nexus One go ahead and launch I
should say that this is running Android
version 2.2 Froyo
with the frf 50 build let's go ahead and
launch this up we'll jump on over to the
YouTube channel
and we'll do a simple refresh with speed
so you can see how this this works as
the sort of load you'll see some
differences here as well so we'll go
ahead and set this to refresh and we'll
set this to sort of refresh I'll put
them both at the same time and we'll see
which is the winner and of course on the
same Wi-Fi network and we'll talk about
what's going on right there in just a
minute all right and we are off on each
with a refresh but the Nexus One had a
clear edge there and speedin already
loaded it and the nexus word the iPhone
4 is still going and as it's still
loading you can see the video actually
playing on the screen and that is
because well quite obviously the Nexus
One has flashed which we will talk about
in just a moment but you can see the
video playing natively they got the ad
in the upper right hand corner and it's
working let me go ahead and pause this
and go ahead and zoom in zoom a little
bit more using the multi-touch prints to
zoom feature and go ahead and hit pause
there we go alright so we saw the speed
that loaded a little bit quicker than I
think I just have to add a little bit
quicker on the Nexus 1 let's see if that
holds true for another website as well
we'll jump on over to TechnoBuffalo calm
and we'll jump over to TechnoBuffalo
calm here they will do a refresh and
we'll see how the speed is going to
compare on each alright so we'll go
ahead and get this refresh started and
we'll see if we get the same results and
once again it's like the Nexus One has a
very early lead
and is now done and the iPhone 4 was
just a little bit behind so the iPhone
caught up but the Nexus 1 was still
quicker so let's go ahead and see how
that holds through to app time and this
is a very unscientific test because the
operating systems handle apps
differently you can see that I still
have trouble with those capacitive
buttons at the bottom but we'll talk
about those in just a minute see the
live wallpaper going as well on the
Nexus One
let's open up sort of some similar
things let's go and open up settings and
see which one opens up first for us so a
little bit quicker on the Nexus One
let's go ahead and try and open up
camera go ahead and pick the passage of
button on the Nexus One or a very big
annoyance so we'll go to applications
and I will open up camera on each so a
little bit a little bit quicker there on
the iPhone but not much and let's try
one more similar application
let's try opening up what can be similar
let's try going right to the browser
again from the home screen or from the
Settings icon and that should be going
to taneous li because they're both sort
of running in the background and that
was just about the same so speed first
reading a very unscientific test the
Nexus One is a bit faster we've seen
actually all the Android devices have
tested we faster than the iPhone that
includes
the next is one now the Evo 4G and the
Droid Incredible something to sort of
keep in mind let's go ahead and move on
over to browser and start talk about
some the things that we have here so the
iPhone I think was really one of the
first to bring a multi-touch browser and
serve a really full function featured
WebKit experience however Android has
certainly caught up I'm still an iPhone
fan I love how smooth the pinch-to-zoom
is it really is seamless the scrolling
is very fast and quick I just launched a
YouTube video there but it just works
very very very well as far as the
multi-touch pinch-to-zoom I don't think
it's as smooth on Android particular
here on the Nexus One it seems a little
bit delayed a little bit laggy but it
doesn't work and you can pan around it
does go smooth but not as smooth and the
double tap to zoom and everything sort
of works if it's squirrely however the
Nexus One does bring flash support to
the table and whether you want it or
don't want it it's nice to have the
option I personally don't use watch on a
mobile device but I like being able to
have the choice to not use it as opposed
to being told that I can't use it so if
you're gonna put these sort of browsers
head-to-head as much as I love the
iPhone browser it's got to go to the
Nexus One so next let's go ahead and
jump into you I certainly uija is
something that got UI navigation it's
something that's going to be very
subjective to people on what they prefer
if you like certainly enclosed Apple
experience and the seamless integration
sure including within Apple's walled
garden you're going to get a very nice
experience here with the iPhone you know
let me the sort of a grid of icons
display you can make folders and such to
sort of store your ayah store your
applications but you're still stuck
scrolling from home screen to home
screen you can see a folders there on
the Nexus One
your navigation is sort of oh is more
widget based you can sort of put in
whatever widgets you like little mini
applications running and you get a bit
of a more open feel it doesn't listen if
you have polish to me as the iPhone but
a lot of people like that so you can
customize the Nexus 1 to make it feel
like it is meant for you you're limited
to just your finger here on the iPhone 4
however on the Nexus One you've got
finger input and you've got especially
on Froyo here now you've got sort of
three buttons at the bottom you can jump
from home to home screen by tapping that
icon and you've got four capacitive
buttons and a trackball I gotta tell you
I don't mind capacitive buttons on the
Evo 4G they work very well on the joint
incredible they work very well on the
Nexus One they do not work well at all
and this is particularly f2 the Nexus
One you have to really make sure you hit
it with the fat part of your finger to
get it's registering you can solder this
video I had problems with that so this
one is really going to come out the
personal preference you why I'm not sure
which one people are going to prefer so
we're going to call this round a draw so
next let's go ahead and move on to looks
certainly want to look nice pull out of
foam in a meeting that certainly what
people used to make a lot of their their
opinions so the iPhone has a very
classic sort of iPhone look you can get
it in black and soon you'd be able to
get it in white to differentiate
yourself a little bit scott sort of the
original one of the original slab phones
as all touchscreen based single button
is very minimalistic the next is one is
extremely capable as we've seen but it's
by no means a good-looking phone the
scroll ball off the bottom which makes
it look a little outdated and the
capacitive buttons not working I'm sure
they're tapping on a free times may look
a little bit silly the bigger screen
isn't very nice they're both extremely
thin devices from the back you serve get
the clean lines of the iPhone certainly
get the slashed part of the Nexus One
that is because the battery is removable
but in a looks apartment I prefer the
way the iPhone looks over the next one
and since I am the one doing this review
this round is going to go to the iPhone
4 alright so next let's jump on over to
camera cameras are very important let's
go ahead and talk about what we have
here so
on the iPhone 4 you get a 5 megapixel
sensor on the back you get an LED flash
it can shoot 720p video 30 frames per
second and it's got on the front 0.3
megapixel camera for video calling the
Nexus One on the other hand has a five
megapixel sensor as well it can also
shoot HD video but only have twenty
frames per second it also has an LED
flash but no front-facing camera here so
probably not a surprise anyone this edge
is going to go to the V iPhone so now
let's talk about call quality since
these are phones they both got make good
phone calls and I got to tell you they
both do make very good phone calls I
tested the Nexus One on t-mobile 18
teams Network speaker volume was loud on
each I had no white noise using either
Network and they've just worked very
well so called quality I have no
problems complaints with either I have
not had any drop calls so far winter
with either phone despite how I told my
iPhone I don't really hold it and the
way that's having issues because you're
gripping it at the vice grip so I
haven't had any problems there and held
calls very well so this round now is
also going to be a draw alright so the
next thing that I want to talk about is
two more since both of these don't have
physical QWERTY keyboards the way you
input text is going to be very very very
important so let's go ahead and talk
about each in the past when we've
compared Android devices we've been
using HTC's Sense UI whichever puts a
custom keyboard the next one uses the
stock Android keyboard which actually I
prefer over the sense of UI is one let's
go ahead and jump right in to notes here
go ahead and open up a new note and I do
want to give full disclosure here I am
an iPhone user so I may be a bit more
familiar with the iPhone keyboard so you
can type on both these in two ways
either portrait or landscape let's go
ahead and do a quick test here and I
will times for the standard method I use
for all use
we need the poo it sounds funny that
quickly with pretty accurately as well
go ahead and jump on over and both have
autocorrect look that very good out of
correct I should say
Winnie the Pooh's sounds funny instead
of hitting the spacebar for a period I
hit the V instead but relatively
accurate there let's go ahead and move
on over to the Nexus One we'll go ahead
and try and create a new message so
we'll jump on into applications here
we'll go to messages messaging and we
will create a new message tap the
compose right here and here's sort of
the standard keyboard that you're going
to get on Andrea it just works very well
so let's try this in portrait
so we need the food sounds gross I made
a mistake while typing but it
autocorrected it let's try it in
landscape
we need the poop sounds gross so there's
two way to be physically in protects but
how about the third and the third is a
little microphone right there at the
speech-to-text let me go ahead and give
you example this I'm gonna have to move
their foam and off-camera to pull up to
my face to type so I'm gonna go ahead
and push it in okay Winnie the Pooh
sounds gross
we need the previous sounds gross it put
it in there exactly perfectly and the
speech-to-text
is the reason that the keyboard and text
input on the nexus one is going to win
sort of typing for typing it's very
close are pretty comparable I'm more
used to the iPhone but I could see
getting used to the Nexus One keyboard
very quickly however being able to speak
to the text is a fantastic feature it's
a safety feature and it's not just a
four one that sort of works sometimes it
actually works surprisingly well and
hopefully and it works all the time so
the keyboard edge has got to go to the
Nexus One okay so for everyone keeping
track at home it's time the clear winner
we had an eleven round smackdown iPhone
one display the iPhone one set it the
iPhone one power and battery the Nexus
One one storage the iPhone one camera we
tied on features the Nexus One one speed
the Nexus One also one browser the Nexus
One also one keyboard we tied on UI and
navigation and we tie it on cult quality
so if those of you keeping track I phone
for Nexus One for tied rounds three so
this one ends in a deadlock
that's my deadlock hands we do not have
a winner in this round so I'm gonna keep
it as objective as possible these are
two fantastic phones you can pick up
either on a team tees network although
you can you pick up the Nexus One on a
majority of other carriers as well you
sort of get your Nexus One on really a
myriad of any carrier of that you like
so that may be an important factor to
you price if that's the termination you
can tailor keep that consideration but
you can't go wrong with either felon
they are both fantastic representations
of call quality build quality design and
aesthetics and really do a nice job at
or if they're supposed to so guys do
agree disagree and my way off-base here
