an unboxing for you it would be one
terabyte my book external hard drive so
before I get started let me say I
totally know this is just an unboxing
external hard drive but it was user
requested so I'm going to go ahead and
unbox it anyway no it's not anything
terribly fun or exciting at least you
guys are get a chance to see what comes
in one of these in case you're
interested in picking one up this is
going to be used for a time machine
backup we've got a 500 gig or now but
with all the videos and stuff that I'm
doing it filled up very quickly so this
ran me a hundred and thirty-five bucks
from costco it's a big box retailer if
you don't have one where you are and
really have them I believe in in Europe
and certainly in the US but if you're
elsewhere in the world and you don't
know what costco is that is what it is
so let's go ahead and open it up i'll
try not to slice myself with this giant
knife at least that'll make it
entertaining and see if I cut my hand
open see there's an easy way to do this
does not appear that there is so we'll
go ahead and just cut into the plastic
let's go through the top see if I can do
it without killing myself we're time
making no promises for police week and
says the boxing had a little bit of
action in it that works nope and I
should say that I do not recommend doing
this at home use a pair of scissors this
was just to keep it a little bit fun and
exciting see if we can cut through the
center
there we go all right we'll slice right
through the top there we go all right
let's see we can just rip sorry if that
deafened you patel costco sells things
and these blister packs okay it's not
the danger is gone let's take a look at
the box you can see I hacked it there so
this particular one is USB 2.5 yr 400 or
esata and again up to one terabyte case
you're wondering how much space one
terabyte is they tell you or right on
top 140 hours of video a dozen songs
91,000 JPEGs all kinds of other stuff so
actually that's what you get with 300
gigabytes with one terabyte you get 400
videos quarter of a million mp3 s and
285,000 JPEGs that's a lot mostly going
to be for the videos see what we got in
the Box tightly packed in that
now give you instructions I gets really
that hard plugin if you need
instructions on an external hard drive I
know you're probably my parents I
shouldn't say a lot of people may indeed
instructions for our guys so here is the
power supply just a simple plug ah they
give you cables which is very nice we've
got a firewire 400 cable and a USB cable
interestingly they're using mini USB
it's not a standard USB to USB size and
that's it let's take a look at the hard
drive itself go ahead and break the
plastic even though this is only a hard
drive I gotta tell you I still love that
new gadget smell no matter what it is
whether a cell phone computer no matter
how big or small it's like something
about opening up a new piece of tech and
this looks just like the other western
digital my book dryer set up a light
there that'll light up and there are
your ports on the back to firewire 400
eSATA USB and power and that is about it
guys just a actual that and say this now
and mean it a very short unboxing of a
western digital hard drive hope you
enjoyed for exclusive content be sure to
follow me on twitter twitter.com / John
for lakers see in the next video guys
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
