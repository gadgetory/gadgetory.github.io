technobuffalo here tomorrow sep tember
ninth his apples it's all rock and roll
special keynote so i want to give a
recap of what i would expect apple to
announce tomorrow and you guys can
rewatch this tomorrow and sort of see
how I did not watch see how I did as far
as what actually gets announced so sure
thing new ipod touches with what I
assume will be a three point five
megapixel autofocus camera on the back I
think the phone is going to look exactly
the same that's going to have well the
camera sensor on the back I think we'll
see the same sort of photo editing
capabilities that we've seen on the
current iphone we may have a little bit
more I also would expect the release of
iphone software 3.1 perhaps ushering in
some new photo editing capabilities
since the camera is going to be one of
the big announcements I would expect
there's a little bit more that's getting
tied in with what we can do with it
certainly I wouldn't expect an ichat
trying to be released but I would expect
a little more say capabilities of what
you can create and will not create with
that camera on the back of the ipod
touch so awesome to that we may also see
some sort of built-in microphone on the
ipod touch we use as a mobile voice over
IP device would you be quite handy so if
you're abroad or if you got a wife i die
like to skype call your mom hey mom
picking up dinner boom hang out you
don't have to have an iphone unless you
want one or any other phone it's just
nice to have that option i also expect
the same cameras to make the way into
the ipod nanos now a little bit weird I
think they're just gonna have the
ability to take some rudimentary
pictures I don't think we're going to
see any photo editing just some sort of
standard hey look there's a picture of a
plant click sort of like you would do on
your standard flip phone you can take a
picture and that's about it I don't
expect them to have Wi-Fi or anything
just take a picture sync it up to your
computer and you can do it ever you want
with that image you know nothing
terribly exciting I also think we're
going to see the final slow
death of the ipod classic moment of
silence for the ipod classic it's the
direct descendants of the original ipod
the one that really started apples
resurgence the click wheel ipod sort of
looks the same but it just doesn't have
a place anymore in apple's lineup
unfortunately flash memory is getting
cheaper and bigger there really isn't
that much room for a hard drive based
ipod i love the ipod ipod classic i
never really bought one recently i like
the fact that it was there it's sort of
like Kevin an old car in your garage you
know you don't always try it but you
like to know that if you ever want to
drive it you could I happy the most
practical because gas mileage is bad and
might not pass emissions testing but you
know it's there in case you ever want to
use it so i think it's sort of along the
same lines said for the ipod classic i
think we're going to see it not um ipod
software and iphone software 3.1 like i
said before i think we're going to see
some more video capabilities and some
editing capabilities we're also going to
see a new version of itunes with some
social networking features but built in
so facebook you can sort of easier to
tell people it's on you listening to on
itunes are you really going to use
social networking in itunes itunes
already where so many different hats
that it's sort of head is stacked up to
the ceiling you know it's got music
playing had it's got a music downloading
had a TV show had kenton ahead i mean
just got so many different hats that you
know what can you do with one
application certainly it's useful for
everything but just coming so useful
that it's completing the ubiquitous
really you just think of of itunes and
really not going to think of music
downloading and we're gonna think of
just everything so i don't know not that
into it I don't think we're going to see
a tablet I do think we're going to see
steve jobs back there and if steve jobs
is not there i think apple stock is
going to take a huge hit but i would
expect mr. black turtleneck to be there
don't be looked at in his pockets for
some sort of fancy tab
advice because you're not going to see
it and you are staring at his pockets
might look a little bit creepy
especially if you're there in San
Francisco so just sort of a real quick
recap of what I've expect did not expect
you know what you guys think doing a lot
of gesture with the hands like I'm
chopping things up what are you guys
saying you think I'm dead on way off not
even close don't know what I'm talking
about leave a text or video comments and
tomorrow stay tuned for the channel for
a full recap of what was announced jon
