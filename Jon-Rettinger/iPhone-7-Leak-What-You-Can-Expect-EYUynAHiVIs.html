from technobuffalo here and usually I've
got a phone or tablet this time though
just about a little piece of silicon
this came from our friend Sonny Dickson
of Apple leaking fame and this
supposedly is a case that's going to fit
an unannounced phone you might have
heard of it the iphone 7 a friend Lou
from unbox therapy did a killer job he
had a similar case walk through it in
ton of details so if you want to know
more about the case hit the link down
below hit the annotation go check out
this video button treat this as an
opportunity to talk about what i expect
the iphone so i'm going to have and give
some predictions for it so first let's
just pop the case on to a current gen
iphone 6s and see that it fits almost
perfectly so you can select that same
4.7 inch design few changes though not
going to have a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack on the bottom instead dual speakers
will live there so expect a ton of
lightning headphone accessories and
Apple to ship their own in the near
future other than after everything else
is kind of the same t get to the back
where that camera cut out doesn't look
like a typical camera cut out I've seen
some leaks that are pointing to Apple
testing dual camera set up on the iphone
7 I don't think is gonna be the same way
that LG did it with the g5 we have two
totally separate sets with a do
different things a wide angle on a
regular sensor the prevailing thought I
a book couldn't be working in
conjunction to create one image more
detail and be able to you have more
granular control or what you can shoot
and this hopefully get better pictures
overall like just get announced at
Apple's annual event usually around the
sep tember time frame come out towards
the end of that month doesn't look like
many other surprises here although I am
hoping that's sort of my wish list for
the iphone 7 I say this every year if I
stand outside long enough hoping for
rain one day I'll be right while it was
charging i'm just some point it's got to
be wireless charging would seem like for
a big upgrade from the 6s to a seven
getting rid of a port and adding dual
cameras might not be enough of a of an
upgrade looks like the phone can stay
the same thickness those hopefully
that's going to signal more milliamp
hours for more juice we got just a quick
thought so what i expect the iphone 7 to
be since we got this case in triggers
good opportunity to share it with you
till next time i'm john render from
technobuffalo talk to you friends next
