here with I am jon rettinger have you
guys ever seen this guy before he's in a
few of our videos so if you guys are
familiar with the gaming space star wars
battlefront it's a big thing and it's
coming up very soon November
mid-november 15th or 17 or 17th of this
year neither of us have played it at all
before we figured we do a fun little
like clueless gamer type thing neither
of us are terribly clueless but oh yeah
come on inland hey come on in alright
well that was fun that was a great how
was your meeting it was good yeah it was
good I for some reason to not make it to
my calendar holy fine totally fine
Baumbach experience things post post
meetings I feel I got my my post meeting
you hi Simon I feel properly in case I
need more hydration I've got my bottle
here excellent well we're gonna play
some battlefront together we're gonna do
a clear mission so I think you're gonna
go ahead and pilot us straight behind
and I saw this at e3 for the first time
it was so very excited may for like 30
seconds but I mostly unplayable so we're
on to training battles or survival I
think it's not a build these aren't into
beta so I think we gotta do co-op
survival which is I believe its horde
mode so we're not doing any story there
sorry I spoilers it's what mode Gordon I
never heard of a Ford not Oh porn all
day in the opposite side so let's do so
split screen a partner local local co-op
all right we're gonna do this is just
like this is just like Cowen's is the
same thing uh am I the clueless gamer I
just know maybe we'll do normal
difficulty alright survival on Tatooine
so every time I hear a tattoo mean I
think the original rebel assault always
remember the beginning the opening
monologue a rebel assault the old game
was morning unplanted tattoo eat wet
consoles what's on a console man
assault that was on was on computer look
like old-school game Wow if you guys
remember that if you remember that
little girl all right so what are we
doing here I have no idea I'm neither
person ever to last over hands a
bladders okay so last year's what are we
holding here we've got a couple of
options we've got a blaster blaster I
feel like I'm a heavy blaster if I'm
gonna go blaster rifle blaster rifle
seems like that seems like a good
mid-range choice I liked a really high
impact like really high damage low fire
rate we're gonna go with the 11 where's
the gala harm there's no that's my one
destiny word I know oh yeah first
product for 30 seconds and people
thought I knew about destiny they got
excited like if you had known he was
pronounced yellow for Hef envy sure okay
so hands personal shield anion shot I
should I should probably say just give
myself a little bit of cred I got a
two-year-old at home and another one
coming so he goes to bed like 730 so I
leave work I only get like two and a
half hours to like be a dad and I tried
to be like fully focusing dad's I'm have
much time to play video games

goofy foot will just roll with that
filthy for maneuvers okay yes you can
see the map and yet we're given my upper
left if that way okay all right there
