the head of the gaming team here at
technobuffalo and this is super mario
maker listen I've got two separate
things going on in this video for you so
first there's the 10 Mario challenge I'm
going to do that first that is a
collection of eight levels made by
nintendo that I have to run through
without using Alton Mario lives figured
that would kind of show you how the game
sort of looks and plays from that
perspective the 10 Moria challenge there
it is if you do not want to watch that
you can jump all the way to where I
actually make my own course here I'm
going to jump in with a mostly made
course and show you basically what the
course maker looks like at least in the
early stages the game so I'm going to
let this play without commentary here i
will pick up and talk to you about the
course maker after this is all done
you
you
you
alright this is a course I'm calling
trust issues I basically wanted to kind
of do players into doing things that
maybe they shouldn't be doing I've only
got two days with horse maker so far as
of the moment you're seeing this video
or recording anyway and I only have two
deliveries worth of goods it actually
takes nine days of playing in course
maker for five minutes or longer in
order to get every single deliverable
good and then there's goods at you
unlock as well so like for instance up
here I put all these flying koopa
troopas kind of like someone will think
I'll just jump over here and there's
gonna be a Koopa Troopa psych it's not
good you get stuck up there that's the
whole point and then up here a same
thing I figure I'd kind of reward people
may be free going this route the whole
course I don't know it probably took me
about 10 minutes it's really really easy
it's just drag-and-drop tools for the
most part things do what you would
expect them to do except there's some
special things that you can do like you
can shake something and it will change
or you can give a mushroom to a Koopa
Troopa or Goomba and make them giant
size so right now I'm trying to make
this last run to the to the flagpole and
inside that box there's a spring I kind
of wanna make it a little bit tough I'm
some of the force players to get a star
by hitting that turtle over there I mean
I suppose you get through without the
star yeah see look at that arrow that's
leading you to death it's not going to
be fun so the cool thing about course
maker and I don't know if you guys know
this yet but you have to you can upload
and share your courses right everybody
knows left but you have to be able to
beat the course before you can upload
them so that's what you're going to see
me do here I'm gonna make sure that I
can beat this course then it's actually
going to test me again and I'm I'm
actually gonna fail a bunch of times
here before I decide okay maybe
something needs to be added something
needs to be done a little bit
differently and you'll see me do that
too I don't let this play out you'll see
the the ports the parts that the ports
the parts that I keep failing on
particularly right here this pair
I'm such a jerk I even made that that
block that you see there on the right
the lowest one I made that a little bit
too low what's gonna force players to
kind of take their time when they jump
through and actually wound up you can do
it without taking damage I've done that
before not during this playthrough but
actually wind up giving myself a
mushroom here early in the course so
that I can make that jump take the
damage and be just fine so you'll see me
beat this and then go to upload it and
be it again this is super mario maker
for the wii u you should know that by
now i would assume comes out on
September 11 is obviously wii u
exclusive this game just makes me want a
legend of zelda maker I'm gonna tell you
the truth that's what I want right now
I've been loving this game i'm having a
ton of fun if you want to see more
videos about this just let me know i can
do more we can do kind of a tour of what
the other reviewers have been making as
well you can see that for yourself i'm
gonna let this play out my name is Joey
I'm again the head of the gaming
department here at TechnoBuffalo com we
are gonna be streaming Super Mario make
or two on our twitch channel so check
that out and I know that that's going to
be starting soon and brought someone in
to do some twitch with us and they're a
lot of fun so thanks for watching guys
and I will see you again soon
