accelerometer magic basically a battery
with where dysmelia yeah and magic

I'd say red so I'm here at popcorn stand
in front of the Honda Civic and I go
inside but people are kind of hovering
around that I don't want to it can
absorb impact and dissipate it can I
touch it certainly can help me so you
can eat it if you want to really look at
that it's like cheese would you rather
sit on one of those or a bed made of
cashmere linen silk fresh silk and
you're being massaged by professional
masseuse there's question they always
ask us is if there's a fire what chair
would you take out of the building with
you and I would say I would take my
embody chair with me the perfect answer
right there but on their subs or Bing
