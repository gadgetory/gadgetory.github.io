pains me they got a pick a winner I've
had a soft spot for Samsung phones
really since the note 7 pre recalls
smoking batteries exploding everything
else and I've admittedly been tough on
oneplus but I've been spending the
better part of two weeks with their
latest two one plus six and I
straight-up love it
not just like love it for its great
value I mean love it like a daily driver
regardless of price and I feel like this
versus is like picking a favorite child
but in this case no one's getting a
runner-up trophy one of these two will
win it's time for the galaxy s 9 plus to
get some real challengers this is the
one plus 6 for the galaxy s 9 plus so
I'm gonna make this versus a bit
different then in past videos not only
am I gonna be picking a winner
there'll be no cop out I'm actually
picking a winner for me
I've been torn out which one of these I
want to use as my own phone so
throughout this process of battling
these two I'm just gonna pick my next
daily driver and in the process
hopefully help you pick your next phone
so the breakdown here is essentially a
video version of the base then I've got
going on in my head when I side what
phone I want to use it also means some
things that may be important to you
aren't here I didn't go too much into
camera for example since both are just
good enough for my use there were still
be categories and since I'm going to
actually be using the winner here there
is a bit more emotional thought and less
or a pragmatic approach their previous
versus these are the categories are most
important to me that's that's enough
intro let's let's get right to it all
right start the new category updates
Android software updates on phones not
name pixels a giant pain in the butt
usually when Google pushes updates they
go out to the manufacturer first then
once they're done adding their own
whatever stuff to it and testing it the
updates that go out to the carrier who
do their own form of testing and then
decide what they want to push and when
they want to push it to users so that
means that carrier phones like the
galaxy s 9 plus take forever to get
updates if they ever get it but they are
generally pretty stable and secure when
they eventually make their way to their
phones oneplus toe cells or phones
unlock
so the carrier part slowly taken out and
oxygen OS is pretty damn close to stock
Android updates are way faster in fact
the one plus six is one of the few
devices that Google allowed in the
Android P beta so maybe just foolish to
run all the updates as fast as I
possibly can but this is a clear edge to
the oneplus for me
I want my updates fast I want to test
the latest and I want it now
oneplus is definitely taking this
category so display and I've got on
record saying display is the most
important part of a phone to me it's got
to look good for me to enjoy using it
and it would be super dismissive to just
give this category outright the Samsung
beyond any doubt their Super AMOLED
panels are the best in the business even
if you don't like how the oversaturated
stuff the display gets crazy braids and
movies games whatever just look awesome
this is not a surprise I'll talk about
this in ton of videos what was a
surprise though is actually how good the
6.3 inch 1080p optic AMOLED panel is on
the 1 plus 6 and I bagged on oneplus
pretty hard in the past for subpar
displays and even maybe installing them
backwards but they nailed this one
it's OLED so blacks or black color
reproduction is super good video looks
great it's probably the best 1080p panel
that I can remember testing but just do
this true number of pixels when held up
next to the galaxy s 9 plus you can
definitely see a crispness difference
the display was closer than I thought
it's going to Samsung but battery is
next I'm pretty hard on my phone so
screen on time is crazy important to me
when I'm gonna be using a phone as my
daily driver so while that 1080p panel I
just talked about on the oneplus 6 isn't
quite as good as Samsung's
the trade-off for sharpness is killer
battery life in fact the s9 plus is
bigger than 3500 milliamp hours but you
factor in how many fewer pixels it's
pushing and that power efficiency you
get with the snapdragon 845 I'm getting
close to 7 hours of screen on time and
battery life that easily gets me through
a single day and almost 2 - charging is
still the fastest that I've seen from
zero but quick charge on the Samsung is
still pretty damn fast too
Jewish oneplus had wireless charging the
oneplus battery life is king it
definitely takes this round and a little
bit of my heart and so now we're gonna
talk about aesthetics and fuel and you
can call me superficial but I want a
phone that's gonna look good and I want
a phone that's gonna feel good maybe
it's not that important to you but it's
it's close to tops priority for me and
it's kind of weird but if you close your
eyes and you can hold both of these
phones in your hands they feel almost
identical design of the galaxy s 9 plus
is familiar
at this point it's almost perfected the
round edges and glass back just screen
premium well I did off to put a deep
brand scale on it to protect the back
instead of a case the oneplus is
wedge-shaped makes it feel thinner than
it actually is and it's got an amazing
weight distribution which is a weird
thing to even notice it's also rocking a
glass back as well like the s9 plus and
I don't want to risk cracking it I'd
also really dig the marble D brand skin
look if you like the aesthetics of these
all link to them down below if you want
to check them out I really didn't think
any phone could feel better to me than
the s9 + but the more I used a 1 + 6 the
more to peel to me and this was as
shocking as anything else from doing
this video I'm picking the 1 + 6 year
which should really say something you
considering how damn good-looking and
good feeling the samsung galaxy s 9
pluses
alright so intangibles this kind of a
holdover from previous verses these are
the little squirrely bits not really fit
into any category button matter some of
these might be more important to you
than me but when I decide what phone I
want to use these definitely matter and
the Sam's like pretty much has it all
stereo speakers ip68 expandable storage
wireless charging it's got a headphone
jack Samsung pay step jogging 45662 Ram
that pretty much checks every single
flagship box you can think of while
still not having a knotch
so on the one plus side it's no slouch
either I adore oxygen OS and I love the
tweaks that it's gotten and even if the
gestures aren't smooth I've got a red
color that's amazing you could pick up
does have a notch but got awesome
software features to customize it it's
got dual SIM but it's lacking a lot of
things like any official IP rating
wireless charging expandable storage its
portrait mode isn't that great and it's
got
lousy single downward firing speaker so
not one of those alone is like a
category winner when you put them
together
Samsung definitely takes us I'm gonna
stop here to recap the categories that
were important to me updates oneplus
display went to Samsung battery oneplus
aesthetics which was a surprise here
went to oneplus intangibles with the
Samsung that gives me a surprise winner
and I think even more surprising new
daily driver the one plus six I adored
this phone during my testing I loved the
way the phone felt by the way the phone
performed the way it looked and the fact
that it comes in at a five hundred
twenty-nine bucks starting point is even
more incredible so I get that one plus
how to make cuts to get to the price
point the cuts they made are totally
justified things like wireless charging
I can deal without things like and it's
not the best portrait mode I can do an
expandable storage not an issue for me
I get why they did it and even
forgetting the price point what you are
getting is a flagship killing phone add
an incredible price this you can go
head-to-head with any flagship no matter
how much it costs you can get in
different colors you can pay more to get
up eight gigs ram you can find the right
version of the oneplus for you for me
it's the red ones I just love love the
red color but hats off to you oneplus if
you're deciding what phone you want to
get and you want to go Android
I really think look no farther than the
oneplus X so it's a bit of a different
style of versus a bit more personal if
you like the style let us know down
below if kind of love to hear if you
agree to disagree I also want to know
these verses always spark some intense
fanboy debates but either way please
give the video a thumbs up we always
appreciate it and all the other stuff
that YouTube makes us Dukes having said
notifications any more subscribe and hit
the notification bells so you know when
new videos are coming up we have more vs
videos coming we've got a brand new
website we just launched called the
nerdy we're covering all kinds of nerd
and geek culture if you check that out
till next time I'm John render</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
