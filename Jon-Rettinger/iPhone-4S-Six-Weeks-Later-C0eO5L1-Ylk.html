technobuffalo here i've had the iphone
4s for about six weeks I thought it'd be
a good time to go back and revisit minus
review and see if any impressions or
thoughts have changed since then let's
go ahead and talk to my phone I love
making videos where I get a face to
camera down and do some hands-on action
with the phones and devices but there
are very few things i love more than
getting a bit old school and sit in
front of a camera and just talking to
you sort of one-on-one about my thoughts
and opinions that's what this video is
going to be and of course a topic is the
iphone 4s which I've had in my hot
little hand for just about six weeks now
so in my initial review I said that the
iphone 4s is a great phone probably one
of the best phones out there and
available but not worth the upgrade from
an iphone 4 largely i still feel that
same way some of the biggest selling
points the iphone 4s namely being Siri I
was one feature that I thought I was
going to use much more that ended up
using it I found it in the six weeks
I've you Siri it take away the first two
weeks not really excited that I had it I
haven't really used it since then mates
because I forget that it exists and I'm
just not used to having a phone that has
those capabilities but generally I don't
use it I initially thought that I was
gonna be scheduling appointments with my
phone my phone was gonna be telling me
what the weather was then be telling me
that I had to go bug groceries it was
gonna be doing Google searches for me
I'm just finding myself not really using
it at all not to say it doesn't have
utility just it's not really having that
much utility for me the best feature and
I guess this is sort of sort of Siri
that I do use though is a text to speech
should have typing an email or message
hit the microphone and I can just talk
to it that feature I really do use a lot
but aside from that I am not using
street at all I think I just forget that
it's there I don't know if that's unique
to me of curious to hear if you guys are
using Syria as well but I know that was
one of the big selling points the iphone
4s and hasn't really translated too much
use for me the other big time point the
iphone 4s lives on the back this guy
right there the camera and i'm guessing
though some difference with the camera
over the iphone four still picture is
just straight up look better on my no
means a camera guy leave that to Mike
Pearlman but when I look at pictures I
can tell what looks better or not better
and pictures just look better they look
better and low like it look better in
direct sunlight to look better in
Twilight and not that Twilight with
shadows and all kinds of stuff they just
straight up look good video quality is
much improved of the iphone 4 but the
audio fidelity is not nearly as good
meaning the built-in microphones here I
have quality just doesn't sound as good
when you're recording video so if you're
planning on doing some video and I'll
cover my face like this your video is
gonna look great audio just hasn't been
that exciting from it's been a little
bit tinny you can go back check out the
original review and there'll be some
samples there but just hasn't been all
that impressive for me so impressions
generally of the iphone 4s it's still
the phone that i come back to as his
previous iterations at the iphone
whether it's the iphone 4 3gs 3g or the
original iphone I'll occasionally make
forays into Android I'll use an android
phone for a few weeks a few months i'll
use Windows Phone for a few weeks or a
few months blackberry a few weeks few
months but i seem to always come back to
the iphone last night as was really most
nights as I'm trouble sleeping and I was
laying in bed thinking about technology
I was thinking about what it is about
the iphone why I keep coming back to it
despite complaints I still really lament
that I can't edit tweak and customize
the operating system more than I'd like
I think some of the changes in iOS 5 or
huge talk about those in just a minute
but I'll try to think why I come back to
the iphone 4s especially when i have
activists to you know really pretty much
any phone that's available and some
phones aren't even available to try it
works and it always works well it's a
consistent experience i always know what
I'm going to get from an Android phone
to an android phone you can get very
very different experiences going from a
samsung galaxy s2 to a motorola built
device
they can be completely divergent one can
be absolutely awesome outstanding and
one can be a little bit slow and laggy
you just don't know makes every device a
bit unique with the iphone I know what
it's going to be and it's sort of that
devil you know kind of analogy he knows
better than the one you don't I know
what I'm gonna get I know the phones
limitations are I'm aware of them and I
can sort of prepare for it I'd ever know
what it's going to be with Android with
blackberry I'm always for waiting for
that next OS freeze even on the 9900 or
for the little clock to start spinning
I'm always just sort of waiting for that
on windows phone 7 I haven't found that
many grapes actually with Windows Phone
7 i'm kind of now wishing for a little
bit of higher resolution screen but
that's a minor gripe I in general I've
actually really liked windows phone
seven and again for Android I just never
know what it's going to be from phone to
phone when I find a great phone that I
really enjoy enjoy android like the
droid razr the resound yeah then it's a
phone that i'll stick with for a while
and i know that that phone is going to
work for me but then i end up getting
into you know downloading applications
and some that maybe haven't been that
thoroughly tested that end up having
stability issues on the phone and then
the app starcraft number system start
looking and working a little wonky and i
have to find out which application is
not working and some people really enjoy
that process they enjoy the ability to
go in and find exactly what works on
their phone tweaked it to exactly the
way they like install custom roms and I
get that oftentimes I enjoy that too but
I don't always enjoy having to work with
my phone sometimes I just want a phone
that's going to work with me that's
probably why I keep coming back to the
iphone that being said I'm waiting for
something else i'm bored with the iphone
i think it's been pretty much the same
phone for the past better part of two
and a half three years specs of change
but really nothing else has the OS looks
relatively similar to how it did at
least a core functionality to how it did
a few years ago I'm hoping that Windows
Phone 7 can be that next thing
I'm hoping that ice cream sandwich
perhaps on other devices and you know
more than just a Galaxy Nexus and
tablets can be the next exciting
operating system I'm hoping that
Blackberry can do anything to be
somewhat exciting but I just keep coming
back to the iphone 4s so I've been
rambling and digressing a little bit
should you upgrade to the iphone 4s sort
of the thoughts and impressions if you
have an iPhone 4 and my initial thing
that I said was do that upgrade to the
4s if you have an iphone 4 that still
holds true there's very little very
compelling little compelling reasons to
upgrade to a 4s from before sure the
camera is a little bit better yeah
you've got Siri I could very easily live
with not having either of those the
camera on the iPhone 4 was fine and not
having Siri I could deal with having a
type instead of talking to it and I can
look up my own questions as opposed to
having seat answer them for me I don't
think this is going to be a phone you're
going to want to be tied into for two
years presumably the design is going to
change this features are going to change
in the specs are going to change for an
iphone 5 and if all the rumors hold true
that's going to be the phone that's
going to be a little bit more
revolutionary we're on the dawn of some
would say we're already in the era of 4G
speeds and I'm talking 4G LTE and this
phone just doesn't have it I wouldn't
want to be tied into a two-year contract
with a phone that didn't have LT
capabilities especially on obviously the
only two that have LTE right now AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon Sprint will have LTE
sometime next year t-mobile's hspa+
network is blazing fast so at least if
it was on t-mobile you know would want
support for that but the three carriers
that have the iphone 4 have pledged or
already have LTE networks and iphone 4s
just doesn't have it sure it's got HSP
plus for AT&amp;amp;T but I haven't seen blazing
fast speeds and a lot of states capable
of 14 for down in various places
throughout the country I've never seen
or experienced personally adding faster
than you know maybe four or five on on a
good day so the big changes with the
iphone 4s are really iOS 5 and you can
get that on the iphone far keeps
shrugging you can get the new
pull-down notification which is clearly
ripped off from Android you can get the
better push notifications which are huge
improvement and a slew of other sort of
great features but you can get that with
an iphone 4 is very little reason to go
out and get an iphone 4s and i still
feel that way my sister for example was
on verizon she'd sort of been waiting
for a new phone she hadn't upgraded her
phone in three years uh and this is a
quote just that i want the iphone with
siri just asked her why she wants
serious that I want to talk to it I
asked her what she was gonna do with it
she didn't know he just kind of thought
it'd be neat and wanted to have newest
phone as most people would if you're
going out to get a new phone you're only
getting one every two years you want to
get the newest one out there I think
it's a case of Miss information between
the difference is at least between the
4s I before so stick with what you got
if you haven't upgraded already and I
think you'll be well rewarded maybe
something new and exciting will come
from Android from windows phone 7 from
blackberry or maybe you'll get an LTE
iphone for next year sort of my thoughts
and ramblings and as I many nights I lay
in bed not sleeping this is stuff that
runs through my head and I wanted to
share with you guys so hope you enjoy do
you agree disagree leave your comments
down below i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo i'll see you next video
