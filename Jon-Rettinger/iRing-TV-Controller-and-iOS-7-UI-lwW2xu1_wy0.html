to you by 23andme
what's up everyone welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup i'm rios jon
wrenches - sure we take a little rumor
here take a little rumor there with
smashing bash um put him in a Blendtec
and serve you up a delicious rumor
smoothie this week it is all Apple all
the time we're gonna talk about Apple's
iWatch iPhone 5s iOS 7 might be behind
schedule but it might not of course the
Apple TV and the next two I phone
supposedly developed under the guise of
the late CEO Steve Jobs this is rumor
roundup let's go ahead get started
several reports have already suggested
that Apple's iPhone 5s will launch the
fingerprint scanner under the home
button so it's kind of a cool technology
certainly better than having to type in
a password or having to put your face in
the right spot to unlock it pretty cool
if it works and works quickly I think
that's the big thing if it works fast no
one's gonna care if it works slowly
nobody's gonna use it Deepika Capital
Markets analyst Brian white post a note
to investors last Wednesday it said
checks with his suppliers and Asia
suggests technology will be built into
the eye watch the team at Apple is
working on a new design for iOS 7 which
will likely make its debut on the iPhone
5s but apparently the entire project is
running a bit behind schedule apple's
design chief Jonathan Ive is working on
iOS 7 and according to recent reports is
trying to make the design flatter and
easier to use Ben before
I'm really excited that Johnny ive is
working on iOS 7 he is the designing
brain behind Apple's flagship products
better than much on the software side so
it's unclear how far behind iOS 7 is but
Apple typically unveiled his latest
mobile operating systems during its
annual Worldwide Developer Conference
which takes place in June so a few
months down the road but I wouldn't mind
iOS launching later the initially
planned may be from June ends up being
in July or August as long as the weight
is worth while iOS getting a refresh
redone redesigned and relaunched I would
love to absolutely see it what do you
guys want to see in iOS 7 the Apple ITV
rumors took a turn to the Bazaar on
Wednesday when topeka Capital Markets
analyst Brian Weitz
our old friend published a note to
investors suggesting that the ITV launch
worth would he call it
I ring I'll consumers to control our
television sets with a single finger so
here's that doesn't make much sense
about this though devices like Microsoft
Kinect already provide plenty of motion
controls without the need for a ring or
any other accessory that can easily be
lost second Apple Siri voice engine
provides more than enough control about
the need for consumers to make gestures
in the first place white went on to say
that he believes Apple will launch a
nine point seven inch mini TV this is
super likely just a piece of hardware
for the iPad but white is convinced
it'll serve as a secondary display to
the ITV according to him essentially we
believe that mini TV screens will be
able to capture content from the 60 inch
ITV across a distance of up to 200
meters allowing a user to view ITV
content in the kitchen washroom garage
bedroom backyard etc the next two
iPhones were supposedly developed under
the auspices of the late CEO Steve Jobs
so while meeting with Apple to try and
find a solution for the growing
incidence of iPhone theft the company
allegedly reveals information to San
Francisco's district attorney George
Gascon saying that the next two handsets
proceed Tim Cook Gascon proposed a
possible kill switch as a way to deter
thieves and that's when Apple reportedly
unveiled their two upcoming iPhone zoom
ibly to say gas cons plan was impossible
in the foreseeable future good news that
perhaps next two iPhones were developed
under Steve Jobs even if it's the 5s and
a lower price iPhone are even better if
it's a 5s than the iPhone 6 so that
could be kind of cool let me step aside
from the rumors for a minute to thank
