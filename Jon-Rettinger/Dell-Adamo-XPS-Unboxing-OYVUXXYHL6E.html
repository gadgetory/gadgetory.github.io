here it's an unboxing for you of the
Dell Adamo
XPS cinnamon light computers are really
all the rage nowadays with every
manufacturer putting a consumer
ultra-low voltage chip into laptops
which tend to make them way bit less and
be a little bit thinner but none are
smaller and none are lighter than the
Adamo
XPS which actually took the crown of
world's thinnest laptop from the MacBook
Air this is gonna run you just shy of
2,000 dollars and that's gonna get you a
1.4 gigahertz Intel Core 2 Duo ultra-low
voltage chip Windows 7 home premium
64-bit 4 gigs of dual channel ddr3 RAM
128 gig solid state drive and all that
in a package that weighs just about 3.2
pounds so very impressive proposition
let's go ahead and start the unboxing
very curious to see what this thing is
going to do so we have a larger size box
with a thin laptop nothing really to see
here yet
we'll use the back to slice the table go
ahead pull its back it looks like you
got a sort of a designer almost suede
feeling box to go and pull it out push
the ugly cardboard off to the side here
we have the Adamo XPS box I had a chance
to play around with this a little bit at
CES and came away pretty impressed
I'm obviously didn't get a chance to
test it spec wise and see how it
performed with streaming video HD
content but just a meta sized an
aesthetic standpoint was a very
impressive device so go ahead and open
this up and peers n there's a little bit
of a tab right here we'll go ahead and
it's magnetic open that up and here we
have the Adamo XPS right on top this is
a review unit that was sent from Dell so
I get to use it for a few months and
then send it on back it looks like it's
already been used before it assumed that
probably would come wrap the
some sort of plastic but very thin we'll
take a look at that in just a minute
let's see what else we get in the box
looks like there's that tray does not
lift up there's a drawer here that will
slide out I'll see what comes in there
and all this again is a very sort of
swayed feeling box so here are all the
accessories this comes with I believe
two separate batteries one that lasts
about two hours and one that's gonna
love us they say up to five hours and 17
minutes with the optional extended
battery which I believe comes in at
about forty watt hours so let's see
what's included so this is the extended
battery a bit thicker here's a standard
battery 82 hours you can see the size
difference probably more importantly a
thickness difference about twice as
thick we'll keep digging in here so you
don't see have a pretty thin power brick
which looks to have this sort of
familiar form factor of this plugging
right into the wall slide this in and
that goes right into the computer an
extender cable as well if you want to
use that and a cloth microfiber to clean
the screen looks like you're obligatory
book of disks probably just restored
discs and lice and stuff it does come
with a few accessories it appears looks
like we've got a DisplayPort to DVI and
the USB to Ethernet port push those back
in the box and got your Restall discs
and a little book about the XPS but not
for the accessories let's take a look
the laptop itself
that's what I'm looking most forward to
and what I assume you guys are here to
see so I'll push all the boxing off to
the side and let's take a look at the
abdominal XPS so this has sort of a few
very interesting things to it
the first thing that it has is a
capacitive latch right here which won't
work because I don't have the battery
plugged in but I'll show you how that
looks and functions in just a minute
also as a sort of a unique design let's
go ahead and put the battery in and see
if we can open this thing up to see what
it looks like another point of note with
the Adamo XPS that there's actually a
small internal battery switch makes the
batteries hot swappable if you can pull
the batt battery out and put in a new
one within 30 seconds you won't lose any
of your data which is kind of nice let's
go ahead and put in the thinner battery
for starters hopefully it has enough
charging it to power of the lock I think
that just slides on in nice and easy
okay so let's do a quick tour of the
device on the left hand side you've got
your display port with one of the two
u.s. beams looks like a bit of a fan
nothing in the front except for that
capacitive latch I'll show you in just a
moment on the right side you've got
another fan there's your audio in and
outs that's for microphone ports as well
it's like I'm touching the splash there
and we've got my USB port and power so
let me give you a quick comparison a
laptop for laptops eyes with let's say a
MacBook Pro the modern generation which
weighs just about 4.5 pounds compared to
the three point two of the Adamo XPS so
let's say 13-inch model this is a
13-inch Adamo XPS as well you can see
it's a little bit longer and you'll see
why in just a minute
and from a thinness standpoint you can
really see the difference well they
almost look like distant cousins here
aluminum on aluminum okay so the
capacitive latch here is kind of
interesting you go ahead and take your
finger and swipe it right across and a
little blue light shows up at the bottom
not sure if you saw that and lets you
open up the latch looks like this is a
new review unit actually it's got sort
of an ergonomic look and feel to the
device so go ahead and peel this off
push that off so actually puts it up at
an angle if you can see which is kind of
interesting makes typing you know I
assume they'll be a little bit more
ergonomic but I want to use it to really
hit a chance to be a judge the keyboard
here is a bit of a different font on the
keys it's actually it's a metal taps
keyboard feel which we'll see how that
feels um very thin sort of sits up and
curiously you can use this on your lap
or not I'll definitely run it through
some tests and show you how this works
sort of sitting on your lap the vents on
the side we've solved and probably
wondering where are the speakers well
that's sort of an interesting question
the speakers on this conserve its unique
form factor are on the bottom there
downward facing and that curious how
speakers can sound on a device that's
this thin let's go ahead and open it up
one more time you've got a two megapixel
two megapixel webcam up top which is of
course integrated you've got I believe
as a multi-touch trackpad with the
windows two buttons that's where you're
used to seeing on those Windows laptops
the full dimensions of this we're
looking at three forty by two seventy
three point nine by nine ninety nine
which is very very thin
this screen is sixteen by nine W LED is
a 720p display so again I'm very curious
to see how this thing looks and how it
works I'm gonna run it through a full
gamut of tests and I'll show you
everything including how it handles HD
playback video streaming keyboard use it
on your lap and how it stands up is sort
of a daily drive for the XPS line of
sort of Dells top of the line for all
their models this is a top of the line
Adamo oh one thing let's check before we
stop this unboxing is a keyboard flex
you think that with just two pages right
here and then all that space on the
bottom the keyboard is gonna flex when
we type let's turn it off to the side so
you can see and let's see if it actually
does do that so I'm pushing in here
doesn't appear to be moving at all not
much at all either when typing I'm
actually has a pretty solid
the keyword looks like it might take a
bit of getting used to the reason the
laptop itself is a little bit longer is
because the screen is actually sunk in
the keyboard goes right into the screen
that accounts for that additional real
estate on the sides and down below so
guys this is an unboxing of the Dell
Adamo XPS definitely stay tuned to the
