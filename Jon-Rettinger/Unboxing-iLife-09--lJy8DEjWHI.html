unboxing for you of ilife 09 and yes it
is just unboxing some software so I
can't promise the most exciting and
titillating video but I will do my best
to entertain you let's go ahead and open
this thing up here's the bag from the
apple store that camera and while I'm
opening this up I'll tell you guys a
story so I went to my local apple store
to get this I'm just right by my house
and as I was paying for the guy was
looking at me fine and i finally said
are you the guy from the internet so i
was kind of flattered like yeah you know
i'm jon rettinger from john for lakers
said he looked at me straight on no
that's not it and he kept staring at me
I thought okay maybe I went to high
school with the guy he looked about my
age and he said you're that chris
pirillo guy aren't you i was a little
bit embarrassed but definitely humbled
at the same time so it was nice to
always stay grounded guy had no idea who
I was and just reminds me of kind of
what's uh what's going on the situation
is so that was my funny I life story
something quite open this up for you I
wouldn't got the family pack and since I
am a student some of you guys know I'm
in graduate school I was able to get a
student discount on the family pack so
what ordinarily would have been 99 bucks
came out to be about $79 beforehand so
the same price to regular figured I
might as well go legitimate get the
family pack i can sell it on the back
book the imac and girlfriends computer
and a few others let's go ahead and open
this thing up here goes his I life on
the front pictures on the back I 5009
your photos by faces placement events I
movie I'm excited to give that a whirl
use that quite a bit GarageBand 09 I
have zero musical ability so not so
concerned about learning how to play the
guitar from john mayer and looks like
that is iWeb with something underneath
it because there's a sticker so open
this thing up you've got the small knife
here to do it with
there we go all right tear off the
plastic off this thing and it slides out
really fun stuff I know harder to slide
out the need expects all right push down
tighten my Apple in California really
nice job designing a box I guess let's
take it a team of 12 there's a disc
that's probably about it looks like we
got some stuff up here if they brought
back the Apple stickers installing ilife
get the most out of your photos and like
a trial of I work to do that with most
of the ilife discs maybe wants all the
tile what I work to give it a whirl Adam
so here we go I like just nothing
terribly exciting I will install it use
it and i'll give you guys of course my
impressions on the whole suite hope you
