have the privilege of sitting with mr.
Glenn lurie who is president of emerging
devices very long title retail
partnerships for AT&amp;amp;T mobility and
consumer market is pretty good that's a
long business card it is all in this
mistake to my eye shadow me I gotta look
I think I tree got one good one so they
sent this your bio beforehand with a lot
of questions lined up don't you want to
ask you the first question I want to ask
you is of your professional soccer days
oh great so MLS no actually I'm older
than I so when i when i graduated in
college I was doing the last it was the
MIS oh ok you got rocked early and if
you were an American back in those days
your only chance again hey go to an x
flash games ok and I'm just watching you
see you're young so I actually played
the cheese on play mr. portlyn pride
yeah I actually put here for the
Portland drive I was my last year plan
we can ask the story how'd you get from
soccer to be President our learning
devices that ain't a stage along stores
i've been in the wireless business will
be 22 years coming up and iowa's playing
ball and in the offseason i thought that
i actually had a company that did some
work for the head of wireless huh this
is back in the days of the old moral
8,000 which were 2,000 bucks you know
the big rig fault is that north yeah and
i got tell you yeah i just thought it
was the coolest thing I've ever seen I
felt that same passion I forgot my first
cell phone I remember when I had to tell
my wife I was leaving a job when a
downturn economy to make videos for a
living yeah I mean that was that was
probably good for you when I hindsight
it where it ended up working out well
but having to tell my mother that I'm
eating my job in a down economy videos
this time so i can relate to them
sheriff we behind the scenes what was 18
he's thinking you bringing the iphone
initially well look there's there's
things we said publicly show you know we
had done a couple things for that but we
launched the rocker I remember the Rhode
Island right with Motorola I students
built Danny exactly the first time that
the iTunes client was ever allowed
outside of an Apple device and in that
process Ralph and Steve developed a
relationship and when Apple decided that
that the rocker was a failure this ain't
about 2500 this is this actually the
rocker launched I want to stay in the
end of 04 that the first call where
Steve wanted to sit down and really have
a conversation about what are we going
to do in the future was actually in
first quarter of 0 5 and so Stan Ralph
and I went and met with mr. jobs and
gentlemen Eddy Cue Eddy Cue runs itunes
he's certain it works for tim cook today
and that was the first meeting of us
talking about what do we want to do
together they learned from us and we
learned a lot from them I mean they
weren't in the wild space this is their
first jump into the wireless business
and their successes of a surprise and
I'm just glad that we as partners have
had that kind of success that we type
ank we expect that same sort of success
to continue throughout the
absolutely yummy the 4s launch last
Tuesday have 200,000 units yeah biggest
iphone launch you have to kind of regret
it so yeah as far as presale right and
you look at what happened I mean same
thing happened we went from 3g to 3gs
would remember that right everybody said
wallah wait a second it's not that big a
difference in hatton 3gs arguably one of
the most successful phones ever this
iteration from 44 s work site and we
even though some of the media and some
of the analysts kind of times most
certainly guilty of at that point
tonight wasn't what we expected look at
what we care about is what our customers
chapel has a done a incredible job with
their ecosystem and I am say that I mean
from device to content app store to all
the ways that that the devices work
together you think about the iphone ipad
and whatever else you may have when you
got a macbook or whatever you have
everything you buy on content works with
everything
and that ecosystem is very hard to
replicate and beat and I think that's
what it's driven that the customers just
love the app store they love itunes they
love all the content in yet i love the
bookstore and they've just done such a
phenomenal job maybe a really simple to
utilize and get that content but that's
what's kept them about the other
follow-up questions that we had and will
move off from Apple I brought us all of
your other 4G HSPA+ devices in the
signorina handle you guys are saying h+
are forging we expect something similar
with the aiming for yeah we have making
announcements on that yet we're working
with apple and that's really all I can
say about that right now she's riding
you guys feel about the the new media so
leaks are part of business please come
out but what's what's the we be really
likely to the gray no hey look you know
it makes you change the way you do
business right because reality is is it
wasn't you know 10 years ago people
weren't looking to be cool by taking
something out of a shop and putting it
on the web and now say it's against our
policies now
we have to change what we do business
we've had to do things differently a
great example I'll go back to Apple you
know we first started to look at that
but one of the things we have to prove
to them is that we keep things quiet
we're big AT&amp;amp;T by time we're a big
singular right there this they're very
very very good if not the best up
keeping things your hand quiet and so I
we've never lived that in almost seven
years it is amazing though how fast
things spread and I would say this an
all on camera it's amazing how much of
its wrong I mean reality I done my PR
folks here that deal with me every day
well most of it's wrong and that's
that's part of the frustration and you
know what's wrong and just have to deal
with it move on you should you should
see our iphone 5 rumor I bet you if I
got a buck for every time you had a bad
rumor I probably with me ina biga oh but
what point being is that's part of the
new world man and we have to embrace it
being in the line of work we ran into
the department you head up where do you
see connectivity going obviously tablets
are a new market that didn't necessarily
exists four or five years they actually
cut try a year and half ago yeah
absolutely you know most of us don't
want to run around carrying around our
pcs anymore so we have a tablet I'd
argue three years from now you won't
have a pc you'll have a tablet that
maybe a pc or maybe an iOS or whatever
it is but you're not going to add both
today you might have it you know there's
260 million cars in the road five
percent of them which I mean embedded
module yeah but you're you of them are
people are expecting it will take this
walk in and through
connecting that they're going to tether
the future down the wheels everyone will
be both are you seeing it as KITT from
Knight Rider I know it sounds a little
outlandish but I mean the whole getting
in your car having your phone and
juggling a hundred things is that's a
big if there's an old simpsons episode
yeah the fax machine in the car and
drives off the wrist I actually see a
mess I actually see it as as as how the
customers going to walk this is going to
hit the car the car is going to
recognize it's there and you're going to
have already told it what you want this
to you yeah this may be driving the
front seat the back see remember the
back seats a different place you guys
are coming in I got kids so what they
wanted the back seat when they were
younger there over now is much different
than what I cared about in the front
seats right the safety security part of
the Diagnostics part of it the front
seat is really more a business related
issue right if you're forward and you've
got this new electric ed car and York's
and you want to know how its performing
that diagnostic you're going to take
information
too right so now you can see what's the
service interval is what's happening etc
etc so there's a whole bunch of models
that fall into the vehicle but there's
no question every car will be connected
down the road innovation in almost any
industry equals wireless chick tell
me any electronic device that would be
better if it's connected and then you
start to think about that wall you're
gonna talk about connected TV try
obviously your internet teenies great
right they connected home you know what
what's the future of the home and we
believe the future the home is that's
going to be the center of the help of
your life I appreciate the time thank
you very much so it's very interesting
