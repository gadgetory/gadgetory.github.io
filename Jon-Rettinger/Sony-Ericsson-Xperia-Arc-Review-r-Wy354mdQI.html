TechnoBuffalo here and this is my eighth
time filming this intro I'm hoping it's
the charm we are given a full review of
Sony Ericsson's new flagship smartphone
the Xperia Arc that we saw make its
debut at CES 2011 let's go ahead take a
look and see if it lives up to that
flagship name coming up with new ways to
say does it live up to is getting harder
and harder
alright so let's run through the specs
very quickly of this extremely thin
smartphone it's got a odd size 4.2 inch
diagonal screen the resolution of 480 by
854 it's running Sony's new Mobile
BRAVIA Engine which we'll talk about at
length it's one of the few phones out
now that's got Android 2.3 Gingerbread
it's got Sony's proprietary Timescape UI
you're gonna get some new widgets and
have your information arranged in a
hierarchy type order I'm not the biggest
fan we've talked about it though at
length on the back god has a fairly
common 8 megapixel camera with some very
uncommon features that we will also talk
about flash and autofocus are here it
can record 720p video at 30 frames per
second it's got a 1 gigahertz scorpion
processor in it with a 1500 milliamp
hour battery
all right specs your specs how does they
actually come together in a full package
let's talk first about call quality of
the Xperia Arc you can probably see by
that arc shape where it gets its name
from much like its friend that shares a
lot of specs with it the Xperia Play
color quality was just about average
this is nothing to write home about
you're not gonna think well this is the
best call I ever made things sound
awesome but you're not gonna think it
sounds really crappy I can't hear
anything
it's just good enough that you're not
gonna notice that it's bad if that makes
sense its average phone calls I didn't
have many drop calls I did do my 20 call
tests and I had three so just about
average and I was using AT&amp;amp;T 3G network
I shouldn't mention this guy is
available unlocked and thank you to the
folks at clove code
kay for sending this over if you want to
take a look and get one for yourself
link will be down below to pick one of
these bad boys up so call quote is
average speakerphone was average I
didn't have a new Bluetooth connection
issues though that I had with the Xperia
Play so something to keep in mind
alright so with 2 mentioned during the
overview that it's got Sony's Mobile
BRAVIA Engine what does that mean in the
world of qHD and AMOLED and Super AMOLED
plus and Super AMOLED double extra Super
Plus screen resolution and screen
quality is all the rage and this is Sony
Ericsson sort of foray into those high
quality screens and I gotta say this is
one of the best implementations that
I've seen images look absolutely
gorgeous so I've got an image here in
the gallery go ahead and zoom in colors
pop blacks are very very black pretty
decent visibility in direct sunlight as
well and you don't get that sort of a
haze on white areas that you have with
other screens I'm looking at you
original AMOLED Super AMOLED plus
doesn't have it that bad screen is just
absolutely beautiful when you're looking
at text so if I jump on over to the web
for example and we take a look at a site
perhaps like TechnoBuffalo something I
can select the icon there we go you can
see the whites actually look pretty
white they don't have that tint that I
mentioned earlier the screen here is
really really very pretty so we're on
sort of Twitter feed you can see that it
does look very nice we'll go ahead and
exit out of that there we go now you can
actually look at the website text is
going to be very crisp and very clear
you're gonna have no problem reading
text on this I wouldn't necessarily read
an e-book although you could because
it's Android there's a ton of you book
options but it looks very very very nice
and very solid alright so it's called
the arc the AR see and everybody makes
funny jokes that know I should have
reviewed this phone and then you could
have said it was Noah's Arc and honestly
if I thought about that we probably
would have had no review because those
jokes would just be funny and awesome so
it is called the arc because of its
arced shape the arc shape makes this
phone through really nice in the hand
right where you hold it in the middle it
is extremely
and it tapers out on both sides this is
one of the most enjoyable phones to hold
I know that sounds very weird but
holding some of the chunkier phones
because a little bit strange it just
feels very very nice and it's extremely
thin if you look at it for example if we
make a little smartphone sandwich next
something like the Xperia Play which of
course has that slide-out keyboard is
gonna add some thickness you can really
appreciate how thin this phone really is
if you look at something like the Droid
Charge again you can really see how thin
this is and just because I know you
Android folks want to see it here it is
next to the iPhone 4 which at one point
was the smallest or thinnest smartphone
out there and now the Xperia Arc just
absolutely dorset this thing is just so
very very thin so for as good as the
design is Sony made some weird design
cues so if you saw a my review of the
Xperia Play I talked about the strange
button alignment here on the bottom and
how they're a bit out of order for we've
seen on previous Android smartphones
well evidently Sony assigned take that a
little bit further and got rid of some
buttons here on the Xperia Arc so if you
go ahead and take a look at a
traditional Android phone so we bring in
the charge here you've got your menu
button your home button your back button
and your search button here you've just
got a back button home button and a menu
button a little bit weird if you want to
get your search on we got to go ahead
and do it with a soft button because
unfortunately we're missing it that
fourth one right there this is running
Gingerbread which has a really really
awesome application management system
built right in and generally in stock
Gingerbread to access that all you got
to do is hit the menu button and you can
access it right there however Sony
decided to make things simpler I guess
and get rid of that option so if you
want to access that you got to make a
shortcut to it on your home screen or
access it directly from your apps I
found that to be very very annoying
all right so I don't generally talk
about cameras in my reviews because
usually they're all varying degrees of
suck they snap pictures you can take a
shot of your dog or your friends out of
a club but you're not gonna blow them up
and chances are it's not going to
replace your primary camera however the
Xperia Arc comes very close to camera
quality and features let me go ahead and
show you some will jump into camera we
don't have a hard button for for camera
you got your typical Android looking
camera options however what you've got
is that little guy smiling at you and
this is the smile detection actually
what this will do is when you have
somebody in frame so if I had a face
right there and I was going to smile as
soon as I smiled it would snap the
picture so if you take photos of kids
and they're trying to get them to sit
still this is a really nice feature
something to keep in mind that I really
liked with the Xperia Arc this is not
something that's offered in all of Sony
Ericsson's up phones all right so let's
talk about speed for all of you
processor junkies and benchmarking
junkies it received a quadrant score of
one thousand three hundred and sixty one
so certainly wasn't set in the world on
fire with its quadrant speed it was okay
it was actually lower than the Xperia
Play which came at 1392
but all those numbers don't mean much if
the phone is going to work well for you
and this phone is pretty snappy one of
the areas where I generally notice
slowness is in the browser so if we look
at a TechnoBuffalo which does have Flash
content here you can see how slow that
lets actually load up the browser it's
not overly quick there's a little bit of
lag with Flash turned off though it's
pretty zippy but if you look at some of
the dual core phones that's really where
you see a difference and this is just a
single core which generally I don't say
is the biggest deal but when you're
looking at Flash content and you're
doing very processor intensive things
having that extra core it really does
come into handy so this is by no means a
slow phone at all but it does exist in
the world of other phones out there when
dual core is becoming a standard whether
you're dealing with NVIDIA Tegra 2 or
whether or not you're dealing with dual
core Snapdragon this just doesn't have
it so while it's excellent for today's
standards and specs if you're good
looking to sign into your contract it
does offer on your carrier you're
looking to spend these several hundred
dollar it's gonna cost to get this thing
unlocked chances are you're not going to
be buying a phone or another phone in
the next year so and you want to get
some
that's going to be future proof and you
just don't have that option here
unfortunately
so do I recommend this phone absolutely
for right now it is a solidly SPECT
phone in a gorgeous package but it's not
future proof so you don't have support
for full HSPA+ you don't have LTE you're
not gonna have that dual core which is
probably going to become standard in the
next year so you're gonna get a phone
that's going to work great now and
developer has certainly been making tons
of applications but it's not gonna be
optimized for dual core phones that will
be coming out inevitably in the next few
months so if you're in the market for a
phone that's going to work well it's
going to give you a relatively decent
speed and looks damn good while doing it
the Xperia Arc is going to be a very
solid phone however if you're one of the
few that needs to have the latest and
greatest technology this is by no means
a future-proof phone and you might be
better off waiting for the Ark to which
presumably will have dual core or
another Sony Ericsson phone which will
sports two cores so guys hope you enjoy
curious what you think about the Xperia
Arc whether or not it's for you I am
John render from TechnoBuffalo and I
will see you in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
