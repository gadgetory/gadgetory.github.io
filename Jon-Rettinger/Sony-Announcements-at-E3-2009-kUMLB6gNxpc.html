is Tuesday June 2nd and today is the
second day of the ìiî the big video game
conference held in Los Angeles now
today's keynote speakers were Nintendo
which I gave a full recap on earlier in
the day and then so me took the stage a
few hours later following Microsoft
yesterday and what sony had in store was
very interesting so without further ado
let's get right into it
Sony opened their keynote by talking
about leaks and that's media leaks it
was no secret if you follow the tech
world that Sony was going to release a
new PSP dump the PSP go it'll talk about
a little bit and it was all over the
internet video specs pictures is very
interesting you see Sony actually
acknowledged the leaks and it kind of
makes you wonder where these leaks are
coming from maybe Sony is even doing it
themselves to help hype up devices or
maybe even companies are leaking these
things themselves to build hype it
certainly wouldn't be a surprise so
let's get into the goodness and what
they started talking about conference
just ended a few hours ago I forgot some
notes in front of me so excuse me if I'm
looking down here
so first what they announced and demoed
were a ton of new games for the ps3 I
mean just an absolute ton some of the
highlights that they announced were
uncharted 2 a new God of War game Madden
Final Fantasy 13 Tekken suck Guitar Hero
van Halen really convinient and and a
new exclusive from rockstar the company
that made grand theft auto called it
agent I think that Sony is trying to get
some of their exclusives back since they
lost a lot of them to the Xbox so good
for Sony for trying to push the video
game exclusivity forward more exclusive
titles generally mean increased sales so
certainly they're trending in the right
direction so the next thing they
announced in the real non surprise of u3
was the PSP go essentially what that is
is a UMD the UMD if you don't know was
the little disc that held the game they
would insert into your PSP a UMD less so
no UMD sliding version of the PSP and if
you wanna know what it looks like you
know
online or think Sony Milo was their
internet device except in a PSP version
it's got 16 gigabytes of online flash
storage it's got bluetooth and Wi-Fi and
they're kind of the cool things about it
since there is no physical media all the
games will be downloaded from a new
PlayStation Network in addition to just
being able to download the full games
they'll also be able to download movies
TV shows custom playlists really upping
the game with the PlayStation Network so
that really is quite cool actually so
look for the PSP go that's gonna run you
249 they didn't give a release date but
they were showing the device off fully
functional last thing that wouldn't be
too far out I should mention though that
this is not gonna replace the current
PSP 3000 they're gonna be sold next to
each other people tend to like having
physical disks and all the games that
are available for download also be
available on UMD so if you have a PSP
2000 or 3000 he'll be able just to pop
it right in and still be able to play
and I wouldn't assume that all these
features are gonna be available on the
PSP 3000 although they could certainly
be updated via firmware we're still kind
of waiting on Sony to give an official
word on that
they also demoed a few really cool games
for this new PSP go they've downloaded
Gran Turismo a new Metal Gear Solid game
and a new Resident Evil game which does
look to be quite cool so the PSP go what
do you guys think are you interested in
it is it gonna make you want to upgrade
from your old PSP to care one way or
another so leave your comments down
below they talked a little bit about
PlayStation Home which is sort of like a
version of The Sims almost where you can
have an avatar you can walk around and
socialize with other PlayStation users
it's actually very cool if the other
PlayStation definitely give it a
download it's still available I believe
in meaneth the next thing they talked
about was the PlayStation motion control
which is sort of like Playstations
version of the Wii Remote except this
thing looks like an ice-cream cone like
a rectangle ice-cream cone with a big
red circle on top I assumed what they
showed was not the final design it must
have just been a
it had to have just been a prototype
because the thing was ugly but it does
have true one-to-one sensing so when you
move it just an inch or a millimeter
it'll move actually just an inch or a
millimeter think the Wii remotes with
the Wii MotionPlus attachment the sort
of what you're getting with this new PSP
motion controller it'll be available in
spring 2010 certainly have a while to go
so the big news with the Sony's
announcement today was really the non
noun sment no price cut which i think
was quite a big deal and no PSP snuck
PSP no PlayStation 3 slim that people
were expecting all I would assume that's
coming at a later date a price cut
really is thinking about they're waiting
for before they jump on the ps3 train so
wasn't disappointed they didn't announce
it but you're still getting a lot of
value with the ps3 you're getting
Bluetooth Wi-Fi blu-ray now you get
ability to download and stream movies
from the PlayStation Network it really
is a very cool platform you haven't
checked it out so now that all three
commenters are over we can surmise sort
of where they all a Microsoft focus a
lot on the hardware Nintendo focused a
lot on the software and Sony kind of
fell right in between so guys what do
you think about the Sony announcement
are you excited about any of it you
excited about the new games at PSP Co
the PlayStation motion controller take
care do not care I'm really curious I
like talking about these music video
game conferences and discussing with you
guys so please leave comments down below
and for exclusive content sure to follow
me on Twitter twitter.com slash John for
Lakers I'll see you guys next video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
