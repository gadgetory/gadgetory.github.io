here with an unboxing for you of the new
HP I pack and glisten this is a phone
for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless that'll be available
in the coming weeks
it's a windows mobile 6.5 or Windows
Phone as Microsoft would like you to
call it it's got an AM oh well let you
scream GPS and a ton of other good stuff
let's go ahead and dig in and take a
look and of course for an unboxing we've
got the big old knife but he seems to
have brought friends these are both of
them that I used for the unboxings they
were sitting here on my desk
we got dueling big ol knives but I have
to kill myself so we'll just use one of
them let's go ahead and dig into the box
this would be available for a hundred
and seventy nine dollars after a $50
mail-in rebate nothing else in it the
iPAQ glisten hp's kind of gone onto the
radar with phones for quite a while this
is one that was teased a little a little
while back and is now available for
public consumption or will be in the
coming weeks so it's letting you know on
the front that it's got Wi-Fi gps email
and a browser and you can see on the
front it's sort of a candy bar looking
phone sort of reminiscent of the
blackberry bold or curved series looks
like it's got some sort of optical
trackpad in the middle or maybe there's
a d-pad we'll take a look and it's got
an unskilled version of windows mobile
6.5 telling you what's in the box but no
need to look at that since we're gonna
open it up in just a second well let's
take a look at some of the specs here it
is 4.45 high by two point four eight
wide and point five two inches deep this
flight is a pretty generous 2.5 inch
QVGA 64,000 color 320 by 420 am oh le
d-- screen so if those you don't know
what the am LED screen is you right here
it is mo LED essentially what it means
is it's a low power really bright color
so it's really what you want on your
smart phone it's god's 512 megabytes of
flash rom in 256 megabytes of ram and of
course a micro
key card for going up to 32 gigs it's
got a camera with a 3.1 and megapixel
sensor with a 5 times digital zoom and
it's got Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G bluetooth on all that
other goodness you'd expect including
GPS let's go and take a look at this I
have not seen one in person so I have no
idea what its gonna look like or how
thick it's gonna be but let's take a
look so I've got some getting started on
the front some stuff about EMT navigator
which I actually use my iPhones my daily
driver and I use AT&amp;amp;T Navigator I think
it's actually a pretty good option some
cases from HP and some information from
HP as well so here is the device itself
and push it off to the side for just one
minute but there's a pretty decent sized
battery there as well we've got a wall
charger for similar to what you get now
with the iPhone and some HTC devices
just a little wall plug with what
appears to be a USB port so they'll plug
right in and let's see what sort of
connector each we decided to use with
this they are using micro USB so at
least it's not a proprietary standard
then push all this off to the side and
let's take a look at the device itself
pop the battery in to and the battery is
sighs let's see if it tells us on it all
right so it appears to be a 1250 milli
amp hour battery it's a little bit long
but it's thin so that's not too bad so
here is the phone itself let's take a
look at what it looks like so you've got
your full keyboard on the front and it
looks to be a very generous keyboard
spacing the keys have nice throw there a
little bit slick and you can see there's
a little bit of raise on them so you can
feel which key is which from a window
standpoint you've got your buttons that
you would expect this is a touch screen
by the way you've got your send key
you've got your Windows key you've got
your okay or back key and your N key
that does look like well that's just not
an optical joypad it's actually a full
d-pad 5 way with a button selection in
the middle and this is of course a
resistive touch screen the only
capacitive
Windows Mobile phone out there is the
HTC hd2 looks like we've got some LEDs
and maybe a proximity sensor we've got
your volume toggle up and down on the
left-hand side
continuing on the right you've got your
3.5 milimeter headset jack and your
micro USB charging port there is your
camera sensor does not have in any sort
of LED flash and that's like you've got
a stylus silo at the bottom which is a
bit collapsible variety so whether you
like that or not you're going to have it
so let's do a quick the camera focus
again let's do a quick size comparison
to some other devices you might be
familiar with here is a similar form
factor device we've got the palm pixi
force print the pixie is probably the
smallest candy bar form factor
chordophone that i've seen and it's not
that much smaller than the glistens that
goes to show that how small this device
really is the keyboard definitely looks
to be way more spaced out on the HP than
it is on the pixie but to keep it on the
pixies quite good so we'll see how this
one stacks up from a thickness
standpoint HP looks a little bit thicker
but not much the obligatory iPhone
comparisons people are familiar with the
size of the iPhone they don't look to be
that different stack them on top side
comparison sort of rounding out some of
the carrier's flagship devices here we
have the blackberry storm2 looks to be
pretty similar that's great the iPhone
sort of rounding out the carriers
flasher devices here we have the
blackberry storm2
looks to be relatively similar in size
and pretty close in thickness so let's
pop in the battery and see what this
looks like so here's the device sort of
opened up there's your SIM card slot and
your micro SD card slot is right there
and let's see if once the batteries in
if you have to pull it out to actually
access that micro SD card slot I'm
inclined to believe that you are going
to have to just pop in the battery that
looks like yeah it does cover up that
slot so you have to pull out the battery
in order to access the micro sd which is
a bit annoying but it's pretty standard
fare for most smartphones that push that
back on and let's power this thing on
and see what we got and it can take
sometimes quite a while to power on
Windows 6.5 devices especially for the
first time so this gets to be a little
bit long I'm going to cut it short
you've got your big HP splash screen
it's about a minute has elapsed now you
get to the Windows calibration screen
this is a resistive screen you're gonna
want you to calibrate it and first it up
your phone so they're saying happen so
we'll go ahead and tap it so take out
the stylus and we'll do the calibration
go ahead and tap the center
and that's it here we are now in the
standard unscanned Windows Phone or
windows mobile 6.5 sliding panel
interface so like I usually do with all
my phone reviews I'll use this for a
little bit and I'll let you guys know
what I think
