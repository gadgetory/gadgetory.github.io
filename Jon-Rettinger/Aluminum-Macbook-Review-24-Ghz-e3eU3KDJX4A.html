lakers calm it's been just about a week
now with the actual exactly a week with
the new macbook and i want to give you
guys my review on it so i've seen past
seven days I've really gone through
little aspect to the computer I've
talked about the keyboard talk about the
speakers some overall impressions and I
want to kind of sum it all together
today and give you guys my overall feel
for the computer itself first off design
I love I waited for the aluminum just
based on rumors and I'm very glad I did
from a purely aesthetic standpoint the
computer is gorgeous with the glossy
screen the black bezel I mean it really
is a technological masterpiece computers
aren't necessarily the best looking
things but in the world of ugly this is
definitely the beauty queen so for my
aesthetic standpoint it definitely
cannot be beat feature wise I've been
very happy with it a big problem people
are having is lack of firewire and for
better or worse Apple took it out
personally it's not an issue since i
have my macbook pro if i need for my
accusing my imac if i if i do any
editing i sold a macbook pro so lack of
firewire it's not an issue for me but I
can see why it would be an issue for the
video professionals that are looking to
do some editing or people other others
that just have firewire peripheral
flying around and there's not a
connection cable you can use that'll
change the ports in two firewire so that
is definitely a drawback of a computer
one other thing that I wanted to mention
I didn't show in the video and people
have been asking about is the viewing
angle the computer so i'm going to show
you guys right now and actually a
viewing angle does go back probably
about 15 degrees more than the last
generation macbook so i'll show you guys
how far back it goes so let's open up so
that's as far back as it can reach and
it is actually relatively far so i
wanted you guys to see that next thing i
want to talk about actually long as i
have is open is the beautiful glossy
screen now personally I'm a fan of
glossy I like the way makes two colors
pop again I don't do intense
or video editing so having them not
having a mat it's not an issue for me
glossy is certainly my preference but
the lack of a matte option again is a
hit for professionals that need mat for
true colors the glossy is not an issue
for me either in direct sunlight I've
taken it outside and tested it there is
certainly a little bit of a reflection
but nothing that has appeared to me from
doing my work although i'm typing or
reading online you can always readjust
the screen or adjust the brightness so i
don't think it's a baking at you I
believe it's blown out a little bit of
proportion if you've been looking at
some of the rumors and the thread sites
keep in mind that everybody to posts
there are generally a vocal minority
people that are unhappy the myriad of
people that are happy with the computers
generally don't post to share their
experiences so always keep that in mind
and but you read online take with a
little bit of grain of salt next thing
the wireless connectivity distance is
aluminum people have been concerned that
maybe the wireless and wasn't as
wide-ranging as of previous generations
plastic so I have a friend that actually
has a lot generation black macbook we
put our side by side and checked our
internet connections at what we could
see we can see exactly the same network
exactly the same connectivity so it
looks like Apple wherever they put their
wireless in here you didn't lose
anything you're not losing anything with
aluminum one of the big issues that I
had with my old macbook pro I know
people ever having with the last
generation macbooks is heat the thing
used to get really hot you put on your
lap and you worried that you might not
be able to have kids again I'm proud and
happy to say that he does no longer an
issue with the new generation macbooks
used it for two or three hours revealing
no heat issues at all on my lap it
didn't feel noticeably hot or
uncomfortable it does get a little bit
warmer in the upper left-hand corner
where the processor is but so far less
than the last generation you won't even
notice it for fortunately and while
we're a heat fan noise is an issue
people haven't wanted to know about I
have yet to hear the fans actually
turned on on this I know they're in
there whether it's better insulated
because you Luminum you just don't hear
it or the aluminum dissipate the heat
better and there's less need for them to
be on I haven't had any heat issues
again and I haven't even heard the fans
so
no concern there at all the disk drive
the eight-speed is the same on last
generation so nothing really to talk
about their keyboard I really do like
the keyboard the short throws and the
spaced out I did a full video on the
keyboard so you guys can see it and
having the backlight is certainly nice
option the 2.4 model so I've been very
happy with the keyboard for my primary
computer i use the wireless keyboard so
it's exactly the same just put on a
laptop so it's been a very quick and
easy adjustments for me hardware-wise
again i have a 2.4 model and thing has
just been screaming fast and with only 2
gigabytes of ddr3 ram it is just
lightning quick I have had any slowdown
tried opening up every program and they
still work very quickly I thought
originally I was going to upgrade to
four gigs but I think I might keep it at
two I haven't had any troubles with it
at all I also did a video where I
installed windows vista on it via
bootcamp and even with two gigs with a
very ram hungry windows operating system
it still was extremely quick and you'll
see on the benchmark score that I did in
a Windows Vista video got a 5.2 Vista
rating which is extremely high and is
higher than a stock configuration dell
XPS 1330 1530 and melissa the HP laptops
out there with higher specs so Apple did
a great job of maximizing what they put
in this computer I think you really are
getting your money's worth if you decide
to go with the macbook while you are
paying what's to traditionally called a
little bit of an apple tax you are
getting a lot for that additional money
you're also getting a full ilife suite
of applications so I movie I DVD
garageband iphoto all the stuff lets you
manage your digital life that ordinarily
you would have to buy in Windows if you
wanted that software so that's something
that comes with the computer and you
also get the ability to run windows so
you can have a windows computer if you
like and you also get a run the elegant
and personally my preference OS 10 I
don't not down on windows at all i think
it's a great operating system personally
i just prefer windows so for my money I
like the option of being able to have
both and I think that additional cost of
Apple is far beyond
and worth it for me for what you get for
advantages so guys you can probably tell
where I'm going with this waiting for
the aluminum macbook was a great
decision I couldn't be happier with it
from performance screen size really
everything has been fantastic battery
life I've gone as long as five hours
with Bluetooth turned off and just doing
word processing simple internet usage
you're probably gonna get about three
and a half to four hours and for
watching a movie plan on about two and a
half hours of battery life so I'll get
through a full movie battery life is
really very very very strong and I
showed in a previous video that they one
of the cool things Apple added to the
side is a little button here to check
your battery I don't be able to see what
the glare but it lights up to show you
how full there you go you can see how
full your charges can see it right there
so if you guys have been deciding what
your computer looking for the macbook is
a great option I haven't tried any games
on it so I can't speak to gaming
performance but this current integrated
nvidia card is five times more powerful
in the previous generation macbook so
you will be able to handle a lot of
games if you're not planning on playing
things at the highest resolution at the
highest frame rates the macbook will
definitely suffice for you whether you
use it in OS 10 or in Windows XP or
Vista if you are a professional and
firewire is important to you and you are
a hardcore gamer the macbook pro is a
great way to go but if you fall under
that professional category and more of a
casual gamer you just like to use
internet and we're processing for
instance if your college student the
macbook really is a fantastic way to go
if I'm on the scale of 1 out of 10 10
being the highest one being the lowest I
really give this a solid nine personally
I can see where people have some trouble
with the lack of firewire and Matt
options but from again from my
standpoint none of those are an issue
and I couldn't be more happy with the
computer so guys hope you enjoyed this
