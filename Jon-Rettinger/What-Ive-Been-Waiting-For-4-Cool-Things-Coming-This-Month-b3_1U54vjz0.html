respect it deserves the shortest of all
the months but I am excited for februari
I am geeked out for new tech we just
talked about in the office there are
four things in particular in February
coming out that I cannot wait to get my
nerdy loving hands on it sounds like his
hands love nerds but you know what I'm
saying there's cool stuff coming
especially for mobile world congress so
i figured instead of just talking to the
guys around the office i would talk to
you about it we could geek out together
let's start with the latest from LG
they've pretty much already not
announced the announcement the LG G six
we've done a video talking everything
about it but should have a bit of an odd
18 by 9 aspect ratio which I don't
understand why I just don't so called
two to one I learned my fractions if you
the bud topsun anyway to have a weird
aspect ratio a Snapdragon 820 one not
the 835 because Samsung just like
hoarded up all the 835 chips for the s8
they're ditching the mods from the g5
favor of waterproofing and I'm fingers
ee crossed for wireless charging we
should see that in February ray so
remember back in I oh wait a long time
ago and then out Android wear 2 point 0
and then we can hear anything about
Android wear two point oh it's coming at
February's a month big boys getting mad
props from TechnoBuffalo and before
anybody starts commenting what am I on
I'll be excited about tech I always
feels comments like John seems excited
he must be smoking something I'm not I'm
high on life and exciting how technology
so some cool stuff from LG should be
coming in fact I believe TechnoBuffalo
is the first sight that shared images of
the two LG watches that are coming the
LG watch sports and the LG watch style
starting around 250 bucks you should
also have google assistant built-in so
Andrew where to point o getting on my
wrist hopefully getting your wrist shoot
you if use an iPhone you can still get
on your wrist because it's getting more
features that'll work by us so know what
used to hear a lot about and now you
don't hear anything about you could all
you could have been smashmouth may be
Avril Lavigne sorry if you're a fan of
those to be Android tablets UCB all the
thing and then we didn't really hear
much about them but Samsung will make it
a showing at Mobile World Congress with
galaxy tab s 3 actually really liked at
a best to was super thin this one's
aimed to go head-to-head against the
smaller 9.7 inch iPad pro a little bit
smaller on the screen side should be
nine point six inches to be rockin and
screen resolution of 2048x1536
Snapdragon 820 4 gigs of ram and expect
Samsung to make it really really really
thin and I can also expect a lot of
explosive comments down below tab s3 is
coming soon and last but not least
blackberry still got some juice left in
that berry which is a joke I've been
wanting to make for for a little while
thank you for sticking with my dad joke
with the blackberry mercury is coming it
looks like a classic kind of blackberry
keyboard down below and the screen up
above we had a chance to go hands-on
with it at CES didn't really let us take
any video of it didn't tell us much as
the specs so TCL made it so they should
probably unveil most with the phone's
going to be but expect a lot of the same
Blackberry Android stuff that you liked
or maybe didn't like with the probe I
was a big fan of it so I'm excited to
try it I still have a soft spot on my
cold dead heart for physical keyboards
so I'm excited to give this guy a shot
maybe you guys are too so the four
exciting things coming to februari I'm
just geeked out about it and I figured
you talk to you about it a TV news
format so what you guys excited about
any particular mobile world congress you
want to see let us know and for a
comment of the day let's go back to our
LG g 6 video seemed to make sense comes
from abdul g who said what's all I hate
against LG there's only company that's
trying new things may not be successful
but held will try firstly excited for
the g6 well Abdul we'll see what they
have in store if you want to check out
more of Abdul comments you've made a ton
of good ones will link to him down below
thank you guys for watching if you want
to beat upcoming comments the day it
should be pretty obvious just leave a
comment and maybe we'll feature it hope
you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up
we appreciate it jon rettinger see you
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
