technobuffalo here they review for you
of the dell inspiron 14z this is part of
Dell's consumers z series which takes
advantage of CU l view processors may
start to hear that around and what that
stands for is consumer ultra-low voltage
with that then translates to is
primarily standard Intel chips that have
been clocked down redesigned to use less
voltage between stanyan factors can put
them into thinner packages so you're
going to get better than netbook
performances but not as fast as your you
know two gigahertz and faster core2duo
that you'll find on other laptops the
price range of this runs anywhere from
six 5000 into 750 we're reviewing the
higher end model right here it does have
a core two duo ultra low voltage chip
coming in at one point three gigahertz
this is running the windows 7 home
premium 64-bit it's got three gigabytes
of ram in there and got a HP cd/dvd
drive which something that you don't
really see in some of these ultra low
voltage computers it's got a 14 inch
screen as you probably guessed by the
14-team moniker and going over some of
the rest of specs on advice it's got the
Intel GMA x4500 HD it's got a six cell
battery which they say is gonna get you
about eight hours I tend to find it to
be a closer to four in terms of standard
usage it's got a 1.3 megapixel
integrated webcam you know Wi-Fi sort of
everything else that you would expect
from a weight wise it comes in about 4.4
pounds so it's not the lightest laptop
in the world but it's certainly not the
heaviest the resolution to the 14 inch
screen is 1366 x 768 so I don't give you
a bit of a tour of the laptop you
probably saw it during my unboxing let
me show you what this thing looks like
you get in a variety of colors to got
the red one right here obviously so as
far as ports go go ahead and plug out
the power cord on the left side you've
got your vents vga hdmi
ethernet one USB and a multi card reader
on the front of laptop you've got
microphone and headset ports on the side
you've got two more USB and there is
your DVD burning drive and your power
port it's relatively thin and pretty
light really we notice the thinness is
on the back if you compare this size
wise with the standard l14 inspiron that
you may find it best buy or your local
electronics store will definitely see a
stiff Akande difference in size for
comparison here is a unibody macbook
this is the 13-inch model you can sort
of see how things stack up from a size
comparison so it's a little bit bigger
than a macbook but not by much it does
actually weigh a bit less go ahead put
that off to the side and let's keep
digging in to the computer so now take a
look at the keyboard certainly typing is
very important to computer usage
keyboard doesn't have much flex to it at
all it's pretty nice nice keyboard wide
space certainly full-sized it sort of is
Chiclets but not Chiclets um the keys
are flat like the chiclet style but
they're pushed close together there's a
lot of throw and it feels good to type
on it's probably one of the better
laptop keyboards that I've used so no
issues there at the keyboard at all the
mouse and the track button right here
it's not multi-touch it does feel the
same as the side a little bit maybe
rougher was the biggest fan of the
trackpad the buttons seem to be pushed
up a little bit high I think they could
have been pushed down a little bit it
have had much more room to use your
finger around there so it wasn't
answering that a deal breaker of
something to keep in mind okay so let's
talk about video playback I made a video
previously demonstrated how this handles
HD playback in both hulu and youtube HD
and handled it well but it was a little
bit stuttering in that video I was using
a screen recording program to do that
called Camtasia want to show you what
that looks like without the screen
recorder running you can see right here
I've got cash manager open so you can
track to the processor speed let's go
ahead and cue up we'll go to youtube HD
you can see what this looks like and
we'll kick it up to
high resolutions you to bless so we'll
go to my channel youtube com so that's
John for lakers I don't pick the first
video that we have here there's review
of the nexus well mo go and go right to
the page so we'll kick this up I'll turn
the turn the volume down a little bit
and we'll kick this up to 720p and let's
check the processor speed here so it's
staggering a little bit that may do the
internet connection so the video is
playing and playing smoothly there's a
little bit of a buffer issue at the
beginning the processor speed though
goes all the way up once it's playing to
67 75 percent right now we're at 72
nothing to go ahead push this back so I
don't have a buffering problem and I go
to put this on full screen you can see
it was moving wallpaper here is moving
pretty fluidly so the moral being you're
not going to get fantastic HD playback
what you're going to get definitely
watchable HD playback and I had the same
experience on both hulu and youtube HD
very watchable the audios synced up
nicely you're not going to have any
trouble with that now this as far as
handles multitasking handle it okay you
can definitely have four or five browser
windows open you could have a microsoft
office open on here too and not run into
any issue 3 gigabytes of ram certainly
helps out with that and not running an
atom chip definitely gives you a little
bit more power than perhaps have i've
been used to on a netbook i did just run
a performance score on this let me show
you what that came in at so the overall
score here is 3.4 and that's based on
the lowest score processor got a 4.1
memory so that's the
hopefully you guys can see that that's
the RAM got a 4.7 graphic Scotty 3.7
gaming graphics got a 3.4 which is where
a 3.4 rating came from and the primary
hard drive got a 5.4 you can get the
hard drives can really range as far as
size goes I think this one has a 160
gigabyte hard drive in there how which
is user accessible I shouldn't mention
case you want to upgrade it on your own
so overall this is a very capable
machine certainly a step up from a
netbook no you're not sacrificing that
much over a standard consumer notebook
so I can definitely recommend this
anybody out there that's looking for a
pc that's a little bit lighter and you
want the smaller screen size having a 14
inch ultra low voltage is a little bit
odd generally run 13 inch range or even
a little bit smaller so 14 is a unique
size a screen resolution wasn't
fantastic I would have liked you've seen
a higher res screen especially for a
laptop that's going to run each other
hundred fifty bucks I think this one
does for the higher end you know at that
price point you can definitely get full
core two duo chips it's going to be a
little bit chunkier a little bit bigger
you're definitely a sacrifice some of
the size but you are gonna get a little
bit more power so I'm not entirely sure
who the target on graphic for this would
be probably go soon would be good right
towards students but if you're in the
market for an ultra-low voltage laptop
and you really like Adele brand you
can't go wrong with this it works well
but you know what you're getting
yourself into you're not going to get a
powerhouse gonna be able to render HD
video although I did try and it took a
very long time but it didn't do it
you're going to get a computer that's
great for for multitasking for word
processing for web browsing and doing
some video doing you're not going to
play the HD games right here don't have
any illusions that you will be able to
and I guys hope you enjoyed jon
rettinger from technobuffalo calm and i
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
