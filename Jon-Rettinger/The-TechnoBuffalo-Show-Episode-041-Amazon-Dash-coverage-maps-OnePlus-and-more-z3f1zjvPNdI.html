TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor and chief of
the site i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazleton everybody how are
you doing today Todd I'm good it's our
favorite day of the year yeah april
fools very hard to write news because
you don't know you have we we're always
very careful TechnoBuffalo we always
double-check everything but on this day
we sometimes trip triple check quadruple
check ya thang a couple years ago I got
I got fooled it was somebody had like a
nokia phone and i think it was like
loaded running Windows Phone or
something which at the time was like
whoa this is weird you know and it was
an april fool's joke but i thought it
was real and now I mean of course
obviously okay folks run Windows Phone
yeah mm I don't know this day is always
tricky and yeah some of the stuff is
just not funny yeah it's kind of hard to
laugh at it too because you're like are
all right you know like come on I've
other stuff to do but yeah exactly
exactly I mean I used to love on
phonescoop every year another site they
used to just always on April Fool's just
had like eight fake news stories and I
don't think they're doing it this year I
checked this morning and I kind of liked
that because you expected it it was
there if you wanted you go there and
they had like their other site to that
was kind of fun but did you go to Amazon
this morning I didn't uh going to go to
amazon right now if you haven't been
there yet it should work what are we
seeing you but we'll we'll wait wall oh
wow let's cool amazon old-school have us
haha remember when it looked like this
so do i well i don't know why they
picked 99 though it's not like it's
anniversary year or so out of night odd
but yeah that uh that made me laugh when
i went through this morning as what
green because they honestly the for
those that follow our deals posts on on
the site I always check
the deals every morning so I have to log
into a system to take a look at those
and I went over there I was like where's
my login wait wait what what's going on
as well I get a look at the deals for
the day but speaking of april fools
jokes 1 plus in the drone yeah that was
weird I mean they teased it for so long
that it didn't seem like it's gonna be
like an April Fool's joke and it sort of
is but it's not they're like well it
does exist but it's like super limited
quantities you have to wonder like did
they just build it for fun and then you
know happen to launch it on today and
say it's April Fool's because they don't
have a lot of years to go around you're
like how does that work i don't i don't
get the joke behind it really um yeah
well like know gaming says here the one
plus joke was a little funny it took
some planning yes I agree it took all I
can't believe how long they played the
joke out right yeah so like our fans
upset then that like is this is the
announcement like they were kind of
teasing something and then they're like
oh it's just this well I mean you could
immediately point to the fact that that
the drone is sold out as fans weren't
upset but for all we know there were
only 10 of them right exactly yeah we we
don't know and for those that don't know
the situation 1 plus had been teasing
that there was going to be a drone
released they even confirmed it
yesterday it's called the dr one and
then when it showed up this morning it
was about it could fit in your hand it
was so tiny right and they went april
fools but is it really in April Fool's
joke if it's really yes I yeah the good
thing is if you can't get that there's
like I was actually randomly looking at
drone Chester on amazon just to see what
you know what their price at what kind
of stuff they have there's tons of
really small ones that you know are
affordable pick them up but my thing I
feel like if I get a drone I'd want one
with a camera so you can kind of see
like that's the whole fun of it to me
right right and no game he also says
that the draw
was just a one was just a one plus
branded cheer spencey x10 oh there you
go well if kind of real kind I don't
know is very odd odd joke I joke but
speaking of jokes and I have seen some
people in such a mahal asks your would
you want amazon dash buttons to be a
real thing to the best of our knowledge
they are yeah i did some i had heard you
know some people go oh it was an april
fools joke but as you know USA Today is
claiming it's not a joke the verge is
claiming it's not a joke that I many
many publications are stressing that
it's not a joke I don't think it's a
april fools joke at all um maybe I'm
wrong but I think it's a really cool
idea and it seems neat I mean just this
little button you can put anywhere and
tap it mean you know new paper towels or
new detergent and then it syncs with
your smart phone over Wi-Fi places the
order and then it's delivered but it's
in a closed beta right now but they're
free even if it is a joke I think it
makes a lot of sense i think you know
yesterday a lot of people were like this
is incredible it's it's a great way for
amazon to receive orders from people
when they're not here they're phone I
mean it's simply just tap the button and
then it comes one of the concerns that
we were talking about yesterday is like
well what if you know your kid goes by
it hits the button 100 times and it only
registers once and it won't ship more
than that until the shipment arrives I
guess and you can always easily cancel
it so right which I think that's a great
system because that actually had been
one of my concerns yo lo billee walks by
and Oh mommy look the I could press the
button too right yeah and you end up
with 20 pallets of paper towels right
yeah but no it's an interesting idea is
it something i will actually use I don't
know because I'm a little too price
conscious I mean there are times where a
third party seller on amazon has a
better price than amazon itself you know
i'll choose to go with them instead so
the eye
dia I mean yes it's very convenient but
the idea of just blindly ordering
something is not super appealing to me
right and i noticed that i mean amazon
for those kinds of products to you'll
household things they have subscription
services and you save if you if you
subscribe so like i was actually
yesterday looking at dog bones and i
think it was like nine dollars for the
pack but if I subscribe to have it
delivered once a month it was like eight
dollars then I don't think you know this
would play into the subscription model
look no it was agreed i'm on several
subscriptions you know for like i have
oatmeal every morning for breakfast so i
have a subscription in my oatmeal oh
really yeah and it's far far cheaper to
order via the subscription hmm you know
and if you are you know running ahead of
yourself for whatever reason you can go
in and tell them I need a shipment now
and you still get the subscription price
right so this seems great for people
especially if you live maybe you know 15
20 minute drive from the store or
something like that and you could you
can wait that extra day or two days and
then just delivery and you're expecting
it and you need it though but like for
me I live in a city I could just walk
downstairs I'm gonna live above a shop
where i can buy all that stuff so I
don't know that you know I would use it
that often no I agree with you there i
mean this you know amazon really changed
the game for living in a small town such
as i do where you know we have to
grocery stores we have a walmart we have
a midwestern chain called hi be and so
there's a lot of products they don't
carry you know if you are reading a
recipe calls for something even the
least bit off and the only way to get it
is to mail order it right you know so
yeah amazon was a big game changer for
us especially when they did start
selling household products you know so
yeah I can see where this would work
better for that that type of situation
but like you're saying you know you can
just walk downstairs and you know by
your thing to go right back upstairs
right we got to do that with paper
towels yesterday
yeah so yeah I don't know I don't know
it's gonna be interesting I i find
interesting they're free though I'm
wondering if there's going to be limit
on how many you can have I know yeah it
seems like that and like can you switch
them out you know like can you just
register it to order shaving cream
instead of paper towels when you're like
oh I don't really need the paper towel
it seems like you could using your phone
but it would probably still have that
label the brand right right and I don't
know it's going to be interesting to see
where this goes yeah uh the other topic
we want touch on today is coverage maps
so you know t-mobile made this
announcement this week that they had the
the best coverage map out there because
you know it was based off of real people
and all that yeah yes so well here I
thought it was awesome because I was
looking around and it says you know
around my apartment here I can expect 7
megabits per second down but at the
beach you didn't really have anything it
just said like coverage is there and I
was like oh you know that's good to know
me you know i'm not going to rely on
tmobile then for the beach and stuff but
you're saying and this is customer data
it's as they pulled in twice a month I
think so you can really see the average
scores but you're saying you found the
scores are not true okay so now when
you're looking at the map there are
little hexagons checkmarks that show up
that say those are customer verified
there is no check mark then it's not a
customer verified well in my area my
specific address you can see my little
road on the map it's showing me a full
4g LTE coverage and all that I have
never once gotten an LTE signal I don't
get t mobile signal period you standing
outside the only bad did she even say
that yeah so I don't know ya know it
less done to me means that the map is
almost useless because if you can't rely
on it and yeah but I do love the idea if
it was to tell the truth I think it's
something all carriers get benefit from
and should
you know mimic let's put it this way
when when I do want to make a phone call
like let's say I've lost power or you
know since I use internet phones here if
my internet goes down I have to use my
cell phone to call my cable company to
get them to fix it I have to drive up to
the head of the road yeah a cell phone
signal that's insane yeah yeah when I'm
inside I you win the internets operator
i'm on Wi-Fi calling right but yeah if I
need to go off Wi-Fi calling I gotta
drive up to the end of the road right so
you know you can say that your map is yo
super accurate and all that I'm just one
use case that i can tell you you know
and the one thing that everybody should
know in general and t-mobile's fixing
this a little bit with new spectrum
rollouts but in general t-mobile signals
pretty bad indoors and so this map
wouldn't reflect that either I mean you
wouldn't be able to go to this map and
say hey I'm gonna have LTE in my home
because it's not necessarily true and
that's why they have the Wi-Fi routers
for fruitier the deposit yeah yeah which
I did pick up one of those routers you
know I called him and that's you know
been great it's a good router so i don't
know i just found an interesting yo that
because i was like oh let's go see what
they say about where i live that's all
totally not true haha yeah it's been
sorry but it's not true from some
chambeaux hall since we were speaking
about all these April Fool's jokes since
today is April Fool's Day was been each
of your favorite april fools jokes that
has gone on by tech company IE google
samsung etc honestly I find a lot of
them really weak yeah I don't like him I
mean you've got the okulu pets which is
yep what's really funny is hulu pets
happened and redbox did a pet box joke
so that shows how hard it is to come up
with a good April Fool's joke and
t-mobile did uh you know
undone carrier for pets so they really
yeah so I guess every okay so you've got
three companies that did pet jokes yeah
wow you know yeah I every year at
TechnoBuffalo we discussed do we why do
an April Fool's joke and it will toss
around a couple ideas and then we just
go you know what this just it feels too
forced yeah it does feel forced you know
and so that's why we die me we've always
come up with different ideas like you
technobuffalo is rebranding itself is
knitting Buffalo and it's going to be
all about knitting and one joke that was
tossed around this year was that we no
longer felt the Buffalo represented us
as the correct animal we were going to
go on a hunt for our new spirit animal
and by the end of the joke it we were
going to be called techno platypus you
know but at the end of the day it's just
like you know we we like to be taken
seriously yes we like to have fun but we
also like to be taken seriously and so
many of the jokes just feel forced yeah
of course I mean look I I guess it's
good for consumers are going out there
and stuff but it's also our job to write
the news and it's hard to write the news
when everybody's kind of joking yeah
yeah although I will say if Google Maps
wants to keep the pac-man feature
parties I'm all for that yeah you guys
I'm sorry you got to go to google maps
and on the lower left hand side there's
a pacman game it's like a level it turns
your streets into pac-man's greedy well
when I what I've been doing is making
myself go to towns where I know they
have really screwy streets haha you know
because like New York City don't fight
you're on a grid system right yes I'm
going on to all these places i have like
diagonals hahaha it's free me yeah you
should make that in half you know just
launched it so you could always play it
yeah exactly from brezin Franco related
to the to the pacman google maps thing
what was better last year's Pokemon maps
or this year's pack maps I think this
year's pack maps it's a little bit my i
love the polka maps but the pack maps
seems to be a little bit more
it appeals to everybody yeah Pokemon was
fun they're like looking around for them
but uh and people found them all right
this year yeah yeah well I found 150 of
them what I didn't know was that they
had a hidden one that wasn't on the
chart what and so I missed that on
getting 150 first that's awesome now I
don't know if you've seen this April
Fool's joke going around from Dominique
Webber m estas for phone best thing ever
I did see that this morning Microsoft
that one did make me chuckle yeah that's
that's true because it was kind of like
a throwback just like Amazon's homepage
I like that it's kind of like oh like
here's what look how far we've come home
most is the way I see that you go to
Amazon's homepage you're like holy
kallik that's what we saw in 1999 I know
and seeing with ms-dos for phone yeah
well here here's my question though is
where did Microsoft find three and a
half inch disks I don't know we have a
warehouse of them still I wonder if
anyone's pop them in what's actually on
there yeah I want you to because I what
was that they held three point four
megabytes yeah I want to go right into
pious numbers but it's 3 point something
yeah I care they were so small I i
remember when i used to buy like um like
Star Wars x-wing the video game it was
like now install now insert disc 18 yeah
that's like I used to flip flight sim
game on that on the floppy disks yeah
yeah you'd have to sit there and load
each disk to finally load the entire
game moving on to more general questions
and I'm I'm really fascinated by this
product from such Mahal what do you guys
think about the sous chrome bit I
thought always need I really want to
play with one but it's basically yeah
stick that has chrome OS loaded on it I
think it's prices like a hundred bucks
$99 coming later and then runs Chrome OS
when you plug it into like a monitor
you know so like that's the whole
computer which i think is really neat ya
know the i have' seuss's chromebox the i
think it was a hundred nineteen dollars
I don't remember how much it cost I've
got that hooked up to my my main
television so like you know if I want to
sit back and watch movie trailers or
whatever it's super easy for me to do
also maybe using a VPN I can sometimes
much other countries um but the idea of
it just being a stick really interests
me yeah it does just toss it your bag I
mean I'm kind of like do I need a
chromecast if I can have a full computer
it's a lot more but I didn't think about
that think about when you're in a hotel
yeah oh yes you'd have to carry a
bluetooth keyboard and just all these
days I mean I have a couple of portable
ones that I've bought all right I always
had this dream that I'm gonna use like
my phone or a tablet as my computer and
I've tried I just can't get there but
you know so these bluetooth keyboard see
work ya know I well I actually i use a
apple bluetooth keyboard for my chrome
box and because i said all the way
across the room i actually for the first
time ever i bought one of those mice
that's just the trackball on the siding
you move with your thumb oh yeah which I
now see why I've never bought one of
those before but it lets me set all the
way across the room so yeah that's nice
but uh no I'm very very interested by
the chrome bit i really want to try it
out when it comes out yeah i still need
to get a Chromebook um I don't know
people are saying was reading recently
there was another journalist saying you
know it's performed much better than
windows and OSX computers like much
faster I mean obviously it's
super-limited but that's compelling
because next to me I have a Windows 8.1
netbook that I've talked about on the
show is like 140 bucks but it does run
out of memory like all the time it'll
say like if I have too many tabs it
would be like running low on memory
which is annoying so I think I want to
try chrome OS and get that going have
you ever hooked coming up with hdmi to a
big screen I'm curious how it looks
uh yes I have it looked fine good yeah
we'll do it look fine the well my chrome
box is also it's hooked up via HDMI to
55 inch television well there you go
yeah it looks just fine works just fine
you know it I mean the only probably
like when you're seeing all the way
across the room sometimes you're like
what what's that say okay yes no you
need to blow up the text some sometimes
but uh no in general it works out great
yeah I now the also yesterday they
announced though and I I was on one
hundred percent clear on this is there
one Chromebook that is going to also be
converted to a tablet yeah I think so I
wasn't really sure on that either I
didn't dig deep Jacob wrote the post for
us right I I'm most attracted by the
prices one starts at 150 which i think
is among the lowest prices for a new one
that we've seen yet yeah i mean the tab
it's not much of a tablet interface so
i'm not sure that it would work very
well let me throw MOS in general i think
you still need a keyboard and mouse for
to make sense right yeah exactly uh from
brazen Franco who got the highest score
on pack maps and i can't believe i'm
using my data to watch the stream on the
train well thank you for being so
dedicated to the show yeah um I don't
know who got the highest map gade in my
area around me terribly two roads going
up and down throwing away what was going
to echo what was going up and down I
could get away from the coast no matter
where I went so I think it's somewhat
determined by how densely populated
getaway streets they are yeah exactly
exactly it took some get used to figure
out where okay if I go up this one I'll
show up down yeah weren't you come in
that was one of things i had and i have
a curved Road near me and as I was going
up it would hit like the arch of the
road and then stopped as if I was at a
corn
yeah hit the up arrow again yeah yeah
same happened to me because actually I
went over to Manchester England because
I knew there were some really crazy
streets there and so I was playing in
Manchester and I was I hit a circle
drive I was like oh oh man when I lived
in figs I lived on a cul-de-sac I should
see what happens with a call to see what
does happen there might just end like a
dead end yeah that could we're getting
way too oh good grief uh from such a
Mahal what apps do you guys rely on the
most for your day-to-day personal lives
and your work lives at TechnoBuffalo are
pretty simple um everything google for
work and personal using both on Android
and and on my iPhone so that's gmail we
use Google Docs long time so sheets and
stuff like that and then Twitter for
work feedly through work they follow all
the RSS feeds instagram for personal and
then facebook kind of tracking people
but my apps aren't that exciting um you
know and I've been playing two dots the
game which is really fun it's like a
puzzle game where you got to connect the
dots and that's that's pretty much my
day-to-day like my must-have apps I
think I'm a weather fanatic yeah I
always think I'm gonna be and i buy that
i buy them a lot but I never actually
used I only use the free ones but I
constantly am checking whether I don't
know why because I never go outside dark
skies be my fever but I got a new one on
the iphone um that says funny things
like based on your weather what's it
called it's uh it's got like series
voice it's called carrot five I guess
let's see if she says anything right now
are conditions that cloud looks like a
rhinoceros a gate says the cloud looks
like a rhinoceros I don't know it'sit's
tries to be funny but it's the three
blocks are whatever I paid for it but
but like you thi I all the google apps
you know Google Calendar Google Mail and
all that which i use on an iphone i know
it the
the the the joke is not lost on me yeah
what else trying to use a daily basis i
love them i use fantastical on my iphone
fantastical to and then i just wrote it
up for the site I haven't body yet they
gave us like a demo that actually ends
today but I've been using it non-stop
it's great as an awesome calendar app on
desktop in the iphone and yeah i can
write things like you know meeting at
five on april twenty third and it just
drops it in there so it's really easy to
do um but it's like 40 bucks i think
right now and then it's gonna be 50
bucks on the desktop so it's a little
expensive but yeah i've used no I've me
it looked really interesting but I just
I can't see paying that much for a
calendar app yeah yeah but I think it's
like it's a lot cheaper on the iphone
and it works just as well yeah um you
know I've actually started using a lot
of is and it's just such as simply as
the Apple notepad oh yeah I love the
fact it syncs across you know all my
devices yeah yeah so I always have all
my notes and fri man's as you know well
no Todd I love taking notes on yeah I oh
thank you and I've been using it for
years I've always used that Apple
notepad and I was with other journalists
and a dinner once and I said you know I
love this and they're like you trust
that like they've had I guess
experiences where they've lost
everything so they've since moved on to
Evernote and stuff like that but I've
never had a bad experience with notepad
my opinion I have any aunts not like I'm
keeping you state secrets in it right
right yeah from Dominique Weber just as
an idea for next year's April Fool's you
could do something like good mythical
morning did today where they dubbed
their entire video in Spanish for a site
like ours it'd have to be something like
klingon yeah i I just I i Wasi as you
know I want to see John speaking with
Klingon yeah that'd be hilarious yeah I
i will say that if you got over and look
at think eeks I haven't yet today but I
know every year they have some great
products that they've got some they've
got some real winners subscribe
they do every year I love the fact that
sometimes they become real products yeah
wasn't like the pixel tie once an April
Fool don't know if it was but they've
had products that were april fools and
people really want well i know the ipad
game cabinet started offices that's
right yeah yeah now last year you know
my love of nerf I want the nerf nuke
yeah to be real really bad but uh yeah
uh from tobor o or tobor zero can't
quite tell hi guys what's your thoughts
on the new Chromebook pixel too thanks I
don't believe either of us have got to
try it yet no I haven't seen it but like
the price is just so out there for what
it can do that you know I'm not really
interested in it and I know it's it's
probably not for me it's probably for
developers or you know enthusiasts who
really want the best hardware to go with
chrome OS but for me you know if I'm
spending that kind of money I need a
real computer you know at least go some
intel core processor and stuff like that
but and I know it has that but I just
don't feel like I'm taking advantage of
yeah exactly but maybe I mean the
thought that I was thinking is maybe
google i/o or later the later this year
maybe not during that that they're going
to announce new features for Chrome OS
that really take advantage of that power
I mean why I put that kind of power that
computer it's not really a glorified web
browser so yeah uh from brazen Franco
Chrome OS hdmi dongle raspberry pi 2
android hdmi dongle or newer laptop
who's the best option today to replace
my old notebook as a TV media center
whoo i am using raspberry pi um i'd say
anything with expandable storage because
you probably wanted unless you're
streaming it from somewhere else on your
home network but you probably be nice to
load it up with a lot of movies and
stuff it it's not always streaming yeah
i know that's a tough one because we
kinda need to know I are you gonna be
streaming from somewhere else do you
need local storage as we kinda need know
a little bit more
so otherwise I'd do it just get a roku
you know yeah exactly hey because as we
all know we love the rokador engine uh
from such humble hall and someone else
has to question somewhat related to this
so we will get to them just second from
such a ball when do you think the 1+2
will be announced when was the one plus
one was like June lasher's last summer
maybe this summer I really don't know
when it's going to be announced and I
don't know that they're on that kind of
product cycle and stuff like that so
we'll see but I'm most interested to see
whether or not one plus keeps the same
pricing model this time yeah yeah and
from rockster 103 related to the 1+2 do
you think that one plus we'll do a
better job of making their new phone
more available to people than they did
with the last phone um we can only hope
I don't know that they would because I
think their business model with the
oneplus one was to create a device and
then build it on super thin margins what
I mean by that is they're not making a
lot of money off of it and then while
selling it making sure that they're
actually getting rid of the products
they have so they're not sitting on you
know unsold phones because they can't
afford to do that so I think the whole
way they did the invitation system was
on purpose so that they were getting rid
of what they're building and making sure
that everything's sort of profit and I
would expect that they do that again
because I don't think you're sitting on
a boatload of cash yeah yeah I don't
know it's going to be interesting to see
what happens i would hope that it would
be more available but Todd raises all
excellent points also from Rockstar 103
do you guys think the gold i watch is a
better alternative to Rolex nope no I
think the Rolex name still has its base
well I think there's a couple things
here you know first off the Apple watch
relies completely on the iphone and so
well not completely but close enough so
the technology is going to get updated
you know
let's say we get to three years down the
road and you got a new iphone at that
time it may not work with the Apple
watch also the fact that it is just a
digital watch at the end of the day the
rolex brand name the Rolex work you know
craftsmanship all that that's what adds
up to the Rolex being valuable that's
not to say the craftsmanship and the
Apple watch is bad it's just it it's
almost like comparing apples and oranges
to be honest there are two very very
different products but you do see enough
where the Swiss watch market is reacting
tag you or announced they're making that
Android wear watch and stuff like that I
just feel like I mean a Rolex is
especially like a gold Rolex has sort of
been you know like that retirement gift
that people get then it's passed down
through families and i don't i don't
know but i don't see the apple watch
sort of being a family heirloom you know
yeah sure it'll always have value
because of the goldens in it but maybe
just to melt it down value no I don't
think it's yeah uh update from brazen
Frank on his question I need storage in
addition to my current Nass then you're
going to need to go with a laptop yeah
yeah Yuri regret well also a lot of
people have had success using Mac minis
as media centers yeah you might look
into that there's a lot of online guides
about turning because you don't even
have to get a current mac mini you can
go out and find a used one from a couple
generations ago and I've seen a lot of
people have success with that route
matter of fact we actually have an
article on on our site where a former
employee here turned a original apple TV
the big gray one into a media center for
like 40 bucks that's cool yeah so yeah
but you definitely need to do something
more than like an hdmi dongle it sounds
like oh let's see what else have we got
here oh that this is a could be a
hot-button topic here d from rocks or
103 do you think
the concept of one port on a laptop
brought upon by Apple will catch on I
don't know maybe eventually but I don't
it's not enough for me I mean it's hard
because when the macbook air launched we
were kind of thinking like oh there's no
CD drive remember DVD Drive and that
seemed like a big thing because we were
still relying on all that media and now
Apple's argument is that everything is
sort of wireless and cloud storage in
your streaming anyways you're not
attaching all these you know hard drives
and stuff because you could you know
you'll have not as network attached
storage and all that kind of stuff but I
still like the option to have more than
one core and without a bunch of
accessories and dongles exactly exactly
yeah i mean i'm sure it'll catch on i
well yeah I recently inherited one of
the older well not older but a year or
two ago macbook pros from the company
and I was so excited that I had to
displayport you know because I could
well I know I'm sorry has one display
port or doesn't have to i don't know i
was using one display born one hdmi but
the fact that you know now I could you
know do my three monitor setup you know
when i'm traveling if I'm mirror other
monitors man you know I had a USB hard
drive attached as well and I was using a
mouse and all that the idea of also
having to carry extra dongles now just
does not appeal to me yeah I mean if it
had USB type-c and maybe one other
either that one more or one more regular
USB or something i'd probably be sold on
it but yeah because I i'm sorry i don't
i like to use a physical mouse I'm I
I'll use a touch pad when I have to but
I prefer to use a physical males yeah in
the same way now I'd call me old-school
I don't care but uh oh my goodness from
know gaming what do you guys think of
the new gear vr g s6 s6 eversion and the
future of mobile VR I'm still not sure
that it needs to
list oh I think it's so cool I love the
the gear vr s really need um I don't use
it all that often but it's pretty it's
just stunning that this is your phone
sort of providing that experience and
the new version for the s6 s6 II I love
that they added support for the edge as
well and in addition to the s6 and then
they added on its own charging port so
you can go a little longer especially
galaxy s6 battery oh that's kind of me
so that's good and then the future I
think there's a lot of future with this
and I want to see where they keep going
samsung and oculus together but it's a
lot of fun one of the things I wish and
maybe I'm crazy is that you can get
notifications when you're wearing it's
like if you're watching a movie it'll
pop up and will say like you have a new
email and stuff it would be cool if you
could interact with that with your voice
or something you know yeah responds then
it brings up to email and they'll be
really deep even though we get on the
road well I think my big problems with
is the fact that the gear VR so far are
specific to certain phones mm-hmm you
know if i buy a gear VR I should be able
to drop any phone any samsung phone fine
there let's restrict it that much but I
should be able to drop any samsung phone
into I shouldn't have to buy oh I'm
sorry is this the gear VR for the note
for the note the game or for the ED it
would be good if it just had like
adapters to fit the phone sighs because
one of the things is it has to snap in
you know said you fits perfectly but
yeah right is that could all be handled
with adapters yeah yeah I just uh let's
see also for know gaming what do you
guys think about the surface 3 with it
running full windows it is on my watch
list the fact that it's running full
windows makes it a bit more intriguing
I'm compelled by it but again I it runs
on an intel atom chip which show does my
processor on my netbook here which is
140 bucks it has a real keyboard and not
to say the surface keyboard I don't know
I'm not crazy about the surface keyboard
but some people like it and it's you
know 140 bucks and not 500 hours but i
think that the surface 3 looks nice i
like the pen support stuff like that
just five hundred dollar see
so expensive to me for the process of
getting until Adam's not super powerful
but up you know power to them for
getting rid of windows RT that was awful
yeah now a Windows RT was horrific from
Dean Norbit what do you guys think about
Nvidia shield console about cloud gaming
errands crysis 3 um i am still not
convinced by cloud gaming hey you know
if you get the slightest bit of lag time
you know I matter of fact I just last
night I was playing destiny a pvp in the
crucible and I had a situation where I
shot a guy he didn't die he shot me I
died and then it registered my kill on
him that's annoying yeah and I had not
you know it wasn't a post-mortem you
know for those of you that play destiny
you know sometimes with her grenade you
can kill someone after you died it
wasn't post-mortem kill it just simply
finally registered my killing of him hmm
you know and so that still tells me that
even now they're still situations with
cloud gaming if you're playing like a
platformer which can you know takes
precise jumps and things like that i'm
just still not convinced by cloud gaming
until internet speeds get up to being
faster see I've use the shield tablet
which you know it's running the same
cloud gaming platform and it works
really well but I do have a really nice
netgear Nighthawk x6 router which it's
not cheap and then I pay for pretty good
internet speeds at home so if you're if
you have the equipment that supports it
it runs pretty well but otherwise yeah I
think you run into you might run into
lag issues and stuff like that but in my
experience with the nvidia shields cloud
gaming haven't really run into any
problems that yeah and I yes I also know
that internet speeds aren't to be all
end all when it comes it's more about
ping but still you know internet speeds
do factor in as well right
we've got time for just one or two more
questions here to do from Benjamin
McDonald I'm buying a moto 360 what apps
do you recommend for Android wear I
haven't used android wear in quite a
while actually so I'm not sure my
favorite inside an app it's the watch
face it's like google street art one I
really like it's I guess famous artists
or something i have created street art
and just pops up different backgrounds
they change throughout the day that's
probably my favorite one the one I
always install first I don't really use
that many apps on it there's some good
weather once and stuff because I'm
always afraid battery life kind of
drains quickly when you load up some of
them so I usually just stick to the
notifications and i'm getting from my
phone and then just you know the
different wallpapers watch faces if you
look okay all right a brazen i I'm read
all your questions and their way over Rs
on some of the computer stuff I
apologize for that but that's just if
Joey was on this week's episode he
probably could answer a lot of these uh
