TechnoBuffalo here this is gonna be a
bit of an old-school on-the-fly unboxing
I've got the iPad keyboard dock were
here I'm actually on my way to a course
and I needed to take notes so we're
actually unboxing it live in my car at
the end of this I'll attach a video of a
demonstration showing you how it works
but for right now I need this thing
tonight which means I need to open it so
I didn't think I could open something
like this without sharing it with you so
we'll take a look at the package you've
got a picture of the keyboard on the
front there's a dock sort of below the
iPad which you can't see iPad keyboard
dock on the back there's a little bit of
a better picture of it and this is going
to cost you 69 bucks no idea that is
going to be useful or worthwhile or if I
just threw 70 bucks away but at least if
I wasted money hopefully I'll prevent
you from doing the same although maybe
it will be worthwhile and go ahead and
open it up and I don't have the big ol
knife here instead we're gonna have to
use a key let's go ahead and dig in at
least trying to get into one hand just
want to hand it unboxing is harder than
it looks I got a new respect for people
I can do that broke the seal so to speak
you can already see the comments
unboxing fail alright peeling off the
plastic or at least attempting to with
one hand recording this just with the
iPhone 3GS alright so let's go ahead and
open this up looks like it just opened I
don't know if they even included cable
in here or not it doesn't look like they
do which just the keyboard which i think
is the same size as the Apple wireless
keyboard and some documentation it's
it's much heavier than you think it
would be ah let's take a look at the
keyboard because there are some actually
iPad specific applications here I
believe that takes you to the home
screen
I believe that pulls up the spotlight
feature and brightness if that launches
pictures that probably pulls up the
on-screen keyboard that button does
absolutely nothing and you got your
music control the volume control looks
like a lock button as well
and then your keyboard I take notes
oftentimes out just in pages having a
full keyboard would be quite nice I've
been bringing my Bluetooth keyboard with
me because the iPad will pair with any
Bluetooth keyboard but propping it up
should be a little bit better option
although another way to go just to pick
up the iPod iPad dock and use a
Bluetooth keyboard or just sort of prop
it up yourself or don't prop it up at
all
but this is what this looks like in stay
tuned after the video for a
demonstration how this works and showing
you what everything does let's continue
the tour you've got the back support to
support the iPad it's pretty sturdy
metal there is your 30 pin count for the
iPad sits in on the back you've got a 30
pin pass-throughs you can charge it or
sync it or whatever and you have a
second audio line out so you can hook up
your music bottom of it there's sort of
a view it's got some feet and the Apple
logo which you probably can't see
through the shadow and show you the
thinness about the same thickness as the
regular Apple wired or wireless keyboard
and we guys I'm John writing from
TechnoBuffalo with this super old-school
probably really shaky unboxing of the
iPad keyboard all right guys I will see
you in the next video and also one point
of notice it looks like it this draws
all the power from the iPad no spot for
four batteries you know something I was
wondering about anyway john Retton jerk
TechnoBuffalo see you next video
alright guys so that's promised here's a
less blurry cam look at the keyboard
dock for the iPad at first blush it
looks almost identical to the wireless
keyboard that comes with the IMAX you
can pick up for any other Bluetooth Mac
you have however we've got this giant
dock behind it which certainly makes it
look a bit different as a size
comparison if you put the - surabaya
next to each other you'll see that
they're almost exactly the same size the
few differences other than the jetting
out dock at the back here are some of
the keys across the top you don't have
function keys so there is not a function
button down here as there is on the
standard keyboard but there are some
unique functionality of the keys up top
here so this button right here is the
same as pushing the home button on your
iPad a button for universal search
control the brightness pictures to bring
up the on-screen keyboard that does
nothing all your music controls
fast-forward rewind pause and play
you've got volume so you've got mute up
and down and then a button that locks it
oh that's a keyboard and typing on a
technique experience is exactly the same
as the typing experience on any of the
other Apple Bluetooth keyboards let me
go ahead and pop this in give you a bit
of an example as to what it looks like
and how it works
goes and slides right in most of all
actually the hardest things about the
doc is getting it to actually go into
the doc can be a bit difficult so I
think that we've got it in there now
check it out okay so we've got it now in
the doc nicely positioned go ahead and
move the camera up a bit so you can see
the screen and see what happens
so typing on this is very easy it's a
great conjunction to have with a program
like pages for example and go ahead and
open it up and you go ahead and start
typing any document you'd like or a
paper anything that you needed to work
with as far as spreadsheets it's a great
program and it's a nice combination
actually when I when I go to class and I
starts I writing papers this is exactly
what I use so here's a paper that
actually wrote on the iPad it was just
about two and a half three pages and you
can open up Word documents and export as
Word documents and you can do it and
actually very easily and this does have
full spellcheck so you can go ahead and
check them type all I've to admit is a
bit weird to always be touching the
screen it'd be great to set some sort of
mouth support but it's not bad if you're
traveling or if you're in school the
combination of the iPad of the keyboard
is really nice for up for notating
especially if you want something a
little bit lighter and a bit less
expensive than a full-size laptop this
is a very good option you get a full
full size keyboard it is gonna run me at
70 bucks let's go over some of the
keystrokes and show you what they do
move the camera up a little bit so you
can see so if I'm open in any program so
let's say I'm in Twitter if ik here hit
this button upper left which is the home
button this is same as hitting the home
button on the iPad I've got a button
here take your break universal search go
ahead hit the home button again to the
left and right brightness but just like
it would on your Mac
you've got a button that launches that
picture slideshow go ahead and launch
that and they're going with pictures
it's one of my dad next button pulls up
the on-screen keyboard and the place
where it's relevant so if I'm sailing
Twitter and I want to post new tweets
and go ahead and compose one now if I
didn't have the dock right here the
on-screen keyboard would come up
automatically but it's not and I can go
ahead and start typing but if I want the
owner to be keyboard - come on as well
go and hit that button and it pops up I
was a bit worried when I got this there
was going to get delay between testing a
letter and when it showed up on the
screen actually shows up just as quickly
as it does on any computer almost
instantaneously it's quite nice so go
ahead and hit close there I don't want
to send that gibberish s tweet the next
button does nothing you've got your
volume controls the music playback will
work just as you'd expect if you got
iTunes running or a song or a video you
can go ahead and pause and play the
volume works pretty much as you'd expect
as well you don't get the sort of
beeping noise that you get when you're
just a volume on your Mac but you do get
two nice visual representation and last
is the lock button which will lock it
and any button will actually wake this
up when it's locked so I don't have to
hit the home button to unlock it I can't
go ahead and push any button and the
screen comes to life I don't have to do
the lock screen slide to unlock overall
I've been very very happy with the
keyboard although I do want to use it
for a little bit more to do a full
review and see if it really isn't useful
as I think it's going to be it's
definitely stay tuned and stick around
