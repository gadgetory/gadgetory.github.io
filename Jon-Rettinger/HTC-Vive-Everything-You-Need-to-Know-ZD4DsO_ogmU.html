TechnoBuffalo and at the end of last
week we got the new HTC vive and to give
it a shot try it out and see what's up
so first off obviously was the setup and
unboxing and I gotta say this is not a
plug-and-play system Andrew and Niven
and Ralph's for the three people who set
it up Friday evening after work and
there was a lot of trouble they had
setting it up one sensor would sync up
while the other would unsink and then
the same thing happened with remotes
there was a lot of troubleshooting he
took them about three hours total so
this is definitely not for your average
consumer moving on you're gonna have
concerns about space when we first set
us up we did it in our editing Bay which
is a normal sized room with a couple
tables and a TV but you're gonna need
more space than that and the space is
gonna have to be empty you're gonna need
about 5 to 15 feet of separation between
both sensors so we had to end up moving
outside and speaking of space they're
also gonna need to have your PC tethered
so just bear that in mind you're gonna
have to move your computer into the same
room as your VR set and it can't just be
any old computer you're gonna need a
very high-end PC here are the specs
required and for Apple users you are
going to be out of luck because steamvr
is not yet available on Mac sorry but
the real question is was it worth it
after all this drama and before I
explain my experience I gotta say I was
very skeptical before using the vibe
because I've used some other VR headsets
and the low quality build really ruins
the experience but this is what makes
the vibe so different there's very very
little light leak it works extremely
well there's a little bit of blurring or
on sort of the edges of your vision but
once you're in it once you spend about 1
or 2 minutes you really get immersed in
the world there's no real way to explain
it it's just something you have to feel
for yourself I got to try out a variety
of games from being in an office and
making VR coffee to sort of flying
through space and creating many moons
and then heating up and burning them as
well as saw some metal ribs off I think
I'll keep my slicing and cutting skills
to the Timeline not necessarily
someone's organs it didn't go so well
the best thing I can probably say about
using the vibe is that it's built and
designed so well that after probably 10
minutes 5 minutes even less maybe of
using it you just forget that it's there
you just sort of blend into the experi
the remotes the tracking it's all so
fluid the screen looks super sharp for
the most part especially compared to
other VR headsets it's really a
pleasurable experience and probably the
biggest highlight for HTC here that
really differentiates them from someone
like oculus who uses the Xbox controller
they use two hand remotes and I love
this where an Xbox controller might be a
little more intuitive for traditional
gamers these two remotes make it so that
you just feel like you have hands and it
just makes it really natural to interact
with the world in front of you once
you're in the VR space picking up coffee
mugs typing on keyboard answering the
phone
moving the moon might not be so natural
but it feels good once you figure it out
and the last thing I was really
concerned about before using the vibe
was comfort you're wearing a pretty
heavy headset for 3045 minutes an hour
maybe if you're a crazy game run longer
than that but the weight is distributed
really well here and it's not strenuous
on your neck at all and so those are
kind of my thoughts on the HTC vive this
is my first experience using this high
end of a VR headset or the highest end
available right now and I think HTC did
a great job as well as valve with
steamvr it's very well thought-out you
can clearly see they put a lot of time
and effort into the UI those tutorials
are great very fluid experience the only
hiccups that we had were really game
sort of crashing once or twice but this
is to be expected with such a new tech
let me know what do you guys think in
the comments below are you excited about
VR what's your opinion on the VR as a
whole as an industry do you think it's
gonna stick or is it gonna be something
like 3d where we see it go in a year or
two this was being pushed by companies
give us a thumbs up if you like this
video subscribe to our channel because
we're gonna be doing a state of VR video
pretty soon more comparisons all that
good stuff that we cannot wait to show
with you guys thank you so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
