hanging from TechnoBuffalo and today
we'll be giving you guys our full review
on this guy this is the Verizon
exclusive Motorola Droid turbo it's got
a humongous 3900 milliamp battery and
it's running some of the finest motorola
features such as moto display and moto
assist I've used it for about 10 days 11
if you count today and I really really
like it the new Moto X which we reviewed
a while back could have a Motorola's
best devices here until these devices
showed up the Droid turbo and the Nexus
6 the Droid turbo features a 5.2 inch
screen with a qHD 2560 by 1440 display
which looks absolutely gorgeous and has
a pixel density of 565 PPI inside it's
packin a 2.7 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 805 processor with three
gigabytes of RAM 32 or 64 gigabyte of
non-expandable storage a huge three
thousand nine hundred million battery
which will definitely talk about later
in a video a 21 megapixel camera with
dual LED flash that's capable of
recording 4k videos and a 2 megapixel
shooter in the front that's capable
recording 1080p videos it's running
Android 4.4.4 kitkat out of the box but
we'll for sure see Android lollipop in a
future now with those specs it's no
surprise to draw a turbo is an absolute
monster the quad-core Snapdragon 805
processor choose 3d graphic intensive
games with ease and the three gigabytes
of RAM keeps everything running at peak
performance apps open up quickly and
browsing the web is super fast
lag is literally non-existent on this
device no matter if you're watching
Netflix or simply just scrolling through
the home screen the joy turbos 5.2 inch
screen is a comfortable middle ground
between reasonable and hand-making
phablet monster like the Nexus 6 a few
years back a screen bigger than five
inches seemed massive but we've become
accustomed to the larger display and the
tour before me is the perfect size the
turbo's 2k AMOLED display is beautiful
the colors are vivid and viewing angles
are great and the slightly elongated
bottom bezel makes it pretty comfortable
to hold while using the turbo for longer
periods of time right below that
beautiful 2k display Motorola tucked
away a dedicated capacitive keys instead
of using on-screen navigation and that's
not really a big deal for me I usually
want as much screen real estate as
possible on any Android device but I can
also understand the appeal of always
knowing where to
to get back to the homescreen overall I
really like adroit or Bose design which
comes in a few different flavors the
first one is the familiar fiberglass
we've we've seen on droid devices in the
past and the one we have here is the 64
gigabyte droid turbo covered in
ballistic nylon which feels really
rugged and very grippy and the Droid
turbo is much thicker than the devices
that came out recently like the Moto X
the iPhone 6 plus and the Galaxy Note 4
but nonetheless it's not something
you're really gonna notice on a daily
basis bulky doesn't necessarily mean I'm
comfortable and I would rather have a
slightly bulkier phone with a bigger
battery than a thin phone they couldn't
last through the day while the screen
and overall design is solid I was a
little disappointed by the speaker
there's only one front facing speaker
that rests on the top of the device and
it doesn't sound as filling nor as good
as something like the HTC One m8 nor the
Nexus 6 which both features from facing
speakers compared to something like the
Moto X which also sports one front
facing speaker at the top I found that
the Moto X sounded just a tad bit better
but what really makes a turbo shine is a
software inside you're going to find
Android 4.4.4 kitkat and it's near
carbon copy of the Moto X meaning you
get a lot of the awesome motor oil
exclusive features or just a motor
display which lets you quickly glance at
notifications and the time without
waking your phone
there's also motive voice where you can
prompt Google now without touching your
device moto assist and Moto action are
here as well with actions you can ignore
a phone call by waving your hand over
the phone and would assist it'll
basically change your phone's behavior
based on the time of day whether you're
in a meeting or just go into bed there's
also this feature called a sensitive
display where your screen won't dim or
go to sleep as long as you're looking at
it the turbo also features a cool way to
unlock your phone if you have a trusted
Bluetooth device all which makes a droid
turbo ru really powerful device now
talking about the camera the droid turbo
packs a huge 21 megapixel camera on the
back and even though it doesn't have oh
is it still produces excellent results
it holds up really well compared to the
g3 and note 4 though comparing it to the
new Moto X it was just a bit better
color seems to be more natural and
there's less noise in the image which is
great in daytime and indoors photos are
sharp and have an extra punch to them
and in low-light condition it's a bit of
a hit and miss you'll find noise and
grain throughout some of the shots but
nothing too crazy I did notice that the
shutter is a bit slow compared to the g3
in note 4 and I'm not sure whether that
can be fixed to reheat software update
as of now there's really not much to do
in terms of tweaking the camera the
cameras UI is pretty minimalistic
there's only so much you can turn on and
off to make the camera better but in
terms of video you'll be able to record
4k videos 1080p videos and slow-motion
720p though now having OIS is a pretty
big deal when it comes to recording
videos and that's where the turbo really
falls short and last but not least let's
talk a bit about the battery life the
droid turbo promises up to 48 hours of
battery life and after using it for
about a week or so I'm pretty impressed
with casual use I didn't have to charge
my phone for 2 to 3 days but once I put
it to its test I would average about a
day and a half that's not quite
incredible 48 hours Motorola was
promising but it holds up well even with
intensive use and since the turbo
supports Motorola sort of a charger you
can charge the phone up super quick I
got the phone from 3% to 30 something
percent in about 15 minutes which isn't
bad at all that 30-something percent
should last you a good couple of hours
so to wrap things there for you guys the
Droid turbo is a well-built phone it has
beefy specs a beautiful display and
would Motorola software on top of stock
Android it makes for a great user
experience but not only that it should
receive Android lollipop it into your
future if you're deciding between this
or something like the Moto X I'd give
the edge to joy turbo just because of
its 2k display and awesome battery life
I'm giving the Motorola Droid turbo a
TechnoBuffalo score of 9 out of 10
