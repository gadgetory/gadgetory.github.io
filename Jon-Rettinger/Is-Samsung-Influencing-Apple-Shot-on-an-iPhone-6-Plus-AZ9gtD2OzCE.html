to you by ting mobile that makes sense
what's up everyone walk back their
pursuit of Rhett enters refuse to show
where I talk about any hits going on
where the technology and sometimes a
little bit outside this episode is being
filmed entirely on an iphone 6 plus
audio though it was going to our Canon
c100 will be color graded but the camera
is being used again is the 6 plus and
speaking of the six plus sole topic of
this video is what the six plus exist if
it wasn't for samsung let's go and get
started the story of Apple and Samsung
is a long storied one Samsung was a
component maker Babel and they were
friends and all was right with the world
then Samsung started getting a little
more serious about phones they started
making different phones bigger phones
and they became a little bit of the
frenemies so to speak although i would
like to argue that Apple and Samsung
have benefited because of each other
before everybody gets all upset at me
with Android and iOS Wars let me just
explain myself a little bit first I can
pretty much unequivocally say the six
plus wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the
Galaxy Note line of phones let's flush
back real quickly to 2011 we're at IFA
Samsung gotten state introduced a 5.3
inch foam which at the time was
ridiculous the iphone 4s was the Apple
phone that was out with a 3.5 inch
screen you're going from 3.5 to 5.3 is a
gigantic jump I remember being there at
the press event for Galaxy Note thinking
this is who's gonna use a film this big
then I played with it they put in my
pocket solid fit and i was like huh i
could definitely use a phone this big
and I remember using it and at the time
there's been famous quotes from steve
jobs that have said nobody would use a
big phone phones only HB as big as your
thumb can reach all that kind of stuff
but things change times change opinions
change what you said something what one
point isn't always what your thoughts
are going to be years and years later so
Apple would have gone a bigger phones
anyway the industry was just going that
way I think we would have seen the 4.7
inch phone that we have right now but
the Galaxy Note line really ushered in
the larger screen phones
we have now in the marketplace I got the
5.5 inch g3 you got the one plus one at
5.5 you've got just a larger device or
becoming mainstream the clay accepted
you look at what Dell had a few years
back the dell street that was really the
first giant phone it was i've met with
just a gas from people thinking what is
this thing it's an abomination i used it
even the time it felt too big for me and
now it looks almost small by today's
standards so Samsung definitely pushed
the industry forward an apple and
samsung definitely need each other so
first Samsung lost the case they used
apples R&amp;amp;D well the agree they don't
agree that they did but they did from a
business standpoint was very interesting
Apple spent millions and millions
emailing they're probably billions on
rnjean that led to the initial iPhone
iPhone everything that came after an
iphone 3g 3gs 4 4 s 5 and serve all the
way on up just tons and tons of money an
apple had to offset that cost and that
went to the consumer and the cost of
devices to an apple devices are
expensive you probably got a mobile
phone in your pocket you're also
probably over paying for it let me tell
you about Tang with 10 you aren't forced
to pick a plan based on what you think
you're going to use each month you've
actually picked what you actually use
each month which means there's way less
waste you simply pay for the service
that you're going to use you can leave
the service whenever you want with no
fees at all there aren't any hidden
admin fees or weird sketchy charges you
don't know what they mean but random
surcharges ting bills are simple to
understand and they only charge you for
your usage but six up bucks per device
plus taxes depending on where you are in
the end of the day we're just overpaying
for our cell phones look at your next
cell phone bill I challenge you and see
if you understand every single line item
you are charged for it is impossible to
understand a try and call them get an
answer in your stuck on an endless loop
of transfers and automated lady telling
you to press 4 if you're ready to get
started use promo code TechnoBuffalo
ting calm and save 25 bucks on your
device purchase or get $25 and ting
service credit towards your monthly bill
give it a shot you won't regret it
Samsung took that R&amp;amp;D leaves large
portions are indeed this has been sort
of determined by courts and they put
into their phone they didn't have to
spend the millions and millions and
possibly billions of dollars to Farrar
md so he would make the phones less
expensive which means they're able to
innovate I think a little bit quicker
than a competition so they took
touchscreen technology took on screen
keyboard algorithms I took a lot of
things that Apple it had and put into
the device that serve made them great
and made them sort of have a much faster
adoption and really be seein any other
manufacturer before samsung had to pay a
huge fine but that fine still paled in
comparison they would have had to pay if
they did their own R&amp;amp;D being their own
R&amp;amp;D would put their phones back years
and years and years so those two
companies have needed each other to get
where they're at and I think you can
only strive for greatness when you're
forced to compete I think competition is
great for the consumers taking aside the
argument of iOS or Android and on a side
note why should someone's choice of
phones define who they are and why
should you care what phone somebody else
has that's just a side to riffy note
there but I want unequivocally say that
we would not have a phone as large as
the 6 plus it wasn't for samsung it
makes me wonder if steve jobs are still
running Apple would reverse the stance
in saying that nobody wants big phones
what do you've said ok I see the
industry's changing let's adapt to
change with it I really would have been
very curiously oh it happened and aside
from that would even prove that camera
hump on the 6 and 6 plus i don't know
but i will say and i'm going the record
to say that samsung was the reason we
have big phones right now whether it's
Apple whether it's LG or anyone else we
can thank samsung for that with your
Samsung fan or not they push industry
forward thank you guys for watching hope
