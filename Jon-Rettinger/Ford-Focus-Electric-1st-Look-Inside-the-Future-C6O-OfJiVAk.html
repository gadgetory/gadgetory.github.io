inside a Ford Focus Electric with Chad
Darcy chad is thee on the Focus Electric
marketing manager tell me about the
lithium-ion battery the lithium-ion
batteries that next generation of
battery and so what it allows us to do
is it's less weight right it takes up
less space because of that way you can
kind of shrink better a little bit but
one of the big things is you can
continue to plug it in nightly and you
don't see that range degradation that
you would on an older style batteries
okay how about a kilowatt hours the
battery is 23 kilowatt hours okay for
total capacity and charging time what is
it three to four hours act on a low to
charging system like the one we have out
there the Levittown branded one it's
three to four hours and we have a 6.6
kilowatt onboard charger that allows us
to do that that's about half a time of
our closest competition very cool and
then that battery allows this card to go
80 up to 80 miles an hour and a little
over 80 miles an hour it is a little
over 80 miles an hour okay and you get a
hundred percent torque at zero miles and
hours you get that instant as soon as I
gers pounds right out of the stoplight
correct one of the things that we really
like about this vehicle is the fact that
we did build this off the base focus
platform so the driving dynamics of this
car are unlike other electric vehicles
out there is a very highly tuned vehicle
and do you have rejected regenerative
braking as you do in the c-max and the
heat dissipation course okay we over the
years we've been able to refine it to
the point that you can capture on the
Focus Electric and capture up to ninety
five percent of that kinetic energy that
you would have lost in a non
regenerative braking vehicle wow that is
a lot yes it's great and all that does
it just helps you give
arranged because that goes back into the
battery isn't and this car is even
greener it takes it a step further and
we'll talk about the recycled material
in the interior yes so there's a lot of
recycled material in the interior now
this one happens to have leather but on
our cloth seating fabric that is made of
100-percent post-industrial and
post-consumer content made by a company
called unify and their brand of fabric
is reprieve in addition to that fabric
we have on a standard in all focus and
focus electric the seats are made out of
soy cushion foam we've got recycled
denim in there we noticed when folks
were buying electric potluck five
vehicles that they were going for the
high trim series and the higher options
so in a Focus Electric we came out with
one trim level and we put everything
into there we could in fact the only
option on this vehicle is leather
seating so it's not just the seeds it's
not just the faculty lucky people we've
done a lot to make the car green inside
and out in fact the water bottles that
we are using today at this press event
are actually going to be used for a
future ford focus electric interior and
that's pretty cool tell me about the
charging station and the merge with best
buy on that we have partnered with best
buy inner geek geek squad to help
introduce the charging station
installation process to the customer and
the reason we wanted to do that is
people trust the brand name of best buy
and geek squad the the average price for
an installation is going to be 1499 and
that's leadership in terms of its class
of all-electric vehicles 1000 499 1499
Ford Focus Electric with the Eco
material interior price after the tax
incentive 32 for 95 in this vehicle as I
mentioned earlier it has one trim level
and we highly content this vehicle so
comes with everything from premium so
many audio to the my for mobile phone
and web site application myford touch
sink the activate voice control features
it's got rain sensing wipers so it's got
everything on the vehicle that you could
want Smackdown Ford Focus Electric
versus the Nissan Leaf how do we know
that question was coming well one of our
big key features right now is the fact
that we can charge in half the time and
so you think about what takes for an
average consumer in their daily
lifestyle and how much further they can
go that's a very big point in the course
do we think about the premium audio that
we have in there in the premium
electronics that we have miles per
gallon equivalent versus the leaf we are
the first five passenger vehicle to
achieve 100 or better MPG and so that's
definitely a story for Ford Focus
Electric as well as you have a solar
program where you can have a solar panel
installed in your house so the Sun power
program which we term drab green for
life is actually a vehicle offset so it
will feed power through solar panels
into your input at the house or into the
grid age that you have done to and it's
there to provide the offset for what you
use in before focusing on easier very so
it doesn't directly feed the vehicle but
it offsets that energy that you're using
ok and the last thing is you have a an
application phone application for
Android and
iOS yep and blackberries okay I'm
blackberries and this basically allows
you to charge remotely so you can do
some of that get through the application
not only that you can find your vehicle
through the application through a GPS
tracking and you can find charging
station correct you could check all your
stats and compare how you're breaking
and you have a break there's a breaking
score yeah it tells you how well you do
with your regenerative braking we want
the consumers to feel that they're very
involved with the vehicle at eisenmann
is if you makes me feel connected so I
mean you you can have your breaking
stories you also just shows you how much
money you save for gas how much carbon
dioxide emissions you say you can share
all of your results through social media
on various places including Twitter and
Facebook so we've put a lot of thought
into you can rub it into your friends
bases and I got better miles per gallon
equivalent in you my breaking scores
better than you Chad thanks so much
thank you very much all right
