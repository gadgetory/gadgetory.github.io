what's up everybody and I just woke up
getting ready to go to CES today out in
Las Vegas and before I could do anything
I mean I stole my robot I haven't even
put my hood up to keep my keep my bald
head one there we go it's a little
better it's chilly out here in Northern
California before I could even do
anything doorbell rang and it was the
UPS delivery person with something from
Tom bin up in Seattle and check this out
this pretty cool it's a carbon-neutral
shipment I wonder what's in it I wonder
if I might need it before i go to CES
let's find out
alright so here is the box Tom been up
in Seattle made in the USA to make a
bunch of bags and I've had some of their
stuff before and it's generally really
good stuff they were kind enough to ship
me out their new macbook air 11 inch
laptop bag called a restrepo because
look at that I've got an 11 inch macbook
air to take with me to CES my new
company computer so thin so light I
really thought voiceless ah you can
check out the unboxing video did that
separately but anyway thank you to the
folks up at Tom bin you know who you are
appreciate it not saying this bag is any
good because I haven't used it yet but I
am saying that I'm psyched to have it in
the bag we've got in the box rather
we've got an ultra suede screen cloth
which that might have been a throw-in
but maybe that will fit the laptop
little big for the laptop maybe let me
I'll take it with me and let's see we've
got another one it's a different color
yes different color and another one
another different colors and I'll they
throw in a little gear patch very cool
the 3d clear organizer cube nice it's
not expecting this i'll have to look
this up and see how much it costs but uh
oh it's like a little travel kit little
mini travel kit man they know how to
know how to get to hear a traveling
bloggers heart I like when I travel I
like to bring as little stuff as
possible but then I packed too much
stuff but then I like to you know keep
it into small thing as possible and this
cool you can hang that on your little
your hotel you know bathroom towel hook
or whatever keep your toiletries or I
suppose I could put my at my cables are
my gear and stuff in there also but
anyway here's the bag itself though oh
wait there's more there's all kinds of
crazy business in here they threw it a
bunch of little thanks Tom been a bunch
of little you know luggage tag some
other little stuff little pouches and
cases
a little carry strap because these all
have little D rings on them I am such a
sucker man but this is cool thank you
another luggage strap another little
case this one is a little like it is a
little a little mining or a little man
I'm not even getting to the house or
more ultra suede cloths in there I think
them get into the main the main business
here though that it is there more stuff
there's another no that's the original
and here's the the absolute shoulder
strap there this is an option with their
bags it's their top-of-the-line shoulder
strap extra padding when you're when
you're covering a trade show and you're
on your feet running around and then
this is the normal shoulder strap as
well you got the regular shoulder strap
and the absolute shoulder strap and when
you're covering a trade show with all
your gear walking around for three or
four days you know these little touches
make a big difference i'm going to zoom
back a little bit so we can see the bag
itself they sent me the green version
one thing if you're covered in these
shows actually you want to use the
handle as much as possible carry the bag
with the handle and not with the
shoulder strap if you can then anyway
here's the bag itself so on the inside
the 11-inch restrepo for macbook air on
the inside you've got a sleeve here
padding for the macbook air so we'll get
the computer it's amazing this is this
is my gear bag so much smaller than it
used to be and slides right in there and
then you get a little fold over and
you're protected now with the foam
padding excellent and then you've got
additional space here so what else do we
need to put in there let's put in the
where is it oh the camel coat I can't
put the camcorder in I'm filming on the
camcorder well this is my old camcorder
which is roughly the same size so this
will fit right in there or I think we
can put it right in front here no
problem because you've got all this area
in the front
and we've gotten a little got a little
tum bin things everywhere man then we'll
need a room for power brick so we will
include that as well cables all that
stuff we're not going to put them all in
now I'll show you later but you've got a
little zipper pocket on the inside here
for you no cables material with that
kind of thing we got more room inside
here you've got a opens area and then a
few little you know kind of a little
open pouch areas there where you can
little slots you can put in cables and
you know pens whatever else notebooks
and some I am an intrepid reporter
you've got another little open area in
here as well closes up a nice big thick
buckle they're adjustable on the back
you got your carry handle you've got a
little document area and then you've
also got another buckle so you can wear
this is like a fanny pack kind of thing
if you want or actually you know over
the shoulder with this cinched up around
your waist as well might not look
SuperDuper cool if you're into the whole
like you know not having last wraps
crisscrossing you whatever but actually
you put that weight on your on your hips
and your you know your lower back area
take some of it off your shoulders and
neck definitely a good deal and then
we'll hook up a strap nice thick heavy
materials metal and that's not going
anywhere that's enough so there you go
unbelievable this is my gear bag for the
show I'm taking it Tom bin thank you so
much for sending this out in time for me
to get it and maybe I'll feel a little
more show you from the airport once I'm
all packed up what this thing looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
