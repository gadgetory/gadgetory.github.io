to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rumor a tip
this show right take all the tech rumors
from the week and there were a few
decent ones this week and I picked the
three to four I think are the most
interesting craziest them definitely
probably should might come maybe happen
sometime in your future so last week we
got a look at the alleged xperia z3
Sony's flagship to follow up to the z2
obviously now it looks like the device
has already passed through the FCC
certification process the obviously
lte-enabled phone in question was
approved by the FCC on Tuesday with the
very sexy model number D 6603 suggesting
it could be in line for the next
powerful Android handset throne the FCC
filing does confirms a typical fare
including things we already expect like
bluetooth Wi-Fi GPS NFC radios IR
blaster an LTE connectivity it's a model
number though it really stands out to
make this unique the Xperia z1 was
listed as the d 5503 well Odie to was
the d6 503 the device just passed the
certification carries a d6 603 model
number which fits the pattern and
pointing upcoming xperia z3 launch I can
now forget those mile numbers that I
spent a very long time trying to
memorize the Xperia z3 face you're
wondering what it might have expected to
offer a faster Snapdragon 801 processor
3 gigabytes of RAM 16gb of internal
storage 20.7 megapixel camera which
should be thinking about it's not a
giant improvement over the z2 but hope
it's going to sports new features we
haven't seen yet or thicken though we
might see that the IFA trade show in
berlin coming to sep tember since makes
sense search on you might announce it of
course we're going to be there so if
they do we will know right away which
means you will right away to waterproof
not waterproof who knows i think Sony's
phones have really come a long way over
the past year and a half two years so
I'm really excited state does III has to
offer did you pick up and I'm Pat Eric's
you want the biggest ipad available I
got some bad news for you the folks
economic daily are saying we might see
that rumoured 12.9 inch iPad sooner than
we think the news outlet said Tuesday
that Apple is planning to launch it's
just dog antic tablet by the end of the
year bike
harrison apple's ipad mini case you're
wondering has 7.9 inch display while the
larger iPad air has a 9.7 inch green
apples larger iPads been rumored for
awhile it's been a staple here on the
show for close to a year details on it
are still super foggy at mystery it's
likely the device again impact some of
the same features expected on the next
gen ipad mini ipad air including the a
processor a touch ID likewise to the
tablet may take advantage of an iOS 8
feature that mail users to run to
applications side by side which we have
seen already been available on other
operations like windows and Samsung's
custom Android software december of last
shoot that report also just suggested
Apple might be testing 2k and 4k
displays a larger 12.9 and ipad apple
does love to surprise a little bit you
can slap at a fork in display on that
thing would be awesome but enjoy it
because man I should probably last like
four seconds the device so could
potentially cannibalize sales of apple's
macbook air depending on how it's priced
because it's unlike any other iPads
display would rival and exceed some of
the macbook air models already might
also service on the way for Apple to KH
enterprise users the education segment
and consumers but really want tablets
with just a larger displays I've been
going to Android either way though I'm
not putting much talking this one I
don't think it's going to happen i think
in 12 point IM typepad isn't testing it
probably exists for the rooms are coming
from but i think it'd be too expensive
and way too impractical i think we'll
see any fainting first a different
aspect ratio ipad but I do not think
we're gonna see this one come to market
but heck asked my wife I've been wrong
before itself the rumors for quick sec
to think the peeps at lynda.com we all
want to be better at something I wish
that I could play an instrument I wish I
had any musical ability for that matter

/ ekman Buffalo let's stick with Apple
here at the iWatch has been around for a
while the rumors have been served
on the show for probably the past two
years but until earlier in the week book
report suggested Apple was only working
on one or maybe two different-sized i
watch the devices for a single model
with all the same 2.5 inch display but
now report out of taiwan is claiming
apples actually building three different
models according to economic daily app
was building and i watch with a
one-point sixteenth display another one
with a 1.8 display and a third model
model they won put in his display made
out of a super indestructible sapphire
we're expected to see all three models
in a third quarter this year so
September to December which is not that
far away according to supply chain
sources it spoke to economic daily
report differs crazy from the rooter
story last month which suggested the
final i watched eyes look coming at 2.5
inches sapphire we've heard mentioned
several times before but apples Arizona
factory that's poorly building sapphire
displays for both the iWatch and the
upcoming iPhone 6 smoothly that a really
strong premium and they not be able to
make enough to make both phone and watch
so probably just glass on the iWatch
Apple's iWatch is expected according to
other rumors to make its debut in
October Paul the introduction of the 4.7
inch iphone 6 and fingers crossed a 5.5
inch iphone air in September when
analyst recently said she suggests Apple
will ship 60 million I watching and
stirring its first year after price
around 300 bucks so I don't make me go
buy some that cheaper Apple's talk what
