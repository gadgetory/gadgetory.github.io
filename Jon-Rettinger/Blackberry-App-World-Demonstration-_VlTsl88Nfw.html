distribution of applications has really
been a cash cow and really became
mainstream with the introduction of the
App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch
and since Apple released that and made
it public and let people start
developing applications for it other
cell phone vendors have sort of jumped
into the fray and this is a
demonstration of BlackBerry's app world
which is essentially their answer to the
App Store so to give you a demonstration
and this will run on any OS 4.2 or
higher so if you have a new BlackBerry
Bold or the new curve or the storm no
problem you can get this nice and easily
if you're running an older device make
sure you've upgraded to a four point or
higher and you can download the
BlackBerry App World it's not gonna come
on on during a firmware upgrade actually
have to go to a website and download it
and I'll put a link in the sidebars
where you have to go on your device to
download this application so let's turn
on the storm pin here we there there is
right there BlackBerry App World now one
thing I should mention is that while the
App Store for the iPhone is typed your
iTunes account the BlackBerry app world
is tied to a PayPal account so you're
gonna have to have a PayPal account if
you want to purchase any applications
although there are a ton of free apps so
let me show you what this looks like
this is essentially your home screen and
you can scroll through some featured
apps and we're just on an e video
connection here and it's broken up by
four icons across the bottom the first
one categories second one your top
downloads it's finally a search and then
my world which lists all your downloaded
applications so let's show you how this
works let's start with categories it's
broken up by entertainment games Maps
Navigation I'll let you guys read those
you can see it as we kind of go through
here but there are a lot of applications
quite a few and there are some very good
games and one of the applications that
you may have seen your friends play on
an iPhone or Windows mobile device
you'll be able to find here really is a
very full-featured app store and he's
growing everyday let's go back and walk
you through the rest of it you've got
your top downloads they'll tell you what
most of the people in the world are
downloading if there's a hot new game or
a cool new app
so Pandora is obviously a big one
slacker radio AP news and this is just
over a video so it can be a little bit
slow it's not Wi-Fi but you can see what
is there and let's say there's one that
you're interested in downloading let's
go back up to the top people love
Pandora so let's click on Pandora and
I'll show you what it looks like when
you click on an application so you get
out from to download it reviews
recommend get screenshots and there's a
little bit of an explanation below it
Pandora is a radio that's personalized
just for you a few icons across the
bottom here too you can download it you
can recommend it to a friend you can
read or write a review actually you can
only read reviews you can write a review
after you've downloaded the application
let's actually go through and show you
what that review screen looks like so I
always read reviews before I buy an out
there's what you guys to get a sense of
what this looks like you can see the
number of stars love this app this is a
great amazing you can go through and
read all those so we'll go back and
let's say that you want to download
Pandora so let's go ahead and hit
download and I'll show you what that
looks like as well so you can see that
it's downloading it's actually still
pretty quick over this EVDO Network know
what you guys to really see a lifetime
of how long you take download an app
well this is a very light non large
application small it probably better way
that's private so there you are it is
downloaded as soon as we get that to
here I'll show you where it is now it's
installing and in just a moment we will
be all done with the installation
process Pandora was installed
successfully
okay or run we'll just go ahead and hit
OK and let's go back to the store
so like I said you can view reviews you
can recommend it or you can check out
some screenshots in the application
itself so one thing that I mentioned
earlier that I should definitely keep in
mind and you should definitely keep in
mind as well is this is tied to a PayPal
account so you are gonna have to go to
PayPal comm set up an account if you
already have one if you were young
Rimmer you don't have access to a bank
account or credit card or debit card
that you can charge to the paypal
definitely gonna need your parents to
help you out this isn't just as easy as
putting in your itunes information
definitely something to keep in mind and
really there are a ton of applications a
lot for free and the lot that can cost
as much as five hundred dollars on here
oh it is interesting some of the
applications in the blackberry app world
are actually more expensive than you
would find in other app stores like
Apple's App Store or even Nokia's Ovi
Store so let me show you what the
application looks like and where it goes
and you download it so exit outta here
so I moved to the app world into the
homescreen otherwise when you download
it it'll show up in your downloads
folder which is now where all the games
are so we can go ahead and there's
Pandora go ahead and just open it up and
there you go don't show this again
continue now I am demoing this on the
storm which is a touchscreen but this is
also just as easy to use on a non
touchscreen device so let me show you
here is your blackberry curve 8900 and
I've got the BlackBerry app store here
up and running and then navigation is
just the same you just hope you use a
scroll ball instead of your finger nice
and simple and this is a running over an
edge network so this might be a little
bit slower than what we saw before but
not bad so we can go ahead and check out
some games arcade in action so love the
older kid games and I was kid and here
we go even just over edge and the Oregon
Trail fell
other than my favorite computer game for
the old Apple now you can go through and
see things are just the same as they
were on a storm albeit on a smaller non
touch screen screen but still very easy
to use actually really liked playing
around with BlackBerry App World there's
a lot of cool things in there that I
can't find in the Apple App Store maybe
because of restrictions or maybe this is
easier to develop for I'm not sure but
if you have a blackberry don't feel left
out you can get apps and this is a great
way to do it to get on your device
anyway I hope you enjoyed for exclusive
content
sure to follow me on Twitter twitter.com
select John for Lakers and what is your
experience with the BlackBerry App World
have you enjoyed you think it compares
to the other application stores out
there on other mobile platforms are you
using it give any tension of using it
I'm gonna go ahead and let me know in
the comments down below see you the next
one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
