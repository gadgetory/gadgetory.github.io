how's it going guys is John Q here from
TechnoBuffalo let me start off by saying
that I'm not an Apple fanboy but you can
label me one if you want to goodness
knows I've been labeled one for simply
using an Apple keyboard like the guy you
see back there what can I say people
like to label things as a user I think
Mac OS just seems to suit my needs
better but I recommend everyone out
there to not brand yourself to any
particular company or product because
those who do generally become a little
bit closed-minded have you ever met
anyone who swore their life to any
particular brand or product like say the
iPhone and if you were to ask them what
don't you like about the iPhone they'd
go all like hi they're gonna offend it
and give you the look of death yeah not
very happy campers mmm-hmm I use my
computer primarily for work and
sometimes play when I have the time I
work with as you guys probably would
have guessed with video as well as
graphics and it just so happens Mac OS
seems to excel in both of those
categories and I don't know if it's a
coincidence or not the Mac's seem to be
industry standard for both video and
graphics I recently purchased a MacBook
Pro maybe about two or three weeks ago I
don't have her with me right now I lent
it to my girlfriend but I did play with
it for maybe about 1 or 2 days and that
was enough to convince me that Mac's
they were the way to go one main reason
is Mac's are pretty and I know what
you're thinking man that's a stupid
reason
let me explain not only is the Hardware
drop-dead gorgeous but the software the
OS is equally as gorgeous if not more so
and as a graphics person you kind of
appreciate things like glossy icons and
you know where they animate and jump up
and down it's really cute another
designer graphic factor would be fonts
Mac's just happened to render fonts
beautifully and I know it's a really
small thing but I like typography and
where people get excited over
snapdragons and dual-core processors and
whatnot I get excited over pretty fonts
even with the new implementation of
ClearType for Windows 7 and Windows
Vista fonts still don't look as pretty
as I do on the Mac I don't think pretty
is the right word plus pretty doesn't
sound very manly I'm gonna replace
pretty with right fonts just don't look
right on the PC compared to the max
there we go if you want to get more and
with fonts here one of the default fonts
on Mac OS is Helvetica arguably the king
of all fonts where's Windows has the
slightly less fancy Arial as a Windows
user you can acquire Helvetica no
problem why am i complaining but if you
want to get it legally the entire font
family costs around I think $300 I'll
stick to Arial right now I have until I
get the Mac thank you
I'm cheap that way on to the serious
stuff these Darius work stuff these
serious video stuff mac OS has final cut
and final cutting will only run on Mac
OS legally and as a video person that's
enough said right there final cut has
become the primary video editor of
choice for many amateur and professional
video makers and this includes mr. John
4-leggers himself on TechnoBuffalo as
well as Matt from Matt's Macintosh also
from TechnoBuffalo he makes great videos
that guy he knows what he's doing props
to Matt BAM right there another huge
advantage of Final Cut studio would be
color color is a super advanced color
grading program so advanced it's
borderline magical color was known in
the industry as final touch and I was
bought by Apple in 2006 or 2006 I like
saying 2006 I don't know why final touch
is color corrective software that used
to retail for Believe It or Not fifteen
to twenty thousand dollars but now if
you get final cut studio you get color
for free mm-hmm as for graphics I use
the Adobe stuff and you always hear
things like programs just run better on
Macs or Macs are built for graphics
personally I haven't really noticed a
huge difference but if you do a quick
Google search you would see that some
people have I'm for me something I've
been missing out from windows would be
PC games but thankfully I don't play too
many games and the titles that I do play
such as left 4 dead 2 and Team Fortress
2 are now available on the Mac plus if
you're running a Mac and you ever miss
windows you can always run something
called parallel to run Windows on your
Mac talk about versatility one is huge
drawback on the Macs and pretty much
anything Apple would be the price do I
think it's a ripoff hell yes I do but I
guess you get what you pay for right and
as I've learned over the years it's not
the specs that count is the utilization
of the specs that counts and Apple they
seem to do it just fine and dandy so to
wrap things up I am NOT a computer geek
a heavy gamer or one to overclock things
I like the
playing simple elegant and beautiful I
work with videos and graphics and
appreciate little things like color and
fonts are max perfect no but at the same
time nothing really is it just works
best for me and that's how I recommend
you people approach purchasing and using
things especially if you're handing over
your hard-earned cash to a company that
probably doesn't care too much about you
but they care enough to want to know
everything about you this is John Q from
TechnoBuffalo
and I'm a PC but I'll be a Mac soon
enough see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
