to you by dice com welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalo this
to show you could ask me jon rettinger
any question you've got from the wide
world technology don't know what phone
to get can't make sense of all the
tablets out there don't know what
operating systems best for you this is
the place you can ask of this week on
ask the buffalo we're gonna talk all
about new phones what's coming out and
which one best suits you what it's like
to run a tech website if you fun things
in between this is asked to Buffalo
let's go and get started user gifted so
last hey john i'm looking to switch to
verizon in november and by that time
windows phone 8 will be out how do you
think the flagship devices such as HTC
windows phone 8x and Lumia 920 will
stack up against the iphone 5 outside of
app selection first I'm glad you put
that caveat outside of app selection is
huge the HTC 8x and Lumia 920 look
absolutely awesome and for very much the
same reasons bright colors pretty badass
Windows Phone 8 operating system I love
the live tiles I am really excited about
Windows Phone 8 when it comes to decide
between which one's right for you and
you know it's sort of six half dozen of
another they're both great choices if
you want a bigger screen Lumia 920 do
you want way more color choices HTC 8x
really they're both known for tremendous
build quality and their SPECT pretty
close to similar and so has the sack up
it gets the iphone 5 can't answer that
so i get the devices of my hands but i
will say that Windows Phone a stacked up
very nicely to previous versions of the
iphone so I'd expect Windows Phone 8 to
be no different Michael Austin asked hey
john i'm wondering whether i should buy
an unlock to note 2 or wait and buy it
for my carrier with LTE i live in canada
with bell and so that's a tough choice
with pros and cons you can always buy
devices unlocked usually weeks or months
before they come to your carrier that's
great to get the device assume you're
not stuck into a contract he didn't pay
a subsidy for the phone but generally
you are going to pay a huge premium for
it $200 phone on contract jenna is going
to retail unlocked for close to six
seven hundred dollars there's a huge
price difference especially in the US or
in canada
sometimes the phones you're importing
don't have support for LTE bands usually
actually almost always you now get hspa+
afford but you're not always going to
have LTE on board it's really gonna be
what's important to you if you've got
the cash to spare and you want the hot
phone right away buying unlock is
wonderful especially if you buy a
reputable retailer we put up a video
last week about fake galaxy s3 you
really want to make sure you're buying
from a reputable site so on the con side
of that again you're going to be paying
a lot of money you might not get support
from your carrier if the device breaks
you got to take it into a store you
can't just take it to your ATT store
your bell store or tell a store or
rogers whatever it might be to have them
fix it because they didn't get it for
you also you got to input something
that's called APN settings essentially
what APN settings do is they make the
phone phone data work with your cell
carrier you can pop it a sim card and
make phone calls no problem but funny
just data you have to be comfortable
going and putting in those settings
pretty easy to do do a quick google
search and usually can find step-by-step
instructions but if you're not
comfortable doing things like that then
you might want to stick for a carrier
phone for me I love getting my hands on
new devices but it can be quite
expensive one thing to consider buy a
device unlocked until it's coming out on
your carrier and so it usually only be
down maybe 100 200 bucks and you can
still get that support for the next
generation phone hopefully that helps
ant your question Freddy d ask John you
concerned about LG Nexus or Meiko being
made by LG if not explain why please i
want a magnificent device from them
personally so Freddie no I'm not really
concerned about it being made by LG and
I can know what you're talking about
some folks are concerned about LG's
build quality LG makes awesome displays
their displays are absolutely gorgeous
and I expect that to really be a
flagship point of the next Nexus Nexus
forever they decide to call it although
I'll reserve judgment till I get a
chance to see it but if other rumors
hold you sure that won't be the only
next device you can choose from rumors
of a 5-inch Nexus 5 are swirling around
like crazy we're also again that might
be three other Nexus version so if
you're looking for that pure Android
experience and those are devices i
really recommend because I do get
software upgrades wait a couple more
weeks looks like your prayers might be
answered let me take a quick moment to
thank our friends and sponsors at
dice.com if you've been itching to get
into the tech world but not sure how to

perfect job for you go to dice calm and

jobs that suit your qualifications HTML
night ask what are the pros and cons of
starting a tech review site so that's a
tough question other pros are certainly
if you love technology get a live your
dream you can play with the latest and
greatest devices in the minute they come
out sometimes even before they come out
and you get a help share your opinion it
get help determine devices success or
failures and you're helping people by
the right products so it can also be a
lot of cons as well from running a tech
site for example when we first tried to
launch the end of 2009 we had just a
little bit of money we launched the site
and then it crashed miserably within 45
seconds we got to go through and do
recoating and burn through all of our
startup capital to get it up and running
we did at the very end of 2009 early
2010 and that a couple months of anxiety
in there between the crash when we came
back up led to me having sleep anxiety
I've developed a huge sleep disorder so
there's a lot of stress that go into
running your own site whenever I say can
give is treat a site like a business I
treat it your readers like customers you
might not have a physical product to
give them but still have a supply chain
you want to make sure that from article
idea to article publication you're
running very smoothly like any business
identify bottlenecks and try and put out
the best product you can there are
really high barriers to entry at least
being successful anybody can of course
create a website it's very very crowded
out there so if you want to create a
website find a niche find something that
you do that's unique or something about
you that you can bring that nobody else
can hope you guys enjoy i'm your host
jon rettinger sure check us out at
technobuffalo calm for ladies and
greatest tech news see the next video
