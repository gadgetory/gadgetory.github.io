may remember me from the Voodoo video
series that went up on the john for
lakers youtube channel back a few months
ago recently John posted a video on his
thoughts and impressions on the kindle
DX which is Amazon's new e-book reader
with the larger screen size one of his
biggest points of contention with the
kindle DX was its price point a whopping
four hundred and eighty-nine dollars for
an e-book reader that doesn't even
include any books on it well i'd like to
present a different view on the price of
the kindle DX and try to explain why i
don't think that the price is too
unreasonable if you look at it a certain
way now to start IM a user of the kindle
just like John I'm an avid reader and I
read most of my books on Kindle now I
was an early adopter and I went with the
first generation kindle I paid three
hundred and ninety-nine dollars for it
which I did think was crazy at the time
and I haven't opted to go with the
second generation kindle because i just
don't see enough reason to upgrade you
know the screen refreshes faster on the
second generation battery left a little
better it's a little bit thinner but
that's not enough reason to make me want
to switch and I've always believed in
eBook readers I think just like
magazines and newspapers which are going
digital now books in the future will be
totally digital in 10-15 years everyone
will have an e-book reader whether it's
from amazon or sony or some other
competing company books are going
digital there's nothing you can do about
it it's going to happen so think about
the price of the kindle to write the
price of the kindle to is about three
hundred and sixty dollars and what do
you get with that well you get the
ability to save between ten and fifty
percent on books that you buy and if
you're an avid reader and you buy a book
a week that will probably allow the
kindle to pay for itself in about two
years if you're not an avid reader
you're probably paying for the
convenience of being able to download
ebooks wherever you are via the
whispernet service or to have all of
your books stored on a small device that
you can keep with you under your arm or
on your car seat or in your glove box or
take up take with you on vacation now
think about the kindle DX how much of a
premium price is there between the
kindle two and the kindle DX well it's
one hundred and thirty dollars right and
for 130
there's more you get basically three
things you get a much larger screen and
how much larger is it well here's a
little visual aid this is the kindle two
and this is the kindle DX much much
larger two and a half times bigger it's
quite significant the second thing
you're getting is an increase in screen
resolution and I think a lot of people
really aren't talking about this very
much it's kind of gone under the radar
so the kindle two as a resolution of 600
across and 800 up while the kindle DX
has a resolution of 824 across and 1,200
up so what that means just like a
computer monitor is but you'll be able
to see more on the screen at one time
that means less page turning that means
seeing a newspaper or magazine or a blog
or even a book in its full fidelity
being able to see more on one screen at
a time we'll really be convenient so
that's the second thing and the third
thing is the ability to have the display
automatically rotate if you turn it to
landscape which is a really big help if
you want to get the kind of widescreen
look when you're reading a book or
obviously if you're reading a text book
or newspaper or a magazine having a
landscape view is something that would
really be helpful so if you look at the
kindle DX from that perspective that for
130 dollars you're getting this new
capability to be able to see content in
a bigger brighter better way the price
is still high but the value is there in
terms of what you get compared to the
kindle two in addition to all the
features that you get with the kindle DX
and another thing is that i think that
the kindle DX is made to be not a
successor to the kindle two but really a
complimentary different product targeted
at a completely different group of
people and for a different settings so
the kindle DX is the kind of device that
you would have on the coffee table or in
your backpack if you're going to school
or maybe even if the bathroom if you
read the newspaper in the bathroom like
i know a lot of people do and the kindle
two is more for portability so it's the
thing you take with you on vacation you
bring it with you in the gear car you
walk down the street with it you bring
it to the park you don't look silly
carrying a petite device the kindle too
so that is just another opinion on the
pricing of the kindle DX yes it is
expensive but if you look at it from
kind of a value perspective it's really
not that bad
