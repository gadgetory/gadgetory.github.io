to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's going on guys the
mark and Sanger from TechnoBuffalo and
in today's video we'll be talking about
five cool app since weeks for the Mac
that we really enjoy using on a daily
basis app so don't improve on how you
work what your desktops gonna look like
and more let's go check out and see what
these apps are all about the first one
on our list is bartender it's a pretty
nifty app that'll allow you to minimize
your menu bar and choose which apps stay
up there essentially making your status
bar look as clean or crowded as you want
you can choose to completely hide it in
the menu bar show the items in the
bartender bar or simply leave it alone
apps will still work the same when
they're in bartenders bar but they'll be
hidden away you'll be able to pretty
much hide and organize and move the apps
inside bartender even hide the
Notification Center menu button which I
wouldn't do if you want something
that'll make your menu bar look cleaner
and overall look simplistic bartenders
an awesome app that'll help with that
now as a nice touch you can even tweak
the bartender icon up in your menu bar
with options like a box the star glasses
and more you can download the app from
bartenders website try it out for four
weeks for free and after those four
weeks are up you'll have to pay $15
which is a bit steep for an app but
nonetheless four weeks for free is a
really good deal to me number two is
fantastical now this is an awesome app
replacement for the stock calendar app
for Mac OS 10 the unique thing about
this app is that it lives in the menu
bar and works with calendar Bizzy Cal
Entourage and outlook and what's really
cool about this is you'll be able to use
natural language to simplify entering an
event into your calendar so for example
I type breakfast wood and at 8:30 at
Brooksie hit enter and the event is set
for 8:30 a.m.
it added Brooksie as a location and if
the event is for Saturday just add
Saturday after the location or after the
time then it'll change automatically
let's say if you want to set it to a
different calendar you'll be able to do
that on the fly if for example you have
multiple calendar accounts just like I
do just add calendar other a notable
change for which calendar it'll add that
event to now fantastical is an awesome
app if you want something minimalistic
it is $9.99 at the Mac App Store and I
believe it's one of the best calendar
apps I've ever tried number three is
control air if
you love listening to music whether it's
from iTunes Spotify or our do I think
this next app is gonna blow your mind
using keyboard shortcuts to pause skip
tracks and turn up the volume is so 2014
control air will let you do all of these
things by just using your index finger
and waving them in front of your Mac so
how does this work well it uses the
Mac's camera to track where your fingers
are and it works surprisingly well
gestures were immediately recognized and
I was able to control iTunes and Spotify
without a problem from whichever
perspective you look at it you either
look cool doing it or your friends may
think something is wrong with you
maybe nonetheless the thought of
controlling music with gestures is
really cool if you're wondering if your
Mac's camera will always be watching
well the app will only utilize it when
you have one of the compatible apps
running like Spotify iTunes QuickTime
and if you close the app the green
indicator light next to the camera will
disappear automatically if you guys are
interested in giving it a try it's free
so check out the Mac App Store for
control err
number four is hyper doc it's an app
that will change the way you use your
doc and windows now for starters you'll
be able to see the window preview
bubbles on your doc for an app like
Safari pages or Spotify now with Spotify
in iTunes you'll be able to pause skip
rate songs and even adjust the volume by
scrolling on the album cover on an
applet calendar you'll be able to see
your upcoming events by hovering over
the calendar icon and in terms of window
management it actually reminds me of
Windows 8 Snap feature which I really
like you'll be able to resize and move
the windows by either dragging the
window to your menu bar to decide your
screen and it'll snap according to
whichever side of the screen you drag it
to hybrid dock is a really awesome app
that I'm sure a lot of power users are
going to enjoy unfortunately the price
tag I believe is a bit steep coming in
at 10 dollars now I have a 15 day trial
at the moment but after those 15 days
are up I'm sure I'll buy licensed now
number five is flashlight this one it's
pretty unique it's not really an app
it's more of a tweak for OS 10 and
spotlight now with this week you'll be
able to install tons of plugins so don't
make the spotlight search even more
useful within the flashlight app you'll
be able to pick from different
categories I installed most of the
featured plugins as they seem to be the
more useful ones for me I can search for
the weather use Wolfram Alpha do a
google search and I can even come in my
Mac to shut down or start with
sleeeeep there are tons of plugins that
you may find useful not just the
featured ones but the best thing about
this is it's free the tweak is free the
plugins are free so go check it out now
there are other apps too that we use on
a daily basis that we thought we should
mention as well like unclutter which is
like a digital pocket for storing notes
links files in saving your desktop from
clutter
alfrid which is a spotlight alternative
similar to flashlights tweaks and
there's also stay which is an app
that'll tidy up your desktop windows and
remember we're in your desktop those
windows should be make sure to go check
