Android needs to be more female friendly
and then you make a phone that's overtly
trying to appeal to females you stir up
some some heat in the tech blog
community the phone in question is right
here it's the HTC Rhyme for Verizon
what's going on everybody I'm Noah from
TechnoBuffalo and this is the HTC Rhyme
for Verizon it's on sale now 430 $9.99
is the retail price if you buy it on
contract from Verizon to your contract
they will give it to you for 200 bucks 1
$99.99 I think so the folks at Verizon
for loaning us this one and I think
after I unbox it I'm going to see the
see if one of the female members of our
staff wants to do the full review
because this was targeted like I said to
the female audience stood up some
controversy some editorials in the
blogosphere about how it's you know it's
not cool to sort of go to this go to
this length and say like Oh female can't
be geeks I don't know whatever you're
probably saying yourself somebody right
now is getting ready to post in the
comments the unboxing starts at 9
minutes and 44 seconds or whatever so
let's get to it
in the box in the very fancy
plum-colored box look at that that goes
there with the icons on it you get
another box I hope you notice the box is
a little ribbon on there the box is more
colorful and definitely fancier then a
lot of the phones that I usually get
here's the phone itself I've actually
seen a white GSM unlocked version of
this phone so interesting to see the
plum the plum actually I think is cooler
looking I don't know that I personally
would carry a plum phone around seems
like it's on too but definitely cooler
looking I think my battery is low all
right that's fine before we get to the
phone's inside the box
we also get so for your tutor bucks you
get a smartphone not a top-of-the-line
smartphone but you know a fully capable
Android smartphone and you get the
multimedia dock and it's all fancy it's
got fabric on the outside
stuff you know this definitely seems
like something from I was gonna say the
the ladies department at a department
store and then you would say why do you
know what's in the latest perimeter
department store Noah and I would say
because I go shopping for gifts for
ladies but I'm just digging the hole
deeper and deeper it's a multimedia dock
it's not plugged in right now so I don't
think it's gonna do anything but it's
got get USB port in the back you can set
it up as a charger next you know use it
wherever on your desk and your
nightstand what I have you and turn into
kind of a multimedia dock charging
station watch your videos check the
weather you know all that kind of stuff
also in here you get your manuals
everything is plumb with the curvy
lowercase font you get your tangle free
earbuds I'm going to open these up
usually whoops I just bang the camera
sorry
usually I don't open these up with the
tangle free I'm kind of curious oh no
this is the charm okay so this is the
the special charm you can plug into the
audio jack of your phone and the idea is
that you plug this in and there's a menu
setting a menu setting there's a
settings menu that lets you set up what
you want the charm to do so you can have
it let's actually find that setting
shall we Oh apps settings charm so you
can set the charm to light up when a
message is received light up for a phone
call let up when you a visual voicemail
there you go and so the charms should we
demo the charm yeah let me demo the
charm hang on saying all right here we
go so imagine you know that the charm is
just hanging out away from the phone
like it's hanging out of my purse was
hanging out of my you know manly leather
jacket pocket or whatever so I never the
phone put away in the charm rings and
okay so I missed the call dude
- okay so I missed the call and my charm
is gonna keep blinking I think I said
rings before I know but it's blinking
and so that one can just be out you know
clip - Maya here I can clip it to my
shirt cuff Kenny I don't know but it's
got a little clip so I can clip it to
places and I can let me know like oh
I've got a missed something or other
there you go so that's the deal with the
charm otherwise with this phone for your
200 somalis you get a 3.7 inch WVGA
touch screen so 800 by 480 Android 2.3
with HTC Sense it's a Verizon Wireless
exclusive HTC Sense left to dig into
that and see what that means the
exclusive you've got a front-facing VGA
camera for video chat and self-portraits
and stuff you get a rear facing five
megapixel camera with autofocus and I
believe it does 720p video capture we'll
have to have to check it out for sure
but I believe it's 720p all the Android
goodness its 3G not LTE but you get CDMA
3G Wi-Fi of course speakerphone
Bluetooth all that good stuff the phone
is relatively lightweight you know not
the thinnest phone out there pretty
lightweight aluminum unibody
construction feels nice in the hand you
know it's a good phone you got the
sensors on the back of me a good feeling
phone feels like it's all they built got
those sensors for the the charging dock
there let's just check out the camera
HCC's other new phones yep it's also you
know it's got that quick reload feature
on the camera which i think is actually
you know could be quite handy if it
stays you know that if the refresh time
stays that fast after you've been you've
been using the phone a while and the
software gets a little bogged down
that's great because it's a pain when
you miss shots because your cameras
reloading these effects built-in do my
sepia tone and overexposed I can glimmer
everyone wants a little glimmer with
their rime my light it's like Instagram
but not really I've never used Instagram
so I don't even I know what it is but
I've never actually used it
ah yeah I wanted to go back and check
out actually the video capture and see
let's go out to the front here and this
is about one of the new sense widgets
this is kind of an all-in-one you see
you've got the thumbnail but kind of an
all-in-one widget here where you can
open up and kind of scan through
different things all right you can't
really you flip and if I can flip maybe
I can't flip but I so if the widget has
kind of a pain to get to in the small
screen if the thing that the widgets
attached to has you know more
information that can be shown on that
kind of slide-out tray there so like the
camber you can watch the camera you can
go to the gallery messages I would
assume I could see I could see that
message from 900 800 whatever that
number is may I have an email mails now
set up let's go back to the camera and
go into video mode can't use a flash
because my battery those two though take
a picture sweetie ain't got time to wait
and quality yep 720p is the highest
resolution there for the video in camera
so there you go first look at the phone
for girls or so certain people would
have you believe the HTC Rhyme from HTC
of course and Verizon Wireless again
available now one 99.99 with a two-year
verizon contract comes in plum comes
with the charm comes with the milk
multimedia charging dock comes with the
oh yeah what are these tangle free
earbuds that's right I got so caught up
in the charm I forgot to look at the
tangle free here buds
so here the tangle free earbuds it
looked kind of like beats earbuds in
plum but a rubbery cord extra set of the
ear tips there you go can I have to send
this one to one of the females on our
staff and see what they think
see if they're offended see if they're
charmed by it get it charmed anyway my
name is Noah thanks to the folks at
Verizon for loaning us this device much
much more on the charm
much much more on the charm at
TechnoBuffalo calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
