a manufacturer could release a new phone
and we would be surprised about what it
looked like in the specs that those days
are long gone
and now that we know what the Galaxy s8
is because I got one in my pocket and
chances are you guys might as well time
to move on to the next flagship launch
and that is from Apple the iPhone 8
goodvery will be called the iPhone
edition an iPhone X iPhone 7s whatever
the next iPhone which I am
affectionately dubbing the iPhone 8 we
finally know a lot about at least
allegedly a lot about it due to Twitter
user Ben Gaskin but not only shared just
images of it but also pictures of an
alleged prototype of the iPhone 8 now
take all this with the obligatory grain
of salt it's supposedly one of 10
different prototypes Apple is toying
with but it does tell a story and
confirm at least allegedly confirm a lot
of things we're hearing about the next
gen I phone the big one is the display
edge-to-edge display
almost used to be a no-brainer with the
next gen iPhone all different prototypes
we've seen at least the renders that
have leaked out have all had that same
similar edge-to-edge display what this
is missing though aside from bezels is
any discernible touch ID button now
we've seen some prototypes that have it
on the back but the Apple logo is some
below the Apple logo this one doesn't
even have an Apple logo on the back
doesn't have any sort of touch ID which
kind of lends a little bit of credence
to the fact that Apple is working at
least trying the attached ID integrated
into the screen itself so whether or not
that actually makes it out the shipping
device who knows with the iPhone 7 plus
Apple added a dual lens system it was
like this it was horizontal today iPhone
a it looks like they're going like that
and making your vertical clothes little
help with focusing it should also make
it those two the smaller phone the
iPhone eight not just for the iPhone 8
plus or they decide to call the bigger
version Ben also gave I call him Ben
looks like I know him but he also gave
further details on the phone itself
saying that about the same thickness as
a current gen iPhone 7 and the metal
edges along the outside which make the
phone kind of look like an iPhone 4 are
actually going to be painted or anodized
a new color he's dubbing space and black
so the phone kind of looks like a
lovechild between a Galaxy at 8 and an
iPhone 4 both of which are beautiful
phone
in their own right the most interesting
thing for me about this phone is a touch
ideas integrated directly into the
screen that is a huge technological
advancement and I think that could have
pushed entire industry forward Samsung
was trying to do with the s8 it couldn't
get it out in time perhaps something I
would get reserved for the s9 but that
is their really cool hyphenate what do
you guys think let me a comment down
below if this is the phone if this is
one of the alleged 10 prototypes that
Apple's goes with this is the iPhone
eight it's going to be in a box
would you buy it you can like comment
down below and let me know if you like
the TV news videos give a thumbs up we
always appreciate it till next time Jon
