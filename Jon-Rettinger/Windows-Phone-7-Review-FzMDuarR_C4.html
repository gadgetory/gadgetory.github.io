TechnoBuffalo here I want to give you an
overview and a review of Windows Phone 7
show you the nuances of the operating
system what's good what's bad and talk
about how it's gonna fit in the entire
mobile marketplace so if you have an
interest in the operating system and how
it's going to work
stick around so we're gonna do this
demonstration on the HTC surround this
particular video is not going to be a
review of the surround itself will focus
on hardware reviews and upcoming videos
but I do want to show you the operating
system and how it works as a whole so
let me talk about first the idea behind
Windows Phone 7 this is directly from
Steve Ballmer's mouth at the Microsoft
announcement in New York what's really
important to Microsoft is no
fragmentation so they have to make sure
that the operative system is going to be
the same across all experiences so every
device that's going to be running
Windows Phone 7 has to be the minimum
spec requirements to ensure that it's
going to be fast or at least fast enough
to make Microsoft happy and that means
that no matter what phone you pick up
whether it's the HTC surround that we
have here samsung focus or the hd7
whatever it might be your experience is
going to be very very similar they're
not taking the Android approach of
different operating system versions on
different phones it's going to be the
same version of Windows Phone on each
device and that's going to be true with
carriers as well the updates will be
pushed out sort of uniformly to make
sure that there is that conformity
throughout the operating system they
wanted you to be able to sort of see all
your information very quickly with one
click and they want to happen to be sort
of accessible in a easy to access manner
and something that was very visually
appealing so I think one of the biggest
problems Windows Phone 7 is going to
have is that it's made by Microsoft it's
a very polarizing company much like
Apple so when you watch this video and
you put together your own opinions on
Windows Phone 7 try and separate
Microsoft from the equation try to look
at as an operating system as a whole and
how it works and trying to take out the
fact that it's made by Microsoft or
whatever preconceived notions
might have about that once I was able to
do that mentally I was able to
appreciate the opportunity
mindset in very editorial and try and
take that those preconceived notions out
the window all right so I've talked
about the phone let's go ahead and show
you so the home screen is made up what
Microsoft is calling these live tiles
and essentially what they are our grid
is sized widgets that have updates live
in the background so you have a ton of
ways you can set these up but
essentially when you want to view them
all it is a completely a vertical
scrolling and at first I found that
vertical scrolling to be quite a bit
cumbersome
I had to scroll down and down and down
to get to where I wanted to go and as I
was doing that using my iPhone I like II
realize that I was scrolling left and
right horizontally to get to my
applications I'm very similar to Android
as well to scrolling through home
screens this is sort of a reverse of the
way you might be used to scrolling on
iOS or Android is something that you do
get used to so these all these home
screens update you can see right here
it's people and that's in place of a
traditional contacts type of menu assert
pulls and everybody's Facebook
information Windows Live and a few other
social networks into this sort of
universal looking contacts field I
definitely enough there is not any
native support for Twitter it's not
gonna pull in your Twitter contents
natively and amalgamated into this
peoples tab unfortunately it's actually
going to have to rely on a third-party
application for Twitter much like I have
right here Windows Phone 7 is very much
about the social experience and the
Twitter emission is pretty significant
although I assume eventually Twitter
will be included so let me go ahead and
open up the people tab here and show you
very quickly what that looks like
so you go ahead and scroll through you
can see everybody's information get that
back and focus here I can go ahead and
see everybody's information and see
what's there
you can scroll through and see what's
new on Facebook you can go ahead and see
recent pictures and go back to your task
menu or your array rather of contacts
and that's sort of how you go through
and dial what is really
here with this so as a way to quickly
scroll through contacts on the iPhone or
Android you can hold your finger down
the side and scroll through and jump to
letters here you have to a lot of flex
going to get to where you want to go
something that I think definitely needs
to be fixed incoming versions so that's
what the risk of making us a very long
video I'm gonna sort of jumping out past
the live tiles and just know that these
do update live in the background you can
set live tiles for your favorite
contacts although it's not gonna be able
to Clark contact directly it's gonna
open up a menu whether or not you want
to call or text that person and that's
sort of Windows Phones answer to speed
dial I would suppose so
this operating system is very animation
heavy and it looks really good and you
see these little animations a little
nuances pop up throughout the entire
operating system let me give you a one
quick example so the phone is locked and
you go ahead and unlock it
the unlock screens first of all you see
a lot of information which is very
useful different email accounts and sets
show up there I should go ahead and
scroll this up you can see the text
start to fade away and there's a lots of
very little sort of animation hints like
that that make me server appreciate the
operating system the physics engine here
is really saw it's got that sort of
rubber band effect as you scroll really
just makes you feel like a very polished
operating system serve something that I
would have liked to have seen once a
webOS launched the fact that Microsoft
is imposing minimum spec requirements
mean every phone can support this and
your experience with these animations
gonna be really nice and you see I'm
sort of pop up throughout the operating
system alright let's go ahead and talk
about these more of these hubs and the
hub customization so some of these hubs
take up the entire row you can see right
here there is a calendar picked up the
whole hub and you've got this HTC to
take out the whole hub then go ahead and
move these around but you can't pick
weather after you take up one spot or
two and service sent by default so since
you already have the same experience
across all the devices and different
manufacturers how are the manufacturers
going to customize the experience and
the answer is they can customize these
hubs so here's the HTC experience this
is the HTC hub and once you sort of put
in custom information about the
manufacturer or they'd like to be in
there so you get sort of a cool
animation here then you get what will be
familiar-looking floozy that have used a
sense device this is the way that HTC is
customized it Samsung has their own
customization in there which give you
access with today's screen weather and
widgets but this is sort of the way that
HTC has done it so while their insert or
Universal feel throughout the device
there is still customization that can be
done you can see here's some more
example of the animations we're sorry'
jumping through a lot of these nuances
very quickly because I want to sort of
show you everything in one - unified
video in upcoming videos going through
the devices I'll talk a bit more about
the operating system as well alright so
let's talk about new browser which is
based on Internet explorer standards and
hearing that is one of the places where
I need you to sort of take back and step
back from your preconceived notion about
Microsoft because this is a very good
browser and probably one of the best
implementations of pinch-to-zoom
that I have seen on a mobile device
iPhone included it is extremely smooth
very fast scrolling happens without any
sort of checkerboard pattern down there
so there's no waiting for it
the content is there easy to view you
can double tap to zoom in things just
work very well on the browser what's not
here right now
what sort of shows that it's a young
operating system we don't have flash
support unfortunately you don't have
support for html5 and oddly enough the
right now there isn't any sort of native
YouTube support yet that opens up an
application - it doesn't really work all
that well so presumably that will be
coming when all these operate systems
were launched they certainly had their
shortcomings so when the iPhone was
launched notoriously miss one was cut
copy paste in multitasking when Android
first launched missing a multi-touch
browser and a few other features sure
every operate system that enters the
sphere is missing features and Windows
Phone 7 is certainly no exception it's
missing and a few really key features
missing cut copy and paste
although Microsoft did show us cut copy
and paste to know that it is then is
coming an implementation was actually
pretty good something that will be
coming according to the promise in early
2011
I know threaded email is very annoying
here the email application is fantastic
it works really well very easy to set up
but no threat of messaging makes it
difficult and that's something I'll show
you in a later video to an interest of
time we're going to have to sort of
brush by it cut copy and paste I
mentioned no multitasking so the sort of
native Microsoft applications and right
in the background you can run the zoom
player in the background and listen to
music applications will download in the
background but there's no background
support for third-party apps which is a
bit disappointing
and speaking of third-party apps app
support are really important to the
success of a platform and I have to say
the Microsoft has done a very nice job
with their marketplace which actually
just went officially live today which is
the 21st of October and there are a lot
of apps you can download sort of custom
HTC apps if you're using a device here
like the surround you can go ahead and
jump in and the applications are all
sort of sorted by category you can
download xbox live games and there are
ton of sort of things you can choose
from here social productivity and a lot
of different categories and there are a
ton of applications here and as this
sort of the platform matures we're going
to see many many many more and the
applications can be downloaded and
excuse me rather paid for right through
your carrier bill so you only have to
worry about putting in a credit card
something to keep in mind so if you're
worried about app support this is very
very very good as far as the launch I
think it's much more full-featured than
Android Marketplace is it when it
launched certainly Android is surpassed
it now but as the platform matures I
think that the application support is
going to increase with it so very
impressed with that so far one of the
things I want to show you the last thing
is the keyboard Harrogate nimpah text on
these phones some are going to have full
QWERTY keyboard some are gonna rely
right on the touch screen let me go
ahead and show you what the touchscreen
keyboards gonna look like here we'll go
ahead and open up a new message and
let's say that it worked very well it
takes traditional approach that we've
seen on other devices least in text
messaging of using that sort of bubble
keyboard works awesome it's got a great
auto correction feature this is probably
the best keyboard I've used on any
mobile device not tested quite a bit
certainly devices larger keyboards and
larger sizes are easy to type on but
this one at least in portrait is
extremely easy to use
the autocorrection features are very
good you can sort of see it move around
you have a separate button for your
emoticons one of the issues that I do
have with it though is when you type in
landscape you expect to keep word to get
a lot bigger there's a lot of wasted
space there on either side I would have
liked the keyboard to have been a lot
larger so go ahead and put this back up
here so I know I had to sort of brush
for a lot of features and I couldn't
show you everything about the phone and
I will sort of delve into these things
more in upcoming videos
but I want to give you a conclusion
about the operating system and how I
feel about it
so despite this being a new operating
system it is entering the sphere of very
mature operating system so we're talking
about iOS and Android which have a lot
of these features that Windows Phone 7
is missing I think in the long run
Windows Phone 7 is going to be a
tremendous competitor to Android and iOS
I think it's sort of a nice in-between
between the very sort of locked down
Apple model and the very open Android
model this allows developers
customizations through these hubs but
keeps saying very unified to make sure
you've got similar experience so I think
Windows Phone 7 has tremendous potential
in fact I've been using a Windows Phone
7 device as my daily driver for about a
week and I have no plan on switching
back to using an iPhone it's been very
easy to use it's been fun to use it's
been sort of an very short learning
curve and it's been doing everything
that I've wanted to do every day I go
ahead and look in the app marketplace
here and there are new applications that
I'm using Netflix is here Twitter
applications are here all the rest of
the music streaming stuff that you like
so I'm going to be here so if you're
looking to get a new phone sometime in
the near future I think you owe it to
yourself to at least look at Windows
Phone 7 because you might be surprised I
feels very I guess on Microsoft II and
it wasn't what I expected having come
and seen you know Windows Mobile 6 6.5
and the previous versions Microsoft
really did a very nice job of the soft
breakfast um making it very modern
scalable and really useful for the
professional the texture or the casual
user you'll find something that you like
here although you are gonna have to live
within some limitations such as the lack
of cut copy and paste and full
multitasking which presumably
we'll be coming soon there you guys hope
you enjoy certain overview and review of
Windows Phone 7 I am John Renton
carefully TechnoBuffalo and I will see
you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
