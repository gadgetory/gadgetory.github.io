their own success they've revolutionized
industries may come to expect
revolutionary products year-over-year
the iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus are not bad
these are evolutionary at best of design
language we saw introduced with the
iPhone 6 does that even matter have they
made an already good phone or phones
even better we headed out to beautiful
Balboa Island to help you decide whether
or not the iPhone 7 and 7 plus are worth
the upgrade whether or not you should
skip this generation all together and
maybe go to a competitor let's start to
review with what's different namely the
home button on the iPhone 7 and the
iPhone 7 plus it's been completely
redone at least internally utilizing
Apple's taptic engine found in the force
touch trackpad on the MacBook Pros upon
setup you get three different options to
pick which one's gonna feel the best for
you and they all kind of felt the same I
just pick number three because last one
I tried and the first couple days of
testing I did not like the way this
worked I missed a physical depressing of
the home button but after that first
three to four days I started to enjoy
the home button and beyond that I didn't
have any false reads and read my
fingerprint almost 100% of the time
something that I certainly couldn't say
it to the generation phones the design
language on the iPhone 7 is very
familiar to the last two generations of
phone the antenna bands have been moved
and I'm definitely talking about the
move of the headphone jack but it looks
like a very similar phone save for the
new black color and a new jet black
color I opted for the black essentially
it's matte black and does a really nice
job of not showing fingerprints for
debating jet black know that when it's
clean it looks absolutely gorgeous the
second you put that thing in your pocket
it is extremely prone to scratches and
shows more fingerprints than a piano the
cameras have been tweaked a little bit
the camera humps are certainly more
pronounced on the iPhone 7 and
absolutely on the dual sensor wielding
iPhone 7 plus and speaking of cameras
they have definitely been changed and
upped arguably that's the biggest
upgrade with this generation of phones
the iPhone 7 now is a 12 megapixel
camera with an f1 plate aperture OAS is
a nice welcome improvement even the
flash has been improved it's how a quad
led true tone flash the inclusion of oh
yeah something at Apple absolutely
needed and video looked really
even while walking did a really nice job
save life and the pictures that came out
of it also look equally good as you'd
expect pictures and normal light look
great because in low light also look
good even with the flash turned off the
flash turned on it looked a lot better
than I've seen in previous generation
phones now having said that about the
iPhone 7 you can't really gauge how good
that picture looks because the
resolution on that screen is still 1334
by 750 a resolution that has not changed
in years and isn't now so far outdated
by even mid-range Android phones I
really try to temper myself and not get
too caught up in resolution being the
most important but this isn't even a
1080 screen that comes out to being able
to see content on the display we just
can't see that much on the iPhone 7
although I like the way the phone feels
in the hand I found myself looking more
towards the iPhone 7 plus because at
least is that has a 1920 by 1080 screen
I think that's a big knock on the iPhone
they've done an incredible job cramming
cutting-edge technology with the thing
you look at interact with the phone is
extremely last gen and saying the last
gen is being very friendly and speaking
of the 7 plus Apple has done a lot of
stuff with that camera in fact they've
doubled it you know have to 12 megapixel
wide-angle and telephoto cameras line
angles got an F eliminate aperture the
telephoto has an F 2.8 aperture and now
we've got real legit optical zoom here
at 2 x digital zoom up to 10 give you a
little icon on the screen you tap it and
you zoom right in so any syrup
exhalation you can also zoom in while
you're recording it's slow motion which
it does at 10 80 120 frames per second
and it looks absolutely incredible
coming out of the iPhone 7 plus even the
iPhone 7 I really love the slow-mo video
it's not surprising to say this is the
best generation of cameras applet ever
produced because suppose the recent
generation of cameras Apple's ever
produced but it's true the cameras are
really nice here on the iPhone 7 I've
said this before in previous reviews but
I have dropped my phone in the toilet
and while being incredibly gross
I've also ruined a few phones I getting
them wet that is no longer be the case
with the iPhone 7 and 7 plus because IP
67 which means it's dust and water
resistant
not waterproof you can submerge in water
for about 30 minutes in one meter and
still be okay a little recommended we
did a full video testing the water
prowess of the iPhone 7 and 7 plus and
it performed admirably if you get stuck
in the rain you don't have to worry me
definitely throw in a pool you're gonna
be fine just rinse it off and you're
gonna be good to go no more trying to
hold a flashlight your headphone jack to
see if a little piece of paper turn
color see if you had water damage and
age you like the natural transition to
the headphone jack it ain't here it is
it is gone in a very curious move by
Apple replacing what used to be the
headphone jack with now just a dummy
speaker it doesn't do much
I could rant and write about that for a
while personally though it doesn't
matter too much to me I mostly use
Bluetooth headphones but for the kind of
person likes to plug in then you're not
gonna want to look at this phone the
very least you're gonna want to make
sure you do not lose the included dongle
that's gonna come in the box other
improvements that this gemphones and the
processors need things are fast rocking
the a10 fusion chip with 64-bit
architecture and the embedded m10 in
motion coprocessor these phones
predictably fly apple's ever been
reliant on a ram although the iPhone 7s
got 2 gigs the iPhone 7 plus has 3 both
feel very very fast but it still is iOS
10 and again whether you love it love it
hater somewhere between it is the best
version of iOS 10 for every pro of the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus there's a Colin the
biggest cons for me are the screens
I like that Apple improve the color
gamut but in all candor things don't
look that different on the 7 vs 6s or
even the 6th the exact same images the
low resolutions becoming less and less
tolerable as Apple goes year after year
without changing it and again I'm not
screaming that these phones need to have
Q HD displays at the very least 1080
across the board is a glaring omission
from Apple on the flip side of that coin
the cameras are great the phones are
incredibly fast and battery life seems
to be improved I'm getting about an hour
long and I did a previous gen phone I
still can barely make it through a day
on the iPhone 7 but on the plus side on
the day with about 40% so the question I
asked should you upgrade if you're on an
iPhone
six maybe you want to consider
especially some of the offers carriers
are giving right now fron iPhone 6s I
would tip this generation out if you
want anything older than i phone six
absolutely upgrade you're gonna have a
huge changes versus what you're using
but this is by no means a must-have
phone it's a nice to have phone
it's a hey this camera is better than
the last gen it's a cool can get wet
type phone but it's by no means to camp
out for two days cuz I gotta have this
device and in that way I think Apple's
lost a little bit of luster they still
make some the best phones on the planet
but they're not as wonderful and gotta
have as it used to be perhaps things
will change with the next gen iPhone
eight we've heard crazy rumors whether
or not that's come to fruition is yet to
be seen but the glaring emissions on the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus make it a phone that
you could probably skip and still be
okay so what do you guys think about the
iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus it's like this
kind of review give the video a thumbs
up to let us know we want to get out of
the office and sort of see Southern
Californian let you see it through our
eyes hope you guys enjoy leave a
comments down below and let us know if
you like the phones we're not you
upgrade or not upgraded and why until
next time I'm J Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo chat you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
