to you by netflix hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley ass gather any question you
might have from the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo calm
you can leave your question there in the
post comments otherwise you can send
them to me at any time of the day or
night on twitter app technobuffalo or at
Ashley asked ebba just make sure you use
the hashtag ask the be so I can see it
and usually I answer between three and
five questions every episode so let's
get answering this is ask the Buffalo
josh asks hey Ashley do you see curved
phones becoming the next trend in
smartphones or is it just something
Samsung is doing this samsung galaxy
round is a really interesting device I
get how it could feel more comfortable
in a pocket a front jeans pocket but I
don't know that curved phones are really
the future I think this is sort of a
middle ground where we're kind of on our
way to flexible devices which is a
little ways out but I think we're on our
way to flexible and to get there we kind
of have to crawl before we can walk so
to speak so I think that flexible
devices are really the future future but
for right now curved is where it might
be going we'll see I am I don't know I
don't I understand you know with the TV
curved is more immersive but for a
little tiny phone I don't know I don't
think so paul asks hey Ashley what kind
of car do you drive and are you into
cars as much as John is or perhaps only
the technology that is in them also what
is your favorite car make well I will
totally admit I'm a Hyundai fangirl I
have driven a Hyundai ever since I
bought cars on my very first car wasn't
but my parents got me a little beater
when I was 16 that I immediately flipped
on the freeway three months later on the
fourth of July so there's that but every
car i've purchased has been a Hyundai I
had no launcher in 2001 it lasted I
still going strong i gave it to my
grandma when i bought my new Hyundai
which is a veloster her name is Vera she
is gorgeous she's great I a salon gray I
love cars I
love cars i love how they look i love
how they're designed i'm not a gearhead
like John by any means but I did take
auto shop in high school I do know how
to switch out carburetor know how to
switch out I know how to change oil know
how to change the tires all the basic
stuff that you need to know I think
everybody should kind of know that stuff
but I don't know why people don't but
yeah I have a veloster I love it it is
an amazing car I wish I had gotten a
turbo but I will say it didn't come in
the grey that I liked so it only came in
matte grey so I had to skip the turbo
but I love veera she's the best twitter
user Kobe or die tryin asks if y'all
were not professional tech reviewers
would you still buy all the top phones
with your own money hashtag ask the be
so here's the deal about that uh
actually most of the phones we get we
send back a lot of the flagships we get
for review go back home to the company
so that other reviewers can then review
the devices I still buy phones with my
own money my iphone was purchased with
my own cash it comes right out of my own
pocket same thing for pretty much
everyone here at the office unless you
maybe want to do a long-form review then
we'll hold on to a device for a little
bit longer to see it you know how it
performs over time we don't really get
you know free phones raining from the
sky I know it might seem like that but
we you know have to share the love with
all the other reviewers and websites and
print outlets that are out there so PR
companies will offer his phone we get
them review them and we say okay buh-bye
phone and then we have to send it away
and it's very sad for user at blue bird
told me says hey Ashley always were
awesome t-shirts where do you get them
from I buy my shirts everywhere on the
internet this one today is from a
podcast that I'm a huge fan of called
welcome to night Vale it's super weird
and super amazing the writing is
incredible ah but otherwise I get my
shirts from places like woot.com
shirt.woot is another great one but if
you want to go one of the places i
really like is t magnet calm and you can
actually see all of those sort of daily
shirt sites they have them in a big grid
so you can just see what's available all
at once at the same time and then you
can just go to each site based on what
you want so that's where I shop for
shirts guys I have to interrupt the show
really quick to remind you that the 50th
anniversary episode of doctor who is
very swiftly approaching
you've never seen an episode of Doctor
Who that is a tragedy but it can easily
be fixed with Netflix Netflix lets you
stream great movies and TV shows
directly to your house you can stream
all of that content with the netflix app
for your xbox 360 ps3 smart TV nintendo
wii Apple TV Roku I mean you get the
idea it's a lot you get unlimited
viewings too so you can get down with
the ninth tenth and the 11th doctor
before watching Peter Capaldi take over
the role seriously time-traveling alien
evil robots crazy adventures there is
always time for the doctor and seriously
