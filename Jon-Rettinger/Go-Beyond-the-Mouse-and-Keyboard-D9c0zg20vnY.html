technologies it's mobile it's the latest
cellphone its latest tablet it sort of
new cutting-edge technologies and we
talk about stuff but going to becoming
generally it's like cloak-and-dagger
stuff we got an exclusive from a source
we got a water market but very rarely
actually get a chance to see prototypes
before they hit the market I'm doing a
lot of research on new technologies I
want to serve start a new series and
TechnoBuffalo or you can show these
emerging technologies almost before the
ready for mass market so you can sort of
participate in the technologies going to
be I've been doing a lot of research on
HTI's or human-computer interfaces for a
lot of reasons kind of selfishly I'm
developing worse and worst carpal tunnel
syndrome in my wrist so many of the
reasons I was looking for this
technology obviously spent a lot of time
staring at a phone and I'm starting to
get idea gation in my research I found
serve a new technology a new way to
interact with computers and things
called wolfie so I reached out to the
folks to see if they'd let me show it in
our first video and they were brightly
super eager so they flew down here and
actually have the very first prototype
there's actually one of four prototypes
of the wolfie HCI
and it's a pretty cool way to interact
with things in general so first it's
it's ergonomically in your hand which is
obviously nice and from sitting here in
my chair on my couch in my living room
and you were except my desk like this
hunched over I can interact with my
computer whether it's Mac or PC wolfie
don't care so here's a run-through of
the control and I can simulate a mouse
you know your left click your right
click and being able to scroll around so
the top part here is a trackpad and it's
also but you can click the top part here
is also a button it's another trackpad
and it's kind of you scroll up and down
like you would if a mouse if you're sort
of using your finger you can also click
that and then this button on at the side
here that is not touch at just a button
you can click and also would simulate
what your right click would be so this
resid stands right now it charges via
microUSB the charging should last about
a week and the sort of blue ring will
give you a battery indicator so as you
75% will start to go down and it'll
change colors let you know how much
better you have that having to like
check in a poor or worry about to die on
your
so it's always kind of right in your
eyesight how much juice you got left so
it uses Bluetooth Low Energy
you'll pair it like any other bluetooth
it doesn't need to install anything it
just works right away you can react with
your computer so this is a very early
prototype this won't be shipping until
sometime middle ish of next year but you
can see what the future is going to be
and it's gonna be less mouse and
keyboard I don't think it's gonna
replace mouse and keyboard least not yet
it's kind of meant to be used in
conjunction with so it's going to get
started so I'm looking at just a news
feed here on Google News I can go ahead
and simply scroll just with my finger
and we've seen sort of similar
technologies before things like an air
mouse for example we can sort of move
around but then if you want to click
something you got to keep your hand
there click and if you move your hand
you can end up getting the cursor all
over the place this is pretty simple my
finger naturally rests on the top and I
can just sort of do a very sort of
simple scroll fine article I want to
read like let's see what's going on in
the world usually not a fun place right
now I just go ahead and click it and
it'll just take me there it works
extremely well and it's not just limited
to computers you can pair it to your
Android phone for example and if you use
a chromecast
or use a Google TV device essentially
use your phone plug it in as a
substitute for that device and you get
full control over your mobile phone
there's even a back button so you have
to worry about your finding an X or
clicking on a home bunch it's very
simple to go back so you can play games
you can control YouTube you control
Prime video or other video apps you want
to do Wolfie can control it when it
comes to things you do on a mouse and
keyboard things like text input you can
pull up a virtual keyboard on Windows or
Mac X or scroll over and you could tap
the letter you know that's an area where
I think a mouse and keyboard is going to
ring supriya probably for a while but
you can't do very simple TextEdit Swift
this the best use case in the simplest
use case and the most obvious use case
think is where the beauty of this
product shines it's just browsing
content consuming content which I spend
a lot of my time doing more more time
like to admit on Facebook scrolling
through news feed on TechnoBuffalo
reading articles researching new
emerging technology is sort of what I've
been doing spending my
time with this is a great way to do it
and I'm hoping it's going to save my
wrist so what I like about this and bear
this in mind as you sort of evaluate the
technology in fact they brought this to
us as a prototype we are still months
and months and months lessons actually
shipping so it's exciting isn't
necessarily what it can do right now and
does a lot it's what I think it can do
in the future what the future of
human-computer interfaces is going to be
so if you guys want to know more about
wolfing and what it can do go to wolfy
technologies comm will link to their
website Facebook there's even a
Kickstarter for trying to help fund this
thing down below I encourage you check
them out so I think a couple questions
that I want to ask you guys this is what
could you do with something like this
how could you envision it working would
it be being interact with a combination
of all those gestures just talking to it
like you would with with an echo is it
just touchpad being out of control
things using a conjunction in the mouse
and keyboard I want to know for me it's
content consumption so I mentioned the
beginning this is the first in a series
of emerging technology videos there's
another aspect emerging technologies you
want us to check out let us know we're
already researching battery technology
something new that's going to be coming
out but this is cool and something that
you guys want to see we'll do the
research for you we'll reach out to
companies on your behalf and let you
know technologies could be what they
could do in the future so please leave a
comment down below we really nervous
making a video like this showing a new
technology please give the video a
thumbs up we appreciate it till next
time I'm John Ranger TechnoBuffalo
