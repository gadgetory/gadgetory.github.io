x10 we've got the Sony expert here to
give us a walkthrough of the device and
talk about the highlights really what's
interesting about this device for the
operates on the Android platform what
Sony Ericsson it is done is overlaid
with timescape and media escape on top
of Android and what that means is it's
just basically a collection of all
communication that you've had on your
device via Facebook or Twitter emails
text messaging in chronological order
from the last communication that's
happened in the last data that's pushed
to your device just overlays on top of
the previous tile where's Persian of
Android is running 1.6 ok if you go into
media escape similar type of technology
actually while we're here I'll just go
ahead and this is not kind of video that
and this is the media escape interface
now this is the media media escape in
our favor and this is everything that is
loaded on the device globally and then
beneath that everything that you could
pull from the internet so it kind of
links you to similar type of thing
the video quality is fantastic well with
quick size of the screen 480 bite on a
4-inch cream yeah
extremely high resolution for a mobile
device in the camera 1 megapixel
something that's neat about the camera
it has face detection and recognition
which basically means if you tag one
particular photo it will go back and
find that person and your album and
retag all other photos so has the
intelligence as long as 75% of the face
is captured it has the intelligence
corps back and we tag everything another
neat feature is something that we call
the infinite button
and this is a capacitive screen of
course this is and if you hit the
infinite button
it'll bring up and this is kind of dummy
information just for the purpose as
you're showing capability but the
infinite button would display all
different communication that you've had
with that particular contact so if there
has been messaging if there has been
emailing just left to right you a scroll
and have the collection of all
communication that can capture this is
very 3d heavies it returning the
Snapdragon processor i zoom it is 1 Giga
one gigahertz Snapdragon that would make
sense it's very it seems very quick one
gig internal memory and expandable up to
32 what's the expandable format is in
micro SD or right now we have announced
that it will be carried at Rogers from
Canada for q1 q2 time frames the retail
price not yet and disclosed
and the u.s. is not yet been announced
but it is an unlock device it does have
ATT 3g bands no no carrier informations
been released no Carrie okay but it is
running on 18 th 3g network here for the
joke right anything else about the
device that people want to say back
covers internal mold that's what make
you very much every gypsum you cut the
UH do you just want to give you a real
quick size comparison versus the iphone
you can see the screen size difference
of the x10 the four-inch screen to
really shine service by clicking a
standpoint such as you can see sort of
what we're looking at there in the epa 1
megapixel camera is talking about is
right on the back with an LED flash it's
really sort very impressive why this
sony has done here we got nothing on the
left-hand side of the device on the
front you've got just a few buttons
really it's mike the fact this is
running Android and ramin is really
nowhere to be found on here the skins
run all the way through got your a
camera button and short volume up and
down on the side and on the top you've
got your 3.5 millimeter headset jack the
USB charger and the lock button overall
the exit Alex you're really impressive
phone i want to emphasize it well no
carriers have an announced is running on
80 s 3g network further not that's an
intern on the FCC and this was the
sony xperia x10 jon rettinger
