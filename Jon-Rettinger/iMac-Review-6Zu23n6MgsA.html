for lakers calm and I want to give you a
review of my new 24-inch imac just to
recap the specs from the unboxing they
are highlighted by 2.8 gigahertz intel
core 2 duo processor a 24 inch monitor
that's built into the computer a 320
gigabyte hard drive an eight-speed
double air superdrive ati radeon HD 2600
pro at 256 megabytes video ram computer
came stock with q gigabytes of ram i
upgraded to for talk about that a little
bit my apologies in advance my handheld
cameras a little bit on fritz some
should be talking about the computer
instead of showing you but you guys saw
it in the unboxing hopefully i'll put a
link to the unboxing inside bar so first
off i was coming from a macbook pro
which was a year and a half old a 2.4
gigahertz processor and that computer
was fantastic i was just looking for
more of a desktop than that gotta say i
have been thrilled with the imac the
screen size 24 inch gives enough real
estate I don't miss not having two
monitors the resolution is fantastic the
speed even with topeka by to ram the
computer was screaming fast boot up
times under 20 seconds and that's with
everything working for pushing power to
being online opening up buddy programs
about 20 seconds programs loaded quickly
ahead 02 trouble using migration
assistant to migrate all my files over
from my imac so kudos Apple for that
just plugged in a firewire cable and
plugged it into the imac and plugged it
into the macbook pro at work perfectly
things i really liked about the the imac
i really like the aluminum look the
brushed aluminum is being featured more
prominently in all Apple products I like
the glossy finish of a monitor I know
that the people prefer Matt I'm a glossy
fan so I was really happy to have it I
haven't had any reflection issues at all
my computer is right in front of a
window it's not really like it makes the
colors pop and makes it look a little
more vibrant the mat while they might be
a little more natural colors made some
look a little bit washed out I like the
black band around the screen mvi map you
can see
the pictures on apple com just make
screen pop out a little bit more the
size the imac has been fantastic i like
having the all-in-one features it's got
a very small footprint about have a lot
of room on my desk now i can do more
work here that i could be for and with
the wireless keyboard i have much more
real estate on my desk um again
performance why the thing is big
fantastic it's been fast everything I've
asked it to do whether i'm editing
movies in imovie uploading to youtube
using microsoft word playing a game
online or using parallels computer is so
fast usually actually doing all that at
once the computer is still able to
handle it even with two gigabytes of ram
it really was able to handle it as well
so if you're thinking about upgrading to
an imac or getting an imac i can't
recommend it enough i don't think
they're gonna get upgraded for a while I
think the specs right now are perfect so
definitely go ahead and do it if you're
thinking about it upgraded to four
gigabytes Ramage because I do do a lot
of video editing and the crucial was
running a special 400 bucks to get four
gigs so I did it probably didn't have to
but I did I didn't notice a little bit
of a performance increase programs load
a little bit quicker and when I was
running parallel was able to dedicate a
full 2 gigabytes of RAM to windows and
that just made windows for a little bit
faster so 4 gigabytes not necessary but
definitely a nice upgrade if you plan on
doing a lot of process or intensive
stuff or if you plan on using windows
either via parallels or boot camp if
we're going to use vista and boot camp 4
gigabytes is certainly preferred in
trunk give you guys real quick take on
the imac it's just been they've just
been fantastic it's been quick quiet
doesn't get hot I don't have any dead
pixels so my questions people have been
asking computer has just been absolutely
rock solid it can't recommend it enough
if you're looking for a desktop go for
the imac it can give you the best of
both world you can run windows in boot
camp and still have the beauty of mac OS
10 really kind of gives you everything
so just a quick take on the imac once
they get my hand held up and running
i'll give you guys some
some more specs on it and some more
views and Justin recap it's got three
USB ports a mini DVI port 4x4 monitor if
you like firewire 400 500 800 audio in
audio out and a microphone jack it
really has importance for everything um
we'll just been effect as a computer I
can't say enough good things about it
once again Apple impresses me with their
hardware build and the quality of the
operating system so just a quick review
guys this is jon rettinger with john for
lakers calm giving you a quick review of
my 24-inch imac hope you guys enjoyed
and if you'd like to write for the site
at wwwgame-meetcom just an official ha
thought that was your I felt didn't you
fun gigabyte hard drive 4 gigabytes 4
gigabytes 4 gigabytes and I need a
teleprompter how do you get a tissue to
dance don't know you put a little boogie
in it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
