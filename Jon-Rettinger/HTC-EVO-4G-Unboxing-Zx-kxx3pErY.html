TechnoBuffalo world of smartphones there
are now two kings of the ring in one
corner we have Sprint's evo 4G and the
other we have apples just announced
iPhone 4
well the iPhone 4 is not coming out for
a few more weeks but we do have the Evo
4G to be unboxed here phone and I'm very
excited to take a look at will run
through all the specs as we do the
unboxing so let's go ahead and dig right
in I have not seen one use yet in person
we're gonna use of course the obligatory
big all knife and I will try again to
not stab myself so ever and go up down
and this is a demo unit from the folks
at Sprint more packaging they really
wanted to make sure this thing is very
well packaged and here we have the Evo
4G for Sprint so this is going to run
you $199 on contract after of course
rebates thermostat I've heard it seems
to be a well worth the money specs on
this it has a gigantic 4.3 inch screen
with a resolution of 480 by 800 it can
show over 65,000 colors of course
experience the positive it's got a
whopping 8 megapixel camera which can
shoot video in 720p which is obviously
very impressive
it's running a Snapdragon processor
clocked at 1 gigahertz sitting on top of
Android 2.1 and not 2.2 and using HTC
Sense UI and as 512 megabytes of RAM and
about a thousand 24 megabytes of ROM so
enough of a geeky spec let's get to the
phone I'm really excited to see this
kind of comes in a egg carton I guess
eco-friendly packaging go ahead and pull
that off
cardboard cover right on top pull it out
and here we have the Evo 4G this thing
is big I mean you can really that extra
almost inch on the screen you can
definitely tell what doesn't look too
big to not be palpable push it off to
the side and we'll continue our tour and
see what else we get we have a red
battery I think the inside this is red
HTC started doing that with the
incredible push set off keep diggin see
those we get just a standard stuff for
getting started a guy with no one's
gonna read got a wall charger which just
plugs in got a USB port on the end and
we've got a micro USB port so it is a
standard which is nice let's go ahead
and do a size comparison here to see how
this compares to some of its competition
let's take a look at its Android
stablemates first and reach across and
grab it we have the Nexus One definitely
a size difference there and we have
Verizon competition we have the Droid
Incredible right there and you can
definitely see the much larger screen
size let's see if there's any thickness
difference between the three and they
all look to be relatively thin phones so
let's push the other two off to the side
and continue our tour of the Evo 4G now
I don't know if you guys get 4G where
you're at I'm in Southern California we
don't have it quite yet although it is
supposedly coming sometime soon there's
gonna be here on on regular 3G service
on Sprint's Network so we've got dust on
the screen but we have four capacitive
buttons across the bottom sort of your
standard Android buttons you've got your
home your menu your back and search
button there is the front facing camera
which I believe is 1.3 megapixel and QS
F for video calls over quick or Skype I
believe - which is kind of neat on the
left hand side we've got nothing on the
right hand side you've got a volume
rocker up and down and nothing else on
the bottom you've got a stylist not just
kidding there is your charging port and
actually HDMI out which is kind of neat
you can actually use this to plug into
your TV and watch full HD movies right
from your phone we've got a kickstand
which you can use to prop it up if you
want to watch something
on the back there is your 8 megapixel
camera and dual LED flash just kind of
nice in the sprint Evo 4G branding
speaker grille and you a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and I assume is a power in
lock button go ahead and pry off the
battery back so you didn't do this and
let's pop it in and do a first boot up
and let's see if somehow I've got 4G
service where I am which I definitely
doubt this also comes with a mobile
hotspot app so you can use this as a
MiFi device and similar what we've seen
on incredible the back of it is totally
red and it looks like the micro SD card
sort of lodged in there a very weird way
I assume they had to reshuffle with
usually do things to get the extra
antennas for of Y back which is for G to
work again
so your battery again which is big and
red is of size C we can find the size on
this thing well I assume it's gotta be
1500 milliamp hours which should be
quite good to get through a full day's
you go ahead and plug it in and I've
done it tours of Sense UI in the past so
I'm not gonna focus that much one sense
in that coming videos but I will be
doing comparisons with the competition
to see how that stacks up let's go ahead
and do a first boot up and see what we
have like somewhere in gets rid of the
standard Android we get the HTC EVO 4G
and I gotta say this screen is huge in
person but definitely not too big you
could fit into a pocket probably just
the right bigness that you can get sort
of optimal viewing and not look like
you're carrying around like a tablet in
your pocket so we'll go ahead and watch
this boot up screen I'll probably cut
the end of this adapter watches all in
real time sprint splash screen and at
least where I'm in Southern California
sprint service is very strong that
reception is very good I experienced a
very little drop calls when I've used
their network in the past it looks like
that's it's a very quick boot up process
preparing SD card I don't suppose any
way that's gonna say 4G up top probably
not go ahead and push that down
data call failure registration failure
so we got to go through and do all the
on-screen steps
so here is this Ricki before Jean I'll
do a sort of an overview and show you
how things work if I see anything sort
of interesting or notable I'll be sure
to mention it in an upcoming video
anyway I'm John Rhett enger' from the
