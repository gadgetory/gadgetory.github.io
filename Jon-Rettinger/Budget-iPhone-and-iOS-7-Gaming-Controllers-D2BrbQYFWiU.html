to you by Full Sail University welcome
back to the episode of rumor roundup I'm
really strangers the show we take all
the tech rumors from the week from all
over the internet smash up into one
episode so you know everything that's
coming might be coming as a potential to
come or is never going to show up a
consumer electronics world up this week
we're going to talk about a faster
Galaxy s4 and Nokia is upping their
megapixel game budget iPhone cases may
actually reveal the upcoming phones
design an iOS 7 is finally getting
pluggy and game controllers this rumor
roundup
let's get round upping alright so you
know that brand-new super-sweet galaxy
s4 that you just bought turns out it
might already be outdated Samsung co-ceo
jaycation recently promised that a
faster gallic x4 will hit the market
soon although we originally suspected
and meant the phone was going off for
faster data speeds with support for LTE
advanced networks turns out though we
were wrong and I might also offer
Qualcomm's high-end Snapdragon 800
processor which offers way more power
than the current Snapdragon 600 ship in
the galaxy s4 the rest the specs
totally remain unchanged Samsung CEO
suggested the phone will cost more like
current Galaxy s4 so Samsung Galaxy s4
plus supposedly though Samsung's gonna
be announcing this guy soon so maybe if
you want to get a Galaxy s4 at least an
unlocked one you might better off
waiting a few weeks nokia recently
published a blog post that teases its
neck smartphone companies holding a
press conference in New York City on
July 11th but it all confirmed that
we'll see the highly rumored iOS Windows
Phone an image posted by Nokia simply
states 41 million reasons a play
obviously on the 14 megapixel camera
it's rumored for the device
so the smartphone's allegedly heading to
18 t with Windows Phone 8 wireless
charging support for 4.5 inch oil
display and more and as we've seen in no
D to EOS photos 41 megapixel camera I'll
come in at the cost of a large hump on
the back of the device I love the small
price to pay for the high court images
we're expecting from the phone so
your sir mix-a-lot or your like me and
you like bones with some bump in the
back you're going to be very happy we
are going to be at the event so we'll
show you everything that comes out of it
before a Mega Pixel sounds pretty sweet
I could deal with the lecture hump in my
pocket if it meant crazy awesome
pictures I have to lug around another
camera Apple's low-cost iPhone which
many believe will hit later this fall in
emerging markets when obviously if the
device does come it will reportedly
sport a more rounded plastic back
multiple colors and a 4-inch green but
of course nothing is obviously
officially a case leaked on Tuesday
however is adding a little bit more
support to the budget iPhone rumors that
we've been hearing designed by case
maker GM GM not the movie studio the
accessory shows a more rounded back that
slightly thicker than the iPhone 5s
design it's really difficult to tell
anything about the authenticity of it
you can clearly see that it doesn't fit
the iPhone 5 though certainly lines up
with the many rumors you've been hearing
over past several months we know an
iPhone 5s will hit around September
October ish at least that's what history
tells us but the jury's still out on the
cheaper model iOS 7 gaming controller
peers and leaked shots yay one of the
first true game controllers for iPhone 5
will be made by Logitech edging apples
content ecosystem further into handheld
gaming territory Kotaku received an
image of what's clearly an early
prototype saying it is indeed authentic
controller will encase the iPhone 5
rather than connect wirelessly like
previous ones had buried in Apple's iOS
7 announcement this month the company
quietly revealed it would give
third-party manufacturers blueprints and
create gaming controllers this is pretty
significant actually because developers
be able to make games around hardware
without worrying about potential button
mapping issues with unofficial
controllers racing games first-person
shooters and even future iterations of
Infinity Blade to be even more improved
moving forward I'll probably see plenty
of peripherals hit when iOS 7 hits this
fall it doesn't appear that Apple is
intent on making its own game controller
at least not yet
doesn't really have to do with all the
third-party manufacturers so eager to do
the work for them I mean take a minute
