TechnoBuffalo with a full review of the
LG g2 LG's ami for this guy to compete
with the big boys the Samsung Galaxy s4
and HTC One and the top echelon of the
smartphone world I put it through its
paces let's see how it stacks up
so as I do with all my smartphone
reviews I want to give you a disclaimer
I use this phone for five days and then
on and off for two more so before I get
into all the specs and what it can do
run a few let's first talk about call
quality it was overall pretty awesome I
tested it with AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and Verizon
obviously wherever you are it might vary
but it was really really solid I'm using
the AT&amp;amp;T version for this review I
didn't really have any drop calls at all
I did test all three of the carriers
call quality was really really crystal
clear and on all three carriers the
folks on the other end of the phone
couldn't even tell I was using a smart
phone speakerphone was also very loud as
well so if you're one of the few like me
that rely on speakerphone you're gonna
have no issue at all let's jump right in
and talk about hardware this thing is an
absolute beast the Snapdragon 800 flies
the UI is a little bit heavy but we'll
get to that later but everything on this
phone felt amazingly fast I would even
say it's probably the fastest experience
I can remember what does that mean fast
yeah absolute fast games load quickly
but just using the phone we ever feel
any sort of lag at all whether you're
flicking from screen to screen are
opening up a menu of things you just
feel really quick it's hard to sort of
quantify but you feel like you're using
something of extreme power the combo
Snapdragon 800 two gigs of ram really
are the perfect marriage
so the quadrant score I know you guys
want to know is pretty impressive score
of twenty thousand eight hundred and
fifty one damn next let's talk about the
screen honestly I think if I can make a
whole romantic video about how amazing
the screen is just slowly swirling
around looking at it too wistfully
rushing back it's hair this screen is
absolutely incredible and anything I
show you on video is not gonna do it
justice you have to see it to believe it
it's a five point two inch screen with a
1920 by 1080 resolution those numbers
don't do it justice it really is just
incredible indoors outdoors though it
could be in a bit of different story if
you get to put the brightness all the
way up and then it's pretty readable but
if you haven't already might have a hard
time seeing it outside and the cool
thing is LG did it with almost no side
bezel so you really feel like it's just
all screen which is pretty cool
obviously the usual stuff looks great on
at games text pictures and video look
absolutely incredible when it comes to
screen LG
not this so far out of the park that it
went into the next ballpark and was a
home run there as well I'd really give
them credit we've seen an evolution of
LG screens over the past few years
they've really gotten better and better
to culminate until I would probably say
is the best smartphone screen on the
market and I'm saying that in a world of
Retina display is pretty awesome Samsung
displays on HTC is pretty ball - Renault
the HTC one you have to see the screen
to really appreciate how good it looks
all right so next let's jump into
battery life so I didn't thinking all
right you got a combo of a high-powered
process or an HD screen it's probably
not gonna have the best battery and if
you thought that like me you
surprisingly be dead wrong the 3000
milliamp hour battery lasted two days
with decent usage and I do not baby my
phones in fact I turn the brightness up
85% I turn out of totally off connect it
to Wi-Fi pretty much all of the day take
it off the charger on 7:30 about two
hours a phone calls I got two emails
being checked every five minutes I'm
watching videos I'm playing games or
social networking going on I'm really
not taking it easy on the phone at all
by the end of day one when I plugged it
back in or would have plugged it back in
around 11 p.m. I had 60% of my battery
left which is 20 to 10% better when I've
gotten on pretty much every other phone
I've tested really really incredible and
equally surprising all right so let's
get this one out of the way the buttons
there on the back and it's straight up
weird and took me about four days to get
used to it which I definitely did but
boils down to this for me the buttons on
the back don't really do anything people
won't buy this phone because of buttons
on the back but they might not to buy it
because the buttons on the back now I
understand why LG did it you got no
screen bezel maybe not room on the sides
but I didn't really find that it added
much to it but fortunately LG did
include some software to make it so you
really have to fiddle with the buttons
or at least try and find them anyway
with your finger which if you notice was
a pretty awesome segue to talk about
software it's pretty heavy on here but
it never slowed down the phone at all as
I mentioned the beginning this review it
was crazy fast
so I mentioned you don't have to ever
really touch this home button LG's got
some pretty awesome things on here you
can double tap the screen to lock or
unlock it it's pretty brilliant actually
this simple DoubleTap will light up the
screen for you and you can go ahead and
start using it if you
want to lock it again simple double tap
on the screen will send it back to
slumber which is really kind of cool so
I've just got a couple other cool tweaks
in here that we've seen on other LG
phones they got something called Q slide
lets you run sort of two apps background
at an app on your home screen there
aren't that many here to choose from but
there are some decent around things like
email calendar messaging phone and
videos and you can run them just on top
of your screen you can make them
fullscreen you check your calendar kind
of other things they quick phone call
really a very neat thing to do I also
love the way you can remove apps if you
go into settings and you go to your apps
screen in the upper right hand corner
there's a plus or minus so you select
that just like iOS you get a little red
X and you click it and you can delete
apps so it's really really very simple
the UI is very clearly laid out even if
a little bit cartoonish let's move on to
camera the 13 megapixel camera takes
pretty nice shot it's got bright colors
and average in low-light for me though
camera doesn't mean all that much to me
it's nice to say images are just as good
or better than your average smartphone
if you're a huge camera file we'll have
a gallery on the full written review
link down below to see those pictures
look like but they look good they don't
look like you're gonna replay the DSLR
with them but they look pretty decent
alright next let's talk about extras
this one's got some other bits and
pieces in it so first only Verizon has
wireless charging which I found really
annoying I've been loving wireless
charging on my google edition galaxy s4
and I found it really hard to live
without having I know it's kind of silly
but it's got very used to just putting
it on my desk and let it charge or
tonight just put it down on it's a
little charging pad and let it charge so
if you want to use the AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile
versions you are going to be totally out
of luck built quality felt okay but for
not removable back that expects much
more of a premium feel they can do a lot
more we'd have to be able to pull that
plastic back off it feels nice it just
didn't feel great so the conclusion here
LG didn't just bring a phone to compute
the heavy weights they came to win this
phone gets a really really big least all
at 9 if they move the buttons give all
carriers wireless charging made the UI a
little less silly and animation heavy we
probably looking at a perfect 210 this
is an incredible phone probably one of
the best phones I have ever reviewed let
alone reviewed this year I used to
overlook LG and I came to phones I
thought they were really subpar this
changes the game
LLG has a homerun on their hand if
you're looking for a premium smartphone
whether Android or iOS you owe it to
yourself to look at the lg g2 thank you
