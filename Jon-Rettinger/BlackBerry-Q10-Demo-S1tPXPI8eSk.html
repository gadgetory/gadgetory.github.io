the TechnoBuffalo we're quickly checking
out the blackberry q10 it was just
announced today unfortunately we can't
touch it both and go over the spec
series he's got the hardware keyboard a
3.1 inch super amoled display with a 720
x 720 resolution that's a 360 PPI 2 gigs
of ram 16 gigs of storage although you
can expand that with a 64 gigabyte
microSD card dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor megapixel rear facing camera
2-megapixel front-facing camera
Bluetooth 4.0 and FC hdmi out LTE
support hspa+ supporting works a few
things that we are showing off today is
keyboard and the peak flow and hub Sony
and you're typing out an email you have
obviously query to keep out but what you
also have is the next word prediction is
much like the z10 except instead of
flicking you just happy so as you
continue to use the device to learn and
adapt with you in addition it also
supports multiple language
as i type in english and immediately
just convert to spanish it recognizes
both my english answer management's
pretty good another thing that was
mentioned today is blackberry remember
so what i can do is for instance flag
and email go to a different email
account
everybody
applying an email and then when I go
into the remember app that emo comes up
as a nun filed message what I can do is
you simply file that into whatever
folder that I want so say family
vacation and save that and now when I go
back into family vacation that emails in
there and within blackberry remember I
can add photos and websites anything
that I want to remember to a specific
top so basically it's a digital pin
board essentially whatever I want to my
attached to that particular file so
that's just a quick look at bikers in on
the q10 thank you very much my pleasure

can show you unfortunately at this point
