technology but also ushering a few
things that didn't quite live up to
expectations or failed so this is the
list of the top 10 blunders of 2013
let's start with number 10 the HP
Chromebook 11 it looked like there's
going to be an awesome choice for those
don't wanted a low-cost laptop but then
things started catching fire how to get
recalled didn't quite live up to HP's
4-ranked the Chromebook world coming in
at number 9 the Samsung Galaxy gear it
looked like it was three pretty awesome
the first device that was really going
to be that first wearable watch that
everybody needed to have but it was
really hampered by poor battery life
it's crazy expensive and launched with
really no device support other than the
Galaxy Note 3 and not to mention that
awful commercial we used it we tested it
and we just didn't like it number 7 the
iphone 5c we like the phone the phone
was solid but it's really been hampered
by poor sales especially compared to the
gang busters iphone 5s last generation
spec you can make it really hard to last
a full two years iphone 5c well probably
a decent phone was not one of the best
products of last year at number seven I
know I'm gonna get some flack for this
Amazon's prime air drone service it was
nothing more than a brilliant marketing
ploy around black friday can be filmed
in the US because it's super not legal
it is never going to happen I despite
how much i like it to happen but i just
think it got people's expectations
really set for drones delivering
products and they're going to be very
disappointed number six this is one that
affected me and probably a lot of you to
target lost 40 million credit card
numbers in a hack and that is quite a
few especially on the holiday season
we're all shopping at Target and now I
kind of forgot to change all my
passwords number five this one was all
the news toward the middle of the year
the NSA's prism is spying on us all the
big tech companies was revealed we're
giving our information to the government
this prism named never been heard it's
right everybody realized all at once
Wow the government knows a lot about us
more than we'd like them to so be sure
to clear your search history number for
Microsoft's back step on the Xbox one
was first announced it had a ton of
features that people were not happy
about a Microsoft backtrack incredibly
fast on things like no use game or game
shared restrictions no internet
connection required and no connect
required to name a few number three
Samsung's Galaxy s4 active that wasn't
that waterproof it was marketed as for
the one device you could take everywhere
with you won't life not getting away it
can go on the water you know could go in
the sand and it could really take a
lickin and keep on making its phone
calls turns out though it was this
waterproofs people thought and they ran
into a ton of issues with it still a
great phone but I wouldn't take it to
the beach with me number two Microsoft's
crazy Steve Jobs s commercial this was
done in a really poor taste to try and
push a surface commercial essentially
Microsoft had a guy that looked like
Steve Jobs from the back talking about
the surface tablets and it just just
didn't translate very well at all it's
sort of struck as disingenuous and
really not honoring near the memory of
one of the Titans who passed a few years
back and for me the biggest tech blunder
of the year might not be one you think
but affecting me quite a bit Twitter
tries to turn off blocking and that
backfired in four hours was an
incredible misfire I'm Twitter's front
and they've done a pretty good job
they've had a pretty good year wrapping
out of block people especially when
you've got a lot of followers or someone
that's gonna leave you know incredibly
racist or homophobic stuff was a really
big deal happy to see the Twitter
reverse their decision the same day that
they made it so I know some of those
things you guys are going to disagree
with I can already hear people
complaining about the you know Amazon
air or some other things never I love to
know why you disagreeing what you think
the biggest tech blunders of the year
