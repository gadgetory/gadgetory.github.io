for you of the jawbone to notice
canceling bluetooth headset over my
probably five or six years now bluetooth
headsets use quite a few of used
motorola Jabra it would use a nokia
branded one Apple I really use a myriad
of headset so I've got a nice
perspective in which to judge the
jawbone two so you've probably heard the
jawbone two and its noise cancelling
abilities and I can go ahead and text
for them firsthand before I give that
let me give you guys a real quick tour
of the device I gave you one during my
inbox and we need one more let's go
ahead and zoom in just a little bit so
you can see the device a little better
but you can see it really is quite small
and see my mouth just sort of talking as
I'm doing this it's lightweight doesn't
weigh much at all and actually has two
buttons on spike now looking like it has
any it's got one main button right in
the middle can push for using call hang
up and call your phone supports voice
tiling that's what will activate and
also another button on the back right
there which adjust the volume in turns
on or off the noise cancelling now go
ahead and zoom back out just a little
bit there we are so it really does fit
nicely in your ear it comes with ear
looms but I just like to turn it off to
take that off I'm not the biggest fan of
your lips itself it also comes
prepackaged with a whole bunch of little
ear jail so finding the fix you're the
best to put it right in and since
they're nice and comfortably on the top
of it there's this little sort of button
and that has to rest right on your
jawbone surprisingly enough and what
that does it actually takes the
vibrations from your jawbone translates
into the sound transit's that sound
obviously over the airwaves so by doing
that it blocked out the ambient noise
behind you it's actually getting the
voice from coming out your mouth to
actually traveling straight up right
into the headset so it is a very cool
technology so I tested the headset with
rain in the background car noise in the
background I had a friendship papers and
background while I was making phone
calls and people had no
idea that there was any noise going on
this thing is fantastic if you drive a
convertible there's a lot of windows
where you live far as I'm concerned this
and the only headset to get it has been
absolutely fantastic as far as blocking
out background noise call quality was
clear people on the other end whether
the north captain was on her off didn't
even know I was on a Bluetooth headset
really does have a wonderful job that
being said though if this little white
part isn't resting right on your jawbone
people on the other end aren't going to
hear anything so you have to do a little
bit of addressing you do have to get
used to it just a little bit it can kind
of be a little bit squirrely sometime
once you get it right you can feel it
touching really have no issues at all
and it stays like i mentioned station
your ear a nice toilet here listen to
music or bumping around no matter what
it is that you're doing so that's the
price of the heads that really does very
sure you have to go ahead and do a
search to see the average prices ranging
or from 100 up to 200 bucks but i can
again I can certainly recommend this
device it was sent to me courtesy of the
guy that my gears for calm I'll put a
link to them up in the sidebar and if
you like the heads that you can order it
i'll give you a temper south anything in
their catalog so guys in conclusion
jawbone bluetooth headset i'm writing
this on a scale from one to ten this
gets a resounding nine and a half it's
probably one of the best sounding
headsets I've ever used it's actually
now become my primary headset that I
created with me on my car I'm really
happy to have it my engine that can be a
little bit loud sometimes when people
are always complaining now they can't
even tell him driving so guys with all
the hands-free laws everyone needs a
bluetooth headset highly recommended
fixing your ear nice and comfortably and
you're off and again for exclusive
content be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter com / John for lakers hope you
guys enjoyed and I will see you in the
next video and for those of you that
stuck around this long picture that I
put it behind you finally is a picture
of a golden pagoda from my trip to Japan
about 10 years ago i backpacked through
China
japan after my first year of college so
that was a picture from that trip I
thought it was appropriate I'll probably
cycle a couple things in and out of here
turning other videos I said before hope
you enjoy jon rettinger and i'll see you
guys next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
