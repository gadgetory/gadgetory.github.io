Holiday Gift Guide event taking a look
at the I think just announced AT&amp;amp;T
version of the Xperia Play you can walk
us through some of the goodness maybe
talk a little bit about the specs and
show us what you can expect absolutely
so like I said we have the sony ericsson
xperia play now for the first time
available on a TV and it will be a 4g
phone brett names f 4g hspa+ or LTE oh
we know right now is it will be 4g and
will be available by your end okay so
the first thing does cosmetically you
have a new stealth blue color options so
in addition to that baseball actually
saw on verizon wireless have a new
stealth flu so both colors will be
available that's correct it's great by
itself you have a front facing front
facing camera and the rear facing camera
and is running of course android 2.3
gingerbread blue food so go ahead which
version to get right to the point very
two or three years point there so the
game the device will come pre-loaded
with several titles as you saw on the
verizon version this time it's asphalt 6
adrenaline the racing title a dungeon
defenders second wave third person
action / RTS almost RPG with leveling up
this will be the exclusive to the HTM
tiver ssion really fun game will have
been playing ton of it matt NFL the sims
3 and also
come pre-loaded with Nova to another
exclusive our first person shooter that
I think most people will really find
takes advantage of that neutral really
difficult to pull off a first-person
shooter on a touchscreen phone so you've
got your d-pad the dual touch analog
sticks your iconic PlayStation Certified
button and the toll the keys and let's
quickly load up this is a prototype
device so we can show you all the games
today we can show you mad what was it
loading respect damn point I really
think the same specs as the rides the
versions of a 4-inch scorpion processor
in there yeah absolutely have the
snapback adrenal grab between Qualcomm
you've got a four inch multi-touch
screen I'm so same same Hardware on the
phone just running on a faster network
as soon as you can probably hear these
speakers are quite loud buzzing loud
else is cool about the play is not only
does take advantage of these full places
and certify controls but it also takes
an agile is touchscreen so in games
you'll find yourself playing games with
the buttons and quickly having to tap
the screen so it's really a totally new
immersive gaming experience I'll go
ahead and check
pick up lay here
you got thousands of people watching you
here you better move find the game those
a nice run we had a good run there
probably real Reggie Bush to do that and
absolutely so as I said this one will be
available by year-end thank you for
checking it out thank you very much Bob
i preciate time
and we're looking at a release sometime
before the end of the year claims AT&amp;amp;T
this fact she hasn't even been
officially announced they just happen to
have one sitting here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
