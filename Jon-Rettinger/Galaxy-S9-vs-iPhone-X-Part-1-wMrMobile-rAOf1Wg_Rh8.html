our skills to get ready for this versus
moment we're gonna be comparing the two
biggest flak chips in the market and of
course being a TechnoBuffalo versus
won't be a cop-out at the end we will
declare a winner this is the iPhone 10
versus the Galaxy S 9 you know what that
sounds like a little bit of fun can I
join you on that you also want to piss
off 50% your audience
let's make YouTube is for isn't it let's
do it all right
I'm mr. mobile I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo and this is iPhone 10
versus Galaxy S 9 so this is clearly a
different versus I am obviously
outclassed by my coalos but we are still
going to compare these phones and like I
said we are going to give a winner but
to make it a bit unique
Michael I are each going to have a vote
on each of our four categories and they
are camera software build and tangibles
as a bonus at the end we're gonna give
serve our personal opinions on the
phones as a whole just to make a little
more fun we're gonna split it into two
videos the first one is of course gonna
live here - what you're about to watch
the second one lives on my channel
youtube.com/ / - d mr mobile and of
course willing to adhere down below and
subscribe and check out over there to
see who the winners gonna be you want to
find out let's start it all right let's
not put it off let's do the hard one
first you're gonna tell everybody what
operate system you prefer I am NOT going
to do that I'm gonna do the camera bit
camera cameras physically speaking these
are very similar very similar and we're
talking about the s9 plus here we should
clarify not the standard eslint I figure
is best apples to apples comparison I'm
leaving thank you so we've got the two
12 megapixel cameras on each both are
optically stabilized on boats are wide
and telephoto lenses yep both have
rather excessive low-light capabilities
but one of them edges out the other
already in that respect so I mean you're
putting the photos side by side and if
you can't immediately tell the
difference no one is gonna blame you but
when you start taking them into extreme
situations like very very dark
environments the s9 + starts showing its
advantage let's reactants we try to see
the advantages with the variable
aperture that Samsung has done naturally
the big difference with the 9 + versus
the 8 + yeah and we've seen I mean by
now we've seen endless close-up shots of
this variable aperture doing its thing
this mechanical IR s closing over the
lens and it is too cool I could watch it
forever but what it results in in the
real world is that you can really get a
whole lot more light into the end of the
camera and I've gotten some really
excellent low-light shots from the front
we'll say the general shots on the same
thing though like Samsung likes to do
they're a little poppy little extra
extra contrast II that's exactly what I
was gonna say yeah with an iPhone you
tend to get a much more or true-to-life
not much more you get a slightly more
true-to-life shot coming out of the
phone that you can then manipulate as
you like Samsung tends to produce one
that's a little more ready for instant
instagramming and so if you want
something that's a little more authentic
yeah the iPhone is your way to go but
the thing that puts it over the top for
me there are two things can we talk
about video yeah can we talk about super
slow-mo I mean I guess we have to thank
you everyone thinks it's a gimmick I
just adore it because I used it on a
Sony phone for a while last summer and
you can really do some incredible time
travel so Samsung basically lifted that
feature and you can shoot at 960 frames
a second for a fifth of a second which
is all you need when you're shooting
something really fast the iPhone camera
the camera though is no slouch on the
iPhone and I think when you compare
pictures and normal light scenarios
side-by-side still they come down to a
preference do you like the poppier more
vibrant colors that samsung tends to do
I think the samsung's credit there's a
lot less processing in the image than
there was it like a galaxy s 8 yeah I
think I think you're right on that I
think also though like there is so much
I'm looking at the viewfinder right now
and there is so much packaged up in the
s9s viewfinder that I tend to prefer cuz
I like the ability to go manual and
stuff without downloading another app on
the iPhone though to your point it is a
much more just pick it up and shoot and
you're probably good but it is something
and that's kind of a microcosm for like
iOS and Android like you pick it up and
it's gonna work you're getting more
granular options I mean you've got a
food mode built-in I mean to the sensor
but you are getting still a really good
camera and I think when it comes to the
iPhone picture
getting colors that are more true to
life as opposed to start a little more
vibrant so you get on Samsung right so
that's going to be a preference I think
we check to see a difference between the
two we talked about the variable
apertures and a little light there's a
definite difference with the artifact in
the background in low-light situations
mmm
I think the slo-mo if you're going to
use it it's a benefit to the Samsung
Apple has it it's 240 at 1080 but also
Samsung as RAM built into their camera
module to process all of those that to
hold all those images that are coming in
which is which is very cool but you're
picking a phone based just on camera
you're getting more with one of the
phones in art or the other and I think
the trap can be very often just doing
these side by side shots which I do and
I like to see how they perform on the
same screen and I'll do one of the same
photo with both phones and I'm like well
half the time I'll take one half the
time I'll take the other for me the more
important question to answer is what
kind of camera experience do you want
and for me given all the out-of-the-box
options I get the s9 plus is the way
that I tend to go yeah I mean and I
think a lot of people would go that same
way but if I'm picking one up because I
want the best pictures and I want the
best video options I'm still going for
the Samsung so let's go from a hard
category to category littered with it
commenter landmines let's let's talk
about software
all right so starting the discussion
with software the iPhone we talked about
making us not an iOS versus Android but
the software experience I think is very
relevant to the phone experience yeah so
when it comes to the iPhone technical
system mm-hmm and I think that's
obviously apples Britain but it's like
people come back to iPhones things that
just work together you know photos
iMessages Apple pay all sort of stuff
yet coming together and sort of one
seamless don't need to think about it
packaged and there are some things that
are still infuriating with the iPhone 10
and an iOS experience
I can't simply add a shortcut to just
direct dial my wife mm-hmm
I can't choose to just put my hat at the
bottom of my screen without creating
invisible shortcuts in quarters sort of
sort of hacking it to make it work there
are a lot of OS shortcomings that
all sort of boils down to customization
yeah customization is the name of the
game and as always with Android that's
where it's that I mean it's just a
bucket of choice you can change your
layout you can change your options you
can change your widgets you can change
you can I haven't always on display if
you want to if you don't like any of it
you can change your launcher so you
don't have to put up with it you know so
there's a lot of added complexity that
gets introduced as a result I mean the
s9 is not as simple to immediately pick
up and use as the iPhone 10 maybe if
specially if you're not coming from
another Android phone and there's a lot
of duplicate functionality that Samsung
has dropped onto it but still at once
again we come back to the point of it in
the camera section you can do what you
want the option exists if you can think
of it on the s9 plus I really like the
Samsung experience which what they're
calling it now you know there's sort of
four core skin on Android ever you want
to call it on the s9 line devices and on
the note line devices I think it's
really good and in some ways I think
it's even better than what you get with
stock Wow
some ways bold move ya know and I don't
disagree one bit because as I say like
even Android stock Android has started
to take over take after iOS in in the
ways of some kind of simplicity and you
know like minimalism and that's really
cool in its own right but if you want
the option to do anything with the
Samsung launcher it's there and I do
want to say I think unique to the iPhone
10 there is a for the first time a
software learning curve with the iPhone
yeah that you know Android is always a
knock on Android you have to learn how
to use it
you have to relearn how to use iOS with
the iPhone 10 and also this is a point I
did want to make in the iPhones favour
as well but we've come to this point of
saying like well iOS and Android are
kind of equal in terms of what apps are
supported all the stuff and that's
largely true but this is a fitness
accessory of the motive smart ring that
only has an iOS app right now or last I
checked I use a microphone back in the
studio that only has an iOS app it's
like it's there is still an edge so if
you had to pick one of these phones
based solely on the software experience
I don't think it's gonna be any surprise
it would be the galaxy s 9 for me I've
almost always gone Samsung these verses
when it comes to software until the
iPhone 10 I really like what Apple's
done with iOS there are a lot of things
you can improve on a lot of ways it can
get better
yeah the app experience is still better
on iOS and for all of those reasons I'm
actually for the first time in a while
I'm picking the iPhone 10 for software
we thought we got the hard one out of
the way but now things get a little
tighter when we talk about build build
quality what do we mean by that
industrial design how it feels in the
hand how it looks we were gonna say I
would look for the screen off but no the
screen is a huge part in this so do you
mind if I jump right into the screen do
it up I think which one you prefer is
gonna depend an awful lot on that notch
Oh dad notch and I listen I don't think
we need to go too far into how we each
feel about the notch I like it I'm gonna
ask you how you feel about it I have
become more knotch impartial I was not
not favorable at the beginning you were
not not friendly I was not not not
friendly not friendly not friendly
always friendly yeah III think I always
quite liked it actually I liked how the
radius is of all the corners match and
like it's really really beautiful but I
think Samsung's approach is the cleaner
one yeah the the prettier one this game
still falls off the edges like it's like
it's done for a while in that infinity
pool kind of thing but you get this
rather nice symmetry between top and
bottom yeah there's a little bit of a
taller forehead in the s9 plus but it's
I don't know it's it's it's less
distinctive I said this about my review
and I think it's becoming less a matter
of opinion more a matter of fact but
same time makes the best displays in the
business yeah and even if you like the
display on the iPhone better you still
like a samsung Display Samsung made the
display on the Apple iPhone 10 so just
wrap your head around that if you didn't
know it right and also I we shouldn't
say that there are not differences
though I feel like the iPhone 10 does
have a more favorable score in terms of
color tuning it's a little more accurate
but if you can see that with a naked eye
you have much better eyes than I
to me both of these displays are just
stunning I like the higher contrast to
of the samsung Display yeah that's a
personal preference thing but I prefer I
still think the displays on the Samsung
line of phones look like stickers and I
can look like real phones yeah but if
you like a phone that changes its it's
white point all the time to match the
room it's in Samsung does this to a
degree to Apple does it better it's one
of those really tiny little pieces of
attention to detail but that Apple's
just been doing for a while I agree so
what about the builds the rest of the
way around the phone this is where it's
really really really difficult because I
think both of these are finished
tremendously but into my view one of
them comes away not the clear winner but
the winner if you think about it for a
second okay and I think it's the iPhone
10 why because it's made of this is the
galaxy s 9 is 7000 series aluminum
that's great it's stronger than the
previous aluminum they were using this
is stainless steel and this is an
interesting category I think in previous
gen especially with the SK Samsung and
run away with this category versus any
of the competition because the s8 design
was like peak smartphone design mm-hmm
and it's an S year for Samsung a lot of
phone manufacturers do that it's if it's
an iterative update
whereas this generation is a completely
new look feel design everything for the
iPhone for the iPhone 10 yeah and still
it has preserved you know what the one
thing is that that that gave me it gave
the iPhone 10 the the win for me mmm can
I say that yeah you can say it I haven't
given my my wonder alert
I like the iPhone one better but it's
big I had to take the phones apart to do
it not really I had to pop a sim tool
into the sim tray pull them both out and
you know that feeling if you've moved
into enough Samsung phones where it
flexes around because it's plastic
yeah because who cares about the SIM
tray Apple did the thing where they
paint the back side of the fence or
whatever because you never see it except
when you first move into the phone and
it's that really nice metal SIM tray and
you know the whole phone is built to
that standard of excellence so that's
what put it over the top for me as
foolish as you may think that is not you
you
so for me looking at both these phones I
love the way they both feel the iPhone
10 just feels different perhaps because
it is different for Apple I mean despite
my hairline notch built into the top I
don't mind that and I've gotten used to
it more than I did at the beginning I
loved the build of the iPhone 10 I can
deal with the knotch I can deal with the
camera humps I love the way that phone
is constructed and you feel like you are
holding something incredibly premium
which is not to say that s9 isn't but I
could close my eyes and hold an s8 and
an s9 and they feel the same premium but
the same but for this category it's a
phone yet so we've covered a lot of
landmine categories but we are not done
in our vs. we still have yet to cover
intangibles we've yet to declare our
winner and for the first time in two
verses we're gonna talk a little bit
more about personal preference so if you
want to see who wins you want to see
those categories there's only one place
to do it that's at my youtube channel
youtube.com slash the mr. mobile we're
gonna cover the rest of that and maybe
make some people mad make some people
happy I'm probably a little bit of both
so we're gonna link to Michael's channel
down below go check out that video and
while you're there of course at that
subscribe button because who wouldn't
want to see that face pop up pretty
regularly Wow
and also is one of the bests in the
business so if you like tech videos you
haven't checked out Michael you're not
gonna find anyone better than what he's
gonna be putting out we're too kind
if I may one thing before we go over
there you do have to be in uniform so I
brought you something
