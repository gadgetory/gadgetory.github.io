review for you of the I power backup
battery for your iphone ipod touch or
ipod really anything with apple's
proprietary port this sucker will charge
now you may have seen the unbox you may
have not actually what it is is an
eighteen hundred million power backup
battery thankee hundred million power is
actually very impressive most phones
even the big beefy phones generally only
ship with a fourteen hundred million of
our battery so this is having almost
like a battery and a quarter to backup
your iPhone those of you that have an
iphone 3g you'll know battery life not
as strongest point something like this
can be very important so before i get
into review let me preface this by
saying a few things first of all the
folks at I power very nice up to 72 and
fortunate that they did because the
first one they sent actually broke it
stopped charging it wouldn't hold a
charge and it stopped charging devices
so I was a little put off and but the
second one they sent this white one just
different than the black pony somnium
box works flawlessly so I want to be
honest and keep you guys my full
feedback so if you have to say the first
one didn't function this one works
perfectly odds are it was just a bum one
that was probably more of an exception
rather than the rule but definitely
something to keep in mind so let's go
ahead and get down to the nitty-gritty
so it looks just like a little square
with a small light in the middle you can
go ahead and take the top off and it's
got a port that plugs right in on the
top of it I'll zoom in here so you guys
can see what I'm talking about on the
top there's a power on/off and a mini
USB port for charging which is actually
very nice if they use a standard
charging port going to pull back out a
little bit so it plugs very simply write
your iPhone it's an external dongle and
it stays like that so there's a few pros
and cons about this first let's talk
about the pros it is a huge battery 1800
milliamp hours in a small package is
fantastic this almost triples the life
of your iphone's battery which is great
if you're traveling you for a while
on a movie to do a lot of web browsing
emails whatever you do you find yourself
constantly running low on battery this
is a great option because well you can
go through almost three times as long so
that's why that's a quite positive about
it next my saying that's power on and
off so it's not always sipping power
when it's in standby are off mode that I
really do like I also like that it uses
a standard charging port like mini USB
instead of some strange private area
format so that is very nice it's also
sleek and very pocketable as you guys
can say really it's thin and has a nice
look to it if it comes in black or white
to match your iPhone obviously here i'm
using the white one so some of the cons
about the device well it's an external
download so you can't just throw this in
your pocket you can't throw in your
backpack and let it charge really has to
be sitting out on a desk otherwise it's
gonna snap right off the connection is
very strong we can see it's sort of
bending a little bit as I'm holding it
so it does make it a little bit awkward
second thing if you want to make a phone
call wire on it there is a little bit of
a gap between the charge and the
microphone port but people who are
speaking to when I had this charge in
did report some little bit of muffled
call some place i'm going to keep in
mind so who is this for if you are a
road warrior and you need a big backup
battery this is a fantastic option
because it's so big and because it has
such a large charging capacity it really
can carry you for a long time and i say
big only in terms of size of the battery
not physical size of device is actually
in a very slim package so I power gives
you a few benchmarks they claim it'll
extend music up to 40 hours let's send
your video up to 10 hours and looks at
and talk time up to 7 hours all of which
are very impressive so if you're a road
warrior you're traveling quite a bit
need something to charge your device
while you're on an airplane this is a
really good option plug it in leave it
on your tray table and you are good to
go who is it not good for those of you
that uses the your iPhone quite a bit
but around the go along I have to keep
putting in your pocket or putting in a
backpack you can have a hard time
putting this in your backpack when it's
plugged in certainly it's possible most
not plugged in but when you're using it
not so good next thing and it's
definitely a pro for the device is that
it charges the iphone from zero to full
charge you just about an hour and a half
so if you do have an hour and a half
plug it in and let it go and you'll have
a full charge on your phone and after
your full charge this thing will still
have about three quarters of a charge
left in it which is really cool so let
me explain it I might not have made
sense if your iphones on zero charge and
this is on full charge and then you plug
this in and tried your iphone all the
way up this will still have three
quarters of a charge left which is
really impressive so i want to give you
guys pros and cons to recommend this yes
I definitely can recommend it but it's
not for everyone if you meet that
segment that this is for your doctor
regret it it's a great product so the
folks at I powered I just have to hook
