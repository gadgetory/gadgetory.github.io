might be looking at your galaxy note 5
and thinking you are due for an upgrade
while it's only one generation but to
model numbers of parts are a lot of
things that have changed with the galaxy
note 7 before we tell you about what's
changed there's a lot that's the same
here as well we've got that same 5.7
inch qHD screen looks absolutely
beautiful the same four gigs of ram we
have from last generation the usual
suspects have improved processors now
faster than it was before both phones
are very fat you'll be hard pressed by a
nice to be different from this
generation to the note 7
but there are some drastic changes that
you might want to consider for one of
these or more than one of these are
important to you the first is
waterproofing ip68 is now on a note line
of phones what its gonna mean is you can
submerge this thing in 5 feet of water
from to 30 minutes or just like take it
in the shower and jot down notes because
a new it improved s-pen it's also IP 68
it also has double the sensitivity that
the s-pen in the galaxy note 5 has and
if I've learned anything over my years
more sensitivity the better that's going
to translate to do some more elegant
writing Sprint's you take out the pen
they start to write on the screens you
can do while the screen is often even
kidnet your long train it's really quick
you don't have any sirs will hack me yet
from older generation styluses not
surprisingly on the most recent note
device it's the best version of the
s-pen and also just a note sans leg now
won't let you put the thing in backwards
battery life is also a big reason you
might want to consider upgrading get
about a 17% increase in battery life
from the 5 to the 7 there's an extra 500
milliamp hours that have gone into note
7 it's up to 3500 so better is important
to you you might want to consider the
note 7 fast charging is here as well
same with the note 5 another big reason
you may want to consider upgrading is if
you're running out of storage the note 5
came in two flavors either 32 or 64 gigs
of storage with no option for external
storage remember when that was the thing
Samsung did for one generation that is
the rectified on the note line 64 gigs
is the only size you can get and now
there's our microSD card
you can pop in there between 256 gigs
and just store all your charger stuff
if security is also important to you you
might really like the iris scanner
that's built into the phone it's not
like the old space scanners you have on
Android this actually uses your eyeballs
to unlock your phone I'm still testing
it so far though it worked pretty well
in low light they give you mornings with
glasses by Travis my glasses on and it
worked if you use contacts when you wear
sunglasses a lot maybe not a big deal
breaker for you but the fingerprint
reader is also here to use as backup
there's less changes in the camera
department in fact a megapixel edges
down on the note 7 the same sensor
that's been in a galaxy s7 s7 edge a 12
megapixel sensor is here versus a 16
megapixel sensor on the galaxy note 5
that's going to translate to I can talk
about micron pixels and that kind of
stuff
the images are going to be sharper on
the note 7 but you can't blow them up to
a giant resolution as you could on the
note 5 also OS is built-in so you can
have a shaky hand you might appreciate
the camera on the note 7 but the camera
I don't think is a big enough reason to
upgrade both are really good other small
things to note USB see is now the
standard on the note 7 that's important
to you you can you're gonna be pretty
happy some software changes as well the
camera UI is different you can create
jig gifts moving pictures directly from
video that you're watching or create
it's kind of a cool addition to the
software and design the design is a
little bit different here it's a little
subtle when you compare them side to
side you can see the difference they
both have the same metal bands around
them but now the metal band on the note
7 has a color matching to the color
device itself it's a small thing but I
think it makes the note 7 look a little
bit better
other additions things like Gorilla
Glass 5 over here got the new dual
curved display that we've seen on the s7
edge I don't really use the edge panels
but like the way it looks and I don't
want to understate what a difference 2
millimeters thinner actually means this
feels more phone in your hand and less
tablet something that I really
appreciate what I've been using it those
are the giant differences in the big
similarities between the two phones is
it a huge update no is Evolutionary yeah
it is but that evolution might be enough
a reason for a lot of you guys to
consider upgrading your phones I use the
note 5 extensively after holding this
guy
and I can see why people would want to
upgrade it feels good the screen is
absolutely beautiful it looks better and
direct sunlight despite the same
resolution than the note 5 and I think
Samsung just has the best screens going
what do you guys think is it worth the
upgrade figure one here thoughts on it
even a comment down below so I'm
wrapping up the note 7 Versa note 5
video end of the day you're in
California

me up and also give me some nutrients I
