TechnoBuffalo here we're at the Sony
booth quite clearly at CES 2014 Windows
8 assured in a ton of non-traditional
nope old laptop crazy hybrid designs we
think you look at probably one of my
favorite the Sony Vaio duo 13 it's got a
frieze and sliding mechanism and a
gorgeous screen and it's made of carbon
fiber let's take a first look so take a
look at it now it just looks like maybe
a regular laptop with the weird edge but
check this out it just slides right down
and you go ahead and take with you it's
incredibly thin and really light and
again it may told you of carbon fiber so
13-inch this is probably one of the
better-looking displays I've ever seen
it's a triluminos 1080p screen and
there's not a pixel to be seen here at
all we've got a power button living
right there on the left hand side on the
back is where you are gonna find the
porter eight you've got a multi card
reader which I really like there is your
fan HDMI out two USB 3.0 through bottom
of your headset jack and there is where
your power is going to go and as with
screens with really high resolution
displays often times three to be some
sort of pen input and Sony's got one
here for you it doesn't slide in or hide
anywhere the external display they use
it of course to control and then there
are built-in applications that you can
go ahead and draw with which actually
relatively on the neat side so if we go
into you know desktop mode you can see
how you can sort of draw in it's really
quick motion usually there's a delay but
it feels really almost one-to-one as I
move and I'll try it
I'll try and draw a little stick figure
guy here for you he's got legs
you've got arms
he's got hair and he's happy and it
works very well to get made of metal on
his feels really solid I like this
design I'm not sure what is that so
appealing about me maybe just that's a
sort of a new style so it's open it up
you just go ahead and sort of give it a
little bit of a give a nudge and it
slides open lift up and slide and there
it goes and just very cool so if you
want a tablet you want the power of the
fortune raishin Haswell chip you want a
full size keyboard with a trackpad some
competitors have something similar but
none have a trackpad here you're going
to be completely all set of course
you've got your standard window button
there and all your windows eight kind of
features you know and love are your
there used to be an 11 inch version but
that sort of since been taken away so 13
inches all you can get with this guy and
it is available now thank you guys for
watching I hope you enjoyed please check

course check out all the tech coverage
