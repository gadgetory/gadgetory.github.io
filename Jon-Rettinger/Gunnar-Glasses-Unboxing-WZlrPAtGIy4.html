from TechnoBuffalo here as you can
probably guess I spend a lot of time in
front of a computer and as such I get a
lot of eye strain man I start to hurt
after a while and I kind of get that
buggy feeling when you just can't look
at a monitor anymore well I've got a
product here that claims to fix that
these are a pair of the gunner optics
performance digital glasses they're
calling them these I believe are the
edge model and essentially what these
things do is they relax your eyes by
reducing glare and supposedly improving
contrast to focus on that will help you
combat the harsh lighting of an office
or a computer screen so they say that
the benefit is kind of feeling a longer
visual endurance but I guess I will be
the judge of that let's go ahead and
unbox these and if you want some more
information on the product it's a gun or
optics comm and I'll put a link in the
sidebar
we'll take the obligatory big ol knife
and we will dig into this there we go
probably one supply should be enough to
open this up yeah I'm curious this
product works as advertised it'll be
quite nice you know for those long times
when you're playing a game or writing a
paper or whatever it might be
not even just browsing online here I
start to hurt and I know you guys have
probably had that buggy experience too
there we go
one more cut alright and we are in
almost maybe they tape this thing up
good okay so here are the gunnar glasses
looks like there's some PR information
comes in a pretty nice sort of soft feel
box almost like the back of some of the
BlackBerry device from the windows
mobile devices that have that soft sort
of rubbery coating feel so that's nice
to see okay a high quality box Gunnar on
the front the Gunnar logo on the side
really nothing on the back other than
telling you what they are so it's saying
these are the colour lens edge expresso
amber with some skew information let's
go ahead and open these things up the
Box just slides up there's another box
underneath and this one has that same
sort of rubbery feel to it but a little
bit more so it's not gonna slide around
on the table in the box we've got some
information limited warranty all that
business
and so I'm tissue paper so let's take a
look at the glasses themselves it's like
the top part slides up and they sit in
the box pretty nicely they give you a
cleaning cloth and the cleaning bags you
can actually put them in here and use
that to clean them as well and here are
the glasses they sit in that box quite
nicely they have a little bit of a
yellow hue to them and they've got
started the same coating on that the
iPhone uses the Olaf obits brain to
reduce smudging with your fingers I
touched my glasses a ton if you guys are
prescription glasses users they also
have a prescription option you can do or
you can put in your prescription so you
can see and also not have tired eyes so
I'll close this up I will try these for
a while and show you what they look like
although I will put them on right now
and let you guys see what they look like
alright guys so here are the gunner
glasses you can sort of see how thick
the lenses are they're very lightweight
let's put them on they don't look too
bad I'm not saying I'd go run out and
pick up a date in these but for when I'm
at home working on a computer or outside
working on a laptop
he looks like they'll prevent a little
bit of sunlight from coming in and also
they'll prevent that eye fatigue so that
does look to be quite and I just want to
show you what they look like on here's
kind of a profile shot and as you can
see sort of what they would look like on
you anyway hope you enjoyed for it's
