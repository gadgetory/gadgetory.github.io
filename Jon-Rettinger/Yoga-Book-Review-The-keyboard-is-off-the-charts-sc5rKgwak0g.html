from TechnoBuffalo and a couple weeks
ago Lenovo announced a really cool and
really interesting device the yoga book
it's fascinating for a bunch of reasons
we're going to be reviewing it today
let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing and probably the most
standout feature to me is the design it
looks amazing
probably one of the best-looking devices
I've ever seen the design alone gets me
and a lot of other people excited from
the hands to the thinness that slate
black.look that it has it's superb it
actually won the red dot design award in
2016 which I totally agree with the
design is also partially why it succeeds
as a convertible where a lot of other
devices have failed in my opinion most
devices are not 5050 laptop and tablet
as their manufacturers might want
they're usually 6040 maybe 60% of laptop
40% tablet 60% tablet 40% laptop I would
say the yoga book falls in the 6040
leaning towards the tablet side it's a
bit more of a tablet than it is a laptop
and the reason is because the keyboard
is probably one of the coolest and yet
the weakest parts of the device as a
whole that's not to say that it's bad
it's actually really good for what it is
but by no means will it replace or give
you the same functionality a regular
clicky keyboard what key travel would
give you the keys are completely flat
and light up so it looks like it's
straight out of Tron Legacy which is
awesome and will get a lot of heads
turning once you're actually using it
you do get used to it it's a bit like
typing on a touchscreen I'd say a little
bit better since you have a rested place
to put your wrists and it feels a little
more like a keyboard it's a bit of a
hybrid maybe but of course you can't
just rest your fingers on the keys which
makes it a little difficult to remember
intuitively exactly where all the keys
were so overall in coolness factor I
would say this keyboard is absolutely
off the charts with functionality in
mind however I'd say it falls right in
between most tablet on-screen keyboards
and most clicky laptop keyboards not as
good as clicky laptop keyboards or even
desktop keyboards but it is better than
most on screen tablet keyboards the
success of the design continues onward
with the thinness when you're in laptop
mode you're not going to really notice
it it's super thin obviously but what's
more interesting is when you flip it
back into tablet mode it's so thin that
even with two layers it's still about as
thick as a standard tablet would be and
that's why you can use it as a tablet
without thinking like oh this is a lap
pretending to be tablet it really feels
like a good solid tablet that brings me
onto the hinge which I think is
absolutely beautiful it looks like a
piece of jewelry and it works really
well
however in laptop mode like the
Microsoft Surface the hinge is not as
strong as I would like so when you're
using it as a touchscreen the hinge does
flex a little bit but you can use it for
a couple touches and presses right and
then there but you're not going to be
leaning on it as a touchscreen device
with when it's in laptop mode in regards
to processing horsepower you have four
gigs of RAM and you're running an Intel
Atom processor I didn't notice any
slowdown it's probably because we're
running the Android version so that
makes it a little bit easier for the
tablet to power through whatever it's
doing we would love to test and compare
when we do get the Windows version in
and see what the slowdown comparisons
are like or how much you can really
throw at it
but like I mentioned on Android it works
seamlessly the display is in 1920 by
1200 display and it is stunningly sharp
in a slightly wide bezel so if you're
not a fan of that that is going to be an
issue for you for me I don't really mind
bezels that much so it's a great viewing
experience again combined with the sort
of flip ability of the device you can
put it in tent mode watch movies in bed
it works really great for that as well
and if that wasn't enough the yoga book
also has another feature it comes with a
pen and so when you flip it down or even
just having a laptop poet and press a
little button you can switch into using
the pen mode so the whole keyboard
disappears and becomes like a big
trackpad on which you can draw with the
pen and it works really well it doesn't
have as many sensitivity points in
something like a Wacom tablet or even as
a surface book but it does have some
sensitivity when you're drawing with
like a pencil or something you can go
from sketching and making dark lines
it's a very good note-taking device but
what makes it better than any other
note-taking device in my opinion is that
you can switch out the tip and put a
physical pen tip and with real aim put a
sheet of paper over the device and use
it as a notebook so essentially you're
making notes with a pen it's pushing
through and you're having a digital copy
as well as a physical copy I'm not a
college student but I would imagine if I
was that would be an awesome feature to
have and very very practical so
switchable pen tip sounds really great
in theory the one issue I ran into is
where do you put the other pen tip when
you're not using it you got to come up
with your own sort of storage solution
because they don't send it with a pouch
or anything like that but I guarantee
you in real usage I would end up either
breaking it or losing it
with mechanical pencils in middle school
in regards to issues with the device
there are a few however they are very
minor gripes number one with the volume
button when you never flipped out in
tablet mode and you're using it your
volume buttons are going to end up
either on the bottom of your device or
on the top which is just kind of awkward
and weird not the biggest deal but
something note in addition to that when
you're trying to flip back and forth
between modes from closing it in the
laptop and then going into tablet mode
there's no lip on something that you
find like with the MacBook Pro or
something along those lines so you can't
really slip your finger underneath so
separating it is actually kind of tough
sometimes and so those are my thoughts
on the yoga book let us know what you
think in the comments down below I'm a
huge fan of it I think it's probably the
best convertible device we have seen
pretty much ever and I think it's almost
three devices in one it's a great
note-taking device it's a tablet for
consumption of media and it's a laptop
and I think the only place it falls a
little bit short is the laptop because
it doesn't have a full-size keyboard
that being said the keyboard is good you
can totally get used to it after a while
you're just not going to be writing any
novels on it but of course you guys
probably knew that already let us know
what you think in the comments down
below we're very excited to get the
Windows version and do a comparison for
you guys so let us know what you want to
see from that video give us a thumbs up
I look forward to seeing you guys the
next one subscribe for more tech content
