technobuffalo here checking out the
lenovo vibe x so this is a phone that
was announced earlier this week at Aoife
it is super lightweight 121 Gramps I
mean this thing is crazy light weight
mostly in part to the this is aluminum
chassis here and then on the back it's
Polly carbon it's a machine sore plastic
very lightweight 13 megapixel shooter on
the back 5-megapixel front-facing camera
so and it's a wide angle lens so you're
really going to get a lot out of your
camera if you are if you are so inclined
a little bit of lag they're not good my
lenovo what are you doing i'm holding us
really really close and you can see
there am hi so there I am and it's a
pretty good wide angle lens I mean you
could really see and this is right in
front of me and this is about a foot in
front of me so great wide angle lens
which is really really nice 1080p screen
IPS display you have your standard
Android 4.2 point to one of the
interesting things that Lenovo's decided
to do with their lenovo launcher is they
have gotten rid of the app drawer so
there's actually no way to tap and grab
your apps there's no dock I would
imagine a phone like this would be
pretty amazing with a custom launcher on
it pretty quick quad-core processor this
device is very very thin it is six point
nine millimeters definitely a device
that's really nice to hold my hand the
vibe X has a 5-inch display so it's a
5-inch display looking at here if you
want to let wants to add
something to homescreen here's a little
bit of lag which is really surprising
considering the s5000 the companion
tablet was actually really smooth when I
used it unfortunately no plans to bring
this phone to the United States or
Western Europe this is going to be Asia
I believe they said China and october
and the rest of asia including india
russia in december so you're in the US
or western europe you're going to have
to go somewhere else to get it go to
Eastern Europe or Asia that is it for
the lenovo vibe x like i said really
interesting device looks looks beautiful
great hold in the hand kind of a bummer
that they're not going to be bringing
this to the state's overall a nice
device leave your comments down below

berlin I'm Ashley sceva see you guys in
