to you by harry's what's up everyone
John rende you're from TechnoBuffalo
here and i am back the episode of ask
the buffalo so what my favorite shows or
i just get to talk to you guys an answer
whatever questions you got from the
world of tech our first one comes from
our friend mubarak underscore EG
underscore 99 probably could have said
mubarak aging 99 he asked at john for
lakers ever considered a job outside a
tech industry i have i worked at a tech
industry up until 2007 I worked in a law
firm I worked in advertising I worked in
marketing and then I jumped over to text
so yes I have what I consider a job
outside of it now probably not I really
love what I do I have to just really
love something even more than this man I
think it's probably be next to
impossible don't we job I could see
myself doing it's not this would be to
be like a full-time dad I could I get on
board with that I could just just Drive
carpool profession next one comes from
DJ is 000 who asked at John for lakers
hey John when using an Android device
how do you find the best way to regulate
battery life they've caught short not a
spare thanks the two things almost
always are going to zap your battery the
first is the biggest one screen
brightness printer screen brightness is
far down as you can go not even on auto
as far down as you can go and you'll
find the better life on your phone will
get we wait we better next thing I do
when I'm really find myself in a pinch I
will turn off LTE that also will save a
lot about your life and if you're just
sort of waiting put your phone in
airplane mode if you can that'll also
help you say to the battery life so I
guess I said two tips but I gave you
three so you got three for price of two
next one comes from yours always 2015
who asks at John for lakers will you be
reviewing the wocket wallet plasa king
card and swipe card smart cards those
are all sort of versions of smart card
or smart wallet we've already reviewed
the coin and reviewed the straddle smart
card will link both of those right here
yes we will actually have to walk it
well in in which are already testing and
as soon as plastic and swipe ship will
be reviewing those as well I'm really
into the smart card and saying how they
work so yes we'll be covering them all
so let me stop you real fast
first to say hi how are you friend and
to tell you there are a few things that
that I really don't like my fruit snacks
don't have any grape ones in them and
having to go to the store to buy razors
I don't like to shave fortunately
Harry's paid out the middleman for
having go to the store and buy razors
their starter kit is just 15 bucks that
includes an awesome razor three blades
of your choice Harry shave cream or
foaming gel whichever one you choose on
I'm a shaving cream man but personal
preference as an added bonus you also
get five dollars off your first order
when you use my code which is techno
after using that code you get in tires
month words of shaving for just ten
bucks you're getting high-quality razors
at a really low price and shipping is
always going to be free so boom shave
your face the cleric caveman and last
but not least real rdz asks at john for
lakers would you rather prefer google
now with now on tap or the new Siri in
iOS 9 hashtag virtual assistant I pick
google now like 99 out of 100 times
versus Syrian fact when I use iOS I
almost always go to Google instead of
going to Syria just works better it's
quicker whereas serial oftentimes Pope a
web search f ask question google
actually read me the answer i just think
its head and shoulders above what
serious right now perhaps an iOS 9
officially launches on the next-gen
iphone it'll be much improved and I
think you guys for watching hope you
enjoyed until next time I am John render
technobuffalo talk to you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
