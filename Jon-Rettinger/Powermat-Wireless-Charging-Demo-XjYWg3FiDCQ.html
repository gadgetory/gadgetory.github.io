TechnoBuffalo here a beginning a lot of
questions on the power mat wireless
charging system and how it works so I
thought instead of just telling you how
it works it would be better to actually
show you so what I have right here is
the power mat desktop charger you may
have seen me a box in their previous
video and if you look very closely
notice there are three sort of little
dimples on the device and those are your
three charging stations now this is
plugged in you can see right there it
does take power right from the power mat
to the wall so it does have a cord
there's a USB port in the back if you
want to charge something else so when
you buy your power mat it's gonna come
with this little cube kind of thing and
what this is I'll pop it out here it is
a mini USB tip that you can actually sit
right on top if you hear a little noise
let you know something you ready to be
charged and you can plug in anything
that's mini USB it also comes with a ton
of adapter tip so you can plug in the
charger of your myriad of devices you've
got one for a Nintendo DSi you've got
one for a deist light you've got a micro
USB you've got one for an LG phone got
one for Samsung phone and you've got one
for Apple so whether it's an iPhone or
an iPod that will work for you so I'm
gonna give you a demonstration of how
this works
I've got one of their additional
accessories it's about $30 it's a dock
for the iPod sit this right on top so
don't like the own core that's involved
this whole system is from the power mat
itself to the wall none of these have
any other sort of cord attached to them
or at least they go to the wall so I'm
gonna take my iPhone just plug it in
just like you would any other dock and
it starts charging and I also have a HP
glisten here that uses micro USB so I'm
going to take the tip I'll plug it in
and now I've got the glisten chart and
you can see the red light and that's
really it
it works just as advertised it's a
pretty seamless it makes that cool
little noise let you know that it's
charging and I've got a third spot here
if I had something else you can buy
additional accessories you can buy
sleeves for phones or gaming devices
they actually put the port on the back
but they had a little bit of bulk I
didn't think they were that useful so if
you're looking to get the power mat this
is what you can expect it really does
just work like it says charges devices
it doesn't overcharge them it's pretty
much the equivalent of plug into the
wall except you only have one cord
that's really the advantage of the power
mats as some addition to having sort of
a cool factor for charging wirelessly
you only have one cord you're having to
deal with if I was had three devices on
here ordinarily I'd have to have three
cords going to the wall now I'm just
gonna have one and they all get to sit
on this little a surfboard looking thing
so guys hope you enjoyed this short
demonstration of the power mat and how
it works
stay tuned for a full review of the
device and I'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
