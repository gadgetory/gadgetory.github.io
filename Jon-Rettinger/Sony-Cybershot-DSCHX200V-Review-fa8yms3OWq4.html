TechnoBuffalo and welcome to another
edition of camera review today's review
is the sony cybershot DSC HX 200 v
that's a long model name isn't it Lucy
stay tuned for the full review
behold the sony cybershot DSC HX 200 v
and goodbye Lucy go get a squirrel go
get a chipmunk
this camera is Sony's top-of-the-line
super zoom camera it has a 30x optical
zoom lens which means you could get up
close and personal with your neighbors
this camera also has 1080 60 P Full HD
video recording an 18 point 2 megapixel
sensor and a host of really nifty
shooting features let's start with this
cameras design the cyber-shot HX 200 v
separates itself from the pack with a
few key features the first one being its
pro style lens ring which operates the
zoom or the manual focus this is a
buttery smooth wonderful tool that you
could find on advanced camcorders also
we have a nifty 921 K pixel display in
the back and the LCD style is tilting so
you could shoot at those hard-to-reach
angles the only thing I don't like about
this LCD screen is that it doesn't flip
out to face you for self-portraits the
Panasonic Lumix DMC fz1 50 has that
capability there's also a two hundred
thousand pixel electronic viewfinder and
the cool thing about this is it has an
eye sensor so it will transition from
the LCD screen to the viewfinder just by
placing your eye up against the cup
there's a great DSLR style dial control
on the back you could press it in to use
it as a button you could also spin it to
make different selections we have a four
way directional pad with some nice
shortcuts on it and Sony equipped the HX
200 v with its info lithium battery pack
this thing lasts a long time it's one of
the best battery life in its class and
the great thing about this battery pack
is it shows you its remaining stamina in
minutes on the LCD screen this camera
has a pop-up flash on top but like any
Sony this camera is geared toward
consumers that's why you won't find a
mic jack or a headphone jack and you
won't find a hot shoe on top the
Panasonic FZ 150 has those features and
because of that the FZ 150 is for more
advanced shooters while the cyber-shot
is more
a soccer mom camera now for features the
Sony cyber-shot HX 200 V is plastered
from lens to LCD screen with a bountiful
banquet of shooting tools it has two
separate auto modes one is intelligent
Auto and one is superior auto
intelligent Auto uses a combination of
Sony's different scene techniques and
picks the right one for the right
occasion
now superior auto takes a series of
shots in different settings and combines
them all into one image but I found that
I achieved better results in the PASM
modes
speaking of which yes this camera has
full manual control a shutter speed that
goes down to 30 seconds which we used
for light painting at night it has an
aperture range of F 2.8 to 8.0 and an
ISO range of 100 to 12,800 so that's a
pretty broad sensitivity range but
that's not all this thing is a built-in
neutral density filter with an auto
setting it also has exposure bracketing
smile shutter and smile detection
saturation contrast sharpness settings
various noise reduction levels an
excellent optical steadyshot
image stabilization which worked
exceedingly well in video and still mode
zoomed all the way in at a 30 X optical
zoom
the cyber-shot HX 200 V also has a nice
GPS feature it has GPS logging and the
camera did a great job of tracking all
of the different locations that I took
pictures and videos now the cyber-shot
HX 200 V also has some really cool
picture effects we do have a really
awesome
HDR painting mode there's rich black and
white there's pop color we have partial
colors water color illustration that
type of thing now we'll hop over to
scene mode and with most cameras scene
modes are pretty useless but not with
the HX 200 V it has a backlight
correction HDR mode that did a fantastic
job check out some of the pictures I
took online without it and with and
you'll see the difference it's pretty
amazing
there are also some great night shot
modes and the HX 200 V would not be a
sony without the panorama sweep mode you
could take up to 180 degree shots this
camera has a ten frames per second burst
rate at full resolution and one of the
coolest features I
found was in playback mode where you'd
actually tilt the camera left and right
using the motion sensor inside to flip
through the pictures like a hologram or
a flipbook I think that is awesome now
there's some nice control in video mode
you can shoot in different scene modes
you could also adjust the exposure
compensation you can shoot an
intelligent auto but unlike the FZ 150
from panasonic you can't adjust the
shutter aperture ISO those type of
things so when it comes to manual
controls in video mode you're pretty
limited but overall this is one of the
best collections of shooting features on
the market in this class now it's time
for image quality under the hood of the
HX 200 V you'll find a one over 2.3 inch
18 point 2 megapixel Exmor sensor with
Sony's buy ons processing so this camera
is geared toward better low-light
sensitivity now the one thing to mention
about the HX 200 V is the fact that it
does not shoot in RAW so keep that in
mind I found it to produce some fairly
beautiful images especially macro shots
outdoor pictures are great I was really
impressed with the colors they're a
little bit cooler than most other
cameras but they're pretty accurate in
low light is really impressed with the
high ISO sensitivity this is a great
all-around camera when you stack it up
against the F Z 150 they're pretty much
on the same plane and in the video
Department this camera was fantastic
that 60 P video looks beautiful looks
absolutely beautiful
great colors really really really
impressive video from this camera
especially from a small sensor
I was just highly highly impressed with
this thing
so overall image quality with the HX 200
V very good and now it's time for the
buffalo call with the zoom happy
cyber-shot
if you're not as concerned with manual
controls you're gonna want to pick the
sony it's just a great all-around auto
shooter if you're more of a manual
shooter you want more manual controls
you're going to want to go for the
Panasonic FZ 150 the reason is it's got
that mic jack it's got the hot shoe it
shoots in raw it's got great manual
controls like shutter speed and aperture
and ISO in video mode so if you want
more of a complete picture if you could
see yourself
starting to do basic video productions
and you wanted that versatility of
shooting in RAW go with the Panasonic I
personally would go with the Panasonic
for those reasons if I were to list them
in order of preference I'd go Panasonic
FZ 150 slash cyber-shot HX 200 V then
I'd go Canon Powershot SX 4 ths then I'd
go Nikon Coolpix P 510 so if this video
was not enough to quench your camera
thirst go to TechnoBuffalo comm for the
full HX 200 review until next time I'm
Mike Pearlman remember to always wear
your safety goggles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
