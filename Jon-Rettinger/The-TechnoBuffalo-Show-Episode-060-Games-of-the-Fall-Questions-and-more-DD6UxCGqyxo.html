Buffalo show I'm live your to host ER
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of the
site i'm joined by executive editor of
gaming joey davidson hello how are you
welcome back to the show sir ah she's
not my guns here you're a rootin tootin
cowboy yes yep is that the game you and
Connor play no I oddly enough it's not
it's just something I'm doing I don't
know okay sounds good so as we mentioned
last week everyone Todd is on vacation
this week it's true technobuffalo
employees do occasionally take vacations
it's rare yeah you got a big one coming
up next month I do I'm going to Disney
World man i'm taking my uh my
four-year-old you're just excited that
your son is finally of an age where you
can use him as a cover story for item if
you're on yeah thanks thanks Connor for
growing up I appreciate it well let's
see i spent my part of the last two
years I've spent my birthday at
disneyland by myself oh I'm just like I
don't care yeah I I even uh go and get
the button how are you serious yeah
that's funny yeah so the cast members
have to say happy birthday to me as I
walk around well that's nice of them yes
it is it's part of their job but so on
this week's episode we are going to be
discussing the games that we're most
looking forward to coming up this fall
as we are quickly approaching the fall
season and Joe am I'm just gonna let you
take off but what are some of the games
that you're most anticipating well you
know it's it's really weird because I
wouldn't necessarily say that these are
the games that I'm most anticipating so
much as the games that I think we should
all kind of be watching out for um this
year is kind of a mixed bag like there's
some really big heavy hitters here but
then at the same time there's some some
games that are kind of middling but have
the potential to take off and Sean I
apologized already because i'm going to
do way more than five ok ok
I think for me personally the biggest
game it's it's split really and maybe
some some viewers won't expect the
second one but there are two games that
I'm looking forward to the most one of
them is fallout 4 like that'sthat's my
gimme the other one is persona 5 and I'm
sure some people watching no persona
like persona and a prob excited 42 but I
don't think that in most people's minds
persona ranks up there with fallout you
gotta understand that persona 4 I played
it for 120 hours on the PlayStation 2
and then I played it for a hundred more
hours on the PS Vita for persona 4
golden I love that game so I'm really
excited for persona 5 they haven't given
us an exact release date yet but but we
do know it's 2015 and atlas has
confirmed that several times but fallout
4 I mean would you say it's one of the
biggest games of the year sean o easily
easily i just even the reaction from the
audience at e3 when it was announced
well they did it i was i was reading an
interview somewhere todd howard is the
game director at Bethesda working on
fallout he's he's kind of like he was
the guy on stage during the presentation
that presented Fallout and Bethesda Mike
presser and he said that if he had it
his way you like they denounced the game
eight days before release and I love
that idea I love it like it's just like
here's game okay it's coming out like
that's so amazing could you I mean I
feel like everyone who watched that
press conference probably would have
walked out the door and bought the game
the next week if it's a really cyclist
at height yeah definitely I mean how
many people downloaded fallout shelter
there's a story that I just approved
from Eric um what is it that since its
release in june on iOS and it was just
brought over to android last week last
week last week fallout shelter has
logged fall shelter players have logged
over 3,000 hours or three thousand years
yeah here's years sorry millennia yeah
that's crazy so I mean that's the whole
reason I haven't downloaded it it's good
but I think well you play simpsons
tapped out for a while right uh for
about two years yeah yeah i feel like
you you probably get into fight it's a
different game but it still has that
like
micromanagement creation type of thing I
know that you like that yeah so fallout
persona 5 those are two games for 75 is
one that I added this morning I just
because it dawned on me like holy crap
this is really happening this year um
metal gear is like two weeks away like I
don't know if you guys realized this but
we are less than two weeks from metal
gear solid 5 the phantom pain another
huge game for this year and probably the
last of the games for that series I
don't know I know it's the last of code
gr kojima's as well but I know that
Konami said that they're already
prepping for the next metal gear so I
don't know what it's gonna be it's
probably just gonna be a pachinko
machine like a full a full dev team to
just do a pachinko machine and it's just
going to be one cutscene that no one
gets to finish because it's too long for
the average pachinko play session that's
what I think anyway um let's see uh
super mario maker is huge i actually
have that in my possession now
battlefront star wars battlefront is
going to be huge Just Cause 3 and then
the last one that I have on my list is
halo 5 Guardians Sean do any of those
stick out to you aside from fallout as
being banner titles well I think
battlefront I mean just because we're
we're in this the middle of this Star
Wars frenzy again due to all these
movies coming out and also people have
been wanting another battlefront for so
long yeah i think the i think the
biggest problem for halo 5 guardians is
it's got to get the stink of the master
chief collection off of it I don't think
I genuinely genuinely I don't think it
will I really don't and I'm time
terrified i wrote about this in the
screenshot saturday post this past
weekend i am genuinely terrified that
343 is going to watch the multiplayer
launch for halo 5 Guardians ya know the
master chief collection still doesn't
work properly like still yeah how long
has it been out now I mean we're
approaching a year it'll be a year yeah
and that's insanity so why should we
take any yeah what why should we have
any faith that 343 is going to be able
to launch halo 5 Guardians in a smooth
manner I don't know I genuinely I don't
I mean I'm not I'm not convinced that
they'll be able to quite frankly but I
mean it's kind of sucks I know that the
die-hard Halo fans will be lining up to
get it and the one thing that I will say
about uh Master Chief collection is
compared to guardians the master chief
collection was like hundred something
maps spread over multiple games spread
over multiple file sizes just everything
not all the maps for remastered some of
them were just straight ports like there
was a lot for 343 to juggle and I'm I'm
no developer I'm no software server
engineer but I I recognize that there
was probably a lot of they had to make
these things lock up you know mm-hmm and
making all that come together in a
matchmaking style uh probably pretty
hard yeah no I do agree with you there i
just i think that there look your
average parent you know for this
christmas oh I'm going to get Johnny
halo five yeah it's not going to impact
that at all but I think you know people
like you myself those of us that follow
gaming there's a lot of work they gotta
do to win us back we're all taking the
wait-and-see attitude I mean almost
universally I don't know anyone who's
like I'm getting it day one and I don't
blame that person I don't I know first
of all I think that that if anything has
been demonstrated best buy this
generation people like to point towards
generations as the age that brought us
whatever 64 and Playstation one that was
like 3d gaming right I made the wii and
xbox 360 playstation 3 to a certain
extent they all brought us motion
control that was huge and live online
marketplaces and online gaming defined
by that generation so far the only of
this generation of software has defined
for me is that it's unreliable as crap
like day one purchases are a mistake
today they are a mistake well like I
told you yesterday I'm having a really
hard time not pre-ordering battlefront i
I'm fighting everything in my body not
preorder battle for it dude you know
what what was it with Batman and you
didn't play it on the pc but like I
remember you telling me like you're
pissed off at me for telling you dr.
pre-order Batman yeah but
it dude it was worth it you probably
still haven't even bought it but it oh
because there have been so many DLC
packs at this point I'm just like
there's no am buying it before the game
of the year edition that's smart that's
smart and I recognize that it's kind of
tough for basically diehard fans to kind
of back off of that a little bit but I
mean it in any other genre if you told
moviegoers that the movie there was like
I'm better than fifty percent chance
that part of the movie just straight-up
wouldn't work when you go to see it in
theaters I have a really one and three
or five but real too right right yeah
Apple to do this movie it's just gonna
stop working get a connecting to server
spinning gun we didn't have time to
finish the effects so it's just these
people standing in a green room so use
your imagination okay right exactly like
why is that okay in gaming but in every
other every other medium out there
people would lose their flippin minds
I'll imagine a band releasing an album
missing two songs oh well we'll deliver
those later yeah right now that's not
happening that's not happening track
seven and twelve they're coming later
know that they're all now album but it's
just static like that's that's what it
is hey so I I don't know any way to this
fall it's gonna be a weird season for me
because i think that there's a lot of
games this fall that are really exciting
i think that super mario maker I gotta
tell you this is a really good game and
I think it's kind of a dark horse thing
yeah I see when I first heard the idea I
was like oh you know I don't know the
closer we get to that game the more I'm
like that sounds really interesting have
about six to seven hours in it already
and I'm not really allowed to like
express my opinion on it um but i will
say that i was skeptical too mm-hmm i
played in a preview events still
skeptical it was the Nintendo World
Championships of e3 that kind of
solidified it for me as something that's
going to be here to stay I know that
Nintendo has a problem with install
based on the Wii U but just looking at
Mario maker and looking at stuff like
twitch
and the way let's plays are on YouTube
and the way that the Internet is now in
general this game could blow up it could
oh yeah I definitely think so i can see
there being leveled building
competitions not just played
competitions but building competitions
mm-hmm you know and just for
clarification folks the reason he's not
allowed to express his opinion is that
is actually a rule from Nintendo during
this time period yeah yeah the yeah it's
not that he's just keeping it from you
he's actually not allowed to just ya
simsim with gears of world that they're
like they're like you could talk about
it but do not give any inclination
Microsoft has this wording do not give
any inclination of how favorably or
unfavorably you might score it I'm just
like okay yes but both of those titles
are in your hands um so yeah I mean now
see here's the thing I've while I
consider myself a gamer I've been gaming
since the days of the colecovision there
are certain games I've just I've never
played a fallout it just didn't look
that appealing to me I've never played
any of the personas yeah yeah so but you
know especially persona I mean the way
you and Ron just got out these games you
know what though here's the thing and
especially Ron like i said ron was in
delaware we're both from like the same
state he's just in japan now and that's
where he works he came in to visit cuz
he got married and we went out to dinner
and it just re solidified what I know
about Ron a nice gaming tastes weird to
super different people like Ron is
hardcore into like classic Japanese
dungeon crawlers and stuff like that I
can't give those games the time of day I
just don't have the patience for it and
I totally recognize that I'm notice I'm
not recommending persona to you Sean
yeah no I don't do not think it would be
your cup of tea but for fans of it for
people like me who like those types of
games yeah it's going to be exceptional
I do think that that the triple-a
Western space has homogenized games a
little bit
much everything kind of has has come
down into this straight shoot right like
everything is kind of the same look at
all the open world games now how many
open world games have you played in this
generation that have just been some
variants of concrete our clear a section
of a map two objectives concrete our
clear section of map do objectives like
that's that's like all we do now yeah
really tired of that now I agree and
speaking of priority I I have
pre-ordered the taken king but I feel
safe and that as I've put you know
almost 20 days now and just the fridge
yesterday if you know that you're going
to get the life the life out of that and
I think that one thing that you have
going is is you play with call it a lot
so I am like you have that guaranteed
partner in crime and I think that that
that sort of like reinforces your
ability to pre-order there was a time
friend in the NHL series when like EA
sports hockey league was a big deal like
I knew every single year that I was
going to play NHL because I was on an EA
sports hockey league club like this is
what I was going to do so I had no baby
my nerdiest thing I've ever heard you
say huh hey man it was at least a sports
game okay so and all the pokemon I've
collected all these years that's not the
nerdiest thing okay whatever dude but
yes you're right i know i have a partner
in crime you know to run through destiny
with exactly now and i got matchmaking
sites when he's not around you know all
that sort of stuff I know I'm going to
get my money's worth out of that
battlefront I mean I'm just I'm such a
star wars fanatic as everybody knows but
I also know from a past history of Star
Wars titles that I may after an hour
through the disc against the wall go I
hate you I hate you I hate you uh I mean
maybe you should pick up a copy used of
battlefield two battlefield 3 I guess
that's working now that's going to give
you a good impression of how the game
plays I mean I know that dice is like no
it's not battlefield it's not
battlefield but dude like at the press
conference at e3 it felt like I played
it for like 20 minutes it felt like
battlefield in space I'm talked about
that
don't get me wrong this is exciting as
long as it flip it works but I don't
know I'm not take it already will have a
certain feel I don't know if you're
gonna like it or not man because I know
that you're you're pretty hit-and-miss
on the shootie shoot games I'm very hit
and miss on the shootie shoot games very
I I haven't picked up a call duty in
years now but you love destiny by love
destiny and you had that stem where you
played the crap out of titanfall 2 yeah
yeah I did I did have a stint on Titan
fall but yeah see you're pushing me
again towards not for your dream haha
who is also the probability that it will
be broken as heck when you get it so I'm
going what you see Sean just talk to it
yeah exactly I have made a horrible
decision so yeah I mean it's hard to
narrow down I mean I won't I'm it for me
I love the last tomb raider game loves
the last year oh yeah that's coming out
this year too yeah so I'm all excited
for that's equal yeah uh I gotta tell
you I I don't mean to like fan the
flames here but I've had a really good
stretch of buying multi-platinum
playstation 4 and getting the most
working product that way I might just
wait I might wait I mean eric is kind of
our resident tomb raider guy so you know
that's he's going to do the review
certainly i think i might just wait for
the playstation 4 version which will
likely come with all the DLCs and
everything else so that's ha and I hate
talking to because on one hand it's
great because you end up saving me money
oh yeah on the other hand you end up
delaying my enjoyment I'm sorry I'm
sorry but I'm not sorry I guess now I
mean you have a point like I said with
the taken King I feel safe you know i
i've put i just looked it up like the
air dam i met almost 20 days of play
time at this point you know which at one
point makes me cry that i've spent that
much time on anything better than doing
drugs
oh yeah it's good have 20 days doing
drugs or 20 days and investigates once
more costly than the other let's just
put it that way oh that's true that's
okay fine but I've definitely got my
money's worth out that but yeah I mean
the thing is like Arkin whatever the
last hour come one was called I keep
forgetting it Arkham Knight I had
pre-ordered at one point you ended up
talking me into canceling that and so I
bet I every time I feel like I've
learned my lesson about pre-orders I
start going oh but this one Oh take of
all the days of excitement and enjoyment
you're gonna miss what no not really
what are you getting from pre-ordering
what do you even get it well getting in
yo in early too you know when the most
people are going to be playing but you
can just buy it from the store yeah I
know but then there's a weapons pack no
no that's not worth your time it's gonna
order your time it and an extra map
Richie time man the harley quinn dlc is
is proof enough yeah i know i couldn't
believe when you guys wrote that up oh
what a day what is it like 20 minutes
not even and it's it's a bad it's a bad
20 minutes it's not like it's like 20
minutes like oh it's over it's more like
huh thank God that must have been three
hours it was 20 minutes totally totally
off topic but mentioning Harley Quinn
made me think of this did you see the
pictures yesterday from the Suicide
Squad set no are they on the site no
because they weren't of the movie being
filmed the cast has bonded ah the cast
has decided that perhaps they should get
matching tattoos geez okay and that
perhaps Margot Robbie who's playing
Harley Quinn should be the one to give
it to them a lot that's crazy she there
are pictures online of her in her Harley
Queen costume and makeup tattooing the
director that's awesome I look that up
so I asked John yo
as you know the company is bonded over
all these years and before I could even
finish my says I just got no no clue
taught it in Harley Quinn makeup and
costume and have them tattoo John and I
don't see what could go wrong what
what's the downside little bitch up dawg
this month right I got a picture of him
tattooing like John's arm and John's
just wincing up dirty bread oh that was
a mental image I did not need Wow okay
uh i will mention to todd when he gets
back he needs to grow start growing out
his hair so we can give him pigtails yep
well we've got a lot of questions coming
in so let's jump into a couple of these
I although my particular favorite came
in very early in the show from prison
Franco oh my god oh my god can't stop
screaming like a fangirl uh at least
somebody's happy to see you Joey a
maybes talking about me maybe he's
talking about you I don't know
interesting question for him such a
mahal have you guys ever purchased a
limited edition console or even a
collector's edition of game if so which
was it I'm tempted a lot of times by
these limited-edition consoles but then
I'm like I already own a console why am
i buying another copy of the council
just because it has a fancy paint job Oh
what have I done to myself son over here
because it's not unpacked I have this
all right so I got the Destiny yet but
you did not purchase that did not
purchase it but I have it I guess yes
that was really the only limited console
I've ever purchased it was the I don't
have it either because I lost it in a
move it forever ago do you remember so
the gameboy advanced they had the SP
line which I still think aside from the
the new 3ds XL is the best
system ever released just in design and
build quality and all that stuff that
was the SP it was small it was like a
square and this one was an NES
anniversary themed one so it looked I
remember that looked like an nes i
bought it it was like a hundred bucks at
gamespot or Y at gamestop and it was one
of the best purchases I've ever made
actually I actually somewhere in my desk
i had my gameboy advance SP i bought it
the battery life was killer the
backlight was killer i bought it and
final fantasy tactics on the same day
and I crush that game that was like a
lie over those a lot of fun um special
editions for games I've stopped I don't
really buy them anymore i think the last
one that i bought only because wind
wakers like one of my favorite games
ever i got the wind waker HD special
edition late though month again and Dorf
statue never opened it I'm one of those
people like when I do but I don't open
it i just kind of like leave it i don't
know i don't know like 40 years when
connor comes up to me and he's like dad
why do you have all this crap you never
opened it i'm really not gonna know how
to respond like I'm not gonna know what
to say to him he's gonna be like why did
you waste your time and money and I'm
just gonna be like I don't I don't know
well if it makes you feel any better
last night I was going through my DVDs
i'm slowly selling off my dvds and all
that and do you remember those Oh Disney
limited edition tins that were like the
complete black and white Mickey Mouse
and all I've got all not all of a good
chunk of them yeah still unopened like I
have some in the same way dude I have
like the I have an original like one of
the first runs of the super special
edition of Casablanca when it was
released on DVD I have that I've got
King Kong when it was released on DVD I
have like I have like obscure flipping
French movies like I have this movie
called voodoo say from drowning and it's
like no one's heard of this stupid movie
but here I am what about the collectors
edition everything else I do not do this
anymore i used to this was like
something i used to do a lot so no now
not that's interesting and somewhat
off-topic I now I think about I don't
buy collector's editions of games by dou
by collectors editions of movies movies
are just a different it's a different
how can I say this without like shaming
video games movies are more acceptable
right i mean it's just it's it's it's
cheaper the collector's editions of
films are way cheaper than the
collector's editions of video games so
ya better that way and it's just it's
they store a little bit easier like odds
are you're not getting a giant statue
like I'm not my the collectors edition
something just for the giant statue so I
don't know ya know be I you know they
come out with you know this box that has
you know this alternate cut of the movie
like when they did the blade runner said
a couple years yeah yeah they had like
all 18 versions of the film a came with
the manager spinner replica oh sweet
yeah I wanted to come with a folded-up
aluminum unicorn it came with that too
did it really yes they came in a replica
of the void comp suitcase that's awesome
well I was really funny was i bought it
for i had gone HD DVD instead of blue
right but which is which is a bold
choice I well you know I did my research
I thought was going to win but the nice
thing was they said after you know HD
DVD was declared dead that said just
come out all I had to do was take out
the insert cover mail it in and they
sent me the blu-ray version oh that was
cool yeah that was very cool that was
Warner Brothers I all my Warner Brothers
HD DVDs all I had to do was send him the
cover and they sent me a blu-ray version
that's really nice I didn't know that
they did that that was one of the nicest
things I've ever seen a studio do in one
of these format Wars yeah okay moving
along as you and I tend to go off on
tangents yeah Todd this Todd go off on
tangents no he doesn't see that's what
you're missing yes and speaking of Todd
from such a ball finally got rid of Todd
for one week eh hey he went on vacation
so we didn't force him out we should uh
from brazen Franco if you think day one
purchases are a mistake what about early
access on the Xbox um well do you
research it's the biggest thing that I
can say the interesting thing about day
one access is if the defensive type of
player you are if you're the type of
player who just likes to play games like
in your little bubble and maybe you like
to share clips with them like on Twitter
or Facebook or whatever and talk about
them a little bit online and that's like
the extent of your gaming i would say
avoid early access but if you're someone
who wants to actively take part in like
the thought jump on the sites forum and
talk with the creator's online and like
work with the community on feature
requests and stuff like that i'd say
early access is a good idea i think it's
going to be a bit more polished on the
xbox one that knows on steam and a bit
better policed I would assume I want
people away from early access on Steam
all the time it's just you're buying
into games that are literally not done
and unless you're someone you both
recognizes that and is completely ready
to offer up what is that like a ramekin
coffee mug you got there what is that
Jake oh my god thanks Joey yeah hey
don't get that what's hot either anyway
wah wah shun recovers Wow oh my god so
uh assume that the Xbox team is gonna
police early access stuff a little bit
better so you're not going to be buying
into quite as many unfinished products
um but like i said if you're someone who
doesn't really want to put up with that
crap ignore it if you're someone who
wants to join the community of players
that are giving feedback to the
developers dymond early access it can be
cool
are you I heard Mac hahaha I'm back
amazingly um hey on the youtube link to
the site someone asked who we are like
in all caps who are we well I'm the
deceased Shaw naughty who just died on
copy okay you are Chad the murderer i'm
sean it's one honey's murderer if I turn
up dead tomorrow folks you know why you
were with those ah man whoo from such
and ball hey Sean which disney infinity
characters yet for the 2 point 0 version
of the game and are you excited for
three-point oh uh I'm excited for
three-point oh but am I going to have to
buy a new version of this game every
single year and every year I have to get
a new disc how many of these discs am I
expected to uh what's your limit man I
know I know as for which characters I am
for two point O way more than I should
however I only bought like three of them
the rest were sent to me as review units
ah yeah so otherwise I would have had to
been very very picky on what I bought as
for a three-point oh yes I'm excited I
I'm really excited they're adding new
game actually I can't discuss what thing
that email we got this morning
something's going to be an answer yeah I
forgot that they said that was for later
no there's some exciting new things
coming to three-point oh the addition
the addition of Star Wars and this has
been revealed you know that you're going
to be able to drive an 80 st you know
yes it's going to be in the Infinity
style but it still looks cool uh so yeah
I'm excited for it but I just the one
thing that bothers me about 50 I don't
know how much closely you
all to joy but being a classic Disney
fan as we both are they're really
ignoring the classic stuff yeah really
well here's the thing we had that shot
with Warren specters Epic Mickey that
that came not to not that you know dig
up that old grave but that game was the
the chance that that like hardcore
Disney fans had it kind of redeeming the
medium i guess but no that's gone that's
gone that was its shot and I don't see
it coming back anytime soon so yeah I
mean we we got you know a fantasia
Mickey as a figure but I mean we've
gotten Donald Duck but where yo we
haven't gotten goofy we haven't gotten
Pluto Daisy mini you know which may not
seem that exciting to a lot of people
but to classic Disney fans those are
important characters there there what
built the house of mouse yeah for sure
maybe it's some play will see them I
don't think so I keep opening uh from
Anthony Lima whatever happened to mark I
liked his camera reviews Oh Mike Mike
Mike went on to other jobs I think you
look I know I doing he's doing fine as
far as I know I haven't talked to him
quite a while uh let's see from Michael
the cell do you think we are going to
see more gaming features on the new
Apple TV to combat the Android TV set
tops such as the Nvidia shield now I
don't see Apple going into that area
Game Center was there was there they're
kind of like their little foray and I
think it didn't really work it's just
not how people play games um I don't
think that that the shield I mean the
shield itself is unproven tech right now
still yeah you know I think there's a
lot of potential there and I think that
for the user base that wants it it's
going to be something that's huge but I
just don't see mobile gaming on
in the way that a lot of people wanted
well and we have a question here from D
Norbert that kind of ties into that
cloud gaming anyone what do you think
hey I did the review for the Nvidia
shield and I did try the the grid
service and I have to say I was
surprised at how smooth that was it was
way smoother than I expected and that
was 100% cloud play that being said so
long as a lot of isp still offer
bandwidth caps it's going to be very
hard for people to make that their sole
source of gaming and a lot and a lot
more Iestyn bandwidth isn't a finite
resource that's what drives me nuts oh I
know I know I my my count resets on
Friday and I've had to like tell
everyone you're allowed to watch like
one show a day for the rest of the month
who's your provider a company called
cable one yeah see we I don't have any
caps i've never lived that life oh it's
not fun yeah it's often we're limited to
300 gigabytes a month on our level hi
yeah I know do you mind my asking how
much you pay a month for 50 50 bucks
yeah and it's 300 gigs and once you're
up and down like I think I feel like we
talked about this 50 down in two up huh
that's right to up yeah I don't know i
know i'm surprised i can see you right
now all right well you're at the office
i actually have the $75 package which
gives me three up shut up yeah I know
and gives me 75 down and 400 gigs a
month which actually this month here and
I'm the only person in this building
every day I have exceeded the bandwidth
cap here for the month God but that's
what I'm 3999 50 down 50 up no caps I
hate you but see bandwidth caps our
reality still unfortunately no yeah yeah
well and as far as cloud gaming goes I
know that that some of the stuff that's
that's behind cloud tech I think that
Microsoft is doing some impressive stuff
crackdown it was announced that all of
that city destruction its multiplayer
only which is kind of a bummer but it's
all powered by cloud so and they can't
have it in the single player because the
xbox one's not always on console anymore
thank goodness yes yes uh let's see here
many other questions folks I do see some
phone questions if we have time we will
get to them but this is primarily a
gaming day since joey is our gaming
editor i can answer questions about
phones you just I don't know what I'm
talking about they may not be correct
well I kinda want someone asked like a
hyper specific question and then let's
see if I can be asked my way through it
well here's one for just for Rex do you
think HTC can make a comeback out of IFA
seems like they're m10 maybe a really
nice phone with a big battery HTC needs
a hit desperately I we love HTC we you
know wish nothing but the best for them
but they do desperately need a hit
hopefully whatever this mystery phone is
that's coming before the end of the year
is it but we'll just have to wait and
see what happened to the m9 the m9 came
out it's a great phone it just did not
catch with the public the m8 is the one
that what's his face is doing
commercials for right yeah Robert Downey
jr. now ah Gary Oldman yes Gary Oldman
also did I make commercials yes yep hey
yo I thought knowledge on display for
Michael the cell what are your thoughts
on the new xbox interface based on
Windows 10 I love it I'm excited I don't
have Windows 10 installed yet but i
think the unification of the platform is
really good for Microsoft you know you
might not like this but it worked for
apple you know and having that platform
unification was big in Apple success and
I think that having that that platform
parody across everything that Microsoft
makes is going to be really good for the
microsoft suite of hardware I also think
that the Xbox app the thing just
released on Windows 10 in it it's
already promising
so I'm a fan I don't know how much i'm
going to use Cortana though on the xbox
one specifically but well concern you
probably don't have your kinect hoped up
any longer correct yeah i love the fact
that they're adding cortada after most
of us have torn the kinect off of our
xbox scored it up no that's pretty much
I wit with me like you're just taking up
space in my life pop by yeah yeah hey
I'm also excited we gets the Windows 10
you I seems infinitely faster yeah yeah
it does seem a lot faster and hopefully
it is uh from saw ha Raja do you think
there is going to be a watch dogs too
yeah okay then well there but there was
your answer all that what everybody uh
are you gonna go up it and tell her
fullest now yeah for Michael cell Joey
and Europe a what do you think Nintendo
should do to improve in the in the own x
well um not sure what you mean I don't
know what's going on with the NX I don't
know what they should do to improve it
well I think he means from what's
happened with the wii u not to take the
NX and improve the overall state of the
vessel sensitive did um I think that
while I don't care i think that nintendo
should work a little bit harder to get
some more horsepower in their machine um
I welcome the innovation I really love
the gamepad I know that that that's not
everyone's personal opinion but I can't
tell you how many times I mean even
during dinner now I hand my kid the
gamepad with like netflix on like
sometimes if we're running late normally
he doesn't watch TV during dinner or
whatever but like if we're running late
i'm trying to condense everything and
the kids like gotta have my Octonauts
I'm like all right here you go like I
pop it on the gamepad form it's really
really nice I don't have to disturb the
television I just like I like the
gamepad so I'm hoping that the NX has
things similar um personally if it was
if I was someone like dream designing
the NX it would be a portable machine
that also doubled as a home console um
but that it still had enough graphical
prowess not maybe not necessarily to go
toe-to-toe with the ps4 and xbox one to
be but come pretty darn close Nintendo's
already proven that they can get to AP
for 60 frames per second on their on
their games that's a really interesting
idea though making it both a portable
and a home system because I as we know
in Japan portable as almost completed
rules the roost man you know if the
gamepad had a clamshell design and could
be taken anywhere on the road it was
lighter thinner and looked better or
whatever like you have a killer system
yeah that's a very good point it's a
very good point that's that's not right
I I wish we knew a little bit more about
the NX I understand why we don't but it
would be nice to know a little bit more
about it yeah I'm sure it's coming it's
just you know it's Nintendo and
Nintendo's got a lot going on right now
especially with the passing of aguada
but it will be interesting to follow
along and see where the NX takes us from
aerial palette Nick I believe I said
that court you crushed that one thank
you do you think the council era is over
or going to be over soon no nope don't
think people were the demise of the home
consoles was something that was
happening with the 360 and ps4 our ps3
and Wii and now we're that the ps4 and
xbox one I mean what was the stat that
this is the fastest fastest selling
console generation ever yeah not going
anywhere I mean it's expanding and i
love the pc i love it i do a lot of
gaming on my pc but console gaming and
the living room are too they're totally
separate things
and I don't see them leaving so yeah i I
just I can't see it going anywhere
anytime soon a pc gaming is great don't
get me wrong i I've been a pc gamer in
the past but if you go out and you talk
to your average person that it was
shopping for a game at walmart or
something you go oh hey yo are you are
you gonna be building a gaming rig
what's that yeah right you know your
average person is not going to want to
sit down and build a gaming rig or by a
computer specifically designed for
gaming they like the idea of i plug this
into my television and it works yeah
which unfortunately is becoming less and
less prevalent thanks to patches and
updates and everything else but that
that plug and play mentality is what
maybe it's what made console gaming what
it is today so yeah no I don't think
it's going anywhere if anything I think
it's going to continue to take over the
living room I mean nothing but why is it
that the best netflix devices are our
home consoles now uh from saha raja Joey
you know you sound a bit like Vince
Gilligan I don't know that is crater
Breaking Bad oh I appear since everyone
says I sound like Seth Rogen I could do
bring I like this yes exactly that's the
main reason I got highlighted cool well
quickly before we go we we know I for
those that don't know Joey's in a
different background than he has been in
the past he's just moved into a new home
