you by domain.com hope you guys like
phones because we've got one inside a
box here for you to take a look at I'm
our person I'm a TechnoBuffalo and we
are gonna unbox the oneplus X so why
don't we get right on into it yes I
realize this isn't the most exciting box
that we've seen this side of the phone
ville but inside this one's not anything
we've got the oneplus X it's a pretty
nice box in any way shape or form
luckily I've got a little bit of yeah
yeah there we go with my nail see if we
can get this sucker open yeah yeah now
we can't Oh No daddy needs help
alright I had to call in for
reinforcements so thank you very much
why are you holding it that way that
seems dangerous okay there we go let's
get in here okay now if you guys haven't
seen anything about the oneplus X I
actually did a small hands-on with it
from the actual event again here is the
box here is what it looks like boom
there it is and let's go ahead and pop
it right open I did I did get to play
with this phone quite a bit so I'm
actually pretty familiar with it in the
hand already and there you go there's
your usual oneplus which never settle
right there very exciting so first thing
you're gonna notice is of course let's
also do John's favorite thing here ready
Oh whole very satisfying so the first
thing you're gonna notice it's made of
glass so we have plenty of lights in
here so you can see it basically
immediately picks up fingerprints no
matter what but that's not a big deal
lots of phones are made of glass these
days the oneplus X is a phenomenal
looking phone I can tell you that
maturity because I've held it before but
what's really interesting is what's
happening underneath the hood because
underneath the hood there's a Snapdragon
801 there's three gigs of RAM
and 16 gigs of storage not to mention
this little door right here this opens
up to reveal two little slots on the
inside one for a SIM card and the other
one is either for a SIM card or a micro
SD card so it supports dual SIM as well
which is pretty cool so while that's
setting up we can take a look at what is
in the rest of the box really quickly
nice big red stuff like we get from one
Plus usually and let's see what this sim
ejector tool looks like I don't know if
you guys I think I've told you guys this
before but I like to collect the coolest
ones I can find so oh that's a pretty
cool one look at that oh and it's nice
and long - not bad big fan of cool sim
ejector tools and even comes with boom
get that little silicone case in case
you're sick of the finger prints got a
little soft touch feel we've got a
little Quick Start Guide in case you're
not sure how to use a phone typical wall
wart and yes one of one plus is
excellent cables though you'll note this
one microUSB not USB see so the device
itself
like I said glass on the front and on
the back I do want to really quickly
just make note of the fact that this is
the Onyx model the Onyx model look at
all this stuff here the Onyx model is
again made of glass but there is one
other model that's going to be on the
market that's going to be made of
ceramic and the ceramic model is there's
only going to be 10,000 of them made
they're going to come in at 382 euros
because they're not going to be sold in
the US and they are incredibly difficult
to manufacture so I'm excited to see if
that does well because the the two
models are sort of like ones
budget-conscious and one is
fashion-conscious so I'm curious to see
how oneplus kind of expects that to go I
have a handful of emotions and opinions
about this device already but I'll save
those to share with you in my full
review but I have an inkling of a
feeling that the price point on the Onyx
at $250 USD off-contract
is going to be a pretty big boon for
oneplus let us know in the comments what
you guys think we need to make sure that
we cover in the review on the oneplus X
and we will make sure to do that for you
and as always thank you so much for
watching hope you enjoyed this unboxing
be kind to one another
and I'll catch you in the next video
all right we interrupt this video for
you're some sort of amount of time
inspiration moment from TechnoBuffalo
that's right you can head to domain.com
to grab yourself a sweet domain name at
a reasonable price they're a great place
to go when you need something of that
nature and I'll tell you what I've got
some great ideas for you to register so
that you can start your very own
businesses first up we're going to talk
about this idea I've had rolling around
in my head for a little while
Lucey the Frenchy dot sexy I know it
seems weird she's a dog but she's our
favorite dog just be kind with the
photos go and register that domain we
can head loose II can have her own
fanpage isn't that exciting secondly and
maybe more importantly spanish-speaking
communities are big into games board
games video games all that kind of stuff
so you can go to domain.com and register
yourself play more games wagos which I
realize seems a little bit redundant but
it's totally fine you're basically an
entrepreneur now you can do anything you
want with that not only that but it's
super cheap and portable to do so
especially if you use the code
TechnoBuffalo that'll save you 20% off
your entire order that seems crazy to me
anyway when your finger domains remember
think domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
