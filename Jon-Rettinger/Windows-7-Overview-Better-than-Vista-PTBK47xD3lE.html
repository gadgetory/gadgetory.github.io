and today we'll be taking a tour of
windows 7 we'll be looking at the new
features and basically looking at how
they work this is the release candidate
version of the beta bill 7100 and I'm
running this overview on a mid-range
setup I have an Intel quad clocked at
three point four gigahertz and four gigs
of semi-fast RAM I'm running Windows 7
off a raid zero so it may run a bit
faster than off a single hard drive and
as you can see even though I'm running
the two caviar black hard drives and
raid the Windows 7 performance testing
gave me only a five point nine anything
above five point nine is apparently
reserved for solid-state drives okay
let's get started an important factor in
operating system in my opinion is how it
looks it's essentially the piece of
software that you're gonna be looking at
most of the time while sitting at your
computer so it's definitely something
you don't mind to be pleasing to the eye
Windows 7 comes with extensive
customization features the wallpapers on
themes can now be set as basically slide
shows the pre-installed themes I think
are quite nifty Microsoft has really
found some nice-looking high-res
wallpapers there are a bunch of pictures
spanning from gorgeous landscape shots
to some pretty freaky looking character
drawings as well apparently mr. gates
has some time to doodle now that he's
retired and he's definitely beginning
some stylistic influences from salvador
dali the architecture theme has some
stunning shots of very interesting
looking buildings in the past I've
usually just used my own custom
wallpapers but these pre-installed
wallpapers on Windows 7 are actually
looking quite appealing just like on
Windows Vista you can tweak the color
settings of the taskbar and windows to
suit your liking I think a bright pink
might go pretty well with this blue
color or maybe not
when you get tired of pre-installed
themes you can make your own slide show
based theme just bring in your own set
of pictures and set the time interval
and you're pretty much good to go
and you can shuffle up the pictures if
you will anyone recognize what this
wallpapers from now this is gonna be a
good movie I must go see it
whoops how'd that get in there now this
is nice this wallpaper is from the
upcoming Tron Legacy movie the desktop
itself hasn't changed too much the
sidebar from Vista is now gone but you
can still have your average widgets or
gadgets as they're now called that you
can layout on your desktop double
clicking on the gaps lays them out on
the right edge of the screen you can
also drag the guides to any place of the
screen that suits your liking
out of the way is usually a good idea a
transparent grid automatically aligns
the gadgets and icons and keeps the
desktop looking clean
I'm not going to be needing these but I
will leave the CPU and RAM meter on so
you can keep tabs of how much power the
windows 7 is taking up just for
clarification some of the RAM and
processor usage has been taking up by
the recording software which is
recording this in high definition if
you're interested in the software google
camtasia 6.0 okay let's take a look at
the more interesting changes to Windows
7 one of which is the new taskbar or the
super bar as they now call it
interesting prefix I would have called
it the mega bar moving aside from the
obvious aesthetic improvements there
have been a couple of new features added
to the taskbar when you run your cursor
over the tab you get a preview of the
program's open windows in this case
we're looking at the open tabs in
Internet Explorer and when you run your
mouse over the small preview windows you
can quickly preview the entire page
without actually accessing it you can
for example quickly check out what tabs
you have left open on your internet
explorer I'm done looking at these sites
so it can actually close the tabs from
here without going into the program
itself to close them I think it's very
cool that you can run your mouse over
any open program icon and it will give
you a small preview window also a cool
new added feature is the Winnie right
click on an icon you get some very
convenient options when you for example
right-click on the Internet Explorer
icon you see your favorite or pinned
websites on the top and here you can see
there are most frequently visited pages
which you can launch directly with good
haste
you can also pin some of your frequently
visited pages to your pin section if you
like
okay also a very nifty new feature is
that when you download any file on
Internet Explorer you get a pretty cool
progress bar on the task bar tab itself
so when you are for example downloading
big files you can easily keep tabs on
your progression by simply looking at
the task bar tab itself
the right-clicking features work on any
program as well here you can see some
recent folders I've accessed and while
we're here you probably notice the
Windows 7 has some new sounds accessing
folders gives out a kind of jazzy bass
string chime which always brings at
least to my mind
the Fraser theme it could be just me
though anyways as I mentioned the
preview view works on any program
right-clicking on the microsoft word
brings out an option to launch recent
port documents and it's an option that I
very frequently use Windows 7 also has
some Mouse free commands for operating
the taskbar you can just hit the windows
button and press the number that
coincides with a program running from
left to right on the taskbar for example
I want to launch the Google Chrome
program which is second from the left so
I hit windows to the VLC player is fifth
from the left so I hit Windows 5 this is
also a feature I've grown accustomed to
and I use quite often I mean come on
moving your mouse is so 2007 ok let's
actually bring the VLC player back up
and I'll show you a cool new feature in
Windows 7 you can grab almost any
program and run it against the edges of
your desktop it will stick to the edge
and scale the window on the side of the
screen so if you for example run it over
here on the right and release it will
scale the application to the right side
of the screen or if left is your
preference you can easily place it on
the left if you drag the program to the
upper edge it will maximize the window
new feature saves time and scaling
windows to appropriate size for example
in multitasking situations and I
actually use this feature quite a lot
while writing my thesis during the
couple of months of writing I actually
watched four seasons of Battlestar
Galactica on split screen you know heat
is some inspiration for the writing
multitasking at its best
excellent show by the way I just ordered
the whole series on blu-ray to replace
my DVDs another feature coming up is
called arrow shake for this we need to
create a bit of a mess so let's open all
these programs on top of the VLC player
ever so often you might find yourself in
a situation where you have a lot of
windows and junk open on the desktop and
you just need to get rid of all windows
except one arrow or shake is a solution
for this just grab a program from the
top and shake it violently as you can
see all other windows are minimized
shake it again and it's a mess all over
again and shake not a bad feature but
sometimes you just want to clear the
entire desktop and a button for this is
found way down here on the right
clicking it will clear the desktop
it's great to see that this time around
Microsoft have really listened to the
core users they've kept all the features
that worked and fixed or improved on
some of the features and issues that
didn't work on Windows Vista one of the
reasons why has skipped on Windows Vista
was the gaming on the operating system
was worse than on Windows XP as you may
have guessed I play a lot of games here
are some of the games I've played
recently but let's take a look at how
Windows 7 can handle one of my favorites
okay video settings art max and let's
play some fallout 3 with Windows 7 on
Vista I would be getting some lower
frame rates and some stability issues as
well even though Vista had DirectX 10
support which is the XP lacked not many
games supported DirectX 10 at the time
so I had no reason to stick with Vista
but Windows 7 brings a change to this
it's equally as fast as XP in gaming and
it brings DirectX 10 support and support
for the upcoming DirectX 11 as well
hello kind sirs would you like to have 8
minutes
have saw
Oh
that's gotta hurt this is the first of
many windows 7 videos to come next month
I'll be comparing Windows 7 against the
Mac OS X 10 Snow Leopard which launches
in September so stay tuned
