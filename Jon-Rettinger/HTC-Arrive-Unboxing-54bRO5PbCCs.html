TechnoBuffalo comm and Sprint's first
Windows 7 phone the HTC arrive just
arrived get it or arrived yeah that's
not funny let's get out of the box all
right here it is the HTC arrived the
first Windows 7 phone for Sprint first
CDMA Windows 7 phone I believe it is
available March 20th for one $99.99 on
two-year contract after rebate you can
pre-order it now from Sprint if you so
choose it's made by HTC here's the phone
we will hit the power button and while
it's powering up show you what's inside
the box thanks to the folks at Sprint
for lending us the device they did not
send it to us to keep we did not
purchase it it's a review loaner that we
will be sending back in the box you get
the getting started guide the manuals
your your mailer for recycling your own
old phone please recycle your old
gadgets when you're done with them or
you know if you can donate them or sell
them do that as well especially right
now with what's going on in the world
and in Japan and and Japan's really not
the only place in need of some aid but
definitely you know a huge devastating
event still unfolding over there you
know donating your old stuff can really
help somebody else out if you take the
time to find out how and if not them
please recycle it anyway there you go
off the soapbox but it's important also
in the Box you get a stereo headset 3.5
millimeter headphone jack inline you get
your USB cable for data and charging and
then your modular power adapter so
here's the phone itself it's got a three
point six inch WVGA display HTC sees 7-5
7-5 as its otherwise known but you can
just call it the arrive if you like and
then gets this stuff off the back here
so we can show you around let's get
started
Windows Phone 7 will just go up
customize so on the front you've got
your touchscreen display you've got a
three capacitive touch buttons down at
the bottom on the left spine you've got
a wrapper switch for plus/minus volume
you've got your USB port on the right
spine there is a camera button the
camera will snap photos even while the
phone is locked or so I've been led to
believe also up top headphone jack power
switch on the bottom just a microphone
port on the back five megapixel camera
autofocus flash 720p HD video capture
I've got the the brush metal there and
then the phone slides up and it's got
kind of the slide and tilt so HTC has
been doing this kind of thing for a
while and I've always been a fan of
HTC's keyboards and we first saw this
design your way back on the HTC tilt
we've seen it in a bunch of different
incarnations since then oh I think my
battery might be be powering down it
said critical so that's to plug it in
but you've got the fibro HTC keyboard
pretty familiar from starting with the
touch pro2 i'll ago get a separate line
for numerical keys which is nice
dedicated backspace key you dedicate a
function speed function key double wide
spacebar emoticon key some symbol keys
shift key with shift lock i believe it
as shift lock actually I should
double-check before I go saying that but
I believe it's shift luck there you go
again I'm a big fan of HTC's keyboards
in general excited to try this one out
alright we're back plugged into the
outlet there I thought I could sneak
through the whole unboxing with whatever
power was in the phone when it arrived
but arrived get it but I guess not
anyway so it's got the device has 16
gigs of internal memory internal storage
and also has the one gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor inside not a dual
core not you know whatever just a one
gigahertz single core wish you know
frankly I think is more power than a lot
of people realized but it's also pretty
easy to get caught up in
- of course here now what I want
single-core so you know I get it but
anyway yeah so uh you know all the
windows services we're not gonna do that
right now the the live tiles the Xbox
integration you know all this stuff
obviously the UI is not yet designed to
rotate so there's a couple of Windows
Phone devices their side sliders now on
your home screen you know doesn't rotate
part of the signup process rotated but
the home screen UI does not rotate I'll
tell you what that pick up boxing you
know battery life issues whatever but
not only for the battery charge I want
to just get this out to you so you can
check out the arrived anyway as we were
saying one gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor 16 gigs of internal storage
802 11 BG and Wi-Fi you know I really
like Windows Mobile 7 in general and so
I'm excited to play with this with the
different hubs going on and the Xbox
Live integration and all that stuff but
those those updates the copy and paste
the other updates have to hit soon for
Windows Phone 7 and and the Nokia deal
you know hopefully getting Nokia's
muscle behind the hardware and the
things will help as well but I'm you
know you've got the whole office hub
with all the office OneNote and the you
know mobile office apps and all that
kind of stuff but you can't cut and
paste in the operating system and that's
kind of a drag anyway we'll get more
into Windows Phone 7 and a full review
of this device but for now I'm excited
to check it out I've played before with
a couple of the other one is from seven
devices including the HTC made what was
that one called the not the focus the
focus was the Samsung the surround with
the slide-out speakers and I was really
waiting for to get my hands on a Windows
Phone 7 device with a full keyboard LG
has one but I haven't had the chance to
really have one of those but now I have
one I'm psyched to try it out again you
know too bad the UI doesn't rotate but
you know baby steps I guess it's the HSC
arrived Windows Phone 7 for Sprint and
HTC made hit sprint on March 20th 1 9999
on contract after rebate you can
pre-order now
you like and we'll have much much more
on this device on the video channels as
well as over on TechnoBuffalo comm and
on the Facebook page and on Twitter and
you know anywhere else if you run into
me at the Oakland Oakland Zoo I'll tell
you what I think of the phone so far
I'll probably even have it on me so next
time my name is Noah thanks for watching
the arrived is departing we'll see you
next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
