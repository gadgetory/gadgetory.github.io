gonna show you some tips and tricks for
the Amazon Kindle 2 so guys first and
foremost the Kindle 2 is an e-book
reader meeting it's a digital way to
read all of your print content so that's
books magazines and even blogs but the
Kindle also has a lot of hidden features
right below the servers that I've been
discovering as I've been using the
device I thought it could be fun to
share them with you so let me start with
one of the big ones that I was shocked
to find so you guys know I'm a Mac user
so I'm not one to play my super terribly
often although it does come with every
version of Windows so the Kindle
actually has minesweeper built right in
so make sure you guys how to do that
here you go it's shift alt + M on the
full keyboard right there hit him at the
same time shift alt + M and there you go
a full minesweeper game just actually
kind of fun and I'm not sure why Amazon
doesn't Erica is the fact that this
thing has games built on it but they
don't so some of the next kind of tips
and trick that the same has here you
guess you can also take a screenshot of
whatever you have so similar to your
iPhone when you hold down the Menu
button and the power at the top the King
that let's take a screenshot for you -
and you have to hit alt shift + G and
I'll store that in a Doug gift format
it's your Documents folder so if you
have a Kindle to go ahead and do that
and it's alt shift in G I'll show what
that looks like and it flashes just like
the iPhone screen doesn't take a
screenshot there goes letting it know
that you took is great job it's actually
very cool so when you go ahead and hit
menu you get a lot of choices you could
view the Kindle Store search setting
experimental I'll walk you guys through
most of these during my software
overview of the Kindle but there are
some sort of hidden things that the menu
does that you guys might not recognize
when you push a menu first throw stop of
the device it just says John's Kindle my
sprint 3
signal which by the way is free for you
by the Kindle and my battery meter but
if I hit menu I also get the time
letting me know 3G is on if I haven't
dropped down to slower data rates and
also tells me how much space I have free
so I know the built-in two gigabytes
storage I've got just under 1.5 left
that's a really quick way to see how
much storage you have available and this
is a quick fYI that you get good bytes
of storage amazon says can hold almost
1,500 books so most of the storage space
that's being used right now is just for
the OS itself it's a lot of heat stuff
shows up when you hit the menu button so
some other cool stuff that's here too
you can also display their websites or
the internet very quickly and very
easily
all you have to do is type in the search
in the five-way controller and then
select Google so at there at the bottom
you start typing down have to right
there it says search my items if you
select it you can actually keep
scrolling over store Google Wikipedia or
dictionary type or whatever you like and
you immediately go right to that it
actually is very handy if you're
interested in some diagnostic
information on the Kindle go ahead and
hit menu you go down to settings once
you're in settings if you hit for one
one who actually get a myriad of
diagnostic information that can help you
know if your device is register to give
you a serial number for privacy reasons
I'm not gonna go ahead open that for you
but I just wanted to show you guys what
that looked like
there all kinds of shortcuts that use a
keyboard for if from on a door you move
a bookmark you can just hit all to be if
you hit alt shift plus 1 through 9
they'll change the spacing the number of
the pages which is kind of neat if you
want a list view of a magazine you're
reading I have to do is press the 5 way
enter button it's actually pretty neat a
lot of text-to-speech shortcuts to you
can start or stop the speech by predator
passing ship SIM just a lot of little
tips and tricks guys that I found as
I've gone through this those are the
kind of the big ones that there
are but just want to share them with you
I hope you enjoyed that make sure you
stick around for the full review coming
up in the next day or two of the Amazon
Kindle - I'm gonna go back to read see
you guys in next video bye bye and for
