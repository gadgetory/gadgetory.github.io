techno but flu here and I've got a
two-for-one unboxing for you this is the
Asus Padfone X it's a phone it's a
tablet it's a one device does everything
for you let's go a take a first look see
what it's all about so here is the box
for the Asus Padfone X it is a big box
typical AT&amp;amp;T orange I do want to give
the disclaimer that this is a
pre-production unit so it's
pre-production hardware and
pre-production software we don't know
price you don't know release date but we
do know it's going to cost something and
it is indeed coming soon it's a very
novel idea so what it is it's a phone
that docks into a tablet so you get sort
of two for one one of the big advantage
of this so especially with a carrier
like AT&amp;amp;T is that you only have to pay
one data plan sort of get two functional
devices it's kind of neat so run through
all the specs here is the tablet part of
it I think the phone and clearly see
where the phones are going to go right
in the back push that's off to the side
for a quick second see if the phone is
gonna live in here it's kind of a neat
unboxing of two devices in one pull off
that tray and here is the phone apart
this is like a twofer here it's two for
the price of one so push with that
adults were going to have inside the box
probably lots of charging cables I would
wager there is your charging brick with
USB there is a pair of headphones and
there's a micro USB cable and in this
side warranty information and that's
about it
so I pushed the box off to the side toss
that on the floor we got a lot of stuff
to look at here so let's start with the
phone want to go ahead and peel all the
plastic here and off the bat it feels
like a very solid device now let's take
off the plastic on the tablet part of it
boom - whooshing noises in one unboxing
video pretty neat okay so let's run
through the specs what we are looking at
at least on the phone is a 5-inch
display with a 1920 by 1080 resolution
at 441 PPI so that's full HD Android 4.4
at launch 2.3 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 it's a quad-core chip
tupiza ram 16 gigs internal storage but
you can expand that with micro sd it's
got a 13 megapixel shooter living right
there today pixel shooter right on the
front 802 11 ABG and an AC bluetooth 4.0
and a 2300 million power battery it also
has a wireless charger to you like to
see the back of it a sort of a soft
touch plastic looks to be a little bit
finger printing but not too bad so again
as I mentioned the idea here is that you
take the phone and you dock it into the
tablet the specs on the tablet sort of
just an extension of the phone we are
going to get a 9 inch display with
gigantic bezels giving it a 1920 by 1200
resolution it's got a one megapixel
front facing camera there but we'll use
the back camera when you've got it in
tablet so I'll use that 13 megapixel
shooter it also has a battery built-in
and so almost 5000 million dollars at
4990 so it'll keep powering your device
it also will charge the phone when you
drop it in here so it's kind of neat
let's take a quick look at the phone and
then we'll turn off these two altogether
so go ahead and unlock this and you gets
these sort of a Seuss's take on Android
it's a light skin it's not overly giant
it looks like you know the kind of
Android B Android and it is Android 4.4
at least it launched which is quite nice
but let's just go and confirm that the
specs can always change from what gets
announced to actually makes its way to
the phone so let's go down to the bottom
about looks very similar to what LG is
done Android 4.4.2 is here on the device
on the left hand side we've got nothing
on the front you've got on-screen button
so you've got your backbone your home
but your multitasking button living
right there on the right volume up and
down and power and lock microphone 3.5
millimeter headset jack on the bottom
that is where your micro USB charging
port is going to live alright let's go
ahead and dock this guy and see what
happened so it looks like it just drops
on in so go ahead and have the back
facing out so you've got the ability to
use a camera slides up riesling push it
down you get a bit of click the tablet
vibrates and now you're using a full
fledge android tablet with its own sort
of OS here and again kind of neat color
informations gonna go back and forth
because using exactly the same device
when the phone is in it too little bit
on the heavy side and again these bezels
are significant but you get two devices
with only one data point so you're
getting really your money's worth
with this device you get a pretty nicely
SPECT phone - it's sort of on par with
the latest flagship handsets from a
screen standpoint and from a processor
and spec standpoint on the tablet side
power button in the upper left hand
corner really nothing else around it
volume is going to live on the left and
there is a charging port on the bottom
of the website for charging the device
the folks at AT&amp;amp;T also sent us some
other accoutrement to do with it we've
got a mobile dock which is a dock it's a
keyboard accessory it also has I believe
external battery net let's go and take a
quick look at this slice action cuts you
plastic all right go ahead open this up
its attempt to get out of their box
there so we get like three unboxings
here in one video so here is the
keyboard kind of making this a laptop a
hydrator this is gonna be probably a
very heavy device when you for a
couple's together but there it is looks
like it just drops right on in nothing
else in the box do a little bit of this
and now you've got three of an ultrabook
android tablet that you can take with
you and this is what it looks like with
the phone doc didn't so there's quite a
lot of parts I'm moving here as well
there also are cases I can with it we've
got a folio bundle here to case that
sort of encompasses the phone and the
tablet lets you sort of prop it up but
seeing things like this in the past so
here is the full Asus Padfone X with all
of its accessories ready to go I know
