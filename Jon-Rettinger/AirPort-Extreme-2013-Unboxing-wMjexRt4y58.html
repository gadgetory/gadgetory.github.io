technobuffalo you with an unboxing of
five Airport Express is also known as
the airport extreme just announced a few
short days ago at least for me at the
WWDC this managed am is going to set you
back just shy of two hundred clams Apple
will also be very happy to sell you a
version with hard drives inside of it
they call that the time capsule but this
guy does not have a hard drive in it
let's go ahead and unbox it so the box
here is very huge dare I even say prism
shaped nothing that exciting to see
there tells you what ports are on there
but we're going to see that in person in
just a minute let's go ahead and cut the
plastic this is the ceremonial Apple
plastic cutting I will say though on
first blush this does not appear to be
the best looking product on the market
despite it having 802 11 AC and a ton
more antennas on the outgoing airport
extreme not so sure that Apple's will
lead designers are working on this
perhaps we had a few interns that maybe
had a few too many drinks and they put
this together but if it works that's
what I care about I will take a product
especially one like this that looks
perhaps not like it belong to the Louvre
but functions well over anything else so
that's the box here is the airport
extreme and that is definitely extreme
kind of reminiscent the white version of
perhaps the new mac pro's so push it off
the side for just a minute we've got
apples designed by Apple in California I
assume we've got a power cord in there
we do this is for very excitingly giving
this power if you didn't know we've got
a set-up guide for guiding your setup
let's take a look at what we got here we
will peel off the stickers ready oh no
status fighting whoosh and all there
there we go good again I gotta get that
noise let's kill us off all the way
around if you want to know what this
thing feels like the polycarbonate
plastic it feels like the same material
right off the back of one of the Nokia
Lumia devices now it's a word a very
reminiscent of that so on the bottom is
also a sticker you could pull this off
and see the internals the folks at
iFixit did it you will find a spot for
her
drive not the proper connections to do
it so don't plan on taking a sucker
apart so we've got three Gigabit
Ethernet connections one USB port but of
course you can hook up a hub and connect
a lot of stuff and that's where your
main hard line is going to go and then
power and there's a reset button there
as well this is the first Apple through
wireless accessory that has supported
802 11 AC so supposedly you can get you
know five times the range and also and
hopefully much faster transfer speeds so
I'm actually very curious to check out
now 802 11 HD a non-reflective apple
logo at the top and that's really it
doesn't weigh all that much looks a
little fugly but if it functions that's
all I care about also have a appears to
be a status indicator like they're so
green flecks you know it's working yet
i'll let you know you got trouble and no
like let you know you didn't figure out
what this guy does anyway if you guys
want to see anything else about this i'm
happy to share so let live down in the
comments down below i'm jon rettinger
from TechnoBuffalo check us out at
technobuffalo com I will see you in the
next video
