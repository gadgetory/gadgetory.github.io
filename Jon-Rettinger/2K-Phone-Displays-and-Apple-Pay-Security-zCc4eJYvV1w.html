you by Linda calm what's up everybody
walk back to episode of ask the Buffalo
I'm your host Jon Rangers to show where
you could ask any question that you
might have from the consumer electronics
world and sometimes outside of it up
this week we're talk about 2k screens
and personal questions to talk a little
bit about Apple pay and will spread in a
bit of news about our new office in the
new studio guys are seeing disaster
buffle it's going to get started first
question comes from Twitter at alexs
suits ass at john for lakers is a clue
2k display really matter on the screen
under 6 inches hashtag at the beat that
is a very good question so you've seen
2k or qhd screens in the market right
now he's from the widespread use in the
LG g3 then 04 is having a qhd screen
it's or more and more phones coming out
its gonna have that as a standard the
screens look great but for what I've
seen so far they look just like really
good 1080p displays you put a great
1080p display right next to a qHD
display just doing regular stuff you
won't notice that big a difference we
did it's a big difference though it's
reviewing really large images or images
to have a lot of pixels and you can view
the whole image on your screen if you do
a lot of that then it makes a huge
difference no matter what screen size
you're on if you don't do much of that I
haven't seen a really compelling reason
yet for a qhd screen today's feature to
have but I wouldn't go and buy a phone
just because of that is the only feature
next one comes from Twitter as well at
Time Warp 2303 ass at John for lakers
who is your most influential
entrepreneur so there's a lot of
incredible entrepreneurs in the world
I've tried to sort of emulate and learn
and read a lot about a few i think steve
job is certainly one of them Elon Musk
is definitely another alow he didn't
start Tesla Motors and certainly Richard
Branson from version is an incredible
story those are three people that I
really admire obviously there are a lot
more folks out there but those three
I've really tried to learn about try and
follow the business practices at least
learn the good in the bad and work and
didn't work so those are definitely send
out in my mind next one comes from at
two rembert underscore Beltran who asked
at john for lakers what do you like to
do for fun besides review tech we've
asked me this question about a year ago
I could give you a long list of answers
would it include going to movies going
for hikes just hanging out traveling
going to be surfing now got a
one-year-old at home I don't get a
chance to get out that much
unfortunately although i will say now
hanging out at home has become one of my
new favorite hobbies just turning off my
phone and hang out my family something I
really enjoy whether it's just taking
the baby and my wife for a walk and just
go into the neighborhood are going out
to mall and just walk around with them
those are my new hobbies that's what I
enjoy he's definitely have changed since
the little guy came around but most
definitely for the better let me do
everyone's favorite thing and interrupt

that's ly and DA com second buffer back
to questions next one comes from ads Leo
the Lion 96 to a SAT John for lakers do
you think that Apple pay revolutionized
the mobile payments and moving forward
about its security and ease of use so
flash back a few years ago in Google
Wallet hit I was pretty sure Google
Wallet was going to change the way we
pay I think the world is waiting for a
more secure nfc-based system I know
Europe has the pin and chip credit card
system that's worked very well for them
and certainly we're getting that here in
the US about time but they need to be a
more secure way to use mobile devices to
pay I thought Google Wallet was going to
be that we didn't see Google Wallet
really get that sort of market
penetration that we expected Apple pay
could be a little bit on the different
side a lot of people were wondering why
Apple waited this long to push out
google pay I think the answers are kind
of interesting a first course Toronto
Reuters technology was ready but no
reason the technology couldn't been
ready a few years ago the United States
is now going to have to start using that
same pen on chip technology that's being
used in Europe other parts of the world
so merchants are the next figure you can
start treating out their equipment and
it would make sense they would start to
get their equipment didn't start
supporting apple pay as well as long as
you're buying you stuff might as well
support everything as opposed to when
Google Wallet came out they can have to
change equipment if they
supported tap to pay them yeah Google
what would work but some of the
terminals didn't work at all so I do
think Apple pay is going to take off I
really like that serve delivered to
secure credit card number so the person
swiping your card never sees a card
number the merchant never sees your part
number that's we can be nice and realize
just on your thumb so yeah I think we're
going to see sort of Apple pay and other
payment systems like it really really
now start to get to mass adoption last
question comes from at Xavier 77 Pat
Chico who asked at John flickers house
