TechnoBuffalo still hands-on at the
Google event this time hands-on with the
all new pixel slate this is Google's
answer to the iPad pro and the Microsoft
Surface pro line they say that this is
the device you want to use for content
consumption and also content creation so
a couple of different highlights here
quickly on the new pixel state it's got
a custom-made pixel panel on here a high
definition panel on the pixel slate that
google says it's 293 pixels per inch
really good for HD video watch it we
don't know a resolution on that we don't
know a lot of specs on this but Google
is counting that it is a really nice
panel for content consumption you saw
you've also got dual front firing stereo
speakers again good for watching movies
watching YouTube TV anything else like
that it's a very thin device it feels
very premium and thin in the hand that's
going to be thanks to a very simple
design kind of Google is industrial
design and simple i/o not a lot of
buttons here you've got a fingerprint
reader built in the power button up on
top you've got two cameras on you're a
front-facing 8 megapixel wide-angle lens
great for group conference calls or
getting group selfies on your tablet and
also supports portrait mode as well if
you're into that sort of thing and
you've got an 8 megapixel on the back of
it 8 megapixel camera on the back of the
pixel 8 as well this is running a chrome
OS operating system that is optimized
for touch to Google says you're going to
get all the google apps on here you're
going to get the full chrome OS
experience but it's optimized and ready
to go for touch
you've got some machine learning things
built in here as well Google assistant
is all across the operating system
obviously you've got some different
machine learning suggestions like hey
play a game we saw you're watching
YouTube TV you want to launch YouTube
you can do that also very easily and
you're also getting the full desktop
chrome experience if I search just for
example here with technical Buffalo on
YouTube it's going to show up just as it
would on your Chrome browser so you're
going to get the full videos
everything's going to look pretty much
the same and it's going to look like
you're basically getting a full of
Chrome experience on your windows your
Mac any device you're going to get the
full experience
on there as well starting price tag for
this device is going to be $5.99 it's
going to come in a number of different
configurations obviously it's going to
come in this blue color but it's going
to be available in different
configurations as for our storage size
as well as process or memory all that
stuff and you also have a couple of
different keyboard accessories and pen
accessories
you've got the pixel slate keyboard it
offers a backlit keyboard with kind of
these rounded typewriter s keys feels
really nice feels very clean them goes
like there's a pretty good comfortable
typing distance on you feels good and
you've also got a pretty decently sized
track front on here as well again Google
is stressing that you can use this just
by touch though you do have the option
to use a full-size keyboard and track
but if you want to and again this all
connects in a very smart connector esque
style on the tablet on the slate here so
for full details on this check out
technical Buffalo talk from of all the
details pricing availability specs all
that but for now this is just a very
quick a very brief hands-on with the
pixel slate what do you guys think are
you sold on it are you not would you
rather have an iPad or a surface leave
your comments down below and let us know
thank you guys so much for watching I'm
Robert Rosen probably talking about
below I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
