technobuffalo here the HTC first is just
freshly unboxed but the highlighted
isn't the phone itself it's a software
that's running Facebook's home software
so I wanna give you guys an overview of
Facebook komik help decide whether or
not you want to order pre-order this
phone or not I want to wait to see what
facebook does or the coming months let's
go ahead an get started alright so the
first thing you'll notice about facebook
home is that the lock screen is also
your home screen so I have not used this
long enough to give a full review
facebook home i do want to give you an
overview about how it works what it does
and what it doesn't do so you can help
decide whether or not you want to
preorder or order the HTC first so this
is what you're going to see when you
unlock your phone assuming you don't
have a password here password I'll cover
in the full review so this is your lock
screen in your home screen you can
scroll through and see all the updates
your friends have done if you want to
like something you can double tap it you
get that cool little noise you can
always like it down there if you want to
see comments on it you can hit the
comments down there and of course you
can leave a comment there as well you go
back you can also select the person or
company that put that up and it's going
to open the actual facebook app and you
can view it that way just idea what if
you are on regular facebook on any other
phone alright so you've got your little
icon right down there and if you hold
that down you get a few options here so
to the right is going to be the app you
just used last up is going to go to your
apps and left is going to go right to
messenger let's go to apps real quickly
and there are a few ways to view apps
first you've got this quick view apps
this is the quickest way to access your
phone if you want to make a phone call
some settings or things you might use
very quickly and you find it odd though
that if you want to access the camera
that's the quickest way to get to the
camera you don't have any sort of
shortcut to get there right from that
initial home and lock screen you know if
our phone that's very Facebook centric
you'd figure photos would be really
important but there you can update your
status you can update picture or you can
check into something if you would like
to if you want to see the rest three
applications you can scroll on over to
the left then you get sort of a typical
Android view of all your stuff including
Google search I interestingly though if
you scroll down to the bottom you see a
settings called more if you click that
you be taken to Nate
naked Android and this is just Android
and it's naked 4.1 form you do whatever
you want go back to Facebook home you
just go ahead and hit home and there you
are if you want to tweak the home
settings there's an icon for that you
can go to home settings you can turn
facebook home on or off show the status
bar if you turn that off if you pull
this down it's not going to come all the
way down I think I'll show you that in a
moment you can set home when screen
turns on and a few other settings here
so I turned off the pulldown I'll go
ahead and go back if you pull this down
you just get a brief notification that
you could pull it down again and get
everything there you can also access a
facebook home and quick settings by
hitting the home button there or at
least the menu button you can get the
home settings right there if you want to
log in and see something let's go back
and talk about apps this is an AT&amp;amp;T
phone it's AT&amp;amp;T branded but there really
aren't many 18yo cific apps on here now
you've got my AT&amp;amp;T and you've got a
visual voicemail client and that is
really it so no bloatware really to be
found on this so if you don't want to
use facebook home you can pretty much
have stock Android with some cool
features so the cool feature I'm talking
about is chat heads it's a cool way to
view your face with messages or SMS and
integrated completely with the HTC first
and there's one from Roy choice does
knock knock can move it anywhere you
want well you're either on the home
screen or an application so you'll put
an application and show you what it
looks like so if you're in chrome for
example you can move that and you can
see exactly what's going on if you want
to see what rice then you can tap it so
knock knock who's there cargo cargo who
cargo beep beep and there's a picture of
Ralph that he sent me doing Ralph like
things and that'll stay there really
doing whatever you want it to do and if
you again you don't want Facebook home
you could turn facebook home off but you
can still keep chat heads which is kind
of cool and if you want to get rid of
chat heads you can select it and drag it
right down to the x1 of the operating
systems from days past I really liked
was palms webos the handle notifications
very cool you got a little bar that
showed up at the bottom you could swipe
it off the screen if you wanted to
notifications here for facebook home or
handled very much the same way they're
going to pop right up on the middle of
the screen you can read it you can tap
into it
or you can throw it right off the screen
it's very cool to see they did a very
nice job with it so the lot of things
that I wish this had facebook has said
that they're gonna issue updates on a
monthly basis so hopefully we'll get
some of those moving forward or like to
have a way to quickly access my phone
for example a quick way to access camera
would be very cool to see Facebook
though the engineers done an incredible
job tweaking this code to make it really
fast this is super duper fast you can
scroll through absolutely everything so
how useful it is that's really gonna
depend on you I think it's kind of cool
right now on but again we just got the
phone in so it still has that novelty
effect seeing how things work having it
being your lockscreen your home screen
it's a bit weird if you have a password
on here and you go ahead and unlock your
phone you have different options but if
you unlock it you can still view your
apps but if you want to actually access
an application then it's going to ask
for your password so be very wary of
that if you rely heavily on passwords
but if you're considering a device like
the Nexus 4 for example because you want
native Android but you want LTE as well
as kind of a cool off drink you can flip
this on and off depending on what you
want to do overall I mean it seems to be
pretty enjoyable I want to use it for a
little bit you know while longer and see
how good it is you're not good and will
do a full review of facebook home and a
full review on HTC first but tonight's
combination of hardware and software
from anodyne telephony I wasn't
expecting you know blistering fast
speeds this is a pretty quick little
device I think HTC might have a winner
on the hands that people are willing to
give this device a shot now the facebook
home is kind of a cool UI it works well
enough if you hold you know daddy kelly
different options there's a lot of room
for improvement and i'm curious to see
what facebook does over the coming
months so hope you guys enjoyed what do
you guys think of the HTC first in
facebook home i love to hear your
comments i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo give this video a thumbs
up we must definitely appreciate it I
will see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
