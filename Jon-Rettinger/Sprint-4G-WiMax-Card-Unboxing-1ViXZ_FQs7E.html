technobuffalo and in this video we're
going to unbox the sprint 4G card spread
is the first carrier to have 4G service
and what that means is that if you plug
in this device to your laptop or even
your desktop you'll get super fast
download and upload speeds compared to
3g we've been hearing about this
technology it's built off of wimax for a
while now and it's finally here it's
deployed in about 15 cities I live near
Philadelphia so I'm going to be able to
get some 4G coverage but over time it's
going to be expanding to lots of other
cities just like their 3g coverage has
so let's open the box all right and here
we go and hmmm what is this personal
wireless hotspot we're going to look at
that in a second and then here comes the
3g card so it looks like any USB dongle
really any wireless 3g that card you
would get from AT&amp;amp;T or from verizon but
it has the capability to also do 4g if
you don't have 4g in your area it will
just revert back to 3g so while we're
doing this a note on speed if you a 3g
card or using a 3g device you'll get
between 400 kilobits per second and 1.4
megabits per second download speed on 4g
you will get from three to six megabits
per second down which is almost as fast
as plugging in to a standard cable modem
running on a wired configuration so
that's really fast speeds so let's take
a look at what's inside the box here
presented quite nicely in the center of
sort of a interesting checkered texture
we'll take a look at that in a second
get started and accessories okay little
foam insert and we have a mini CD to set
up the the drivers we have a little
chamois to clean oh it's actually a
little case for the 4g time we've also
got it looks like a
I don't know what this is we're gonna
have to talk about what all this stuff
is some connectors this is probably for
use with a desktop so you can actually
anchor it to the wall and have it use
you know up up in a high place for an
antenna and then we have some manuals
let's take a closer look at this 4G card
it's quite small and it should fit quite
nicely onto any size laptop and it looks
like this just swivels out we're going
to full speed tests and comparisons
coming up in the next few videos we're
really curious to see how fast the true
upload and download speed is of this 4G
network and how good the coverage is
here in Philadelphia let's take a look
at this other device which actually
looks like a mifi but the idea is that
you plug in the 4g card to this device
and you get a 4g Wi-Fi for those of you
unfamiliar the Wi-Fi pulls down cellular
data and spits out Wi-Fi so if you're in
the car where you are at the park you
can actually create a wireless hotspot
right there and have multiple people
connect with our laptops or other
devices that use Wi-Fi so pretty neat
product here so there it says create a
secure Wi-Fi hotspot in seconds wonder
how bulky this is going to be quick
start guide here is some power it runs
on batteries let's see how big this
battery is to get an indication of sort
of how long it'll last it is 1800
milliamp hours which is pretty good for
a device of this type and here is the
device itself alright so pretty small
not as small as the mifi the mifi is
extremely tiny nice reflective coating
here and of course the idea is that you
take your 4g card and plug it right into
here and then within seconds you have
Wi-Fi on 4G speeds it's actually called
the y-pipe instead of the mifi
pretty cool that's where the battery
goes a little bit more bulky than the my
phone and finally I just want to plug
this into my my netbook to see how much
it protrudes so put it over here and as
expected it comes out a few inches but
that's really the average size of a
device of this type so a word on cost
this cost zero dollars after a rebate if
you don't sign up for a new service plan
it's a hundred and thirty dollars the
service plan costs 59 99 per month and
that will let you use to the 4g or the
3g service and it only allows you for
five gigabytes of data transfer and that
may not seem like a lot if you're doing
a lot of streaming video you probably
want to wait until you're in a Wi-Fi
hotspot to do that but if you're doing a
lot of emailing a lot of stuff on google
docs just checking out some websites the
standard website with some pictures the
blog style website that is actually
enough and and you'll be surprised at
how far that takes you so we've got a
lot more coming up on the sprint 4G card
we're going to see how fast this
actually is and we're going to test this
interesting wide pipe device to see how
well it works in turning 4G into Wi-Fi
we'll be back soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
