TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you a full review of the HTC surround
powered by Windows Phone 7 I know a lot
of you are interested in the operating
system and this is one of the flagship
devices on AT&amp;amp;T let's go ahead see if
it's worth your hard-earned 199 bucks
all right so before I get to the phone
review and go over all the specs I
generally like to start a phone overview
of what talking about call quality if
the phone doesn't make good phone calls
no matter what the operating system is
or what it can do it's not gonna be much
use to you the HTC surround does make
excellent phone calls call quality is
absolutely outstanding it was able to
pull in the strong 5 bar signal really
most of places that I went where most
phones would get me maybe four bars of
3G this is pointing in a much stronger
signal certainly bars are a bit
arbitrary from device to device but this
did have a very strong antenna
speakerphone I'm gonna hold off on so
we're gonna talk about a little bit
later that's sort of the reason that
this device is called the surround I'm
from a call quality standpoint was
absolutely outstanding alright so now
that we've discussed that let me review
the spec to this guy with you it has a
3.8 inch that's diagonal WVGA resolution
screen which means 480 by 800 it's got a
1 gigahertz Snapdragon processor with
just sort of the minimum requirements
for Windows Phone 7 and I will say the
Snapdragon processor feels very fast on
Windows Phone 7 devices that I've tested
that would be the HTC surround and the
Samsung focus really seems to be
optimized it feels much as if e'er then
the Snapdragon processor feels on even
the Android device it has 16 gigs of
internal storage 512 megabytes of from
448 of RAM it's gone on the back a 5
megapixel camera it just will do
autofocus LED flash of course and a
video capabilities which will record at
720p it also has this sort of Dolby
mobile we'll talk about in just a few
minutes it's got a digital compass 802
11 N which is sort of a little bit rare
now for mobile
becoming more commonplace it's got a
1230 milliamp hour battery and this
thing weighs it's actually a little bit
on the heavier side a Wang 165 grams or
5.2 8 ounces or 5.8 2 ounces rather with
the battery in there so let's just jump
in and talk about the battery first this
is a very media centric device if you
saw my overview on Windows Phone 7 you
know this phone does a lot of stuff with
these live tiles playing information and
even though it doesn't have multitasking
support for third-party applications
there's a lot of stuff in the background
for the native apps and that sucks
battery this 1230 milliamp hour battery
you're going to have a hard time getting
through a full day of use with regular
email and having sort of send push
messages using the phone probably 2 to 3
hours a day and sort of checking and
replying to email and doing some light
web browsing but I mean the end of the
day came around I was searching for an
outlet because I thought this was going
to die on me any day or any minute
rather that was typical of pretty much
every day so if you are going to use
this device you may want to consider
picking up an extra battery or really
monitor how you're using the phone you
might not want to set your email push
you might want to set it to sort of pull
the stuff in every 15 minutes or 30
minutes and going back to the weight the
phone feels very heavy it's got sort of
a sturdy feel to it and a little bit
heavier than you'd expect from a mobile
device
it certainly has HTC is really solid
build quality it feels good it looks
kind of industrial and as you slide the
phone up you don't have a keyboard but I
actually have this sort of Dolby mobile
surround which is really one of the
through the key offerings of this device
which also on the back reveals a
kickstand so you can push this guy up
and you can watch or listen to your
content now I do a lot of meetings a lot
of conference calls without a device
like this would be perfect with this
really big speaker will be great for
conference calls and serve this is the
first time we've seen this Dolby virtual
surround sound mobile sobs very excited
let me give you a demonstration as to
what this sounds like I'm gonna go ahead
and play a YouTube video and one of the
novice devices does not actually have a
native e2 player you
the download and app which will let you
watch videos from YouTube comm from the
mobile site here's a video of that I did
actually of the Motorola Droid unboxing
a while back and this is with the Dolby
Digital offline here it it sounds like
and this may not be the best test to
show on video kuzia microphones not
gonna capture the true sound so you sort
of the standard speaker now let me turn
the Dolby Digital home and it sounds no
different and that is don't bother
adjusting your speakers really doesn't
do much though how you pauses here I was
quite surprised and really disappointed
actually in this Dolby mobile I really
didn't do anything other than just drink
battery a little bit more a speakerphone
for something this loud was a little bit
on the tinny side and wasn't even close
to what I expected of the quality from a
device that calls itself the store round
so wallet should be usable and it's a
fine speakerphone I certainly wouldn't
call it a flagship feature of the device
it works it works alright the Dolby
thing is more of disapprobation anything
else the speakerphone doesn't sound any
better than any other mobile phone that
I test it something definitely to keep
in mind if it's around it this is one of
the reasons you're looking to purchase
it go ahead and slide this got closed so
Microsoft is sort of put in limitations
for what phone manufacturers you can do
with the operates with them as a core
but what sort of separates Windows Phone
7 is that these manufacturers can make
their own sort of hubs actually see
you're sort of done that right here so
your experience using any Windows Phone
7 the operating system is going to look
the same
let's get differentiate it though are
these hubs which is kind of a cool
middle ground between what Apple does
keeping things locked down and these
sort of wide openness of Android where
your user experience can vary from
device to device let's take a look at
the HTC hub which you want things that
really separates it from the other
mobile phones and if you've used HTC
Sense on an Android phone or previous
generation Windows Mobile Phone
you look very familiar to minute looks
really nice as a great interface they
actually have access to download
exclusive HTC applications which you can
see right here so you got sound
announcer stocks photo to answer and
there's some more and when you go into
the
good place here you actually get a
separate almost app category for your
particular manufacturer device I'm go
ahead open up the market place here and
you'll notice that there is a separate
category for HTC if you're using a
Samsung device it'll say Samsung there
so go ahead and jump on into apps and
you will see that which is kind of neat
lets you get through the custom
experience that you want from your phone
that you don't really expect to get so
you get sort of a different way to get
your application this you've got the
application store and you go ahead and
download these sort of HTC applications
that won't show up on other devices and
that would be most particularly the HTC
weather application and such now I'm
sure would be ways around that but for
the most part that's the best way to get
on here sort of have the manufacturer
put out these applications so you can
sort of download all these and they work
very well they're sort of nice you can
get some more photo enhancement features
sound enhancer I'm not going to go
through the nuances of each application
for the interest of time but suffice to
say do work well and you sort of control
the customization of your device which I
really like I'm going to keep this sort
of not a review of Windows Phone 7 I did
certain overview and a review of that
but sort of a summation is I really like
the operating system I think it's got a
lot of potential in the marketplace it's
certainly new and it is sort of striving
to find its own but I think by time we
get to version 2 and 3 it's really going
to be a competitor the browser works
well the internet speed is very quick
pinch-to-zoom works fantastically I've
served demonstrated all that in previous
videos I will say as a whole package the
HTC surround is a great phone the screen
looks bright and vibrant however if
you're sort of looking at it in the
cache of other 18t devices you look at
the super-mo left screen of say the
Samsung Focus you can really see a
difference here with the quality even
though the resolution is going to be the
same so the screen quality isn't
necessarily going to blow you away
with the way it looks but it is very
passable and it has a nice resolution
compared to other mobile phones it's a
bit on the thicker side let's do a quick
size comparison here here we've got an
iPhone 4 screen and just a little bit
bigger here on the HTC surround a three
point eight inches but to go ahead and
stack them you can see there's quite a
big thickness difference answer the size
device as you expect
full slide-out QWERTY keyboard words
instead you just have that surround
sound speaker out of much rather had a
thinner device at a standard speaker or
the same size with the full QWERTY
keyboard take a look at it next to the
little bit larger here samsung focus it
has a 4 inch screen I can see the
thickness and thinness here is really
tremendous so it's a larger device and
again it certainly weighs a little bit
more so you're definitely going to feel
this guy in your pocket however if
you're looking for an HTC made Windows
Phone device on a teen teen it's going
to be a very solid choice on a one to
five I really give it a very solid
three-and-a-half would have earned much
higher stars if that Dolby Surround if
you really was one of its flagship
features I had worked just a little bit
better and devices maybe just a tad a
bit lighter
I'd really like to sort of feel my
device I know it's got some strings to
it but this guy is almost downright
heavy if you're looking for a Windows
Phone 7 device on AT&amp;amp;T you may want to
look at the Samsung focus of the review
of this guy coming but the sneak preview
of that is it's a fantastic phone and
you guys many questions almost pure -
leave them down below I am John wreckage
or some techno buff so be sure to check
out the website for all your Windows
Phone 7 news I will see you in the next
video
