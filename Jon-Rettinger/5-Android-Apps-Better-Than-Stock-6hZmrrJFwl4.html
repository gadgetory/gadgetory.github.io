five replacements for stock apps on iOS
and we asked if you want to see this new
one for Android and the answer was
resounding yes so I've got for you five
stock app replacements they are not
going to get on any om device so these
won't come on a Samsung won't come on
Nexus device or LG these are all
straight third-party applications
personally I prefer the stock Google
applications but if you guys want to get
something that's not going to come on
your phone here five really good choices
number one is an app that was
recommended to me about a year and a
half ago by our own producer Ralph
Lorena's and it is cloud magic for email
I absolutely love it for a few reasons
first I'm changing phones all the time
so it gives me a username and a password
when I log in no matter what when I'm on
it's going to import all of my settings
and all of my email on I have to go and
set it up from scratch it's fast it's
got sender profiles there's a ton of
third-party integrations there desktop
applications for me on Android Cloud
magic is my absolute go to mail app
looking for a fast easy to use eloquent
customisable email app check out cloud
magic next for an SMS replacement chomp
SMS this is an oldie but a goodie it's
been kicking around I believe since the
Eclair days it's gotten a little bit
bloated but it's still one of my go-to
for SMS for a few reasons first I can
block people right inside the SMS app if
I'm using a press device and someone
else had it before and I get just
spammed with messages it's nice to have
I also like the customization options
you can change the colors you can change
the themes that make it look the way you
want there are a lot of other options
out there but maybe chomp just rings of
nostalgia to simpler Android days but I
love it and I still use it for reminders
is doulas replacement my go-to is any.do
if you switch devices a lot or maybe
you're not on your phone all the time
you're gonna really like the seamless
cloud sync it'll sync between your
mobile desktop or tablet so it doesn't
matter what device you're using you can
drag and drop it's got integrated speech
recognition built in you can share with
absolutely anyone and it was designed
for mobile so it's gonna work great on
your phone instead of just being
designed for a tablet they got a shrink
down the UI is intuitive and it just
works well it's my go-to for reminders
next for a calendar replacement the
appropriately named Cal calendar first
there's a ton of third-party integration
here especially for any
do it's gonna integrate with your
exchange can integrate with Google any
of your third-party options it's going
to work seamlessly with there are a ton
of widgets which I really appreciate you
can customize and find the right one
that's going to suit you the killer
feature for me those predictions it's
going to know what you're typing what
kind of event it is it's going to
suggest people you might want to invite
to this event so there's a long-lost
friend message in a while
Cal calendar is gonna remind and last
but definitely not least you know it you
love it
chances are installed on your phone Nova
Launcher I could probably spend ten
minutes running through all the features
that are in ANOVA but here are some of
the highlights things like custom grid
infinite scroll gesture support Billy
the hide apps scrolling effects my
favorite backup and restore if you
change phones quite a bit a heads up
though some features are going to
require Nova prime so you guys think
about our top five stock app
replacements I want to pick five they're
not gonna find pre-installed on any
major OEMs one we missed when you love
leave in the comments down below in
front of download and the apps that I
mentioned or put a link to it down in
the description box so next time I am
John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo that's
you guys next video now that you know
five apps Acree place any stock app on
your phone let me tell you a little bit
our friends from Atlassian it's a great
collaboration software that you work
with teams communicate from anywhere
around the world you can assign and
track and manage tasks for any project
no matter how complex
that's the clarity of JIRA you can
create and share content organize
results and bring team members up to
speed with confluence they offer an
incredible amount of collaboration
software things like HipChat and
bitbucket check them out at Atlassian
