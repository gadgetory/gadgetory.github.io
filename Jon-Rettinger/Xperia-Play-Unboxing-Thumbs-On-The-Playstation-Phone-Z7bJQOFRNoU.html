TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the Xperia Play the first PlayStation
Certified phone let's go ahead and see
if it lives up to the name so the Xperia
Play is an Android powered phone with an
emphasis on gaming quite obviously
because it's PlayStation Certified this
is going to be an unboxing and a very
short thumbs on this is set to us from
the folks at clove Co UK and it's
available now you can get a version with
18 t3g bands or north american 3g bands
and there's a version with some european
3g bands as well be sure to check to
find out which one is going to be best
for you let's go ahead and unbox this
guy I have actually not seen one of
these in person yet so here's the front
of the box there's the device and
there's pictures of the device going
over some specs but of course we're
gonna cover those every time I think of
this phone I think of that creepy
Android commercial let's Sonya ran where
they took off the Android guys thumbs
and put on human thumbs super creepy
alright so here is the Xperia Play on
first blush it looks like a pretty
standard Android phone feels very light
I'm guessing the battery's not in there
the main attraction when you slide that
up to spring-loaded you've got a lot of
business but we're gonna get there let's
see what else we got in the box go ahead
and lift this up hopefully there's a
battery in here ah and there is a
battery which is important because we're
going to want to power this sucker on
the battery is of size 1500 milliamp
hours it's seems to be pretty standard
now and I'm guessing we're gonna have
the usual array of other stuff so here
is the charger you're gonna probably
want to pick up a different charger if
you're in the u.s. it's got a USB port
there and you've got a micro USB to USB
charging cable and we've got another
micro USB to USB charging cable if
there's a longer one in a short one
that seems weird or maybe this is a mini
HDMI cord listen check out what this guy
is thing nope that's mini USB same with
this one weird so we get two cords of
varying lengths and then you've got an
adapter if you want to charge this guy
in your car and get your gay men on
while you're driving but enough of the
accessories that's not why you're here
here is the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play so
let me run through some facts on this
gaming guy the box out of there first
actually let me peel off the sticker so
I know you guys know it's there and I
know you hate stickers all right so
here's what we have we've got a four
inch TFT display with a resolution of
480 by 854 this is ready scorpion arm
chip with a clock speed of one gig er
sub gigahertz supposedly relatively
quick 512 megabytes of RAM and ROM it's
got an Adreno GPU graphics processor of
course you want to get some extra
processing power for those games you're
gonna be playing it's got a 5 megapixel
camera on the back with autofocus and
LED flash there is the autofocus in LED
flash and I can shoot video in 1280 by
720 or 720p this is a gingerbread device
so Android 2.3 is onboard it's only has
400 megabytes of built-in storage but
expandable to 32 with an expansion card
slot you're gonna get supposedly 6.41
hours of talktime on 3G and 413 hours of
standby time uh not the lightest foot on
the work plug-in about 175 grams alright
so I am going to plop in the battery
let's go ahead and see what this guy
looks like alright so we got this
plastic back taken off to a little bit
of prying we're gonna go and pop in the
battery my guy came with a 16 gig card
in there go ahead and plunk that in
close it up and I will power this guy on
let's see what kind of games we can
expect I'll give you a tour of the
device while we're getting our boot up
this is not released in on any US
carrier though over
Rhymes and have said they will be
carrying it at some point all right so
it's going to be powering on hopefully
if it's got a charge in it which is
always questionable let's see
I felt a vibrate there we go sony
ericsson so we are looking at four
physical buttons across the bottom I
kind of like the trend of having
physical buttons other than capacitive
typical Android buttons you don't have
any time scape or Mediascape buttons
here that we've seen on previous Sony
Ericsson Android phones there's a back
button home button menu button and
search button but I probably didn't have
to tell you that chances are you knew
we've got on the left hand side 3.5
millimeter headset jack and that micro
USB charging cable port which you can
use there two cables with on the back it
is that soft plastic the battery sits
relatively flushed to the back so it
doesn't have that hollow feeling you get
with a lot of plastic actually feels
very high-quality
you've got the Sony Ericsson logo the
camera the flash and if we go ahead and
look at the right hand side it's a
little bit of interesting stuff here so
there is the volume rocker and we have
shoulder buttons what you're kind of
neat I don't have to have any effect in
the operating system itself but they're
certainly going to be useful when you
slide this guy up
you can access those shoulder buttons
with your thumbs in the back we've got
full PlayStation s controls so we've got
your what considered a pad expose up
down left right we've got some touch
sensitive controls here for your gaming
action and your typical
four button PlayStation controllers the
triangle the circle the X and the square
which proves that I do indeed know my
shapes I also got some Android controls
as well and got the Menu button then
you've got a select and start key and it
looks like that's going to be it for the
buttons there is a sliding mechanism you
can see what that looks this looks like
I will say it's a bit top-heavy
I guess that's expected so when I'm
holding it just a little bit of weight
that feels like it's kind of gonna drop
down uh interesing alright so let me go
ahead and
on lock this guy and I took a quick look
at the operating system and figure some
noise in the background as I'm filming I
apologize there's constructions and
going on all day and I didn't want to
wait to get this video up I don't know
when they're gonna stop so English us go
ahead and hit next you only have to do
this setup I presumably once I don't
have a SIM card in their attitudes gonna
let me into the operating system and it
looks like it will and we've got search
Sony Ericsson's custom interface here
time to keep a media scape or gone we
just have now skin let's go ahead and
look at the settings just to check out
that this is indeed some gingerbread
action so let's see if we go to the
bottom yep you do get that sort of white
color that shows up depends on what
carrier or what manufacturer what color
is that going to be let's go to about
bone it's always nice to see phones that
are shipping with Gingerbread so model
number two point three point two so boom
we got some gingerbread action but
mostly what I want to sear the games
gonna be in here how the controller's
going to work so we'll do this for the
first time let's take a look at what our
options are so here's what it's going to
ship with market PlayStation now or play
now got crash bandicoot and the
PlayStation pocket let's go ahead and
jump right into a crash bandicoot and
I'll do a future video on the
PlayStation pocket I just want to see
how these controls work and what the
graphics look like no content was found
on the SD card checked the SD card and
try the content again I got a download
it alright somebody cut just internet
I'll download it I'll come right back
alright so I've got the game downloaded
I've been difficulty connecting the
device to my Wi-Fi network took several
tries even though the password is
imported properly something to bear in
mind the game was just over 500
megabytes let's go ahead and open it up
and this can pretty much play
PlayStation 1 games crash bandicoot
continue I should get a Buddha prema go
ahead and open this up and let's see
what happens it's the first time
actually playing this game
looks like nothing happens there we go
unauthorized reproduction in any manner
Sony Entertainment Europe and I'll do a
full tour of PlayStation Store on here
and a whole device I just want to see
what a game looked like very quickly and
see how the gameplay was just on first
blush and this is very very very much
first impression thumbs on I've never
turned this on before so naughty dog dog
must have peed on the floor
there's the Naughty Dog it looks naughty
all right come on I want to get my crash
bandicoot on so there's what the graphic
looked like it's nothing unbelievable go
ahead and it start I'll level say the
speakers are really loud on this um I do
quality's pretty good it's not even sure
the speakers are it looks like the
grills are on both sides underneath
there so you can see if the game looks
like running around doing your crash
bandicoot thing ah the control pad feels
good there's not that much space between
the left and right and up and down so
you have to sort of move your fingers
very subtly to get that motion I can
imagine that could be difficult with
fighting games you got to do a lot of
combinations do a touch controls here
it's look like I don't take this game
kind of using them not much the buttons
do feel good the 4 Way buttons here the
triangle and the X and all that business
first flush very impressive not sure why
it's not taking up the full screen here
a little bit weird key and zoom that in
or make it bigger did you get the menu
you can get some controller settings
media volume screen mode so we can get
full screen going on there we go so now
let's go back and hit start back so that
looks much better
uh in full screen mode so fun you can
get your game on
just a real quick first demonstration of
crash bandicoot and the Xperia Play
there'll be a full review and all kinds
of fun stuff coming up I am John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo and you know
I'm gonna go get my game off
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
