while now but there are a fairly new
competitor in the whole laptop space in
the era of Ultra portables and larger
beefier workhorses it's hard to stand
out from those that have been doing this
for so long
but maybe the newcomer can bring some
real innovation and inspire a little
more competition in this very stale
market though not without taking some
cues from some of the best in the class
i'm rob rosenberger TechnoBuffalo and
i'm here to answer a very simple
question is the huawei mate book X Pro
an incredibly compelling laptop that's
worth your attention or just yet another
MacBook Pro ripoff first off if you have
not seen my review of the Dell XPS 13 I
did just a few weeks ago click that link
down below and check that video out it's
an ultra portable from dowel that is
very similar to the make book X Pro in a
lot of ways and we've gotten so many
requests to review this laptop and I
understand why on paper it's a no
compromise machine it's bringing the
features and specs the device that is
future-proof but also hangs on to a
little bit of the past for convenience
sake the main book X Pro comes in at
just under three pounds and it's made
out of an all aluminum material that
feels very premium it's built extremely
well though there's no getting around
the fact that this thing looks almost
like a carbon copy of a MacBook Pro but
what Apple's high-end laptop is missing
in some areas the mate book X Pro has
specifically when it comes to ports
there are two USB type-c ports on this
machine with one of them being
Thunderbolt 3 compatible and on the
other side yes that is a full size USB a
port to be honest in my two weeks of
testing I use the port only a handful of
times though I will say just knowing
that I had it there gave me a real peace
of mind and it saved me the frustration
of having to dig through my backpack to
find that type a to type C dongle
honestly I really appreciate this best
of both worlds approach and despite what
other manufacturers may say I don't
think it took away from the design or
added any unnecessary thickness another
thing I appreciate about the mate book X
Pro is that almost bezel is display the
computer has a 91% screen to body ratio
that gives you lots of room to navigate
around and take advantage of all that
screen resolution the display is not 4k
it comes in just under at a resolution
of 3000 by 2000 so it's more like 3k but
it gets very bright it's got excellent
color reproduction and it's also got a
touch screen which is super nice and
convenient for the times that you need
it movies games web browsing everything
looks really good on this display though
you will notice one thing is missing and
that's the webcam while we did something
special with the camera placement on the
mate book X Pro instead of putting it
under the screen or doing a notch design
up at the top the webcam lives built
into a dedicated key on the keyboard
simply press down on that key and the
camera pops up and it's ready to use
it's definitely something that I've
never seen done before and it's nice for
those conscious of their design and
especially in this day and age their
privacy but I just have to say it to the
angle flat out sucks and there's
absolutely no way to adjust it whoever
came lives in a mechanical switch you
can either have it open or closed
there's no in-between also if you are
going to use that webcam you're going to
need to sit way far back or okay a
considerable distance away to be in
decent view of that whopping one
megapixel camera sensor okay so I'm a
little bitter on that camera placement
but the rest of the keyboard is actually
fantastic like it's so good that I did
not want to stop typing on it
the keys are a chiclet style and they're
very comfortable to type on and it
reminds me of that old MacBook Pro style
keyboard which is a very good thing
there's a good amount of key travel and
the entire keyboard just feels very
spacious it's also spill proof but
luckily I haven't had to test that yet
the same story also goes to the trackpad
below it's very spacious it's really
smooth for navigating around the OS it's
got multi-touch support and it's also
significantly bigger than what you see
on other laptops of this size and after
using this thing for a while
I really came to appreciate that extra
trackpad space there's also a Windows
hello compatible fingerprint reader
built into the power button right above
the keyboard there's not much to say
about this it comes standard it works
really well and it's a convenient and
secure way to unlock and lock your
machine so for a laptop that's been such
a strong performer overall I have to say
I was pretty disappointed by the
built-in speakers
especially after how much huawei has
been hyping them up to the companies
credit they are technically dolby atmos
certified and they do get very loud but
after listening to them for quite a
while they honestly are comparable to
every other pair of laptop speakers I've
heard don't get me wrong they're
definitely good enough for listening to
music or watching YouTube videos but if
you really want to sit down and watch
something for an extended period of time
or really listen to music
do yourself a favor get a pair of good
headphones or a Bluetooth speaker it's
gonna be much better than the built-in
speakers when it comes to performance
the mate book X Pro can definitely hold
its own against others in this class it
has Intel's 8th gen processor inside and
our unit specifically is packed with an
i7
8550 you 16 gigs of ram and a 512
gigabyte nvme SSD you're getting an i7
though it is worth noting that it's
running at a slower clock speed of 1.8
gigahertz but honestly for a thin and
light laptop you're not going to get
desktop level power but if you keep your
expectations realistic you'll be really
happy with the performance you are able
to get out of the sink and it's an i7 so
it can handle multitasking really well
day-to-day usage like the standard sub
email web browsing watching videos it's
gonna run on this machine without any
issues it can also handle 4k video
editing in premiere at full quality
playback without dropping frames which
is nice and you can even do a little
gaming well sort of our review unit has
the dedicated GPU built in it's an
Nvidia MX 150 and it does not come close
to delivering the power of a desktop
level GPU but having 2 gigs of dedicated
video ram built into this laptop
especially a laptop of the size is
really nice don't expect any miracles
here but turn down your settings to
medium or low depending on the game and
you can actually get games running at a
very playable framerate I know many of
you are curious on the battery life on
the mate book X Pro and I'll just say
that I came in right at the middle of
the pack which is totally fine I got a
very respectable 7 to 8 hours of battery
life on average during my testing no
real need to stress about being near an
outlet but you won't be able to make it
a few days with
a charge during the two weeks I used it
I was able to make it through an average
day of work or a day of classes at
school just fine as long as I wasn't
doing anything super CPU intensive as a
complete package the mate book X Pro is
giving you a lot to consider you'll need
to get over the fact it looks like a
MacBook Pro because yeah it totally does
but once you do you can enjoy a
beautifully designed and a really
well-made machine it's a very compelling
package but there's a catch
pricing and availability is a little up
in the air right now while weigh says
this machine is coming to the US but we
don't know when we also don't know what
the exact pricing will be when it does
come from overseas the main book X Pro
is price over in Europe at 1500 euros
which is about equivalent to eighteen
hundred US dollars just so you know this
is in no way an insignificant amount of
money and you're getting an ultrabook
that definitely has some shortcomings
but as a second attempt from a newcomer
in this space I say give it some serious
thought in consideration it is by no
means the laptop for everybody but for
those looking for a midsize lightweight
laptop that has a little pep in its step
you'll be very happy so what do you guys
think of Huawei's latest laptop is the
camera placement on this thing
innovative and very interesting or is it
annoying and looking at you from the
worst possible and go leave a comment
down below and let us know we got a lot
of requests to review this lab to have
