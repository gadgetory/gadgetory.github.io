brought to you by Squarespace hello
dears John Q here from technobuffalo and
welcome to what's the apps now every now
and again i get a message i get a tweet
i get a youtube ding or whatever from
people asking me Oh what you come what
kind of gear view use how do you film
all these wonderful scenes for your
episodes and even in the last video
someone asked me if I can show you guys
behind the scenes of what goes on into
making one of these videos so put this
all-important very special episode of
what's the app so we're gonna be
checking out the behind-the-scenes of
how everything goes on to make one of
these videos I don't think that made
sense that's okay this is okay whats the
apps as you guys know is an application
review show hosted by myself and let me
go let me tell you guys I have long
exhausted my app library of applications
that i would like to share I I just
don't use that many abstinent on a
day-to-day basis on my phone I use my
phone to email text and to call people
that's it I'm grandpa like that so I
talked to John in the read-through folk
and they said hey you should ask the
audience and ask them to give you some
suggestions as to what to review later
okay like that double thumbs up just
like that could it happen just like that
the meeting happened just like that so
started doing this recently and the
feedback has been awesome minus a usual
Internet I hate you kind of negativity
going on and it benefits in two ways you
know there's a whole audience
interaction thing where it's like oh my
god I can't believe John read whatever I
said I've shivers and tingles running
down my spine we have that which is
great and you guys give me content to
work with which is awesome so thank you
and after playing with the app for a few
days I will wrap write down some notes
and because I new graphics design user
interface design and all that kind of
stuff on a day-to-day basis I can use
those principles to help me review the
application if it's you know if it's not
sleek if it's not pretty if it's not
easy to use if it's not intuitive than
in my opinion it's not a very good
application I don't care if you're
superstar Kanye West and you love this
application right here let's call it
okay let's call it the kanye west ave
let's pretend Kanye West has an appt
imma be does not and he loves his
application well I don't care that if
this is in this lyrical geniuses app
library if it's not intuitive and if
it's not you know easy to use it doesn't
count that's it not a good application
in my opinion at least in my opinion so
from those notes i formulate the script
which I eventually perform but I perform
on camera and in a previous episode I
actually mentioned that i write down all
my video note center and everything with
evernote in fact i use Evernote for
every single video project that I have
to work on helps me stay organized you
know this is where all the magic magic
happens this is where I decide okay for
this scene I'm gonna be here on camera
for the scene I'm gonna do the voiceover
for this scene i'm going to show me
holding the phone for the scene i'm
gonna show me tapping the screen and in
the menu pops up and i'm all happy and
everything and yeah everything is
decided here once that's done I go
downstairs AK my studio AK my basement
and I let you know start camera turn on
the lights make sure I got my microphone
all set up and I perform the script on
camera
I actually have a lot of fun doing the
voice over its believe it or not do you
know the scenes where I'm not actually
on camera because nowadays I started
integrating these unusual but quirky
kind of run-on sentence kind of things I
can't describe it LMT miss check right
here there we go this is a script from
the last episode and we have this little
ditty right here um this is actually
performed on camera oh my goodness I
remember this it took me like literally
40 to 50 takes to get this right it took
me about 12 minutes practicing this
thing no not practicing like trying to
say it on camera I practice way before
then as well ridiculous anyways I said
Wow personally I feel like organization
you know staying on top of your tasks
writing highlighting sending notes
setting reminders for due date study
dates meetings projects lab social
events gatherings heck even setting
reminders to wake you up for your six or
seven a.m. morning class all that stuff
is really really really important with
all of our fancy new gizmos and gadgets
organizational tools aka applications
are right at our fingertips boom like
that showing off right now looking into
distance not at the camera tryin to be
all suave and cool
after I'm done shooting everything or
come back upstairs to my office aka the
upstairs room I put everything together
I you edit everything together and bam
what you see behind me basically is the
rough edit no this is the the whole
episode and then its entirety minus the
b-roll shots with just me holding the
phone bill hey guys this menu pops up
and I'm like smiling and stuff like that
so yeah this is basically the footage of
me being on camera and the voiceovers I
just touched my screen Squarespace is he

final thoughts so I get some tips for
for the up-and-coming tech reviewers
experienced tech reviewers videographers
video bloggers and so on and so forth
the people who produce videos online um
I say follow the three P's three P's
okay i just made this up right now for
this video is rupees it's uh it's
patience practice and perseverance no
practices first practice patience
perseverance there we go practice
because all right I haven't I have spent
so many hours doing this online video
sub I've been doing this for one one one
or two years now made over 300 videos
online each video takes about no two
three four five six even seven plus
hours to make so that's a lot of time
man that's a lot of time for me to
practice and even nowadays with all that
experience I try to continuously learn
new things so for the next video I might
tweak this color to see to see if it
worked properly or do something with
this audio setting you know forcing
myself to learn I think that's really
important so yeah practice second p
forgot it it's patience patience okay
you have to be very patient when you do
these things especially if you can't get
whatever you want to say you what am I
trying to say this perfect example right
here especially if you can't say
whatever it is you want to say in front
of the camera sometimes I'm kind of not
stubborn but I'm a perfectionist okay I
want to say this specific line on camera
and no matter what I'm gonna say it so
I'll practice a bunch of time off-camera
and then one to turn the camera on out
to save the line and I'll keep doing it
until I get it right even and even after
50 takes if I don't get it right to take
a break and try it again okay I'll try
the line again and if i get if i finally
get the line right without me into
running out of breath or me making a
weird noise a cake or something I'm
biting my tongue and so forth because
I'm just silly like that um if I finally
get it right but I don't feel a hundred
percent with it
feel like I could have just said it
better I'll try again I don't know why
I'm stupid I waste too much time doing
this kind of stuff but i'll try again
and i'll try to get a few more times if
i can't get it then i had to settle for
it and if I just don't like it they're
not just skip it all together throw it
out throw it out so much for being
patient so yeah you got to be patient
when you when you do this stuff and last
one perseverance you when you're doing
this stuff with the internet you're
gonna get a lot of negative feedback I
don't know why the negative the internet
just this kind of encourages people to
be hate haters I hate not not not even
hitted few then created the internet
just makes people angry I don't know why
it's a good you make a video you suck
man the video sucks ate your face you're
my phone it's bigger than yours just
random stupid things like that don't let
them get you down all right you know
what you you know what you got to do you

what you can improve on and you know
what you love doing so make sure you
know all that stuff keep doing what you
love don't let it want to get you down
