TechnoBuffalo here and i want to give
you an overview of how the dell inspiron
14z handles youtube HD full screen
playback and how it handles hulu
playback watching mobile video on the go
is really important to me and I assume
it's important to you so let's go ahead
and jump right in and check out how
things look the first thing I'll notice
right here is at the screen background
who have gone a little bit jolted I did
a test just a minute ago of youtube HD
and when I came back to the home screen
the screen seems to be a little bit
strange and I wanted to leave this to
show you exactly how it was so just as a
quick refresher this is running a intel
core 2 duo ultra-low voltage it's the UL
300 clocking in at the one point three
gigahertz and this is an ultra low
voltage chip but it is still a full core
2 duo chip and this has 3 gigabytes of
RAM and it's running windows 7 64 bit
home premium let's go ahead and get
started and see how this stuff behaves
we'll go ahead and jump right into
YouTube got one of my videos right here
it's actually the unboxing of the
inspiron will play see how it plays into
standard 14z laptop this is arranged a
notebook that sorta slated above the
graphic it does look to be a new units
last night this one comes in so that did
play nice and smooth and I want to show
you the processor this takes up as well
I should also mention that i'm running a
screen recording program in the
background to record this called
Camtasia which does definitely take up
some resources so just having the
youtube video right here not playing but
pods mall ready at about forty eight
percent i'll go ahead and move this off
the sides we can watch how it changes as
we play the video read and does have a
DVD drive which is which turn the volume
down so i can talk over it jumps to
about eighty two percent which is
relatively high let's kick this over to
HD and see what happens
this ultra low voltage processors one
that's being found in a lot of more
modern ultra portable computers like the
dell adamo XPS and a few others so it's
playing nice and smoothie we're clearly
well the doesn't need to be Joel T
although the processor there is up at a
hundred percent if I wasn't running the
screen capture program I can tell you
that it drops down to just about 80 but
my cpu usage is quite high I'm as you
can see but this can clearly handle
running HD video and the handles is
actually quite well just don't plan on
having a lot of things running in the
background let's see how it handles full
screen its handling full screen very
well it's running smoothly there's a
little bit of choppiness but not bad and
I try this again without the screen
capture program and it did run very
smoothly and the processor speed just
around 85 to 90 so it does get very high
but it's not bad and I'm not running any
version of beta of Adobe Flash it's just
the most recent public already spilled
so let's go ahead and stop this and jump
on over to Hulu and see how it handles
it hulu is quite important to me it's i
watch most of my TV shows from hulu so i
would need a laptop that i can make sure
it can more than handle this so here's a
popular clip from Saturday Night Live
well go ahead and watch now
you can see right away the cpu usage
jumped up significantly and it seems to
be the less intensive than watch the
videos of normal commercial breaks it
seems to be less intensive then actually
watching youtube videos which is quite
interesting I'll turn the volume down
here but is playing and it's playing
very smooth let's go ahead and full
screen it and the full screen does
playback very smoothly so really the
more look here is that if you're looking
for going closes looking for your ultra
low voltage shift to be able to handle
HD playback in hulu playback it
absolutely will with very little
problems however don't expect to have
many processes running in the background
like I mentioned with Camtasia running
the back that really jumped up to a very
high hundred percent now I'm sure when
adobe flash goes updates to their newest
version which is currently in beta that
will drop down significantly but I
wanted to show you some real world tests
about what it looked like if you bought
it so anyway I hope you guys found this
useful and a little bit helpful and show
you what you can expect with the
inspiron 14z and other ultra low voltage
computers i'm jon rettinger and i'll see
you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
