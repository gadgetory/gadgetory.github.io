from technobuffalo no longer do we have
to wait the google i/o to get a sneak
peek at their next android OS codenamed
and google surprise a lot of folks and
dropped preview number one at today if
you want to check it out you need either
a 6p a 5x6 pixel see a nexus 9 Nexus
player or an Android one device called
the general mobile 4G there's a lot of
new improvements in expect a lot more as
new betas come out some are flags your
features like multitasking and your
notification panel others are very much
under the hood they're gonna help
improve battery life but there's a lot
of stuff that we can show you that does
look visually appealing the first one is
a huge feature that androids been
missing we stock Android for a while and
that is multi window support finally
side-by-side multitasking just hit that
multitasking button on the bottom right
drag the applications you want to use
you to the side at the top depending
what they're not using a tablet or a
phone and you're good to go to close it
just swipe it all the way down and it is
gone to apps side by side on stock
Android looks good another big new
feature of android and we now have a new
notification drop-down menu we saw this
in previous leaks and it is here the new
shade has a bundle notification that
spans the full width of the screen at
least on phones and quick toggle to the
top for notification shade including for
Wi-Fi cellular battery do not disturb
flashlight and a few more and a new edit
button lets users make changes without
have a new system UI tuner from Android
yay also new you cannot reply to
messages directly from a notification
shade please for some apps settings also
got a gigantic overhauls the top
announced he suggested settings maybe
you just got a new phone your have a
lock screen set it'll suggest that for
you maybe they think you want to change
your wallpaper because you haven't yet
it will suggest that for you as well you
scroll down in settings you'll see new
information for each setting so sound
for example tell you what your volumes
at battery is halo your batteries at and
so forth as you jump into any of those
settings you will see if the upper
left-hand corner new hamburger menu if
go ahead and select set a hamburger you
don't get access to all the settings
options that you'd get from the default
settings apps that is pretty handy as
well next one I know it's gonna make a
lot of people pretty happy night mode is
back Android m's original dev preview
hinted that it was going to be there but
by the time marshmallow shipped it was
gone with Android n it is here and way
more fleshed out than before all you
gotta do is enable system UI tuner just
hold down the little settings I've
button in the upper left and quarter
notification shade you'll see it there
get a ton of options and set the
settings to your heart's content another
huge update here is doze on Android and
we'll be able to save battery life you
when that screen is turned off instead
of only working when the phone has been
sleeping for longer periods of time it
means only high priority notifications
will show up whenever the screen is
turned off if you want no more maybe
want to do this for yourself hit the
link down below give you all the
information you need so what do you guys
think about Android and I know a lot of
you are still waiting for marshmallow
hit your phone's it looks like it's a
incremental improvements it offers a lot
of nice things that Android has been
missing certainly we'll see more as new
betas come out over the air over the
next few months as we build up to a full
release give the video a thumbs up but
was appreciate it until next time John
render from TechnoBuffalo talk to you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
