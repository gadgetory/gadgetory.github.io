TechnoBuffalo here with a MacBook Air
Smackdown Battle Royale on the left-hand
side we've got the outgoing MacBook Air
this is the 2010 refresh model the first
year that we got the tapered design it's
got a 1.6 you can hurt its Intel Core 2
Duo chipboard gigs a RAM and 128
gigabyte solid state drive and on the
right we've got the new hotness this is
the 11.6 MacBook Air with the core i7
processor it's got 4 gigs of RAM at 256
gigabytes to the solid state drive so
we're gonna bash these two head-to-head
not literally and see which one comes
out on top or comes out on top by how
much let's get started
okay so let me give a few caveats here
first this guy has not been upgraded to
Lion it is still running Snow Leopard
and has been used for about a year and
this guy of course is indeed running
lion I have not done any of these tests
yet so I'm actually kind of curious
myself I upgraded because I wanted
faster video encoding a faster video
exporting when I'm at trade shows or
events being able to export videos
quickly is extremely important so let's
go ahead and start with the most simple
of all tests and this is the simple boot
up and that's what has been used for
about a year so you know it's got a
whole bunch of files on it and all that
business so keep that in mind a very
unscientific test so I will go ahead and
hit the power button at exactly the same
time let's go ahead and see which one's
quicker and obviously these are both the
11.6 inch models so we see the screen on
the new one boot at first but we see the
Apple logo on the old one boot up first
this could also be I guess a lion vs.
Snow Leopard comparison and looks like
the old one booted up first and now I'm
being prompted to enter my password so
I'm going to go ahead and do that but we
saw things first on the older model
which is kind of interesting
all right password has been entered off
screen sending you guys got some sneaky
eyes let's go ahead and launch iMovie
will quit out of this quit Skype rack
all right so we got nothing open on
either computer I'm gonna go ahead and
launch iMovie and I'll launch both of
them at the same time or at least as
close as I can get and they should have
exactly the same file queued up in there
ready to go
so I'll go ahead and open that up
alright so they were both clicked and
surprisingly it opened up first on you
get thumbnails later open the first on
the old version of the MacBook Air so
that's kind of interesting so both of
these have the same video same length
same amount of time I'll queued up here
in each actually the one on the right
doesn't have the TechnoBuffalo intro so
we're gonna pull that out all the
settings are exactly the same so I go to
share
I'm gonna go ahead and export using
Quicktime I'll do the same thing here
share export using Quicktime all the
settings are exactly the same you can
sort of see that right there if you can
want to zoom in on your computer or to
take my word for it the settings are
exactly the same so we'll go ahead and
hit OK on each o it ok on this one and
we will hit export and see which one is
quicker I'm gonna save this to the
desktop I make things a lot easier it's
about a two minute and 34 second video I
couldn't show the importing of this clip
because I was importing with the camera
I will say that for about a two minute
30 second clip on the outgoing MacBook
Air the older model I took about six and
a half minutes on the new model about
three minutes were shaved off to about
Sarina half minutes alright let's go
ahead and could save and see what it
tells me for export times this is really
the big big test for me I never thought
the outgoing MacBook Air was slow at all
the only time I even noticed a little
bit of slowdown was with doing right I'm
right now video exporting so it's
telling me 32 minutes for exporting the
project here hopefully you guys can can
see that 32 minute countdown on the old
model and on the new model it's telling
me ten minutes so look looking like we
are just about three times as fast which
is extremely a helpful and hopefully to
make things even faster this is going to
be a subject of another video I've got
one of these guys this moron this will
be coming soon that should speed up the
process even more you can already see
the status bar moving much quicker on
the outgoing model and the new one and
for me personally that's what matters
most is that saving of twenty minutes
when you're at a show and or event
you're trying to export you know two or
three videos at a time being able to
save twenty forty you know 60 minutes is
huge especially when they need you out
of the event area very quickly or trying
to get something upload as quickly as
possible that can be just a giant
benefit so this might be a leopard vs.
snow leopard comparison I movies are the
same but this is a huge huge benefit for
me this is what I really wanted to show
on this comparison hopefully you guys
enjoyed I am John retinue from
TechnoBuffalo and for all your MacBook
Air coverage
sure to stick around to TechnoBuffalo
calm and it something that you want to
see between either these two laptops or
just a new it in particular let me know
I will see you guys in the next video
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
