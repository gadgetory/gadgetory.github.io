look here it's currently two thirty in
the morning pacific time the apple store
went online with iphone 4 pre-orders at
one o'clock so it's been exactly an hour
and a half and i'm still unable to get
in that no I've been not the only one
for talking people on Twitter and
they've been post that the apple store
is just not working on getting just a
myriad of errors something to show you
what's happening when you go on and try
and order again this may be fixed by the
time you watch the video at least for
right now it's not so go ahead and
select a 32 gigabyte white is currently
not available for pre-order or in-store
pickup sometimes it hangs right here
sometimes you get through takes a little
bit of time by just hitting pre-order
sometimes you have to keep clicking it
and clicking it to make it work I will
see if we can actually get something to
happen here and this is just
representative what's been going on for
the past hour and a half it's
unbelievable I know what i pre-ordered
the 3gs it was about a four minute deal
and that was it and i pre-ordered right
when they came online so this is still
not working try and keep flipping it
again to keep saying waiting for by
iPhone Apple gonna calm down there in
the corner and here we go finally got in
so replace the phone on your contract
will go ahead and do that and it's
really where the fun and the air is
started to happen if you're lucky to get
this park it's going to ask me now for
my personal information assuming you can
even get that far for a company like
Apple to have these issues is certainly
expected for a short period of time but
for an hour and a half these should have
been fixed after the first ten minutes
there you go session expired this is one
of the many errors that I've been
getting try out one more time looks like
they just get a spinning beachball it's
always fun thing as well so that happen
much faster I'm divided putting my
personal information of course you'll
have to block it out them let's see if
on camera the website feels the stress
and lets me in so sometimes we'll hang
here for good
it's three minutes and not go anywhere
sometimes it will actually go to the
next screen it's really anybody's guess
as to what this is going to do so I'll
leave it here for a few minutes and see
what happens and I'll leave it in real
time as you can see what I'm dealing
with
so sometimes we get this far so we're if
you act on pricing I'm go ahead and pick
it fast sometimes it'll say your
sessions expired sometimes it'll start
doing that spitting thing again still
waiting odds are it's been telling my
session is expired leaving down here it
says waiting for for apple and down here
this bar spinning although maybe we'll
get lucky and it'll respond well to the
pressure of being filmed still waiting
this is not looking promising you can't
see I could get my upgrade feet wage
which is nice efectos reset so that is
again one of the many problems and I
click it again it session has expired
this is just some of the numerous
problems that people are having
pre-ordering I hope you guys are having
better luck than I am I'll keep you
posted as to what happens if you have
any same experience let me know if you
get successful let me know as well jon
rettinger TechnoBuffalo I'll see you the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
