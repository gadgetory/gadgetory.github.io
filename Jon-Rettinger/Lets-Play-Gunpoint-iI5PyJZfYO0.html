episode of let's play this is joey
davidson the senior gaming editor at
technobuffalo calm and i'm here today
playing a new game called gunpoint some
point just released for the pc platform
on steam and i believe on the game's
official website for an early june i
think it was june third this game was
developed by tom francis he's an indie
developer who actually was a writer for
pc gamer and worked on this game in his
free time he used the really accessible
game maker creation software I don't
think he had any experience leading up
to this release gosh I'm just dying fast
in gunpoint is a believe it's called a
stealth based puzzle platformer that
means that it has the the 2d stealth
elements of something like maybe mark of
the ninja but then there's also some
cool platforming elements and it's a
one-shot kill system so as you just saw
a bit ago I think a security guard
caught me in his line of sight and boom
I was dead this is an espionage film
noir detective type game and basically
without giving away any of the story
stuff which it actually hasn't gotten
too intense where I am you're just sent
on several missions in order to sneak
into facilities and hack terminals or
steal data or eavesdrop on conversations
in order to be successful what makes
gunpoint really really cool and you're
kind of seeing a little bit of that now
is that each level is essentially just a
real big stealth puzzle that the the
level that I play after this I picked
two different slices of gameplay for
this let's play I picked an early level
from maybe like 10 15 minutes into the
game and then a level about an hour and
I'm still very early on so I'm making
tons of terrible mistakes but I wanted
to give you guys kind of a slice of two
different I guess one simplistic and one
not so simplistic level gives you an
idea of what kind of puzzling this game
packs with us god that guy is dead so
yeah you have to play with the
environment and kind of learn how to
navigate the space and then you'll use
these these wires and rewiring the
circuits in order to trick the guards
hurt the guards disarm them or open
doors and get into new rooms and that's
what makes gunpoint so fun and so
entertaining and I'm like I said really
early into this game and it's already
one of my favorites from this year so
far I'm going to let the rest of this
level play out I want you guys to spay
pay special attention to the music
itself I'm kind of a fan of that like
film noir detective e jazz and that this
soundtrack for this game is perfect when
it comes to that so listen in and I will
be back on the other side
all right now on to the second level of
this game play clip again it's a little
bit later in the game but not so far
that it's going to be a really intense
and complicated level but I wanted to
show you one that has more dynamic
wiring situations that kind of layers
the puzzling nature of gunpoint so
you'll see when i switch back to that
almost like darkened scope you'll see
that there's multiple colors that i have
to contend with or the wiring there's
red which is on this ground floor then
there's gold which is going to be on the
second floor and then blew in order to
control the wiring systems that use the
gold and blue wires I need to actually
hack those boxes so you see them there
on the Left there's gold on the second
blue on the third and there's also
wiring that's darkened out right now
that I don't have access to because I
haven't hacked those terminals so that's
one of the more challenging elements of
gunpoint when you start a level you
don't have the ability to control
everything in the space that would
almost be too powerful so you have to
figure out how to distract the guards
and get into the areas where there's
more susceptible wiring facilities and
so that you can move on and kind of
explore the space my goal there's an
optional objective the room directly
above me what you see there my goal is
all the way in the top left corner so I
don't he's gonna have to try and read
this it's just some side stories stuff
and I'll just we want to read it when
we're done but basically the game kind
of works in such a way where you notice
that I jumped through those that glass
pane and it alerted the guard to my
presence right so I killed this one
guard and now the new guard is up there
in the room
that I was kind of hanging out in he's
just gonna stay right there that means
that I'll be able to get to the gold box
that i mentioned before i also have an
upgrade if you're wondering like 01 you
notice that second glass shatter there's
an upgrade that you can buy where you
can jump through glass without causing
any noise but you have to click like as
your in-flight to the glass so it's a
little bit difficult to use but it's
really useful okay so now you're
starting to see that I need to I'm gonna
have to gain access to all three wire
plates in order to get to my objective
right so that means that I'll have to
basically pulse on my way through every
single room in this building and what I
understand about gunpoint in the way it
was developed and this is something that
was discussed very early on its
development is its kind of open-ended
you can approach it from any way that
you like so while I might be solving
this puzzle one way maybe some of your
scratching your heads wondering why I'm
doing it this way like why am I not just
taking the elevator I'm wondering that
okay ah terrible I just walked the
motion detector and go up the elevator
much simpler than trying to spring my
way through some glass play I said the
game's meant to be played really in any
way and you're rewarded for taking
better more precautionary measures if
you want to go ghost you're going to get
a much higher rating on a level than you
would running through killing everybody
and making tons of noise being a ghost
player is actually really really
rewarding and it's one of the things
that sets gun point apart from other
shelters where rewards might be
experienced or whatever else gunpoint
actually rewards you just by being fun
when it's played in a really really
stealth and ghosty way I can appreciate
that
like I said earlier I'm very early on
into this game and it's already one of
my favorites from the year I'm enjoying
the crap out of it it's only ten bucks
apparently the developer is going to
push for a mac and linux release down
the line or at least that's in the cards
but right now it's just on PC I hope he
gets it out on other platforms it's
really a cool game and I I don't say
this often but it might even do okay for
a touch-based experience I could totally
see rewiring these spaces with up on a
tablet or whatever else so alright as
I'm nearing the objective I'm actually
going to wrap up here like I said ten
bucks on steam or their official website
which you can find linked below either
in the article or the youtube
description i've been joey davidson i'm
still Joey Davidson after I leave but
whatever I was cheesy I'm terrible sorry
thank you guys for watching let's play
and I'll be back soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
