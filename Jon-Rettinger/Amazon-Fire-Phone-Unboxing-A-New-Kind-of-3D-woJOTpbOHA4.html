TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
Amazon's first foray into smartphones
this is the fire phone let's go ahead
dig it and see if it's gonna set the
smartphone world ablaze so here is the
box for the fire phone looking quite
diminutive I've got the 32 gig version
so some big things here about the phone
of course Firefly out the sort of little
light show and it'll pick anything that
you can find almost new to the option to
buy it from Amazon of course dynamic
perspective uses four cameras one in
each corner sort of make it look like
the phone screen is moving in the images
on it or moving it supposedly kind of
cool for looking at pictures your maps
but let's go ahead and slide this right
out of the box you've got the Amazon
logo embossed on top well go ahead and
cut that piece of tape and see what
secrets lie inside boom that was my
dramatic tape cutting I'm really excited
to take a look at this device I love the
Kindles and hopefully this will keep
that awesome trend going so here is the
fire phone sitting right in the box a
little thicker than I thought it was
going to be pushed off the side for a
quick second getting to know your fire
phone that in a different language I
believe that was Spanish what other
accessories were going to have they are
a very exciting charge and seeking cable
it is micro USB it's a pretty standard
there accessory wise we are going to
have
of a wall work last but definitely not
least we've got a pair of headphones you
guys always say I never take a look at
the headphones go ahead and do that real
quickly these are supposedly have all
kinds of crazy non tangley things to
them haha
they did not tangle at all this little
bit of magnetism in them so you can keep
them together to make sure you don't
lose them and they do stick together so
there are those headphones inline mic
built-in with volume control but that is
all fine and good but that is not the
reason you were here the reason is to
check out this guy in it's crazy dynamic
perspective let's go ahead and peel off
all the plastic here well the back feels
and looks very similar to the Nexus 4
through that glass type back to in the
phone looks like a typical Android phone
it's got a bit of a longer profile and
you can certainly see those four cameras
it looks it looks unique alright so go
and power this sucker on I should
mention this is also going to come with
a year of prime while it's powering on
I'll do a quick hardware tour and then
I'll walk you through everything that
the phone has on the left hand side
you've got a volume rocker up and down I
believe that is a dedicated camera can
also be used for a Firefly button the
power and lock button lives on top you
got speakers 3.5 millimeter headset jack
nothing on the right-hand side there's
your charge and sync port and then dual
speakers on the back and there you've
got your camera at a 13 megapixel camera
on the front addition to the four
cameras on the side I've got a 2.1
megapixel shooter up front from respect
looking at a 4.7 inch screen here at the
1280 by 720 screen you can do a quick
math that's a 312 PPI in case you're
wondering it's an IPS LCD display it's
running a fourth version of Android but
fire OS 3 point 5.0 it launched and
pretty beastly processor with a 2.2
gigahertz Snapdragon 800 which means
it's got quad core 2 gigs of ram are
inside of here
no external storage but they can get in
32 or 64 802 11 ABG ññ bluetooth 3.0 and
a 4.0 here in the battery is a
non-removable 2400 milliamp hours and it
does have NFC here as well
it'll be shipping to folks who ordered
or want to preorder on July 25th gonna
cost you anywhere from 0 to $650
depending on
get a contract or buy a totally contract
free again this is meant for AT&amp;amp;T let me
go and go through the whole setup
process we'll come right back in just a
minute we've got the phone all booted up
here and it looks nothing like the
Android OS it's based on it's a totally
forked versions got its own App Store
and really is hardly even recognizable
as Android you've got your home screen
here you can swipe through and you can
see all the different apps that you've
got an access ur of different options
for each of them so here's some games
you can see puzzles and all kinds of
other stuff here if you go to Amazon
video you can see what's available right
there or jump right into the application
there we go you can see it's broken up
into apps web game video music books and
the rest that stuff right there if you
go into apps you think you're gonna view
your app - or actually you get is the
app store if you swipe again from the
side you can go ahead and view my app
and see what's going to come installed
and again all the stuff that you would
expect is going to be here of course
you've got the Kindle Amazon music shop
Amazon's featured very prominently in
Firefly and I promise we will talk about
in a few moments so go ahead and hit the
physical home button down here and go
back you swipe from the other side
that's where you get sort of widgets and
quick notifications will show up right
there as well and if you swipe down from
the top you get sort of an Android ask
way to quick view settings and jump into
brightness and that kind of stuff and
also access Mayday
which this has and supposedly they say
they can connect within about 15 to 20
seconds so really fast as I move this
phone you might notice some things are
happening the icons are kind of moving
look at the top right there you don't
know if we have a SIM card no don't no
time it is we can move the phone a
little bit it shows up which is crazy to
see but the best way I can show dynamic
perspective I think is to jump in to
maps let's go ahead and pick I think I
picked San Francisco here you can see
this is sort of moving as I move the
phone I mean it's crazy to see and I
know it's gonna do justice on camera but
as I move the phone even as I move my
head it is moving on screen it's crazy
to see as you move along you know it
just keeps happening you can serve a
look almost like you'd see as a street
if you were walking if you tilt the
phone or you want to see a bird's-eye
view it's really kind of crazy to
actually see here it's really the big
selling point of the phone so it's gonna
take some getting used to I think but a
well she doesn't take away from the
experience it kind of adds to it I know
3d was a big gimmicky stereoscopic 3d
especially this doesn't do 3d 3d kind of
comes out at you this sort of goes into
the device and that makes sense and I
think it works really well at least on
first blush obviously I use a phone for
a while and see if your that comes to
fruition or not so the other big feature
I mentioned is Firefly let me go ahead
and show you what that can do so get it
will jump on over will go into my app so
I'll launch Firefly I can also launch it
with the button on the side and what
that's gonna do it's gonna sort do a
kind of a cool glitter effect and elect
you purchase all kinds of things so
we'll go ahead and click on Firefly I'll
bring in something I hope it'll
recognize here like the fire box I'll go
ahead and hit OK it starts to do a
little a little bit of glittery there on
the phone you guys can't see it I'm
trying it that and already recognize the
fire phone right there and going jump
right into Amazon and buy it let's bring
in some other stuff just out of
curiosity let's bring in some an old
classic for example here we got mario
kart 64 and it found it and it found it
really fast so firefly is really another
way to get Amazon to sell you things and
it works very quickly indefinitely as
advertised this has been a real quick
first look here at the Amazon fire phone
of course I'll run through everything
the full review we'll do some hands-on
with everything else but a very nicely
packaged device it's really amazon's
first foray into the smartphone world
