parallels desktop software for mac it
lets you run windows XP vista windows
millennium linux in your mac environment
without restarting it's very handy I've
received a lot of questions on it so
hopefully this video will help to answer
some of those as always thanks for
watching any questions about parallels
and then my way and thank you for
subscribing enjoy this is the box that
it came in parallels desktop the newest
version is version 3 point out which is
not what came in here but as soon as I
installed this program parallels told me
there's a newer version available I was
able to upgrade to the new version of
parallels through point O with 3d
support for all your 3d rendering so
let's get to it it's already been
installed right down here is the
parallel like on my dock click it it
will open up I have two versions of
Windows XP I've original on a backup I
may too just in case something should
happen to the original should get
corrupt download a virus or some sort
all the files are self contained within
each folder so i can just restore it
directly to sign back up and reboot so
let's push play it's a lot i gave it one
megabyte of ram out of my my two I gave
it 12 gigabytes of harddrive space
and scratch that make that one gigabyte
of ram not one megabyte which
everybody's going to be commented on
that all right loads up just like
regular windows XP press ended up so you
can hear it it made the little windows
XP sound alright so here you go here is
your regular windows computer start drag
just like anything a couple things to
show you you can make it fullscreen very
simply by hitting all enter rotates in a
pool cube flashes comes back here URL at
at full sprint if you see it's moving
very quickly moves just as quickly as
any other windows XP based laptop quick
here on my computer can right-click
properties you can see things are
looking pretty quickly the one things i
have installed on here our microsoft
office and firefox i will show you both
there's firefox load up just like any
other version of firefox if i wanted to
download a program for example want to
download AOL instant messenger it's very
simple to do at the wrong address
I can download it just like any other
windows computer and install apps like
any other windows computer it's already
been installed drive been downloaded
that's how quick it is there's the
install file I'm not going to solve it
because I don't want it on here all the
same windows pop up like normal just
like any other computer curious about
how fast Microsoft Office is i will show
you microsoft office i'll open up word
it's quicker than my old laptop the
district place there's no delight
between typing and it's showing up on
the screen I'm actually going to save
this to say this word document to show
you later we'll save the desktop and
it's here go down here I'm going to go
back to half screen and show you some of
the features of parallel desktop
three-point up if you look over here
you'll see a whole list of features um
first question that I got with people
when i told them i was using parallels
or about USB devices you can use any USB
device you can use on your mac go over
to USB devices tenth USB external hard
drive built-in isight wireless infrared
everything works you just click on it
and it's there very very very simple
your cd-rom drive will work if you have
a external floppy for whatever reason it
will work to parallelize comes with the
excellent option called coherence mode
puts you run both operating systems side
by side right over here and notice this
little icon says coherence you click on
it it actually puts the Start menu right
down at the bottom now you can move that
anywhere you want to make it easier for
you let's put up at the top what that
lets you do now is I can open up any
windows program and have it show up in
my map doc so again let's open up
Microsoft Office and let's open up
PowerPoint so there's power point to
notice right down here in the dock there
is a PowerPoint icon
standard windows icon with the parallels
icon below it very cool as you run both
in the same environment finally very
handy I'm again that's right now and
show you something else go to view I
want to go to OS window and I'll revert
back start menu still up top for it move
it and drag it back to normal another
neat feature about this is it lets you
share documents across operating systems
so this word document that we just
created let's say I want to open that up
in the mac environment using new office
which I have very easy to do i take the
document and I just drag it over to my
mac desktop and there does i can open it
up they'll open up with text edit i can
open up with neooffice got any trouble
and it also works actually both ways so
here afterwards both ways and that's
true for video files as well down here I
have some quicktime videos that I've
maiden posted I can drag it right over
to my Windows environment there shows up
as a quicktime file i'll push play and a
load just so quickly that does on most
pcs police on my pc there it is the play
it's not choppy or anything terms of
volume we're subscribing and for all the
comments i'm trying to get well it looks
good we just like anywhere please be
patient close it out let me also show
you guys some of the streaming video
that you can do just like any other
windows environment make it full screen
for their i'm on CNN com i can click on
video there's a happy video on here
doesn't appear to be anything it's not
depressing so let's just click on one
video pops up just as quickly
check the buffer up
and there goes
and there's windows media player right
quick so guys there is parallels kind of
a glance it's quick it's much faster
than my old HP laptop that I used to run
before the Mac it's a really a great
option if you don't plan on playing 3d
intensive games everyone's going to be
saying why don't you run games on here I
don't have games for the computer yet
but they're plenty of videos out there
that show that anyway guys give any
questions about parallels drop me a line
and thank you all for watching and if
you have any questions about anything
else send me a comment and please
subscribe thank you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
