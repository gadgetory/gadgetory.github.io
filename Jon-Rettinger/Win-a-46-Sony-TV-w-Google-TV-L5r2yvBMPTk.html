technobuffalo here I've been racking my
brain trying to think of a creative way
to tell you that you could win one of
146 inch sony tvs with google TV built
in what i was going to do was do some
cool side profile shot like this have
the phone to my ear have a ring hmm
thick hey YouTube what's going on chance
to win 300 TVs my audience would love
that if it's one thing my audience loves
it's ready first in the comments and
writing new and talking about the xbox
versus the ps3 but everybody loves
winning free stuff so I'll tell them but
then I I DSP and I saw what you guys
were going to say in the comments and I
thought no that's not going to work the
direct approach the best way so you can
win one of 100 Google TVs 46 inch from
Sony pretty sweet contest is going to
run until december twenty seconds of
starting today which is december 13th
all you gotta do is make a video
response saying why you are excited to
watch youtube on a google TV now you're
not required remind i suggest it's a
great platform for watching tech content
all your tech reviewers that open and
unbox tough i asked my wife why she'd
like to watch youtube on google TV and
her answer was puppy videos we're
thinking about getting a puppy when
thinking about this for about two months
and she watches every single copy video
on youtube and that's not an
exaggeration if you type in puppy video
on youtube you will see millions and she
has watched pretty much everyone which
means i've seen pretty much everyone so
many times I'm coming into work didn't
show walk in with her laptop saying look
at this Cavalier King Charles and six
weeks old next stage would come in and
say look at this plugin for weeks old
I'm sick of puppy videos so moping that
we just get a dog finally and we're down
a bit it's also a great platform to
watch animals riding rumbas or cats
farting also if you want to watch
highlights from some of your favorite
shows on there
official YouTube channel it's a great
way to do it I like to watch some Lakers
monster dunks on there I do a lot of
sort of browsing on YouTube there's a
ton of stuff that you can watch and I
even have to do it from your computer
you can do it from your couch or you can
do it from your bedroom or you can do it
from your computer as well but the
contest is just why you're excited to
use google TV browsing youtube what part
of that is most exciting and titillating
to you so link will be down below for
all the details go ahead and get
entering 100 kiedys pretty meat no
pressure you don't have to enter but I
figured I needed to share this with you
guys 146 inch TV is a pretty big deal so
I hope that my audience wins I want to
see the unboxing of these guys anyway
jon rettinger TechnoBuffalo see the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
