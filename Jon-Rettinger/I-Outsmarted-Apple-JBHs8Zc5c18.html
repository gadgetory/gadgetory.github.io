expensive an to use me properly you need
to pay for Apple music by special smart
home devices that are home kick
compatible and want to use the best
virtual assistant in the world Siri hey
that's me that's not gonna work for me
let's change it
your Apple fans and sometimes apologists
talk about the ecosystem how it's the
best thing since the last time the
Lakers want a championship and a lot of
ways that's true the ecosystem is
incredible if you are all in inside of
it if you get a phone call on your
iPhone a little ring through on your
iPad and your Mac Apple pay works across
devices earpods sync across devices
you've got iCloud Drive there's a huge
list of ways Apple's ecosystem just
works together if you have all those
products and if you spend the money for
all of those products but if you're
missing a key component of that the
ecosystem can feel broken so when
everything works with Apple's ecosystem
it's awesome I mean as I'm sitting here
I've got an Apple watch on of God and
iPhone sitting next to me I've got an
iPad with some notes on it and if my
phone rings while I'm filming this I'm
going to have three devices that are
going to ring and give me options answer
it on whatever one is most convenient to
me so there are a lot of reasons I think
why Apple's relationship between
hardware and software is so special and
probably unique and the biggest one is
its vertically oriented which means they
make the hardware and they make the
software they're in charge of the
production for all of it and development
of all of it so they have a better
control over top to bottom that gives
you the functionality that you just
don't get with other manufacturers but
and here's the big but if you love an
iPhone and you love an iPad but you
really want to have a PC laptop there's
a big gap and what the ecosystem can do
and a lot of people want to branch out
maybe they like having an iPad but they
don't want an iPhone one or maybe they
really like you know the razor laptop or
the surface line of laptops they don't
want to get a MacBook Pro or spending
the money then you're losing out on a
lot of those awesome features that Apple
can offer you and like traditionally
it's been really tough to impossible
sort of crack a hole Kinetico system you
know to jailbreak so to speak your way
in but occasionally and just sometimes
get away in where you don't have to
spend the money to get inside of Apple's
walled garden but you still get a plant
dance and do a little twirl
and enjoy the best of apples ecosystem
without paying the prices for apples
charging to get into it so if there's
one Apple product that's like the most
Apple II of all the products it's gotta
be the home pot if you like Siri and you
subscribe to Apple music you've got a
bunch of home capable devices you're
going to absolutely love the home pod
but if you use Spotify you don't like
Siri then it becomes a really expensive
speaker and that's about it all right so
this is clearly like not a TLD dream
desk but everything that's here is for a
reason I am gonna do my best
dr. Frankenstein oppression and I'm
going to kind of hack a new brain into
the home pod with the help of a
Raspberry Pi essentially we're gonna get
rid of the or at least add to the Siri
functionality let us use an Amazon echo
dot or even a Google home and while
we're at it we're gonna make Spotify
work hands-free with the home button so
we've got a Raspberry Pi 3 here you
don't need the most powerful Raspberry
Pi most then we'll actually will work
for this so we've got a couple of things
plugged in but perhaps most important
one we've got a dongle it's gonna give
us a 3.5 millimeter headset jack we've
loaded up some special software on here
and willing to it down below how we did
it it was really easy it probably took
it about 10 minutes just loading some
software on it very simple to follow on
what this is gonna let us do is anything
that we plug into the 3.5 millimeter
headset jack is going to be airplay
compatible so that'll let us use the
echo dot instead of the hey this lady's
name or any other assistant that we
wanted to plug in like a Google home ID
so now we're gonna interface with the
Raspberry Pi and this is either going to
look crazy simple or incredibly
complicated but whatever camp you're in
I promise anybody can do this this is
just the UI for raspberry products hook
a monitor up to it start left-hand
corner there's gonna be a little icon it
looks like a terminal and it's
appropriately called terminal you got to
put in a few codes so
do CD space babble pod
enter and then we'll do node space index
dot JSON turn alright so now we are
gonna go to the browser it's a little
globe thing chromium-based in case
you're wondering and we're gonna go to
the IP address for the raspberry pi so
in this case so it's pretty simple here
so the top is the source so I've got USB
audio cuz I've got that little dongle
plugged in and then where I want to
airplay to so this one here is called
airplay office I can adjust volume here
and pretty much good to go
alright so as promised Alexa play music
by Jo Barksdale on Spotify playing songs
by Jo Barksdale from Spotify coming
through on the home pod you guys can't
be able to tell where you are but it is
coming throughout the home pod look I
can adjust the volume just louder
all on the home pod rocking out to my
boy Joe Barksdale so these are just like
some examples you can really do anything
that you can plug into a 3.5 headphone
jack so if you got an old record player
and you want to be able to airplay that
you can do it sort of anything that
again has a headphone jack you can make
work a few caveats though keep it
music only there's about a three-second
delay so it's not gonna work if you want
to airplay something with video so you
would look like it was dubbed over the
mouth wouldn't match the audio so music
only this is an awesome solution that
works well which is a minimal amount of
of computer know-how so obviously this
hack works there are some caveats of
functionality but it's frustrating you
have to go through these steps to change
your default streaming music player to
play on your home pod speaker and sort
of that typify is Apple what works
really well is all the Apple first-party
services and every now and then the some
grant access to something that's not
made by them and that's really the
beauty of what Android has been and I
wish there was a happy middle ground
where you have the functionality to use
what you want and still get the best
from Apple's experiences there are a lot
of upsides with the Apple ecosystem now
I talked about this in previous videos I
love the default Photos app my 90 year
old grandparents use an iPhone I can
share pictures to a shared gallery they
see it it shows up on their phone they
could leave comments and they know how
to use it that's a huge plus for me
iMessage certainly something a lot of us
in the u.s. love I know people outside
of the US and we're whatsapp focused but
that's a big deal it's nice to have it
makes things easier for group chats it's
a luxury that I've gotten myself used to
so I obviously like what Apple is
offering but there's a lot of areas for
improvement giving away extra storage
space on iCloud would be really nice to
have or upping what the standard free
tiers would be nice and I know this is
probably pro competition but I would
love Apple to offer their services on
other OSS be able to have iMessage on
Android would be awesome even though I
know that's never gonna happen I'm sort
of holding out hope I was
to see little bits where Apple is
becoming a bit more open select the
Apple TV plus experiment is interesting
to see Apple playing nice with other
manufacturers and seeing airplay show up
from other manufacturers is very
interesting and I'm I'm wondering and
maybe I'm hopeful that was kind of using
it as a use case if we give up control
of the hardware that our services are
going to be used on that experience
still going to be the same as if Apple
made it themselves and I hope the answer
is yes and I hope people are enjoying
and going to enjoy using you know
airplay and watching Apple TV plus
content on non Apple devices so perhaps
they will start doing that for other
services and that's what I think we'll
see a new direction for Apple when hacks
like this won't be necessary when you
sort of take your services with you no
matter what platform you are using and
still have access to those awesome
things that Apple does give you so what
Apple's gonna do next is kind of
anybody's guess they're walled garden I
mentioned that is incredible if you are
all in if you're missing a product or
you don't want to pay the money for a
particular piece of that walled garden
you're left with a degraded experience
and my hope is that Apple fixes that
lets you sort of experience that missing
part with another manufacturer sort of
make a solution yourself like we tried
here and I'm hoping the next decade for
Apple is a more open decade and I'm
hoping that they let us get access to
some of their awesome services without
having to buy Apple products and maybe
it's a pipe dream maybe it's us
pie-in-the-sky wish but I'm hopeful I'm
optimistic it's gonna be a very good
next few years for Apple I hopefully
play nice with other companies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
