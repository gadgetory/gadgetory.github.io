surface pro for abusing it as pretty
much my daily computer every day since
then so that an update my thoughts on it
how things have changed or not changed
and that review came out soldiers fresh
shirts is 2056 gig hard drive eight gigs
of ram and core i5 processor one of the
biggest issues that I had as a surface
pro 4 was battery life
Microsoft claimed about 9 hours of video
playback obviously that's totally
subjective depending on screen
brightness and what you're watching but
I was not getting that originally I was
getting usually between 4 to 5 hours
there's been a lot of software updates
that have come since this computer was
released and a lot of them famously
addressed really old code that never
should have been the compute in the
first place to fix battery life I'm
getting about an hour an hour and a half
more than I did originally I am also
getting something new I didn't get
before and that heat and fan noise
coming out of the side of the computer I
originally loved how quiet and cool the
computer was so that's quiet
and a little less cool nothing that is
annoying but something that's definitely
changed originally I also gushed a lot
about the new type covered side cover
for this is not the one that has a
fingerprint reader built in but I liked
how easy it was to type and the more I
typed on it the more I appreciate having
it as a mobile option I'm traveling I do
travel a lot with this but using it as a
computer at home I'm using now an
external keyboard I found it to be a
little bit cramped and the trackpad
starts get a little jerky for me it was
originally very smooth scrolling at the
beginning but then the more I would
start to scroll and where I used it I
tend to get a little less fluid I don't
really like that so I went to the
external keyboard and a wireless mouse
I'm using this at home actually the
surface pro 3 dock and it works pretty
well just for whatever that's worth
Windows hello I still absolutely love it
seems like a magic trick to me that it
works but I have to worry about
passwords I can just look at it and it
will sign me in I think when the big
features about the surface line has
always been the hinge no Microsoft calls
laugh ability if an angle hinge is still
really good but there is a little bit of
give a little bit of flex that was not
there originally just probably from
wear-and-tear
there's a little bit of wiggle and noise
when you get to a little bit of the
higher angles that tends to be
diminished a little bit but it's not as
tight
as it once was nothing that would
prevent me from using it something that
I've noticed the screen has held up
really well traveled with this thing
quite a bit about all over the world I
don't have any dents or scratches and
I've got protecting it is just the type
cover on the front the surface line is
kind of interesting now it was rigidly
put out as a reference design to show
manufacturers what Windows 8 at the time
could be there's a lot of other Windows
10 computers out there less expensive
Windows 10 computers that do something
very similar what I still find very
attractive and alluring about the
surface pro line devices the magnesium
build it just feels really premium to me
and I appreciate that and for me that's
worth the extra cost but if that's not
worth it for you there are now a ton
more options than there were back nine
months ago would I buy this again yes I
would absolutely buy us again I've loved
using it it's still for the same people
that I said in the review it's for those
that aren't into heavy 3d rendering that
aren't doing heavy gaming that aren't
doing much video edit the more changes
coming to surface pro for Windows 10th
anniversary edition is coming for all
Windows 10 devices can bring with it
things like Windows Inc essentially an
entirely new area that the operating
system their new sticky note options
Cortana is a lot smarter just little
improvement the operating system a
little bit more elegant if you want to
see us do an updated video when Windows
hannover tradition hits give the video a
thumbs up to let us know you want to see
that overall though boils down to this
or surface pro 4 I still recommend it as
much as I did nine months ago I've been
happy with its puddling the best
computers I own and beyond that probably
the most reliable computers I own
throwing this guy in my bag it weighs
almost nothing if you want to computer
that's light it's gonna be powerful
enough it's gonna get the job done and
look good doing it I can still recommend
the surface pro 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
