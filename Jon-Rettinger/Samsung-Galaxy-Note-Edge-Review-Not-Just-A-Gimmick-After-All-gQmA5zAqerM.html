technobuffalo here 34 you have one of
the most unique looking phones of the
year this is the Galaxy Note edge go
ahead take a look at it and see if it's
more form of a function that translates
into a really good package so as I do
with all my reviews let me give a
disclaimer I use this for five straight
days and then about three days on or off
in Southern California on t mobile
services sent to us from the folks at
Samsung to review so usually with
uniquely designed phones there's a
compromising usually it's a big one to
be made the edge essentially is a note
for yeah it's point 1 inches smaller
than the screen size with 5.6 display
the battery is a little bit smaller to
at three thousand million but other than
that this is a note for through and
through it's the same gorgeous qhd
display the same three gigs of RAM is a
ridiculously fast quad-core processor
same 16 megapixel camera same s-pen same
everything it's just a note for with a
couple cool new things added to it so
let me just touch on performance a
little bit here if you want to see more
about the device and get some more
granularity about how the phone performs
and quadrant test snack kind of stuff
check out our galaxy note 4 review we
put the link to that right down below
but I'm gonna sort of give you the
highlights from that video first the
screen is absolutely gorgeous I think
Samsung is long had some of the best
screens out there and this I think is
the pinnacle of their screen pneus the
blacks are really black the colors are
bright and vibrant text looks absolutely
gorgeous I don't think it's a stretch to
say that this is probably the best phone
screen out on the market I so don't see
a huge difference between qh Jean a
really good 1080p display but this is
still a really really good screen out
there so I wasn't sure what to make of
the edge and I want to see it looked
really cool it was definitely a
conversation starter not many phones
people look at it like what the heck is
that in all candor though I wasn't sure
what to make of that curve screen all
honesty I'm still not sure what to make
of it it's definitely new eat it's
unique let me explain a little bit about
what it does and what it can do so it
kind of serves to mutant purposes first
like an entirely separate screen you can
read information interactive
ice on it the screen can act as a
shortcut bar giving you sports scores or
stock quotes it got that really cool
alarm function as well just give you
more real estate interactive your device
like the camera goat up the camera
control is no longer there on screen
there on the side screen right now
though they're only a handful of screen
configurations available but Samsung is
hoping Deb's gonna be like hey that's
cool let's get on board so they provided
an open API so hopefully more will come
this cool factor though does come at a
price and not just talking about the
hundred dollars or so premium versus the
note 4 so it moves the power button up
to the top because obviously it can't be
on the right hand side it makes advice a
little bit hard to hold left hand side
same square design we've seen before a
little bit of an angle here on the right
so a little bit difficult to sort of
pick up you want to pick it up from
there right side you got to kind of
scoop it up and a bit awkward just to
hold in one hand here build quality
though is really really good Samsung is
up there build quality tremendously if
you held the sort of old misconceptions
I've got Samsung's all sort of plastic
and bad build those are gone now this is
a well-built phone much like the Galaxy
Note 4 it's got the same start a faux
leather back but it's not the same that
we saw in the note 3 it's got more of a
soft touch more premium feel to it the
phone just feels really nice battery
life is not a Stella on the note 4 but I
can't get through a full day with about
fifteen percent left again about 220
million hours smaller in my day usually
comes off a charge around 7-730 and
picked it's a Wi-Fi at home or at work
almost all time our nap two hours a
phone call I've got YouTube videos going
playing some games since it was tmobile
I'd Wi-Fi calling on board here a lot of
camera texting and I was definitely
using that side screen quite a bit so
you can't get through a full day but
yeah if they're gonna hit a bit of a
premium versus what you've got with that
galaxy note 4 so bear that in mind
battery life is not going to be
absolutely outstanding the best you've
ever seen but getting charged every
night po enough to worry too much about
it this is a really interesting device
for a lot of reasons I think in order
for us to get tour going eventually with
foldable displays and curved screens
devices like the Galaxy Note edge need
to exist I know it feels more like a
production proof of concept but I give
Samsung a ton of credit for bringing
this to market a lot of products like
this never see the light of day to
consumers usually they're showing behind
closed doors at trade shows or meetings
so I really give Samsung is a hue
huge huge amount of credit for bringing
this device to market so here's what
this boils down to if you're willing to
pay the premium for the curved screen
try it get it if you're banking on
developers taking advantage is that
curve display you're going to get a lot
of potentially new functionality out of
it you want have something that's neat
licks there than any other phone you're
really going to appreciate this again
even that novelty factor wears off let
me reiterate you are still getting a
well spec device there are no
compromises here I think Samsung
deserves credit for that if you decide
to get the Galaxy Note edge I don't
think you'll be disappointed thank you
