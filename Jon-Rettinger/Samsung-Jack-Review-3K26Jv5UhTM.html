with a review for you of the samsung
jack for ATT wireless this is the
spiritual successor to the samsung
blackjack two and the blackjack that
preceded it so this will run you ninety
nine dollars on AT&amp;amp;T after rebates and
two-year contract so let's jump right
into the review this is a phone and it
has to make good phone calls and this is
one area where the jack really did not
shine it was dropping calls left and
right with full 3g signals I thought
maybe it might be an AT&amp;amp;T network issue
so I've swapped sim cards and tried in
two other phones called exactly the same
number in exactly the same place and I
had great call quality with no dropped
calls so I think the cell radio in the
samsung jack may not be the best or at
least in this unit wasn't the strongest
so definitely be wary it's not only I we
have a decided there are a lot of pauses
about the device I want to talk about
the first is the onscreen qwerty
keyboard as you can see the keys are all
very close together with no space in
between like you might find on the
samsung epix for example with the space
between the keys or even on a blackberry
curve it's very similar in fact to the
blackberry bold the keys are large have
rounded edges and I had no problem
getting used to typing really after just
about 20 minutes of use I was going with
probably about ninety percent accuracy
which I think as close as you can get on
a device with a qwerty keyboard like
this you're never going to have full
accuracy of a standard keyboard the
keyboard really is one strong point of
the device I should mention though that
since there's no space between the keys
it's laid with just a single sheet the
keys actually are one entire piece of
plastic so if you push in the middle you
can't see a little bit of give it was a
tiny bit disconcerting but not bad is
something to keep in mind so we're
talking about that let's go ahead to
build quality the device both quality i
think is fantastic on the samsung jack
it feels sturdy it feels solid I never
felt like I was going to break it or
drop it the chrome accents on the back
and sides I think add a little bit of
class and make it look like a business
device the 3.2 megapixel camera is
located right in the middle and I'd like
the location of it's got a really large
speaker grill above it and it just
exudes confidence I think it's a very
strong looking device I don't think the
blackjack two had the best build quality
always looked a little bit cheap to me I
think Samsung actually fixed that with
this device so what we're on build
called it let's go ahead and talk about
speaker strength the speaker foot on
this is absolutely fantastic it's
actually probably one of the best give
your phones I've ever used it is very
loud so loud in fact you can use it
almost as a conference line if you're on
a conference call so the Samsung
included something very interesting with
this device they included this super
scrolling so if you're scrolling down a
webpage or scrolling down anything you
hold down a down but it will scroll
actually very clean this super scrolling
did work very nice we want to get from
the top of the page down at the bottom
you can do it with a lot of ease I've
always been a big fan of windows mobile
6.1 standard so again non-touch hernan
and is a great implementation here it's
got a lightning fast over 500 megahertz
processor which really I didn't feel any
lag at all it's got plenty of wrong
plenty of ram and this thing is probably
one of the quicker windows mobile 6.1
standard devices that I've used they
really can be memory hog so it was quite
nice to see this thing hauling through
so one other thing that I want to talk
about I've been testing this device
while I'm testing the curve 8900 for 18
teen even just holding the two next to
each other it is very apparent that the
screen on the jack is much lower
resolution the jack has a 320 x 240
resolution whereas the curve has it 480
x 360 and after you look at a higher
risk read and then look back that Jack
it can't help but look a little bit
washed out so I'm going to keep in mind
if you're not going to be having another
phone next to it you're not going to
notice it but it was something that sort
of started to bother me as I was looking
at other phones micro SD card slot is
external which I definitely like the
call volume on this is actually quite
loud not easy speaker
the internal microphone and speaker was
actually very loud I could hear people
great when I wasn't dropping calls
people on the other end to hear me and I
could hear them without any white noise
recording I will say though that the 3g
radio was very strong here I was able to
get a strong 3d saying I might all would
not always been able to make the call
out but the signal strength is actually
much stronger on this than it was on the
iphone for example as far as 3g is
concerned it's definitely something to
keep in mind overall I did really like
the jack but I couldn't get over the
call quality and the drop calls was made
it almost useless for me simply
something to keep in mind it may have
just been this unit I recommend going to
your local ATT store interested in this
device making a couple tests phone calls
and trying it out there like I said it
very well could have been the test voice
that I was sent samsung generally has
very good call quality so I'm willing to
give them the benefit of the doubt at
the end of this case and assume it was a
bum phone so guys in conclusion on a
scale from one to five I get the samsung
jack a very solid three and a half with
the only knock coming from the very
regular drop calls taking that out of
the equation assuming that wasn't a
problem auto giving this a very very
solid for Cal Poly when it worked was
great battery life is fantastic you'll
easily get two days or up to 15 on
standby it's got a really hefty battery
in it Wi-Fi signal strength was strong
GPS was very quick to walk onto the
satellites everything worked as
advertised with the one exception so if
you're in the market for a windows
mobile standard device I think this
really is a good choice samsung 18g
claims to be upgradeable to 6.5 when
that's available but they're very slow
in ensuring upgrade so I wouldn't hold
your breath for a 6 6.5 update live with
6.1 it actually works very well on this
phone so guys this was a review for you
and be samsung jack hope you enjoyed for
