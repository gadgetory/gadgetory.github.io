to you by domain.com all right guys
let's talk about some of my favorite new
headphones that I have had the
opportunity to wear on a regular basis
as of late these are the III yes III
headphones like alpha 5 these are very
cool because of one particular reason
they're modular and by that I mean the
band's the earpieces the actual ear pads
the cables they're all modular you can
pick whatever you like and have it put
together that way so everything from
like I said the band down to the cable
is tailored to you based on what you
actually want out of the headphones now
that does come at a pretty steep cost
though unfortunately this this pair of
headphones is pretty expensive once you
start to add up all the pieces that
you're gonna need to get a full pair
working it definitely adds up fast for
example let's take a look at these bands
really quick we've got two different
bands that they sent us these are the
rugged and comfort bands the rugged
comes in at 50 bucks the comfort comes
in at 60 the rug it's got a very kind of
like a silicone feel and the comfort one
is focused on a nice bushy top of the
band for your little noggin there these
two are the PU leather over a years and
the microfiber over years and both of
these come in and fifty dollars so
already just with the band's let's say
you get the comfort band with the
microfiber over ear you're already
looking at $110 so the cables are also
about 25 bucks apiece you can do either
coiled you can do a straight one with an
inline mic and button you have a few
other options on the configurator on the
site as well and then finally these
drivers here your actual speaker pieces
these are really where you're gonna be
spending the most money they sent us two
pairs the all-rounders and the vibrant
pair and the vibrant pair comes in at
$90 the all-around pair is only 65 but
when all is said and done you're looking
at spending over $200 on a pair of
headphones now this isn't Wireless we're
not talking about anything too terribly
fancy but they do sound phenomenal and I
will say you can seriously just wear
these things all day they disappear into
your
they're remarkably comfortable I haven't
worn a pair of headphones this
comfortable in a very very long time you
can check out all the options that are
available on their site and III dot DK
and they even have all these sound
profiles for each of the different
drivers check it out for yourself and
see if it's something you might want to
be into I can't in good conscience
recommend these for someone who's just
looking for a good pair of headphones
because you can get a good pair of
headphones for $50.00 but if you're
someone who does live and breathe music
maybe you're an artist maybe you're a DJ
whatever it is if you're looking for a
solid pair of headphones then I feel
like this is a great great option
because not only do they sound great
feel super comfortable but you can
tailor them directly to what you need so
go ahead and check those out I think
those were pretty cool let me know what
pair of headphones you guys are wearing
to watch this very video in the comments

ìiî TMA chews and thank you so much for
