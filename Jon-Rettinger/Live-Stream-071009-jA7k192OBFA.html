on July tenth for a live stream to talk
tech and announce the winner of this
brand new Apple TV contest that we've
had going I was going to structure this
little bit better and maybe give away
the apple TV first and then answer some
questions I thought maybe you would
build with suspense if I answered some
questions first and then we will
announce the winner of the Apple TV so
what do you guys think should we take
some questions or should we just go
ahead and and announce the winner and
build the suspense a little bit I think
we'll take just a few questions first
year and then we'll get to the apple TV
so if you guys want to give me a column
to take questions live here via Skype so
if you want to call me just add the name
tour called an end technobuffalo I'll
put it right there so you guys can see
it and we'll take some calls so let's go
ahead and get this party started and
take a few phone calls well to we got
4th on the line there and this all
streams when we going to last a half
hour guys I'm actually going to the
angel yankee game this afternoon with
some friends so I'm pretty excited to go
take them you know go check that out so
let me go ahead and get this party
started grand parks you are on the line
for real toll hello water hey hey man
what's the agenda for yet oh yeah in the
future uh-huh yeah whoever every told
not sure what what that was let's go
ahead and take another call sign was a
little bit on the odd one I'm getting a
lot of requests for a room tour means
we'll do that add another time you'll do
a whole separate video and put you guys

right let's take another call here let's
see who we got random answer think we
have Joe Andre or and rod day on the
line how are you John hey man got to
speak up just a little bit what's up I
would like to know what does it be the
biggest challenge when you are making a
review is if the order over things who
are talking about you see if the future
Z we're going to choose um you know that
that's a good question when I make my
videos sometimes I have to do you know
seven or eight takes to really get right
what I want to talk about so the hardest
thing is probably limiting it down so I
can talk about things for so much I can
talk about an iphone 4 45 50 minutes
Bobby said I got to cut it down which is
which is unfortunate so I lose out on a
lot of the features that I'd like to
talk about and people sometimes want to
hear about particular thing that I just
don't have time to talk about
unfortunately so I hope that they answer
your question sure all right let's go
ahead and take a few more calls and then
we'll go ahead and get you the winner
what you're gonna pick somebody at
random here Jason Diaz how are ya ready
go hey man I love your twitter post
always good articles
hey what's that what's up all right the
time to give you the heads up um telling
all my friends about you thanks man I
appreciate it yeah no problem no problem
I'm actually talking to you on my arm by
my voice pretty cool are using mijo
built-in Wi-Fi that's pretty good
quality right yeah my new coming in

good um yeah my keep doing the good job
man I put away for took my Buffalo
thanks we're really excited about about
technobuffalo thrilled to be able to
share some of it with you guys oh great
well thank you I will take a few more
calls Kyle duffield what's up man hey i
doing John I am good okay before yeah um
yeah sorry video on your hell your
iphone broke Woodstock we have to put it
we're just out of curiosity honestly
just stopped working I'm just just one
turn on anyone just wouldn't turn on
nothing would would work Wow
unfortunately it was really annoying
that's what ever happened to Utica no
never with the net worth in 3g actually
oh yeah I mean um I member i had my
iphone routine i actually dropped in the
screen completely cracked and then it
stopped working and Apple sent me a new
home for the day so I mean their
services fantastic i think yeah it
really has been been fantastic and it's
unfortunate though in a phone breaks but
oftentimes worth the carrier you want to
go back to the carrier you got a deal
with the manufacturer it's nice table
just to go directly to Apple yeah
absolutely yeah i'm looking forward to
technobuffalo thing that's gonna be
really cool so I wish you best of luck
on that thank you i'm excited about it
and a few you guys if you look at the
stream here you'll notice i made you
mods so you can go through and take care
of some of the chats i can't really do
it right now I don't know talkin cyou go
say give it all right let's take another
call here we've got I'm gonna mess with
your name unfortunately AB riage
hello yeah fine hey man you got to turn
your body down it's a little bit what I
do for you what happened John Foley calm
you are you're breaking up but I think
you asked what's happening to John for
lakers calm and that's actually an
excellent question and one that I've
really spent a long time thinking about
you know I started John for lakers calm
really to give people a voice and to let
everybody have a say in technology and
kind of give them their own forum but
unfortunately it kind of got to be a a
repost of just some videos and such and
people weren't getting exposure that I
wanted them to have they weren't getting
the coverage and they weren't having the
flexibility to create and modify their
own content it's just straight posts got
to be a little bit on the on the rough
side of doing a hard to kind of realize
the division so I was one of the impetus
behind technobuffalo let people have
their own pages when they are controlled
of their own content and some of those
pages pages will be featured and looking
a lot more exposure i think that people
were getting on John for lakers calm
thanks sure no problem all right we'll
take maybe two more calls and then we'll
get to the giveaway let's see who we can
get on the line here we have Daniel W
hair Hey oh gosh thank you for you man
um yeah our show 2 Broke a question I've
got a bunch of friends on I got a bunch
of friends on verizon and I was
wondering if the iphone must ever go to
verizon what would they have to change
with what would happen to uh well the BB
short answer is are you in the United
States as I am there are two main sort
of cell networks as one that's called
gsm which variety and t-mobile use most
of the phones that have SIM cards and
then there's another cell network that
is called cdma and the cdma is her
without sim cards it's got an internal
radio and that's what variety and sprint
use so in order for a Apple
to make a verizon iphone they would have
to have a completely new radio cdma in
there and it will help how long do you
think that'll be you know if I would not
guess on an iphone for verizon until
well until 2011 unfortunately all right
thanks man sure no problem I will take
one more call that will get to the
answer here let's see who we can have
Colin start skype just had some issues
there we will take one more call to do
we have one with you Alex hey I'm good
man how are you you got to turn your
turn your volume down though alright
sorry is that better much better what's
up all right my question is would have
been the biggest troubles you have had
on youtube trying to get noticed with
technology uh you know that that's
interesting when I when I started the
channel I didn't really do it with the
intent of trying to get noticed or you
know getting many subscribers I started
it just as a way for me to learn how to
use my new Mac I never had a Mac before
so it's just kind of a way for me to to
learn and to be honest I I think that
probably ninety nine point nine percent
of whatever little success I might have
had was probably attributed to just luck
mostly I don't think that there's much
out there that separate me from the
other type of rivers and I feel really
fortunate you've even had just a little
bit of success you know I can look back
in retrospect and try and offer advice
to some aspiring tech reviewers and
that's kind of why I did that video
series earlier on the advice but you
know what i can say is thank you your
content is good make sure your camera
angles are good make sure that your
speech is very careful and every mindful
of what you're saying and know your
product even if you're reviewing some
sort of tech or not you know make sure
you know what you're talking about
alright yeah cuz i'm just starting out
just wanted to know a little bit about
that thanks sure what i would you
started restarting out on youtube yeah
why do you give your channel little plug
it's whack your tech
that's why I could tuck and I'm doing
just like a bunch of things like I just
started doing an unboxing video what's
in my dog video and I'm just kind of
messing around right now up I remember I
wish you I wish you nothing but luck
Thanks alright so without further ado
I'll take some calls after this the
reason you guys are you're probably sick
and see in my face from all my videos
but I've got to announce the winner of
the Apple TV and the first thing I want
to say I was given this away not for any
reason I didn't hit any milestones or
anything I just want to say thank you to
you guys the support you've given me and
the fact that i'm going to be able to
review technology you know as a as a
career and in your future it is really
exciting to me and to have that
opportunity i know is because of you
guys this is just a small way to say
thank you and i have many more giveaways
coming up and part of our launch with
TechnoBuffalo will be a lot of Giveaways
like apple TV here so after the giveaway
I'll take another caller to and I'll
talk to you a little bit about
TechnoBuffalo for the people that are
here and you know let's go ahead and get
started so let me tell you how I chose a
winner because it had to be very very
very random obviously if you got a lot
of comments what I did was I went to the
YouTube channel and I took all the
comments there and I pasted them all
into a Word document a massive massive
massive word document fact I think we
had over 14,000 comments I mean it was
crazy and honestly I just held down the
down button for a prescribed amount of
seconds that i got from random.org and I
stopped when I got somewhere I moved the
cursor over the left and I selected the
winner it was really just as random as
that so you know eyes were closed and we
kind of pick somebody I used like I said
random.org to pick amount of time and
just pick somebody at random so let's go
ahead and get started in the past I'm
going to go over would give it away i
sent a flip minohd to the UK i gave away
a LG view and i gave away a nintendo dsi
so had a lot of fun so the winner
they go ahead and we've got a separate
winners thing here I don't know if this
person is here but their youtube name is
when a massacre and I think here a SI
Miller 350 and it is a SI Miller 350 is
her twitter name and she posted her
comments two days ago so that is a
veggie winner of that is her twitter
name of the apple TV i will be sending
you if you're here a note on youtube and
i hope that you decide to do an unboxing
and post this but if you guys didn't win
like unfortunate a lot of you didn't
there will be plenty plenty plenty
plenty more giveaways thank you
everybody for entering and we're gonna
have a lot more cool stuff than just the
Apple TV I promise so again thank you
guys for you know supporting me and
supporting the channel and hopefully for
your support to TechnoBuffalo so you
know thank you guys I really just just
appreciate it from the bottom of my
heart Noah no Bologna no BS just want to
say thank you so let me tell you guys a
little bit about technobuffalo and give
you just a few more details here first
thing I want to say is thrilled to
finally announce it so TechnoBuffalo is
going to be on the front end you're
going to have just original content we
have a staff of professional hired
writers who are going to be putting up
or you know new reviews new thoughts on
opinions video content shows really
think of the kind of content that you
get on and gadget or cnet 24 hours a day
or right on your homepage but aside from
that aside from the original content we
also have a full social network and the
social networks that you see now are
mostly freestanding facebook or myspace
this social network is going to just be
the support TechnoBuffalo so whether you
can talk to each other we've got a
built-in instant messaging client that
when you add technobuffalo friends you
know they show up and you can talk to
each other you know it's uh should be to
be pretty cool I think and the thing
that I'm most excited about
we put the really the most hard work
into is the sub logs you also have the
ability to create your own sub blog so
whereas on John for lakers you just
write as an author now you can have your
own site and we've built in full
wordpress content management for you on
your own sub blog and not only you have
your own sub blog you can also put in
your own ad so you can put in your own
banner ad using Adsense or whatever
advertising option you have so you can
actually make money on your content if
you're writing it and you're putting it
out there you deserve some reward for it
and I'm hoping that this will be a way
for you guys to you know get get paid
for your hard work so if you've got your
own website people aren't noticing it
anything you know then technobuffalo is
probably going to be for you we're going
to be featuring a lot of these sub logs
you don't have to pay for hosting any of
a way to make some money off of it so
really we're super excited about it so
I'm going to go ahead and take some more
phone calls there's one ask
technobuffalo questions go ahead in fact
the name that you call me on skype is
just TechnoBuffalo so anyway I hope you
guys are very excited about it and we'll
take a few more phone calls and then i'm
going to call it a show nice quick and
early because i'm actually going to the
angel yankee game tonight i'm very
excited so I'm Joe thanks for taking
care of the content no mods and Jalen to
you as well let's go and answer call
here we've got Matt skateboard thanks
thanks for narrowing down what's up um
ok so I have a few questions for you
what can I do for you um one no you
don't know no universe method so I phone
will avenge for the inversion well I
just asked this question probably not
until 2011 if ever for that matter yeah
and also I was just recently looking at
a friend's blackberry storm ah and I
took off the battery cover noticed there
was something that looked like a sim
card with
verizon wireless logo on that like what
is it that actually is a sim card it's
meant for international user which
doesn't hook up to AT&amp;amp;T 3g network here
does share one of the band with ATT
that's mostly just for international use
since gsm is more of international
standard okay and one more question
actually sorry ok 10 so of for YouTube
you said that you started just to get
you know Mac help you didn't want I like
actually get noticed um I sent emails to
a cup of companies and of course I got
rejected because they were my first book
you have any tips on how to actually
write these emails you know the best tip
I can say is be very mindful and you're
using don't use abbreviations smiley
faces LOL you want to save the number
two right out twl t wo keep it very
professional and make sure that you show
them some sort of benefit to it's got a
hugely beneficial for them so i would
lay out what is you know what their
benefit would be they're not going to
send you stuff you know just for just
for the heck of it ok thank you you're
welcome oh I will take maybe one or two
more calls and then we will end this a
nice and short so let's see how we got

sense oh no problem and let's go to

filming a filling a video so I will take
one more call here and we've got bread
dense and how are you man good to talk
to you hey how you doing good good nice
to uh nice speak to your filing we've
exchanged some conversations over a
Twitter yeah I notice that that's great
to talk to you what's up uh yeah um I
have a old macbook from you know why I
bought it last September okay or
actually I got it for my birthday and
and I actually was thinking about
getting the imac okay go 24 inch okay
yeah and I I want to know since you've
had it for a while Oh what you thought
of it I've been
throat with it I it's been great for me
it's been fast it's been powerful I
think the screen is beautiful size-wise
is great I thoroughly recommend the 24in
imac in the future I may have to move to
a Mac Pro just for some more power for
rendering HD videos and such but the
imac i think is absolutely fantastic i
would buy it again in a heartbeat oh
okay cool that sounds good it's a good
talk to you man don't be a stranger him
you boy alright guys so because I gotta
go to the game just a few minutes I'm
going to film actually a video I'm going
to try to film it will try and do one
take announcing the winner of the apple
TV i'ma let you guys actually watch the
filming process if you if you like so
got my camera tripods over there I'm
going to go set this up let me get the
winners information up on my screen here
so I can say it properly let's see okay
got it up here so I'm gonna give you
guys some behind-the-scenes stuff if you
like someone to go is set up my camera
on the tripod be back in a minute so
usually what I do is I'll take my chair
and kind of line it up with my desk so I
can see what a straight shot is going to
look like and then I've got the tripod
in front of me over there you guys can't
see and I line up the camera this is my
sony HDR sr 11 HD camera so let's go
ahead and do that right now so i am
behind the scenes right now with my
tripod which coincidentally was my
nickname in college not just kid you
guys probably get in here me so i'll put
the camera on the tripod let's turn this
on there you go to line it up make sure
it's lined up looks to be okay turn this
around and I come back and I've got a
remote control for the camera right here
and generally think sometimes this is my
mosaic I look a little bit to the side
is that I am looking at the display I
don't always look right at the lens I
guess
need to improve on that so let me go
ahead and get this open all right and
we're going to go ahead and just film
the video i can't see you guys hope you
can still see me as i'm talking to
create a headache from the turn mute my
volume and we're going to go ahead and
get started try this in one take
generally takes me like five or six
takes record a video but hopefully we
will be able to claw to get it right
what's up everyone jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo calm here and i'm very
happy to announce the winner of the
Apple TV giveaway it up and running for
the past 10 days this giveaway wasn't

support some you guys may be watching
the behind the scenes of me filling this
during a live stream if you are you
looking at me from over here hello and
if you're watching this just straight on
YouTube hello to you as well so we had
well over 14,000 entries for the Apple
TV which fantastic and really exceeded
my expectations to pick the winner what
I did was I took all the comments picked
them into a Word document went to random
word and pick the number and really
scroll down with my eyes closed until I
hit that prescribed number of seconds
move the cursor over to the left and
selected who the winner was that was the
best way I could think to keep it fair
so thank you everybody who entered and
without further ado and virtual drum
roll the winner of the apple TV is a
similar 350 same name on both YouTube
and Twitter I believe it's a woman she
entered two days ago so thank you for
entering thank you for winning thank you
for your support I'll be sending you a
PM on YouTube asking for your address
and i will get this out to you next week
