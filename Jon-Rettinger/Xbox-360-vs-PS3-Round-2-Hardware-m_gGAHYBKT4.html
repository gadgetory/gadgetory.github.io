put the controllers head-to-head and the
Xbox 360 controller came out on top by a
slight edge while both controllers were
deemed excellent the 360 controller
proved to be a better fit in the hand
and the overall design was superior
compared to the DualShock 3 after the
first round the Xbox 360 leads by a
single point and in the next five rounds
we'll be taking a close look at the
hardware everything from design input
and outputs to central processing units
and GPU it's all going to be covered in
depth so get ready for 12 rounds of
heavyweight game console action it's LP
from TechnoBuffalo
and welcome to the console war showdown
now this is a topic that has to be tied
in with price and value
I bought the PlayStation 3 on the
European launch date back in the spring
of 206 man was I excited but man oh man
did I die just a little inside when six
hundred and fifty euros left my wallet
that's about nine hundred US dollars
with the introduction of the ps3 slim in
September to a nine the price has dipped
significantly down to approximately
three hundred bucks
both US dollars and euros the two
consoles are now on the same price point
but I think Microsoft still has levers
to pull so I would not be surprised if
the elites price comes down to 250 if
the ps3 starts gaining some ground so
I'm going to be looking at this hardware
comparison from the perspective of where
we are right now in fall 209 and the
notion of both consoles being and an
equal price point round two SKU wars to
make these series of videos a bit more
complex both manufacturers have come out
with multiple SKUs of their hardware not
many gamers knew or cared what asked us
before Microsoft came out with two
different versions of their Xbox 360
hardware the term was adopted by the
gaming community basically overnight SKU
stands for stock keeping unit
it's a term merchants used to identify
unique products in inventory obviously
in this case it refers to unique system
configurations the multiple SKU strategy
has brought with it more choices it's
not only a matter of which console to
buy a consumer must now choose between
the different variations of the same
console when I bought the ps3 I had two
SKUs to choose from the 60 gigabyte SKU
and the 20 gigabytes SKU the 20 gig SKU
was a hundred euros cheaper but it
lacked backwards compatibility flash
card readers and Wi-Fi since the launch
of the ps3 there's been seven different
SKUs on the market some with ps2
backwards compatibility and some lacking
two of the SKUs have had flash memory
card readers and the rest have not
suffice is to say that it's all a bit
confusing for the average consumer but
there are benefits of multiple SKUs
during the PlayStation 3 SKU cycle the
size of the processors have been shrunk
down from the original 19 animators to
first 60 nanometers and now with the
slim to 45 nanometers the point of
shrinking down the size of the CPUs and
GP
is fairly simple smaller size equates
less power consumption and heat
dissipation that is also cheaper to
manufacture so if you like me and you've
gone and bought the original 60 gigabyte
ps3 back in the day with considerable
expense it will be consuming 1/3 more
power and running considerably hotter
and noisier than the newer and cheaper
SKUs the Xbox 360 has also had several
SKUs over the past years
when I bought the Xbox 360 there were
four different SKUs on the market five
if you include the butt-ugly Halo SKU I
mean come on it looks like something
you'd find in a ditch
anyways four SKUs when I bought the Xbox
360 the arcade the pro and the elite and
there were also some 20 gigabyte
promiscuous still on the market and
looking at Microsoft long list of SKUs
really makes me miss the olden days
where there was only a single system and
everyone pretty much had the same device
I'm really not sure if the multi school
strategy is the right one because for
the average consumer
things can get a bit confusing I
remember a lot of people were quite
pissed off two years back when having
just bought the version of the Xbox 360
that lacked the HDMI output only to find
out that the HDMI version was on sale a
few weeks later but there's also been
quite a lot of confusion about which
versions of the ps3 had backwards
compatibility and which did not in my
opinion the whole Scooba this has harmed
both brands in the long run but I kind
of do understand the business aspect of
multiple SKUs adding an HDMI output
post-launch will sell more units shaving
off a hundred bucks with the expense of
backwards compatibility will sell more
units to certain demographics but it
definitely would be nice if the console
I buy at a high expense on the launch
date would be at least equally as good
as the SKU that comes three years later
with half the price now this pisses me
off and I know for a fact that I'm not
alone with this what do you guys think
luckily Microsoft and Sony have both
tried to cut down on the SKUs Sony first
got rid of the SKUs - lacked Wi-Fi and
Microsoft only recently revealed that it
would be losing the Xbox 360 Pro see you
leaving only two SKUs on the market the
arcade and the elite I'm awarding no
points in this round because the
multiple screw approach really doesn't
serve anyone's interest I am perfectly
fine with shrinking down the components
but adding and subtracting features
confuses the average consumer and
frustrates the Loyalists of fans of both
manufacturers hopefully come next
generation of consoles both
manufacturers will develop their concept
and hardware long enough not to have to
make ten versions within the consoles
product cycle a single SKU approach
seems to be working fairly well for a
certain other Japanese console namely
the Nintendo Wii
round three design and external features
the design of game consoles have always
been interesting to say at least no game
console is alike and the xbox360 and ps3
are very different looking devices the
original PlayStation 3 is a bit bulkier
than the Xbox 360 but obviously the slim
has turned the tables and the slim is
about the third smaller than its big
brother and significantly smaller than
the Xbox 360 I'm pretty sure Microsoft
isn't planning on an Xbox 360 slim but
if you're watching this in 200 10 with
an Xbox 360 slim in your living room I
take my previous statement back the ps3
is an expensive looking device it has
sleek curves and a lot of thought has
been put into its unique style some may
say that it looks like a UFO and some
say that it resembles a sandwich grill
but I think the ps3 looks sleek from
almost any angle the Xbox 360 is a sweet
and simple design very minimalistic but
classy in its own way the front of the
Xbox 360 has a very distinct look about
it and it has some customizability to it
as well you can buy custom faceplate to
suit your personality a bit of a novelty
feature but it definitely appeals to a
certain crowd while I do like the piano
black finish on the ps3 man does it
collect some serious dust and
fingerprints but if you don't like the
glossy finish the slim features a matte
finish which may not be as flashy as the
original PlayStation 3 but it gets the
job done and looks good in its non dust
collecting and smudging way I have said
it before the chroming is definitely
better suited for rims of cars than
entertainment devices but the chroming
on the ps3 looks ok I'll though take
note that the chroming is gone from the
cheaper SKUs including the ps3 slim the
Xbox 360 has a very uncool feature which
is the huge power supply that can be
tricky to hide depending on the
placement of your device I mean this
thing basically looks like a game
console in its own accord
both consoles have a very cool and
distinct look about them and I really
can't decide which I prefer more you
know some days I prefer coffee and other
days I prefer cocoa that's just the way
goes but let's check out the external
inputs and outputs which are also
connected to the design the inputs and
outputs on both devices have changed
between all the different SKUs so it's
impossible to make an entirely accurate
comparison between the two systems but
what we have
here side-by-side are the most common
models in use today and most essential
features are the same beside the disk
tray we find a couple of memory unit
slots and underneath them we find a
wireless sync button when I first got
the Xbox I was wondering where the USB
ports were but they're actually down
here under the hatch and the USB ports
are a bit tricky to get to because
they're quite deep inside there and
having the USB cable attached to the 360
it really breaks the clean lines of the
device the 360 features a mechanical
button for the DVD tray which pops up
with good hates when you press the
button the tray seems to work nicely
even though the Xbox is placed
vertically but the most prominent
feature on the front of the Xbox 360 is
the power button which has acquired some
notoriety in its own accord in a
slightly negative way over the past few
years it's also a subject that we'll be
covering in upcoming rounds on the front
of the ps3 we have four USB ports well
if you have the newer models you'll only
get two but I really haven't to use more
than two USB devices simultaneously so
two is probably enough under the lid
here we have memory card readers for
several types of memory cards it's also
a feature that I do not use too often
but it's a decent feature to have if you
for example store your pictures on the
ps3 unfortunately this is also a feature
excluded from the newer models including
the slim under the optical drive we find
to touch sensitive buttons one for the
optical drive itself and one for the
power while the touch sensitive buttons
may be cool I have a feeling that
they've added to the high price tag of
the platform but the slim has excluded
the touch sensitive buttons and replaced
them with simpler and probably cheaper
mechanical buttons on the back of the
ps3 we find several inputs and outputs
and starting from the right we find the
power cord input which connects to the
internal power supply there's also a
main power button if you don't want to
keep your device on standby for some
reason next we find the analog output if
you're for example using a scart or
component cables and we also have an
optical output for connecting with your
amplifier here we find the LAN
connection and here we find the HDMI out
the ps3 supports 21.3 HDMI profile which
has double a bandwidth of earlier HDMI
standards
it adds deep color support and
include support for the new HDMI audio
standards dolby digital plus and DTS
true HD of course most people don't have
the higher-end amplifiers and TVs to
support these formats but it's good to
be future proof more about this stuff in
the upcoming round that will be covering
media playback all rightie on the back
of the 360 we find a power cable input
that connects to the massive power
supply I showed you earlier and here we
find a USB port which is a nice feature
to have on the back because you may have
some devices that you want kept out of
sight and we also find your standard
local area network port while the first
SKUs of the Xbox 360 did not have an
HDMI output all of the current models do
the HDMI on the Xbox 360 only support
HDMI profile 1.2
there is no optical audio output on the
xbox360 but there is an optical audio
output from the analog cable that's
included with the device which is fine
but a very annoying thing with the
xbox360 is that you cannot connect the
analog cable and the HDMI cable at the
same time which means that if you
connect the device with an HDMI cable to
your display you won't be able to
connect the optical cable to your
amplifier this sucks quite a bit all
right you the next two features were a
bit tricky to categorize as they're
external for the Xbox 360 and internal
for the ps3 the hard drive on the Xbox
360 lies on top of the console it's very
easy to remove and replace so if you
have one of the older Xbox 360 skills
you can upgrade to for example at 120
gigabyte hard drive the only thing
holding you back from upgrading will be
the 150 bucks price tag you can also
swap out the ps3 hard drive but you'll
need a screw driver to do it
luckily the process is very simple and
you can swap out the ps3 hard drive for
any 2.5 inch serial ata disc so if you
store a lot of games and media content
on your hard drive you can get a 320
gigabyte hard drive for under a hundred
bucks and you can actually speed up your
ps3 loading times a bit by installing a
7200 rpm hard drive as you can see the
hard drive included in my trusty old ps3
is a pretty standard Seagate Barracuda
disc
all-righty the next feature is internal
for the ps3 but is an external add-on
for the Xbox 360 put simply the ps3 has
built-in Wi-Fi and the Xbox 360 does not
a wireless network adapter is sold
separately for around 80 bucks
and in my opinion Wi-Fi is a feature
that one expects to be built in these
days so it's a definite negative for the
Xbox 360 heck even my toaster has a
built-in Wi-Fi it probably comes as no
surprise that the ps3 will be taking
this round both the original ps3 and the
slim are sleek looking devices that
include all the necessary input and
outputs although some of the features
have been excluded from the slim it
still managed to be the better all
rounded advice when it comes down to
input and outputs
the round for design and external
features go to the ps3 hands down the
match is now tied up with a point for
each platform in the next two rounds is
time to peek under the external covers
and analyze the internal hardware CPU
and GPU are up next
it's time to break these babies open
catch you later in the next round of the
console wars LP signing up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
