it's the first design overhaul Apple's
had since the original iPhone and like
Apple itself it's predictably polarizing
I tend to be pretty agnostic when it
comes to mobile OS is splitting my time
pretty evenly between whatever Android
flagship does yours outs in the large
screen iPhone at the time for me the
iPhones become a commodity and enterings
iMessage
but what 210 it was the first iPhone 6
the 6 plus I was generally pumped about
but now two weeks in the initial
enthusiasm has started to wane the
iPhone 10 for me though is a tale of two
stories for the first six days I found
it frustrating and oftentimes super
annoying I wasn't starting my swipe far
enough down to go home accidentally set
off the SOS alert trying to turn my
phone off probably the police to call me
back it was annoying that I couldn't see
the battery pretending to have swiping
down from the right but then the second
week of testing something happens I
stopped thinking about these UI tweaks
and just started using them after that
initial learning curve I started to
really enjoy the phone but I'm getting a
bit ahead of myself let's start back at
the beginning the iPhone 10 at least on
papers a phone that I've been hoping
Apple would make wireless charging OLED
badass camera setup and a design that
can finally rival the best of Android
so aside from Apple's stealing my
hairline for that top notch at least
aesthetically the phone looks stunning
face ID these sounds like a gimmick but
now two weeks in and I'm still not
completely sold but I'm Way more
convinced that I was at the beginning
but we'll get to that I usually skip
over software my phone reviews because
it's iOS but with the 10 you can't just
pick it up and know what to do
I've been doing phones now for over nine
years is the first device that I can
remember where I had to look up how to
power the device off I had to ask how to
take screenshots and how to close
applications there's a lot of nuances
here it takes time to learn but the more
I used it the more I saw that Apple's
feature while looking surprisingly like
the palm free software is incredibly
bright the gestures became more
deliberate and the swipes became second
nature
I still have a hard time understanding
why Apple didn't put an on screen home
but or at least something force touching
the dock but I did at least get used to
it
so software aside the next big story is
the 5.8 inch OLED display and I just
want to say thank you seriously
finally and thank you the 24 36 by 11 25
make the 458 PPI screen look awesome in
my recent Samsung reviews I praised them
for the incredible screen technology and
for the 10 Apple cozied up to the
frenemy Samsung to build the display
while Apple maintained control under the
underlying tech so predictably when
those two get together the screen is
incredible but not perfect I turned off
the true tone display
I thought the constantly white balancing
was unnecessary in a possible battery
drain it also to my eye caused a bit of
a yellow hue but others in the office
absolutely loved it so personal
preference thing color reproduction is
awesome the wide color gamut really
helps with that and the black levels are
very black it's one of the incredible
things about the OLED technology I was a
bit worried about brightness but with
Auto turned on I never felt this green
looked washed out I never had issues
seeing it in direct sunlight this is
clearly the best green Apple has ever
put on one of the devices and can
finally rival the best displays from
Samsung and LG despite having a larger
display than the A+ the phone feels
noticeably smaller in the hands it kind
of feels reminiscent of a galaxy s 8 and
it's only slightly bigger and frame than
an iPhone adel IA opted for the larger
size phones but it's hard not to admit
this is the sweet spot for almost
everyone's hand size I really love the
feel of the phone the glass on the back
feels awesome and I thought that I lost
the Fila device when I put in a case so
perhaps foolishly I made the decision to
go case free and instead opted for Apple
care it started to not feel like a chump
after showing out about 1200 bucks for
the phone that extended warranty I have
laptops that cost less than
apple claims the glass on the back is
the strongest glass on any smartphone
when it comes to the accidental drop and
there's stuff to put in battle of glass
versus concrete I'm going with concrete
every time and the drop test that we've
seen and reviewed tend to confirm the
fragility the band around the side is
made of surgical grade stainless steel
and I'm not sure what surgical grade has
to do with anything here but hey it's
there the space crepe version and I've
been testing does show plenty of finger
prints so keep a t-shirt or a cloth
handy to clean that sucker up the
speakers here are also 25% louder and
they sound pretty good for a mobile they
don't distort the sounds when you go to
high volumes but if you still want
better audio you're gonna want a
headphones but make sure those
headphones or the wireless or lightning
because still no headphone jack here so
I promise I talked about face ID and in
all honesty I'm still not sure how I
feel about it but how I feel doesn't
really matter it unlocks about as fast
as touch ID and I found myself having to
use a passcode about as often as I did
with touch ID anyway so I think that's a
win using it in apps though is we're
really shine things like Apple pay and
one password just feel effortless
camera time it's Apple change
orientation a 12 megapixel sensors from
landscape to portrait so you know they
mean business it's expected combo of
wide-angle and telephoto lenses and
Apple's marketing machine will tell you
it uses a state-of-the-art seven magnet
solution but to the end-user the
pictures just look really good both
cameras have oh is and they do a really
admirable job of stabilizing video or I
think it really shines is in low-light
situations where the pictures still end
up looking really good pictures look
really incredible without being
overexposed and even in almost no light
I was able to see the true color
reproduction in the photos another thing
I love is portrait mode and I try and
use it almost every chance I get to take
pictures of my kids it just works
incredibly well the true depth camera on
the front enables portrait mode selfies
that just looked really bad
hopefully software updates will fix this
but the background sometimes where I'm
blurred properly ears seem to trip it up
I just wasn't that impressed but you do
get an emojis which I'm not gonna lie I
use more than a grown man should so now
lets you'll probably wear off soon but I
love shaking my head and seeing the
Poots way and I can't be alone battery
life for me was about 10% worse than
what I got on my a plus it's good but
not great I could get through a full day
so that's at least what I need and I
commend Apple for not going full Apple
and creating their own wireless charging
standard instead opting for the pretty
much ubiquitous cheese standard it also
rained one day while we were testing so
it was nice to have the ip67 I'll
obviously I would have preferred the
ip68
that standard now across almost all
Android flagships so that not it's it's
there on one hand I can see why they did
it it creates two distinct swipes to
bring up different things in this case
control center notifications and I get
that it also for better worse services
brand identification for Apple but when
watching full screen videos or apps and
aren't yet optimized it's kind of
distracting it a bit of an eyesore it
did start to fade in the background in
the latter part of my usage but then I'd
watch a full screen YouTube video and I
be Jean Lia where'd that notch was there
I'll say this though it detracts less
than I thought but it's definitely a
slight blemish on otherwise gorgeous
canvas day eleven Bionic is powering
device and it's predictably fast
sometimes it feels overkill but I
imagine the extra horsepower is there to
help the iPhone 10 aged gracefully into
iOS 12 and 13 which I think are gonna
focus a lot on gestures so the iPhone 10
it's not for everyone in the way
previous iPhones were my mom for example
has been an iPhone user for five years
and took one look at the lack of a home
button and said no thank you
face ID and gestures are gonna take time
to get used to not because they don't
work because they're drastically
different than what people have had
before the price of having the cutting
edge from Apple is a steep one to pay
starting at a grand the barrier to entry
is crazy high even for Apple if you
decide you want to come on board or get
a device that's finally a feature parity
with the best of Android and predictably
performs better than any iPhone in
recent memory I can see the direction
Apple is heading here and well not
perfect the iPhone 10 is definitely top
notch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
