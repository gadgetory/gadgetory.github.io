technobuffalo here today September 9
applehead there it's all a rock and roll
keynote address which is highlighted by
some hardware and software updates Steve
Jobs stage and looked that as healthy as
usual so good news for all the Apple and
jobs fans out there so the big news
really was in the ipod line let me go
ahead and get started and tell you what
happened I've got some notes here since
this guy keynote just ended so excuse me
if I look down or away for a few moments
first there are updates to the ipod
touch line but not the updates we were
all expecting no camera was found on the
back of the ipod touch perhaps that will
come later or not at all but we did see
what some storage increases and price
drops you can now get a 1 99 ipod touch
with a gigabytes of storage not bad you
can get a 32 gig for 299 which is
probably going to be the sweet spot for
a lot of people and a new 64 gig for 399
so that's a lot of storage a lot of
video or a lot of apps on your ipod
touch other than that really nothing
revolutionary or exciting here the next
was a bump to the classic or on the bump
on the ipod classic it went 250 gigs
same price 249 nothing terribly exciting
there was not killed it was just bumped
up in welcome spent next was the shuffle
you're getting kind of a slew of new
colors and you also got some fresh drops
as well which are always good news 59
bucks is going to get you a two gig
model where 79 is going to get you four
give other that's the same buttonless
design with the voice-over control and
all that business the big news and
actually the one more thing announcement
was to the ipod nano which now has a
video camera on the back keeps the same
very slim design but has a slew of new
features so you're now getting a video
camera on the back you're getting a
built-in money on the back
you're getting built in speakers on the
back you're also getting voice over
technology the same stuff that's found
on the ipod shuffle you're getting a
voice recorder that you can see on the
iphone or the ipod touch you're now
getting an FM radio so the Nano is the
first ipod to feature any sort of radio
transmitter so i'm cool if you're into
that it also has a pedometer and if you
hear that noise in the background that's
the collective crap i think that the
flip video company is dropping right now
at the thought of losing a tremendous
amount of market share to Apple on this
new sort of video camera in your pocket
type thing so price-wise these things
are actually really good coming in at
149 for an eight gig model or 179 for a
16 gig model now you're not getting
Wi-Fi but you can upload right to
YouTube soon as you plug it into your
computer shoot a lot of video plug it in
uploaded right to YouTube you know quite
nice it's also going to come in a slew
of new colors so if you're an ipod nano
fan or you're looking at maybe getting a
flip flip video or a flip ultra flip HD
you may want to take a look at the nanos
as well as you do your comparison
shopping since these are just announced
I've got yet to actually see one and
talk about the video quality but I will
have a new nano to be doing some head to
head comparisons with some video quality
for you apple also announced itunes nine
which has some cool new features let me
go ahead and share with you what those
are you've got improved store navigation
including a persistent navigation menu
you really get an hour more of a
streamlined UI which seems per user
interface which is quite nice you're
getting full a window itunes store so
those times when the side barrage is too
much for you can now get the store in a
full window no that was a complaint with
a lot of people you can preview from
anywhere in the store you don't have to
really drill down anymore to preview
itunes LP which sort of this new thing
that iTunes is doing which is including
some extras with the music you're
downloading
their videos booklets pictures think of
it as like the extras on a DVD or
blu-ray you're also now getting genius
mixes more and more advanced genius
playlist really nothing revolutionary in
there but you are getting served some
improved functionality you're now
getting an app management for your
iphone which is quite nice as well
you'll be able to sort of control your
apps right from itunes now let's think a
long time coming you can drag and drop
to move certain apps to on pages which
is very nice you can also now you a home
sharing which name of you to share your
video your music or your pictures within
five computers on the same same home I
assume that's probably gonna be limited
to the same Wi-Fi network but now you
can actually share downloaded videos
which is quite nice and downloaded with
apples crazy restrictive drm you can now
set items in the iTunes Store as gifts
add them to a wish list and even publish
them to Facebook and thinking of which
there's now integration with Facebook
and Twitter so you can send out to your
friends what you're watching what you
just bought or whatever what other
iTunes related information you think
they might be interested in and it'll be
available starting today also apple
announced iphone OS 3.1 which is going
to have app store genius capability so
it'll tell you sort of a list of apps
that you might like based on what you've
downloaded and bought I'm you know I'm
not so sure that I'm going to go run out
and download a free point run one right
away it seems like that's the only real
edition is the genius playlist if that's
important to you go ahead and get
downloading that would be available
today as well that was a recap of the
event sort of all the rumors that were
building up to it and in true form
turned out to be just rumors really
didn't get most of what no the press was
expecting so you know I guess that's par
for the course was a little bit of a
boring keynote wasn't anything that was
a very wow inspiring a lot of price
drops which is great and two new
features to existing hardware anyway
