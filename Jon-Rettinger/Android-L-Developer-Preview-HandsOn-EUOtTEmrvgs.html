from technobuffalo and yes I am the new
one here and if you haven't seen my
intro video check out the link down
below to see that this is my first
official video for TechnoBuffalo and I'm
excited to show you this this is the
nexus 7 running the new Android L
operating system that was unveiled at
Google i/o 2014 and we're here to show
you a quick overview of the developers
preview of the Android L running on the
Nexus 7 android l is a big update for
google and it's set to hit consumer
handset tus fall during the company's
i/o keynote this week Google detailed
many of the releases big feature what's
most intriguing to us is how the
software it looks or as Google is
calling it material design the new
approach is something that will be
present across all Google properties
going forward including the web mobile
and even TVs and it looks beautiful
designed to be a more consistent
approach across multiple form factors
google described material designed to be
something that uses bolder graphics more
fluid motion more tactile surfaces all
combining to create an even more
intuitive experience this is something
that will not only be present across the
deepest part of android l but also in
apps from developers which is why the
Developer Preview is already available
on the home screen you can already see
there are new software buttons a
triangle circle and square it's these
little flourishes along with the use of
surface and shadow that will allow
google and other developers establish a
physical structure this approach helps
explain what can be touched and what can
move with an Android L in a Developer
Preview we played what you already
notice some of the big changes things
like the notifications which now shows
up in a beautiful card style similar to
Google now the notifications are also
active too you can either swipe to
dismiss them or swipe down to interact
and reply it's a useful addition we
can't wait to see how it works in the
long term since we're running a preview
on a tablet we couldn't really see stuff
like the new dollar in action but we
were able to see how material design
would change something like the
calculator there you really get a good
look at the right colors geometric
shapes and shadows used to indicate what
and where the software can be touched
everything you touch animates to and it
looks very very beautiful elsewhere
google is also making changes to
multitasking which is not laid out in a
kind of rolodex here you not only see
your most recent app but also tabs open
and chrome though that's not president
just yet in this current Developer
Preview the layout is pretty simple to
use and you can easily swipe them away
like in previous versions Android L is
still early in development and doesn't
even have a proper name yet which means
it's not quite press
across the entire operating system but
from what we've seen so far we're really
enjoying where the OS is heading and
can't wait to see the material design
implemented even deeper into the
experience thank you guys for watching
if you haven't yet please subscribe
would be the first one to know and every
upload new content we've got new stuff
coming every single day we want to make
sure you see what's new in the world of
consumer electronics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
