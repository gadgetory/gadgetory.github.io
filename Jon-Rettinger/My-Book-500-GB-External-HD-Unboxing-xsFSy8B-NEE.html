requests to unbox my new external hard
drive to my book especially user moose
hair 999 subscriber mind where you want
to see it so I'm gonna do it but bear
with me I didn't want to set up my
camera and stuff so I'm just gonna try
it with you guys like see how it works
might not be the best fit give it a
whirl anyway like I showed you earlier
this is the my book I bought it from
Costco which for those of you that don't
know it's a warehouse saw are they
something involved or large purchases
and they happen to have this my book
drive 500 gigabytes with USB 2.0 and
firewire 400 and it was a 149 us that
was a pretty good deal for 500 gigs of
storage gonna be perfect for a time
machine reason that I got it so let's go
ahead and unbox it bad boy
cut it out of the plastic I think if you
buy it from somewhere other than copper
won't won't come in this giant sorry
that was a little all right here it is
my book says stuff that's included but I
guess we'll see it so I won't go and
read it for you a compatibility windows
vista XP 2000 Mac OS 10 0.3 or higher
500 gigabytes they're saying you can
store up to 140 mm photos 38 hours and
movies for 125,000 songs which is
actually pretty impressive let's go
ahead open this bad boy up it's pretty
decent size so unlike my 160 little
passport Drive this one looks like it
has a power supply but we'll go through
everything here so
packaging actually not that actually not
that big a figure it that stuff on I'll
give you guys a minute
it's always fun to open up new things
here
alright so this
this is it not terribly big is it the
front of it looks like that's the power
button that goes in on the back it's
like there's power USB and two firewire
cables I'm on the way to firewire cables
I don't know why there would be two but
you know there are again there's the USB
and to firewire it's like there's a lock
there - and power thick it is let me
show you guys something I'm sure you're
all familiar with the iPhone you get
comparison alongside for thickness look
too small it's not giant though either
then I can sit it right behind my
macbook pro and I'll probably never even
notice it see what else it came with
here tar brick wasn't that big it's
almost like a cell phone power but with
a that's have a connection now nothing
proprietary or not but there it is a
u.s. be cable standard USB cable and
they gave you a they give me a FireWire
400 cable which is nice so I don't have
to use another one alright guys that's
it my book 500 also known as my time
machine drive 500 gig should be the last
hard drive I need to buy it for a while
I'm assuming anyway guys thanks for
watching any questions about the hard
drive let me know thanks for watching
thanks for subscribing and tomorrow is a
leopard day and barring them selling out
I guarantee I'll have a copy tomorrow
I'll unbox it for you guys I don't want
to see it actually I kind of want to see
it too so I've been in boxing for you
and review a little while later anyway
guys for a walkthrough of leopard check
out Apple comm they've got a couple
minute video on that shows all the cool
features I'm excited I know you guys
have brought our excited I'm gonna
figure out getting it tomorrow but you
certainly get it within a week or so and
we've all waited long enough as a quick
heads-up don't answer questions
some people were wondering if computers
that they bought tomorrow or that you
could install with leopard they're not
the answer is no they're enough to be
pre-installed with leopard you if you
can send it in send in a coupon it they
could pay 10 bucks for shipping and
we'll send you a free copy you got to
wait a couple weeks for those computers
to get out so I recommend waiting they
may send out some updated Mac books with
leopard and maybe a macbook slim and who
knows but if you waited this long listen
a couple weeks all right guys thanks for
watching thanks for subscribing and I'll
talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
