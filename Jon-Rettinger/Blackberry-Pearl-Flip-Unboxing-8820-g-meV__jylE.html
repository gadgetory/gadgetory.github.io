the good stuff
we got the FedEx box here sent from the
PR firm gonna open it up and see what
they included a lot of tabs to get
through here camera over alright see
what's inside so there is the key mobile
box port and looks like some public
relations material nothing terribly
exciting there ever so let's go ahead
and see what's in the box here so it's
got a picture of it on the front the
blackberry pearl flip I use a blackberry
pearl before I got my first iPhone I
loved it I've always been a big fan of
blackberry and I think the flip phone is
a great form factor for it so I'm very
curious to use it so picture of it there
picture the clothes on the side device
on the back with some of the cool stuff
it does calling fun information and
messaging it's got Wi-Fi my faves it's
not 3G it's running on edge and what's
inside the box but we'll see what's
inside the box and that's about it
open it up information blackberry pearl
88 20 tips and tricks getting started
having fun being a guy I'll probably
never look at that install CDs something
in Spanish Terms &amp;amp; Conditions and here
is a device itself go ahead I'll put
that off to the side for just a minute
but what
second let's see what else we got inside
it's like they included a charger that
looks like it's microUSB they want at
this time so a microUSB to USB place
it's not toys if I carry 3.5 millimeter
headphones of course a wall charger kick
all that aside let's take a look at the
phone itself here's the BlackBerry pro
flip let me just zoom in a little bit
now that we've gone high-def hopefully
you guys can see this stuff a little bit
better I'll do a full review and
comparison for you but let me do my
obligatory size comparisons here here is
the iPhone 3G just a hair smaller about
that much certainly their thickness wise
definitely a little bit thicker but not
by much
blue zone that off here's the BlackBerry
pro flip let's take a quick look at it
so it does have an external screen right
here although you can't see it cuz the
phone is off but does have a pearl
esque keyboard right there which is kind
of nice let's see how that looks the
type on its impaired to be that bad it
does have the recessed trackball which
is very interesting let's go ahead and
boot this sucker up for up for the first
time and let's see if it's got a chart
and see how it looks so if you hold down
the power button right there it's
actually unstable so when you have it
open up it's not not solid it kind of
rocks around a little bit the setup
wizard
alright let's see what this has to say
continued United States well connect to
Wi-Fi blah blah blah we can set all this
stuff later and had to use the phone
alright I get the setup wizard
alright so that was it look like it was
already on very quick boot up and there
is the external screen which actually
looks to be pretty nice it'll show you
messages
which everyone think I have one of
there's a voicemail on this SIM card
account it says your battery indicator
your edge and your signal strength and
the analog clock I seen you can change
that to digital it does have a camera I
don't know if the resolution is I'll go
through all that in my review but it's
got a nice feel to it I'll definitely
give it that and very easy to open and
feels pretty solid and secure in the
hand but again I'll reserve judgment
until I review it looks like it's got a
3.5 millimeter headset jack there your
micro USB port like a programmable soft
key right there microphone volume toggle
up and down and a soft key on top looks
like that's about it but don't we has a
real nice feel to it and looks nice so
we'll run through this a little bit
later and play around of it
tell me guys John rhett injure John for
Lakers comm with an unboxing of the
blackberry pearl flip 8820 hope you guys
