technobuffalo here I get a lot of
questions over Twitter and oftentimes
topics overlap so this afternoon which
is Friday februari 26 I send out a
message saying ask me whatever Twitter
questions you have and I will inch them
in a video which is exactly what I'm
doing topics range from personal tech to
really a little bit of in between so I
picked really the 13 most common
questions I'm going to go ahead and
answer them live in this video the
personal stuff I generally leave for my
other channel inside John's mind but
sometimes it's fun to sort of give you
guys a little bit of an insight about my
personal life so let's go ahead and get
started if you see me look to the size i
got the questions in front of me we're
going to start with the first question
from Twitter user k Joseph and John for
lakers what video editing software do
you like to use you like to use any
effects near videos like crossfade and
dissolve whoa k Joseph primarily I do my
video editing in imovie although I have
final cut express that use occasionally
wanting to do some pretty more finite
week since or bigger editing generally i
do a little bit of fading you can see in
my videos from the introduction to the
start of the video it's been of a cubic
back it just a standards for a
drag-and-drop transition sometimes i'll
do some overlays with videos what I do
of comparison showing two cameras for
example I use I'm blue flats bit of a
pain I'm doing two video cameras i
actually got to take a black image put
it into the screen then export the video
then take the first sample video and put
that on top of the black image and i got
to export that again and then put the
other video next would export that again
so i am sort of trying to learn how to
use final cut express a bit more
hopefully transition over Q final cut
pro in the very near future hope that
answered your questions a bit of a
long-winded answer alright let's go
ahead and go to the next one this is
from Park se PA RK e sy why John what
are you moving into your new house or
throws you that do follow up inside
John's mind you may know that I am in
the process of
my first home for myself and my
soon-to-be wife in August escrow is
scheduled to close sometime in June but
you never know what could happen you can
fall out of escrow org things might not
come through with the loan you just
don't know if everything goes according
to plan which I'm really hoping for
fingers crossed I'm not flicking you off
I'm hoping for some time in June so i'll
be in the house found two months before
we get married in august alright next
question goes to do that 133 dget 133
John you think I should get the 3gs now
or wait for the upgrade if you need a
phone and now if you have to have a
phone yours is broken or busted then get
it if you have a phone that works you
can wait until june or july timeframe
definitely wait because if a new one
comes out you're gonna kick yourself
when it's got front facing camera slide
out keyboard can transform and make you
a sandwich you're really going to miss
out all those sort of cool features so
unless you have to have a phone right
now i would recommend you wait going to
the next question your Apple kid John
when and why did you start making
tech-related youtube videos I think it's
been probably now going on two and a
half three years I started making videos
not because I expected to get me sort of
following or I didn't thought amy was
gonna watch we just actually helped me
learn about my new computer I was a pc
user and i bought my first mac it was a
15-inch macbook pro that some of you
guys may have seen me unbox and i
figured the best way for me to learn how
to use it would be to make videos that
can force me to learn sometimes you know
like you get a bit lazy about learning
how to use new things and their computer
it's something that was that better
purchase for me i want to make sure
everything knew I was getting into and I
made a few videos and you can see in
their early videos I was extremely
nervous I'm still nervous never I film
but I can hide it a bit better that's
art how it started it really weren't
that many tech reviewers out there at
the time and I think it was mostly just
luck so hope to help answer your
question go to the next one peak total
action John you can jailbreak your
iphone if so why I jailbroke my first
generation iphone and i have not
jailbroken
my 3g or 3gs I've thought about it quite
a bit but being a tech review or AB
sometimes as you guys know it sometimes
criticized before I compare a lot of the
phones i get to the iphone is sort of
the standard for the mobile industry and
I want to keep sort of the phone as
virgin if you will as possible so people
can see what they would get with an
out-of-the-box iphone comparison if I
starting to jailbreaking wouldn't be the
fairest comparisons a lot of people
don't jailbreak their phones I know a
lot of you guys out there do but the
majority people that watch the videos
don't so if I ever get my hands on
another iphone 3gs I will certainly
jailbreak into its new series of videos
that cover that but for the time being I
leave my phone on jailbroken which I
know let's be miss out on a lot of
really cool features let's go ahead and
go to the next one this is from Mitchell
it's m17 CH three ll John you enjoy your
job is ever get boring up where you
always occupied um well my job for those
you guys that might be wondering about
going on six months ago despite the
economy i left my job i was running a
marketing department for a software
development firm and i left to focus on
development of technobuffalo and attack
reviewing full-time so in my opinion I
think I've got the best job in the world
it's a dream job one that I feel really
lucky in them and very blessed to have
so no I love my job but it never gets
boring i get a plate guidance all day
when i was younger in college or high
school I go with my friend we just walk
around best buy for fun fact that now
it's forget to do that for a living is
is unbelievable snow it does not ever
ever get for let's go ahead and go to
the next one this is from Adrian wall
what was your childhood like where did
you grow up how are you in high school
my fountain was very good i grew up in
Southern California about 25 minutes or
so from where I live right now so pretty
close in high school I played a few
sports I played the tennis you're
looking at a third-string quarterback
proudly I did throw a one touchdown pass
and took to sex and I wrestled my
freshman year
of high school so I was definitely into
sports I was not the nerdy guy getting
wedgies like you guys may expect oh you
know probably was a bit of a nerd high
school is an odd time and everybody's
awkward can't figure out who you are I
didn't really know who I was or what I
was going to be but I had a pretty
normal childhood um yeah I wasn't the
most popular guy wasn't the least
popular guy I had a group of friends and
you know it was a good experience I
don't look back in high school with a
negative negative late I'll i remember
at the time thinking that sometimes
things were rough but you know looking
back it was a pretty enjoyable for years
moving on we've got 92 Apple fan John
what point should i apply for a youtube
partnership this that question that I
get quite a bit it's hard one to answer
goods totally subjective Google doesn't
have assets or guidelines saying okay
you'll be a partner when you have X
number of videos x ember subscribers in
X number of video views it's really just
kind of up in the air I know that
they've tightened down a lot on who
they're accepting for partners some
people are getting in with you know just
couple hundred subscribers summer not
getting in with thousands it really
depends what I've generally said is I
would wait until you have at least I'd
say two to three thousand subscribers
and show you're producing regular video
content you know that's two to three
pieces of content per week youtube I
think likes to like to see that again
it's no guarantee that you're going to
get into the partner program and the
other is just my recommendations and
make sure any videos you have on your
channel don't have any copy written
materials don't have any music in there
or you know video game footage or
anything like that that maybe you know
considered copyright otherwise your most
assuredly not going to get into the
partner program if you do those videos
will be immediately removed and that's
right no fun for anybody next question
wee man oh aight John have you been
following the Olympics at all if so what
are your favorite sports it's hard to
watch our winter olympics at least
desert of a sports guy and not look at
all those guys and girls that do the
skeleton potentially they do the bobsled
run but just one person headfirst
straight down
and that is just a unbelievably
impressive feat of balls to be able to
do that I've been watching the skeleton
the bobsled and luge I like watching
toward the aerial skiing to you and it
jump up and do the flips and stuff it's
kind of who have also been watching some
of the snowboarding I've got a
peripheral contactor to one of the
athletes in the Olympics so see if you
can follow follow me here my sister's
husband okay my sister's husband his
brother girlfriend or fiancee her
brother is Seth Wescott who won the gold
medal for us snowboard cross and a few
snowboarding things so I've sort of have
a bit of a connection to Olympic songs
from they've been following him quite a
bit so if you can follow that again my
sister's husband his brother his
brother's fiancee or a girlfriend animal
dear her brother is Seth Wescott so sort
of been been watching that sort of
watching him quite a bit and yeah it's
hard not to root for us hockey um you
know has always fun so hope we had
helped answer your questions all right
next Tom of action John what is tech
above low powered by host template or
other techno buff so technobuffalo it's
not a sort of a template that we pulled
from boot theme something like that
we're one of the more advanced
implementations of WordPress or
WordPress and multiple user WordPress
envy you you may have heard we've got a
custom theme that we had built based on
a design images from graphic designer
and built by programmers hosting we're
hosting by a media temple we're running
on one of their nitro servers when we've
launched may remember we had a bit of a
botched launch tried to launch in
September I wind up going live in
November but initially when we did go
live in November we're running on to
nitro servers right now we've got things
for a streamlined a bit so hopefully
that helped enter your question and next
we go to Gilly Cador Gilly kid GI ella y
ki d 1 what happened to the
no you were going to make after speaking
to the dell reps regarding customer
service and that is a really good
question be honest that video just sort
of things that coming up coming up with
time I remember to do it was sort of
past the point but i will give you guys
a bit of a recap that would happen with
dell i tried to order a monitor from
them the short story was I word the
wrong one who's late at night is my
fault I wanted to return the monetary
before it got shipped and I just had an
awful customer service experience I got
transferred to transfer it transfer than
they were human rude and told me that I
didn't want to return to moderate she's
ready to turn the monitor so I did video
talking about i figured if this happened
to me it probably happened to you as
well and i was contacted by dallas
customer service and invited to sort of
recap and share my experience with some
del executives and I certainly did and
Della sure to me that they were taking
steps to improve customer service and
that they took all this sort of action
with everybody I can pick a bit of
umbrage with because I I was obvious to
me that I was getting sort of attention
because I have a bit of an audience on
YouTube if I was just a general consumer
my complaints would have fallen on deaf
ears so you know I definitely
communicated that I still remain not
extremely satisfied with dolls customer
service I have taken steps to improve it
they've got a twitter feed with a lot of
active people on there that can help
improve it I think dell does make some
very good products what i buy them all
on my own i don't know i know a lot of
you guys out there by Del so I have
continued to review del products I know
it's a lot of what you guys are
interested in so hopefully that helps I
answer your question moving right along
we've got star developer if you
completely abandoned your iPhone a favor
the next is one I have not although hope
the nexus one was on 18 Thea's network I
would definitely consider it I'm using
the nexus one for for a while but the
edge speeds on 18 feet which is my
primary carrier our killer so the iphone
is still my daily driver next we've got
a question from mr. Logan cook John what
do you dislike most about the current
tech review industry Logan that is a
good question i'll tell you what i like
a name dislike there is a very low
your denture you being a tech reviewer
that's not the good and bad thing all
you need to be a tech reviewer is a
webcam and an internet connection and
that's about it when i started going to
technology reviews it weren't that many
people that were doing it you know there
was Chris Pirillo and leo laporte and a
few other guys but yeah it's just three
years ago they really weren't that many
and now there's hundreds if not
thousands of reviewers out there a lot
of people are getting into it just to
try and get free products I think being
a impartial tech reviewer you should
never get free products that is
certainly going to impact your judgment
and impair your review of you like it or
not certainly getting products to review
or one thing but getting products to
keep I think are very different sort of
walk a very fine line you know a moral
issue some people are okay with that
some people are not although now they do
you have to say whether product was
given to you or that review unit which
I'm very happy with even in my early
reviews I always said it was sent by
whatever company is PR I want to be very
fun think it's important to keep up
certain degree of integrity in your
videos and reviews certainly personal
opinions are balanced to seep out and I
trying to keep those at bay but what I
dislike most are probably the people
that are very very openly bias and let
those biases sort of permeate the
reviews I'm an apple fan I prefer the
iphone as my platform today but I've
gone on record many time to say I think
it's been boring and I see the pros of
other platforms as well so it's heard an
example of ways that I tried to keep my
biases at bay but being a person it's
just found to happen no one out there is
truly impartial so let's go ahead and go
to actually that was the last question
Logan you weren't the last question this
what turned out to be a very long video
if you guys like this series I'll
continue it you know every week or two
weeks i'll put out the post i think i
ask a questions on twitter and i will
make a video in the meantime if you do
you want some more you watch this far I
want to get to know me a bit more
personally and intimately I check out my
other channel inside John mine will be a
link to it in the sidebar and
one of these directions and of course
for all your tech news be sure to check
out technobuffalo alright guys i'm jon
rettinger and i will see you in next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
