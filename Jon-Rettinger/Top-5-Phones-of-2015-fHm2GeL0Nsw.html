to you by Harris as 2015 comes to an end
we reviewed over a hundred phones this
year I'm John written jur from
TechnoBuffalo and these are my top five
phones that we took a look at in 2015
coming in at number five the Moto X pure
Motorola stepped up their game huge with
this gens Moto X while keeping
everything that made the original great
the 5.7 inch screens now qHD the one
super weak camera now packs an
incredibly solid 21 megapixel sensor the
awesome gesture controls ambient
displays are still there it's got a
micro SD card slot solid battery life
and quick charging it also works on
every single carrier here in the u.s.
not to mention a competitive price
points and modem acres so you can make
it looked at with you one number for the
iPhone 6s and 6s plus Apple spent this
generation focusing on improving
Hardware and less on the design as it's
pretty typical for the S iterations with
more RAM faster processor stellar
battery life better camera and 3d touch
this gens iPhone simply improve the
experience from 6 in almost every facet
number three the blackberry print I love
an underdog story and the Prive is the
rocky at 2015 blackberry shipped Android
was a long time coming they delivered in
fantastic fashion with an almost stock
Android experience coupled with
blackberry security slight OS
improvements curved edges a killer
on-screen keyboard which you should
definitely try it you haven't a full
slide out physical cube where it doubles
as a trackpad the prim might just put
blackberry back on the map number two
the galaxy s6 edge+ for me this is
hands-down the best looking phone of the
year especially I'll done up all
prettying gold
sure the curved screen was of
questionable utility but for a combo of
looks and killer specs the s6 edge+ is
really hard to beat Samsung still makes
the best screens TouchWiz was done with
the Wii lighter touch and ever before
and with Samsung pay working on almost
every terminal out there this beauty
queen is a phone to be reckoned with
also mentioned in the same family trees
a sailor note 5 those is a little bit
and it looks apartment but adds S Pen
functionality and drumroll please my
number one
of 2015 Nexus 6p if you ask me last year
or any other year if I thought a huawei
built device and makes my number one on
the list I'd say a resounding Hales no
but fall weighing Google absolutely
delivered here the 6p is a perfect combo
of form and function it's thin packed
the latest Android has to offer has a
beautiful screen great camera the
fingerprint sensor on the back is
definitely a little bit weird but it
works take some getting used to though
with a competitive price point killer
spec sheet 6p is the phone to beat just
don't try and bend it with all your
might so me what do you guys think lefty
your thoughts on it if we extended the
list into some honorable mention we
would have added the Nexus 5x and the LG
v10 on here as well but is your top 5
match ours leaving the comments down
below
I would love to hear all your thoughts
and opinions anyway thank you guys for
watching but I was about 14 I shaved my
face for the first time and if you've
ever shaved any part of your body and
shaved against the grain that hurts
