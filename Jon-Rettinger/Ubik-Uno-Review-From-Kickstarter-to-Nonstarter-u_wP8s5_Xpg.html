you are a Kickstarter phone at all but
whether or not you are the best I'm our
first Center we're TechnoBuffalo and
this is the Ubik oh no the Yuba guna was
reviewed over a period of seven days the
team who sent it over the Ubik team
obviously they made it very clear that
what we're using is a pre-production
sample it is hand-built and it is not
totally representative of the completed
product any hardware issues that we see
here are supposed to be resolved by the
time the production split spins up but I
just wanted to let you guys know this is
indeed a hand-built pre pro Divine's the
Yuba Kuno is in an interesting device
the the team behind it has a ton of
experience working at major OEM so this
definitely isn't their first rodeo
the device has a distinct look to it
with its kind of non-existent bezels on
the side and a kind of a taller form
factor but feel sturdy enough in the
hand and it does feel a little bit
premium with its metal frame and
chamfered edges on both sides the back
is a plastic non removable panel with a
radial texture on it that gives it some
kind of nice grip you can kind of hear
it there too I wouldn't use the word
nice to describe how the phone actually
feels in the hand but it doesn't feel
bad either
it's very utilitarian feels very sharp
the corners are kind of tough it I don't
know something about it just feels a
little bit blocky all right let's talk
about some specs inside this thing we're
looking at a mediatek processor we'll
talk more about that in a little while
but in the meantime it's an octa-core MT
6 7 9 5 o'clock - 2.2 gigahertz with 3
gigs of RAM
a 20 megapixel Sony camera with 6
different lenses on the inside and 16
gigs of on-board storage that of course
is expandable by that 64 gig slot on the
side the rest of the hardware is just
kind of there the buttons on the side
are identical and they're difficult to
tell apart when you're looking at them
though when you're holding it it's not
that big of a deal the U logo on the
chin seems like it ought to be a button
but it's not the speakers are on the
back and they get kind of tinny at
higher volumes but there's
serviceable otherwise and here on the
left side is where you're gonna find
your SIM slot on the bottom along with
your micro SD slot on the top the 5.5
inch display is strong it's got decent
color reproduction the color temperature
is a little bit off for me and I wish
the colors were a little bit more
saturated but the blacks are rich and
the sharpness is about where you would
expect it to be at 400 dpi where it does
take a bit of a dip is the
responsiveness of the touch panel it
definitely feels like the touch panel
here is subpar and I haven't felt that
way in a pretty long time when it comes
to mobile devices check out this
comparison that I did between the galaxy
note 5 the newest latest and greatest
and the Ubik you know you can see that
we don't have a pretty hard time
maintaining a consistent touch response
and it really does come through on the
day to day one of the other marquee
features of the uno is the camera and on
paper this Sony sensor is packing quite
a wallop it should snap some of the best
photos you can get on a mobile device
but in practice it really does still
need a lot of work the camera is totally
unable to focus on anything close up
period end of story whether you're an
Instagram the actual camera app on the
phone or the Google camera app the 120
frames per second video doesn't quite
work just yet
either and it really just results in a
choppy melee of visual and audio the
software on the camera side though is
totally easy enough to use and it does
offer a lot of options for those of you
who want them mediatek gets a really bad
rap in these parts of the world due in
part to their refusal to kind of share
the source code which means that custom
roms and third-party patches aren't
something that you should expect to see
on the uno this is really kind of
unfortunate because I do think that
media types doing some good work they're
focusing on multi-core and intelligent
cluster management and it really kind of
shows especially on this little thing
the work of heterogeneous
multi-processing is the same kind of
text that Samsung is working towards
with their Exynos chip sets so if you
feel one way about Samsung and you use
the Exynos chip sets anyway you should
be not really all that upset about using
a mediatek processor performance in my
experience was pretty
aside from the obvious issue of touch
panel on responsiveness the UNA was
always ready for me to throw something
at it the benchmarks don't look great
compared to similarly costed cohorts but
I never had any issues with performance
animations were smooth after were
responsive there were spots where other
devices would lag especially other ones
that I've used that I didn't experience
here that you know just didn't bat an
eyelash at any of that stuff I've never
used a mediatek processor before but I'm
actually really pleasantly surprised
with the quality that I brought to the
table on the uno the software here is
also totally inoffensive it's mostly
stock Android with a few handful of
small tweaks there are some nice
additions like tapped awake and some
gestures when the device is asleep but
everything else is entirely stock and
that's a good thing stock Android is
probably one of the reasons why this
thing feels like it runs so smoothly the
battery life was totally fine not crazy
good but I didn't have any issues with
it though this is probably because I was
unable to get any SIM cards working on
LTE bands here in California so
hopefully that's something that they get
resolved before they hit production as I
said these are hand assembled devices as
far as value devices go we're about to
start seeing some seriously heavy
hitters in the arena and if you want to
win you've got to bring your A game
the uno just doesn't seem to do anything
that other manufacturers aren't doing
and it's second iteration
Rubick is gonna be counting on the
community to let them know what features
to support and what the design of the
device should be like but for now it's
kind of just another bunch of device
unfortunately it's not a bad phone I'm
just not sure it's doing enough to make
a name for itself right handle the UVic
comes in at 320 dollars USD which is
certainly at the lower end of the value
device range but I'm struggling to see
anything special about it beyond the
totally reasonable price I'm really
hoping that next year's entry from Ubik
which will have been fueled by the Ubik
community is a little bit more
forward-thinking even though this isn't
the phone I'd be rushing out to get I
think it's so so good for the industry
that it exists there you have it folks
my thoughts on these successfully
kick-started
Ubik uno have any of you guys backed it
or any other kick-started devices is
this thing the you know
have to capture your attention let me
know in the comments what you think and
of course you can whack that like button
on the way down of course you can also
subscribe if you're interested in our
upcoming six-hour sassy seminar for very
sassy folks otherwise thank you all so
much for watching be kind to one another
and I will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
