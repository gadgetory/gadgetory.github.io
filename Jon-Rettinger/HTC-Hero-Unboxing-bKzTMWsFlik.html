from technobuffalo here with an unboxing
for you that I'm really excited about
this is the HTC hero it's the unlocked
version since this has not been picked
up by any carrier in the US this is
running a new version of Android with a
skin on top of it called sense UI that
was developed by HTC it started the next
step in a cover flow like you may have
seen in some windows mobile devices so
I'm really excited to unbox this and
give it a whirl as I mentioned this is
not released yet there are rumors that
it may be coming to US carriers but as
of yet nothing has been announced so
let's go ahead and dig in fresh off the
DHL truck go ahead use the big ol knife
to dig into the package and of course
cut away from me I always get people
talking about my cutting style I'll
always I'll make sure I cut away from me
so there you big on the package here
you've got another package some material
on top oh you doing nothing exciting
there here is the good stuff go ahead
and dig in I should mention that this
does not have us 3g bands so it will
only be running on edge in the US
unfortunately but it does have Wi-Fi
nothing in the bag they're just wrapped
in some bubble wrap
here we have the HTC hero in a very
small box it's a very nice high-quality
looking box it's a little bit thin but
long I've got a picture of the device on
the front on the side you've got a
picture of a whole bunch of apps on the
back you've got your list specs will go
over in just a moment picture your
little android guy peeking out from the
side and back to the front if you're
curious how big the boxes here it is
next to the iphone 3gs box can see it's
a little bit bigger and definitely
longer go ahead and push that off to the
side so here are some specs on the
device it is running the Qualcomm 528
mega her processor believe that the same
one that's found in the touch pro 2 it's
running android of course 512 megabytes
of rom 288 megabytes of ram dimensions
it is 112 by 56.2 by 14.3 five
millimeters weighs 135 grams since this
is a UK phone ways it's got wcdma 920
100 which unfortunately won't work in
the US it's got GPS it's got Wi-Fi it's
got a five megapixel camera with
autofocus got a 1350 milliamp hour
battery and the rest of that stuff so
let's go ahead and open it up some real
excited to see what how what we got in
here let's see how this opens up like
that just slides off got a real nice
sort of heavy-duty cardboard definitely
feel like it would protect the phone and
here's the phone itself HTC innovation
it's nice to see HTC do a high quality
unboxing usually they just put a
cardboard try in there and throw all the
accessories and nice to see that they're
stepping up their game which with one of
their probably flagship phones so there
is the phone itself nothing behind it
push that off to the side for just a
minute and see what else comes in the
box welcome to HTC HTC care probably
some warranty information and some
accessory stuff nothing that exciting so
here's what comes in the box you've got
name the charger of some sort USB 2 it
looks like mini USB what's actually an
HTC proprietary port but it will work
with standard mini USB as well just to
charge your computer we've got a pair of
stereo headphones with a microphone for
driving whatever you want we've got a
looks like a UK wall plug that's not
going to be so helpful to me but that's
what it looks like here is the wall
charger it's actually a very thin wall
charger this piece just plugs right in I
will have to get a u.s. one and also
comes with a microSD card of size 2 gigs
that was nice them to include that all
right push all that stuff aside and
let's look at the big thing while we're
all here the HTC hero then pull it up
well it's lot smaller than I thought it
was going to be it'll pull off the
plastic it's always a very satisfying
thing to do and push that down and on
first glance does feel to be very nice a
build quality seems high it definitely
has that Android chin it's the Jay Leno
of smartphones but it should be nice can
hold it up to your head this will sort
of curve in towards your mouth for
better microphone fidelity it's sort of
a soft plastic but it's a Teflon coating
so it feels not soft touch doesn't feel
like it's going to slide out of your
hand on will do a full hard word torque
but you guys can sort of see quickly
what's on the device you've got send key
a home button menu key and end button
look you gotta search button the back
and of course your trackpad and there is
your 5 megapixel sensor on the back
again I'll do a full hardware walk
through this and I should definitely
thank the folks where this phone came
from at clove which you can
find a clove co uk i'll put a link in
the sidebar in case you want to check
those folks out there really fantastic
anyway I definitely stay tuned for a lot
of HTC hero news there's going to be
quite a bit on the channel about this I
think it's a very hype device people are
really excited about so I'm looking
forward to reviewing it and sharing my
thoughts hope you guys enjoy for
