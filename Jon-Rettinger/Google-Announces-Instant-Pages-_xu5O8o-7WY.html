opportunity from the DC area I'm a big
fan of the washington post so i go to
google type my search a scan of the
result i want i click and I wait even on
this really fast internet connection it
takes time to text and images alone
until now let's just bend the fact of
life but now let me show you instant
pages what I have here is two identical
versions of google chrome running side
by side the one on the left has instant
pages dis a brawl hall the one on the
right has instant pages enabled now i
also have an extension install the home
near my actions from one browser to the
other if you want though so you'll see
there is a slight bit of lab but because
i'm controlling the browser them left
will actually be giving old google a
head start I'll also go ahead and clear
my cache from both browsers just to show
that I don't have anything free cash so
let's go ahead and do that same search
before that's the first thing you notice
is that there really is anything to
notice search results page looks exactly
the same but the difference will come
when I click and what you'll see is that
the browser on the right will load the
page much more quickly than the browser
on the left done
as you can see the browser on the right
with instant pages loads the page
practically consumed there's no it's not
waiting for text or images to download
they're just there at the bottom of the
page we have a small-timer installed
that shows how long it takes for the
page load event to fire now you can see
on the left that takes about three and a
half seconds on this very fast
connection for the that page to load
whereas on the right with instant pages
it was effectively instant instant pages
is enabled by dupree rendering
technology in chrome being intelligently
triggered by google web search we're
very confident that we know what we lo
are going to want but of course instant
pages doesn't just work with new sites
as an example I'm going back home to DC
later this summer june thirtieth and
while i'm there i want to see if one of
my favorite summer done activities
folklife festival we're running so I'll
do my search do you see full light
festival oh yes smithsonian folklife
festival it's the result of expressed to
me done and again and again with instant
pages it loads effectively instantly in
fact it was so fast that if i betray
quickly i could have answered my query
but yes it is going to be running june
thirtieth planning before the other
browser had even loaded the page i've
also heard that there's a great new
museum called the spy museum that
friends tell me i should visit when i'm
home that's something i think yeah so
i'm going to go ahead and research that
see if it's worth visiting so what I
have here is what I have here is results
that show on a map where the spy museum
is but of course what I want to learn
more directly from the source so I'll
click on your site done
and again when this engages its
effectively instant and took whereas it
took about four seconds with instant
pages in fact it was so fast as i can
start exploring the site browsing
learning more about the museum before
the other browser limited but of course
it's DC it's a summertime and it's going
to be hot i'm sure by the end of the day
I'm really going to want a cold treat
luckily I know the best place it's
called the dairy godmother one of my
favorite places in my hometown they're
amazing frozen custard and each day they
have a different flavor I suspect I it
makes my mind NBC deaths it's great so
what I'm going to do is search for dairy
godmother player of the day to see which
results I have put forward and so that's
later the day forecast that sounds about
right done
and you can see that in this case is the
patient little instantly took a little
while to load but even with that with
instant pages that it was about four
seconds faster and again I can answer my
question Swiss chocolate almonds the
flavor i put forward to before the other
page even move it so that in a nutshell
if its opinion thank you Alex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
