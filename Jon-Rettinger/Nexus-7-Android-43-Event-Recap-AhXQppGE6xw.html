technobuffalo and this is my recap of
the google nexus 7 event so Google just
finished up with their press conference
event today and they officially
announced the new Nexus 7 it has the
same 7 inch screen size as the original
Nexus 7 but a smaller bezel around the
edges it's almost two millimeters
thinner and 50 grams lighter and it has
a new black on black design with a few
glossy accents around the camera it's
back in an HD 1920 x 1200 screen with
323 PPI google calls this the highest
resolution 7-inch tablet on the market
the screen also has a 30-percent wider
range of colors it will have a front
facing camera at one point 2 megapixels
and a rear camera at five megapixels
with the new 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon 34
pro processor it is eighty percent
faster than the old Nexus 7 but even
with the faster speeds google says it
will still have up to nine hours of
battery life watching HD video and up to
10 hours of Wi-Fi browsing this will
also be the first Android device to ship
with Android 4.3 pre-installed upgraded
with two gigabytes of ram dual band
Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 dual stereo speakers
and 4G LTE it will work with AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile and Verizon Wireless when it
ships it will be available for purchase
on July thirtieth next up Google talked
a little about Android 4.3 not to bigger
an update but it does have some
improvements over for point-to-point to
such as a new low-energy Bluetooth and
the upgraded graphics with opengl es 3.0
for gaming they also have a new app
called google play games it's basically
the same idea is Game Center for the
iPhone you'll be able to challenge
friends different games and see what
scores they have on those as well
android 4.3 will be available today as
an over-the-air update for the nexus 7
Nexus 4 Nexus 10 and the Galaxy Nexus it
will be available for other devices in
the future so like I said before you
cannot get the nexus 7 until July
thirtieth but if you want to get a
device right now you can actually
pre-order Google's new thing called
chromecast chromecast is basically
Google's version of the Apple TV or the
Roku it's a tiny device that you plug
into HDMI port on your TV which allow
you to stream youtube netflix and vimeo
videos as well as mirror your google
chrome
page from your laptop or phone straight
