you've got John's opinion on the iPhone
event and now it's my turn
here's what I think of Apple's newest
smartphones
well apples had their big Tino and Tim
Cook echo showed off not one but two new
iPhones the 5s and the 5c though some
pretty interesting watching the reaction
so devices online while some people
absolutely find these two phones boring
by Apple standards and others are really
excited about the new technology in
colors well first before I get started I
want to talk really quickly about
something Steve Jobs said back when the
original iPhone was released he said
that Apple was five years ahead of the
competition and I think that statement
was absolutely right the original iPhone
launched in 2007 and now six years later
every major smartphone OS has an equally
powerful and capable flagship at this
point in the game hardware and features
are pretty iterative across the board
for all of the OSS and there isn't
really anything at this time that to me
is considered innovative I actually
think that as a tech community we love
the throw that word around a little bit
too much and may have diluted the true
meaning of the word innovation but
that's a rant for another day the point
I'm making is smartphone press events
are starting to be kind of humdrum and
the reason why is because it's a lot
like new-car models so at first cars
were really exciting and as we've seen
new technologies show up they are really
cool but unless you've completely
redesigned an existing model put in
crazy technology or launch an entirely
new line you're not really doing
anything it's worthy of a frenzy right
so that's kind of how I feel about this
iPhone in that Apple's been doing a
pretty good job with a design cycle of
design change one year and then
optimized the following year for the S
model and that's exactly what they've
done with the iPhone 5s the 5s is an
awesome phone and anyone using the
iPhone 4s or previous will find it an
easy decision to upgrade if they have
the opportunity I'll probably upgrade to
the 5x if only because my iPhones paid
off and I like having the newest tech in
my pockets it's interesting one of the
things that I find to be different about
the way Apple does things as opposed to
Samsung of course the two big
comparisons everyone likes to make is
you know Apple tends to pick one or two
things to really kind of dive deep into
and they like to sort of bring you
things that you're you know they're
hoping you're using on a day
this is like things that make your life
easier and they automate things while
Samsung tends to say what's the craziest
thing we can think of and then let's
just cram it all in one phone well
that's not to say it's a bad thing I
think a lot of people obviously really
like their Galaxy devices the note 3 was
amazing when I saw it at Aoife and
Berlin but they do have certainly a
different way of doing things and so I
think that in that way
Apple's sort of iterative design can
feel a lot more boring compared to
somebody like Samsung who brings out you
know guns a-blazing they've got you know
they're throwing spaghetti against the
wall it's crazy and so I think that
that's one of those things that is just
different about Apple compared to
Samsung so whether that's your cup of
tea or not is up to you it's not to me
but I do think that Apple tends to dive
really deeply into one or two specific
product designs so touch ID being one of
them you know touch ID is a really
interesting piece of technology um this
seems like obviously something touch ID
you're gonna be using all the time so
and I really like how they've integrated
it in a way that it's going to act as
your password so when you go to buy an
app you just put your phone on there or
your finger or whatever whatever finger
you choose to do per touch ID um but I
like this idea of sort of the future of
this so this is a first generation
concept the Atrix did it kind of poorly
but but generally speaking this is you
know kind of a newer technology this
sort of biometric identification and I
think that if Apple opens the API which
I'm not saying that they will it's
actually in and of itself its existence
sort of suggests that we're really
getting into sort of this area of
technology and that to me is really
exciting okay so now on to the more
interesting of the two devices to me
which is the iPhone 5c honestly I was
totally wrong about this one I genuinely
thought Apple would have taken the
iPhone 4s as guts and dropped it into a
4-inch Retina screen with the same
colorful polycarbonate shell that the 5c
has that way they would have had a
low-cost iPhone for emerging markets
that could have been freeing on contract
and they could have also dunked their 30
pin port in one fell swoop which that
was really surprising to me that they
kept that around for another year it
also makes me wonder if we'll even see a
6c next year and just maybe push the
iPhone 5s and the 5c down in price to
make way for the iPhone 6 when it's
announced it's all a little bit odd in
terms of supply chain at least to me
because why wouldn't you want the same
size screen across all three of your
devices but I don't know maybe they are
gonna have a shortage of Retina displays
maybe that's what it is I mean they're
expecting them to sell huge in China and
I mean they said you know what maybe we
should keep the 4s around - to prevent
shortages for our 4-inch Retina display
I don't know I can't I can't possibly
speculate about such things Apple is
very secretive about those types of
things I'm like everybody pretty much on
this earth I actually like the thigh C's
cases of the dots which offer an
opportunity to sort of protect a device
without covering up its style but I also
would have liked to have seen other
patterns so maybe stripes or diamonds
I'm sure these will show up in the
future from other case makers on the
other hand the iPhone 5s cases are awful
as an iPhone user I'm disappointed
offering the muted and bland choices if
you want anything official from Apple
these like kind of gross pastilla sh
leather do not like but I don't keep my
phone in a case anyway so I guess that
really doesn't matter to me
overall Apple had what I would refer to
as a whelming event
I wasn't overwhelmed but I wasn't
underwhelmed I just whelmed and honestly
I think that's okay I posted on Google+
yesterday that I realized that no matter
what major OS your fan of whether it's
blackberry Apple with iOS Android or
even Windows Phone you have some really
good flagship options available to you
so regardless of how much you love or
hate the iPhone the 5s and 5c everybody
out there should be appreciating that we
as consumers are the ones who are
totally winning this battle because of
the choices that we have laid out in
front of us when shopping for a new
smartphone that's good stuff well that's
it for this video guys leave your
comments down below argue with me
disagree I know a lot of you guys will
love Android and that's cool you're
allowed to do that and no live you guys
love iOS you're allowed to do that too
Hey and you Windows Phone fans can also
leave your comments down there
blackberry Tizen your Tizen fan your
webOS fan whatever you want leave your
comments down below tell me what you
think of the iPhone 5s and the 5c you
can check out John's impressions of both
Apple products in his videos that he put
up the day of the event and I will be
online reading all your comments so be
nice and that's it for this time I will
