here with an unboxing for you of the
palm pre plus for verizon wireless this
is going to run e 149 bucks after
two-year contract and some rebates we
first took a look at the palm pre many
moons ago when it launched on sprint and
I was a big fan of the device back then
the pre plus improved on some of these
shortcomings of pre had a namely it
doubles the ramp and doubles the storage
from eight to 16 gigabytes which is
definitely nice and welcome to refresh
your memory it's got a three point one
inch hvga screen so that means it's 480
x 320 of course the cdma phone is
running on verizon it's got Wi-Fi while
B&amp;amp;G and it's got something pretty cool
and it called a 3g mobile hotspot we'll
talk about that a little bit let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing so here's
the picture of the device on the front
looks very familiar minus one change
i'll show you in a moment prom pre plus
on the site tells you what's in the box
in the box right there and picture on
the back of nothing very exciting a
typical palm box with the sleeve that
sort of comes off that's a very nice and
boxing sort of feel to it go ahead and
pull back the tab right there this is
just a review unit and there we are with
the device riddled with air bubbles so
one must have reviewed this one before
me go ahead and take that off and push
it to the side for just a minute and
we'll see what else comes in the box got
a hard plastic gel it sits on top of
palm pre plus a little bit about it app
catalog all that stuff getting started
information about anybody ever looks at
that and then down in the box you've got
palms tiny USB charger you've got a USB
cord that's microUSB you've got a pair
of stereo headphones with a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and you have a
bag which is smelling it definitely not
leather um not so sure who's going to
use that but if you want to keep your
pre in
a little bit of a bag you have the
option so I put all that stuff back and
let's take a look at the phone pick the
very satisfying peeling of the plastic
off with that nice whooshing noise and
let's take a look around the device so
got the 3.1 inch screen on the front and
missing from the original pre is the
home button right there it is now just a
complete gesture area so when you tap it
that would be the exact same thing as
hitting the home button you've got your
speaker and microphone ports on the left
side of the bus you've got a volume
rocker up and down and that's about it
on the right-hand side you've got your
USB charging port right there beneath
that sort of flimsy feeling window on
the top you've got your 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and your toggle to change
it from vibrant to ring and a lock or
power off button let's say click the
keyboard keyboards also on the
differences of the palm pre plus liked a
right off the bat the sliding mechanism
feels a little more secure a little more
stable than it did on the sprint version
that tended to feel a little flimsy when
you shift the device like this it would
almost come off from the hinges not
doing that here so we're missing the
orange button that was on the original
palm pre it's now sort of a grayish
white let's take a look and see how the
keyboard fuels it's got a bit more click
to it I'd say it's more akin to the
pixies keyboard doesn't feel that as GUI
I don't think the keyboard on the
initial pre was bad this one feels a
little bit better go ahead and close
that up let's do a size comparison for
you of some other devices you may be
interested in to to see first here is
the iphone 3gs looks quite large
compared to the diminutive pre plus
which by always meant to look like a
stone or pebble and sort of got that
round smooth feel to it definitely has
it really nice you let say look to it on
the back as well I want to mention that
it does have a 3 megapixel camera with
flash and then you were speaker grill
and the palm pre plus does ship with a
touchstone compatible back cover so you
don't have to buy that set
really the touchstone for you that don't
know is a capacitor passive it's a
inductive charging so you just put it on
the charger and it'll charge for data to
plug anything in 2d device itself so
let's look at the iphone size
comparisons of course the pre plus at
the slide out keyboard few other devices
you might be interested in here is the
nexus one it's probably one of the
thinnest smart phones out there
especially considering its specs it see
the size difference there and in phone
of a similar form factor at the slide
out keyboard here is the LG expo big
difference in size side by side you can
really see the difference so I mentioned
earlier this comes with a mobile hotspot
app and I'll do a video demonstrating
what that is and how it works but
essentially it takes verizon's 3g evdo
signal and kicks it out as Wi-Fi that
you can connect as you would any other
device to Wi-Fi network and you and for
the people can actually use it and share
the connection that sounds great it's
not free it's going to cost you a bleep
about forty dollars extra if you want to
do it there's a five gigabytes data cap
on that again I'll do a video
demonstrating surf how that works but
this has just been a relatively quick
unboxing of the palm pre plus for
verizon wireless a stay tuned to the
channel and TechnoBuffalo calm for a ton
of palm pre plus coverage will be
putting it head-to-head against all
these devices so i phone nexus one you
guys can really get a comparison that's
how it works and maybe see which device
is right for you amongst the comparisons
and competitors so for all your
