segment from TechnoBuffalo and today
we'll be taking a look at what's new in
iOS 9 beta 5 we've done several videos
in the past showcasing some of the newer
features in previous iOS 9 beta so if
you guys haven't seen those yet make
sure to check that out over here
probably the biggest and most noticeable
change in iOS 9 beta 5 are the new
wallpapers there are 15 in total ranging
from colorful desert landscapes to plans
planets and multicolored apps track
explosions the majority of Iowa State's
wallpaper have been removed from the
collection and the blue green tidal wave
image originally included with the
earlier iOS 9 betas has disappeared
Wi-Fi calling for AT&amp;amp;T has also been
added in iOS 9 beta 5 under settings
phone but it looks like it's not working
properly at the moment previously Wi-Fi
calling was only supported by t-mobile
and Sprint so it's nice to finally see
ATT support coming soon moving on inside
a cellular settings pane scrolling all
the way down there's a new toggle for
Wi-Fi Isis which essentially will allow
you to use your cellular data when your
Wi-Fi connectivity is poor if we go
ahead and go inside the keyboard pain
inside the Settings app text shortcuts
are now labeled text replacement and
speaking of the keyboard to delete shift
and dictation glyphs change to match the
overall look of iOS 9 launching the
calendar app for the first time in beta
5 you'll now be greeted with a splash
screen for calendars proactive features
proactive is an extension to Siri which
can read your calendar and let you know
what you have going on for today going
inside Apple music and heading into my
music there's a new shuffle all button
prominently placed above recently added
Apple also made some changes in sidecar
play which now supports beats one and
apple music features including liking
tracks lastly the series suggestions you
I have been tweaked a bit in iOS 9 beta
5 removing the labels for calling and
messaging instead only icons are
displayed now apple is expected to
launch Iowa sign alongside the new
iteration of iPhones this fall so
hopefully we'll be taking a look at the
final build of iOS 9 in a near future
but that's about it for now those are
the changes we saw in iOS 9 beta 5 there
are any major changes in future iOS 9
beta is including the final build we'll
be sure to keep you guys in the loop
over a TechnoBuffalo calm anyways thank
you guys so much for watching and if you
guys enjoyed this video make sure to
give it a thumbs up and we will see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
