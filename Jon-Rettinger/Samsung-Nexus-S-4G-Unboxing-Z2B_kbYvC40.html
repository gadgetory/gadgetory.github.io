week than with a brand new Google phone
except that it's not really a brand new
Google phone cuz it looks an awful lot
like this not some new Google phone
what's going on everybody I'm not from
TechnoBuffalo and this is the Google
Nexus S 4G from Samsung for Sprint
alright so indeed Google i/o is this
week starts tomorrow I'm filming this on
Monday and tomorrow is Tuesday Google
i/o starts tomorrow Tuesday at Moscone
Center in San Francisco I will be there
on Tuesday and Wednesday if the news
warrants it I will head back on
Wednesday as well bringing you live
coverage of Google's annual Developers
Conference we've got a whole bunch of
coverage going on all week on the site
and on youtubes to check it out I think
John might have a couple things to say
about Android on video coming up soon a
bunch of articles but what Google is up
to in you know Google there's a lot of
stuff it's not just phones they
obviously search obviously if their
hands deep deep deep into search online
but everything from TVs to energy to
tablets and now netbooks and all kinds
of stuff so a whole bunch of Google
stuff going on check it out over on the
website and as always make your opinions
heard you know we want to know you have
to think about all that stuff speaking
of which thank you to everybody who
posted a video response video review for
the what's in your pocket thing got a
ton of responses really excited about it
going through them and we'll be posting
a bunch on the site starting later this
week so stay tuned for that in the box
of the Nexus S 4G from Sprint made by
Samsung you get a cable it's a USB cable
USB to micro-usb you get a charger
module charge modular charger and you
get some headphones Samsung headphones
and then you get the phone itself so
this is essentially it's Sprint's
Sprint's pure Google phone their first
mature Google phone they've got the epic
yes I got some phones let's say with
Google on them but they're not just the
pure Google experience so to speak so
this is stock Android 2.3 Gingerbread
does it have enough battery in it to
fire up we have to plug it in usually
they have enough better to at least turn
on
this one seemed not to all right we'll
get this plugged in all right don't tell
sprint Google I'm using a different
charter it's okay I'm cheating anyway
very similar to the Nexus S which has
been out for a while available to run on
the US on t-mobile but you've got
Android 2.3 Gingerbread like I said
stock version of it you've got the
near-field communications protocol four
inch Super AMOLED display WVGA all that
good stuff basically you know it's a
Nexus S with WiMAX chip in it it's $1.99
ninety-nine on contract with a cheat
with a two-year contract I should say
direct through Sprint although least
I've read right now Best Buy is offering
it for $50 cheaper which is interesting
one $49.99 but that's as of May 8th 2011
so by the time you're watching this who
knows but basically you know we'll skip
that I'll just take a look at the phone
4 inch Super AMOLED display WVGA like I
said it's got the near-field
communication it's got the Wi-Fi chip
and it or the WiMAX trip rather in
addition to CDMA a 3G it's got Wi-Fi
built-in it's got mobile hotspot
capabilities front-facing camera VGA
rear-facing camera 5 megapixel with 720p
HD video capture and a flash it's basic
got all the stuff that's on the the
Nexus S you know stock Gingerbread like
you're used to let's see if there is a
4G yeah turn on 4G and yes please notify
me let's turn it on stun so see if we
get some 4G here it's got the
hummingbird processor as well you know
again it's uh you don't need me to say
it again it's the same phone it's got
WiMAX in it but it's still a pretty
sweet phone on the right side you've got
your power lock switch on the bottom
three half millimeter headphone jack and
USB port on the other side a rocker
switch for volume and such
it's got gyroscope and accelerometer
it's got the the proximity sensor
ambient light sensor all that kind of
stuff and you can see them connected to
the 4G right now
all right so I've got an account hooked
up a Google account and I can download
from the market so we'll download the
speed test mobile app won't do a quick
little speed test here but again excited
for Google i/o for sure interesting to
see what comes out of the keynote
looking for all kinds of things related
to Android you know the next version ice
cream or Ice Cream Sandwich people are
expecting to be called may do a lot to
unify the Android experience
particularly for developers across
phones tablets and also Google TV
looking for some more information I kind
of haven't heard a lot about Google TV
in a while but looking for maybe some
updates on Google TV maybe a if not a
relaunching of it at least kind of a
lighting a fire back under the Google TV
platform lots of Google TV sessions
listed in the i/o sessions pay on the
i/o sessions page if you're gonna be at
i/o by all means if you see me say hi
and what else Chrome's some rumors about
Samsung launching a Chrome netbook on
Wednesday night at a party after Google
i/o look in looking for more on the
Google music service that was actually
teased at last year's i/o and not too
much officially announced since then but
we've heard some rumors recently there
was a leak of an Android player so
interested to see some stuff on that see
I got about 2.2 down I'm looking at
about 512 up 600 little more than 600 up
to 700 up 800 900 to hear a thousand so
a two point two four down about 0.9 up
on the speed s here at the sprint 4G
network the WiMAX network here at
Oakland California pinging the San
Francisco California server so anyway
lots expected to be coming out of Google
i/o and then of course lots of
speculation about what device are they
going to give away they always they gave
away last year on Evo 4G to all of the
registered the folks in attendance
because the Developers Conference and so
they want to have the developers you
know with the latest and greatest
hardware so they can get psyched up to
to develop forward and you know that
keeps the whole ecosystem going so the
interesting to see what they hand out
tomorrow if anything would expecting
something to the developers some rumors
going around about tablets possibly the
Galaxy Tab 10 one from Samsung
so of course well let you know
everything that goes on over at Google
i/o but here and now we've got the Nexus
S 4G now in Sprint flavor to go along
with the gsm t-mobile flavor 1 9999 on
contract to your contract from Sprint
already being advertised cheaper than
that at some other outlets so you know
if you're shopping for a Nexus S 4G look
around get the best deal and we will
have all of your coverage androids of
lots going on this month month of May
