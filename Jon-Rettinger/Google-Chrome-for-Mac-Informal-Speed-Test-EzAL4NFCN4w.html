TechnoBuffalo here and i want to give
you a demonstration of the just released
google chrome official beta show you how
fast it works compared to Firefox and
Safari so before we get to any sort of
speed test I want to show you the speed
of my internet so you can tell if this
is a relatively fast connection at least
you can get a bit of perspective for how
quickly or not quickly these pages load
so here is the speed test relatively
quick and I did this and firefox but the
internet speed will be the internet
speed so I'm going to go ahead and quit
this and I'm going to open up and launch
Chrome from a completely cold launch its
only bit opened up one time before it's
been completely quit no pages have been
cashed in it whatsoever let's go ahead
and open it up and it launched pretty
quickly well go ahead and pick up
TechnoBuffalo com did launch very
quickly I had a previous version of a
developer preview for for Chrome but you
can see that it does launch it very
quickly it's got the very typical chrome
look with the tabs up top very minimal
what's missing here is any sort of real
bookmarks manage there's not that much
that you can do other than just
bookmarked pages that's one of the
things that Google a said should be
coming with another version of the beta
so it definitely is one feature that's
missing so let's compare speed wise now
to firefox firefox takes much longer to
load up chrome was almost instantaneous
we'll try TechnoBuffalo calm as you're
very informal test here this is of
course already been cash on the page so
let's close both these i'm not going to
quit we're going to see how quickly they
load again and we're going to low
technobuffalo one more time now that
they've both been stored in cash so open
up firefox much quicker that time will
open up chrome pretty close to
instantaneous open up technobuffalo
and we'll hit up TechnoBuffalo on
firefox it's not a monster different
speed why I certainly I've been on clock
thanks to either just wanted to give you
a quick shot of the speed I like to try
safari and see how quickly that loads as
well Safari takes a bit long to load
from a a cold launch specially on my
imac which is pretty powerful in 4 gigs
ram nice relatively modern core 2 duo
processor let's go ahead and load up
technobuffalo calm
so i'm not too bad i'm gonna try putting
all three next to each other i'm going
to refresh the page in order and we'll
see if we can get a sense of any speed
at all let's not can be at the same time
certainly because of all these sizes
again very informal testing here okay so
we've got Firefox Safari and we have
Chrome let's go ahead and do a refresh
on all these and we'll see what looks
like so i'll go chrome firefox and
safari to see what the final order it is
on try and go as fast as i can so they
all loaded pretty quickly it looks like
firefox actually still refreshing the
page the other two loaded much faster so
goes to show you firefox may be a bit of
a lag in OS 10 but let's go back to back
to chrome since that's the new one let's
take a look at how it handles some video
playback so we'll go to youtube
certainly if you're watching this you
obviously do a lot of YouTube viewing so
go ahead and just sort of a pic so
generic video
place things just fine see we can find
any sort of HD video and certainly HD
playback is going to be a very pretty
directly by your hardware but that does
work pretty well if you've got a more
low powered Mac an older Mac for example
I think chrome is probably gonna be a
pretty good option for you to get
maximum speed matter if you're older
processor if you're writing more a more
modern machine you're probably not going
to experience that big speed increases
but if you just like something different
a chrome really works quite well and
it's a very quick browser I've only had
it to the official beta for just a few
hours but I was using to develop a
preview for a while with a lot of use
and it was pretty stable and reliable so
you can go ahead and download this i
will put a link in the sidebar if you
want to go ahead and download the beta
and if you want some more information on
features and such I check out the other
link in the sidebar to go to
technobuffalo see you guys next video
