TechnoBuffalo and in this video we're
gonna unbox the new asus UL 30 VT laptop
this laptop does a lot of interesting
tricks we're gonna talk about that in a
minute but first a bit of a story of how
I got to this point I've actually been
looking for a laptop for about three
months now I do all my work on a desktop
and I also have a dell mini 10 netbook
for web browsing but the netbook really
can't run Photoshop it can't playback HD
video on YouTube it's not really a
productivity tool I can't get much work
done on the netbook it's simply too
underpowered to do anything really
significant so I've been looking for a
laptop that fits really four criteria
number one is size and weight I wanted
it to be very portable almost as
portable as a netbook but with a bigger
screen so 13-inch screen
the Asus is about four pounds which is
extremely light and it's quite thin to
number two price was a huge
consideration I wanted to stay under
$1000 the Asus used to be as of a few
days ago $7.99 which is an awesome value
for what you get but as of today they've
actually increased the price 150 dollars
to 949 I think because this is one of
the most popular laptops that that is
shipping this holiday season hopefully
it'll come down in price come the the
winter and the spring number three I
wanted power I wanted the ability to use
Photoshop and watch HD video on YouTube
and run many many applications at one
time without the system getting slow
this laptop has actually a Core 2 Duo
processor that is under clocked it's an
ultra-low voltage processor it's only
running at one point three gigahertz but
I've heard that that's overclockable to
1.7 gigahertz and additionally this
laptop actually has two graphics engines
the first is an integrated intel
graphics engine that you find on many
laptops out there but it also has an
NVIDIA GPU which is really great because
you can toggle between these two modes
on the fly to either get more battery
life or get better performance if you're
trying to play a game for example or do
HD video rendering and
number four battery life was a
significant criteria for getting a
laptop and the Asus UL 30 VT claims to
get 12 hours of battery life although
you know manufacturer claims are always
way too high I've been hearing and
reading about nine to ten hours of
battery life is reasonable which is
really high that's the entire day of
work that you can get through with this
laptop and again the way that it does
that is through that ultra low voltage
processor coupled with the graphics card
switching to save on power so let's get
to the unboxing I've been waiting for
this for a very long time and I'm sure
you're curious to see what this laptop
is like it's like we have a box inside
of the box okay so we have some specs
here that will zoom in on let's see what
we have here so each cell battery this
is the CPU CPU the ulv SU 7300 has a 500
gigabyte 5400 rpm hard drive although I
will be installing this guy the Intel X
25 M solid-state drive it's 80 gigabytes
to increase performance further and to
get more battery life out of this laptop
and we're going to be covering how to
actually do that in in future videos so
watch out for that it's continued down
the line here let's continue down the
line we have four gigabytes of RAM
although they show it as two gigabytes
times two ddr3 it's running Windows 7
home premium edition 64-bit it has 802
11 B G and n Wi-Fi I think it also has
bluetooth and that's that's pretty much
it for specifications let's zoom back
out and cut into the box here the box
actually feels quite heavy I guess
there's a lot of documentation in here
because as I mentioned the laptop is
only about four pounds as a comparison a
lot of netbooks out there are around
three pounds
so somewhat of a bland box Smart
Notebook smart.you
yes they're trying to keep costs low by
having a boring box let's see what it's
like to open up this guy another oh all
right so it looks like the laptop is in
the bottom section here I think we can
pull it out like so okay here's the
laptop we'll take a look at that in a
second let's see what we get in the box
what kind of accessories there are so
this must be the the charger pretty
small not as small as some other laptops
out there but that's not big of a deal
hopefully this will stay off the charger
with the incredible battery life see
what else do we get inside the box here
is the battery it should sit flush with
the laptop and not stick out like some
other batteries alright and here's the
other side of the power cord nothing
terribly interesting and let's see what
kind of software comes with this we have
a cable tie okay for the power cable
power to go
looks like software for burning programs
we've got some drivers and utilities and
then we have Windows 7 recovery disks so
this is the reinstallation CD that I
will be using because I'm gonna put the
solid-state drive in immediately and
install windows 7 from scratch and
hopefully it doesn't carry over all of
the Asus programs that tend to sort of
you know make things a little bit
bloated we've got the Express gate
manual I think this is a Seuss's
instant-on operating system that lets
you access multimedia and things like
that you can kind of see here you can
access Skype and Internet and
from this instant on operating system
that probably runs in Linux something
like that have to take a look at that
user manual and let's see the laptop I
was also looking at the sony vaio laptop
sr series because it's very similar in
size and weight and even price but I
went with the Asus because the reviews
came in very glowing and you know the
ability to switch from one GPU to the
other to save on battery is really cool
so let's take off this plastic and and
what we have on the front here is this
really nice brushed metal look it's a
very high quality let me take off this
little piece of plastic is covering up
the logo okay very nice it's very light
the batteries not in right now of course
let's let's open her up this has an LED
backlit display which helps to save on
power okay so a million stickers here
that I'm gonna have to remove let's
start by taking off the one on the
screen up here on the webcam on the on
the touchpad down here extremely thin
wow this feels probably thinner than my
netbook and we'll do a size comparison
in a second the touchpad is an
interesting texture it actually has
little bumps on them it's gonna be hard
to get used to this also is multi-touch
like the MacBook so that you can
actually do two fingers scrolling and
there's some other gestures you can do
so we have a chiclet style keyboard here
also like the MacBook and some other
laptops out there which is I actually
prefer I think it's more comfortable
here's the switch up here that will
switch between the two GPUs and I hear
that you have to reboot the system in
order to get to the other GPU but we'll
have to test that see what else it says
up here sixteen by nine green LED
backlit panel ddr3 RAM iSchool palm rest
so they're saying the palm rest doesn't
get hot down here it says instant boot
up smart power manager eco friendly
Global warranty blah blah blah okay so
that's annoying let's take off that
sticker
that's better and we'll take off this
sticker as well so I'm gonna put in the
battery just to get a feel for how heavy
it is when everything is together so I'm
gonna close the lid
very thin lid by the way I think that's
helped by the LED backlight and so I'm
going to snap this in okay that was easy
and it does stick out a little bit but
not too much so it's a very lightweight
laptop that's for sure and it's quite
thin too we're gonna go over all the
ports on the sides in a in a future
video but let's take a look at this
compared to the dell mini 10 which is in
11 inch netbook so the isus is not
significantly bigger
it's obviously wider in both dimensions
let's see the thickness I'm actually
going to say that the the Asus is
thinner than the netbook which is quite
remarkable and it's especially really
really thin down here towards the edge
so we've got a lot more coming up on the
Asus UL 30 VT we're gonna put a
solid-state drive in here we're gonna
mess around with overclocking and do
some other performance tweaks and talk
about the experience of this new laptop
and whether it actually gets 10 or 12
hours of battery life which would be
quite remarkable a lot more to come
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
