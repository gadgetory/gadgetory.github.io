from TechnoBuffalo here this is a video
by popular demand I've had a lot of
questions being sent in people ask them
for a head-to-head comparison between
the just-released
samsung built Google Nexus S and the
also Samsung built Galaxy S in this case
we have the Verizon Wireless variant
here these samsung fascinate so we're
going to put these two head-to-head
they're very similar in a lot of
respects and see if we can determine
what the big differences are and whether
or not Android 2.3 makes a difference or
whether not you're better off having an
older operating system with Samsung's
TouchWiz put on top of it so let's go
ahead and get started so for those of
you want you that maybe are familiar
with these two devices just a quick
refresher we've got the Nexus S on one
side which is running a completely naked
skin free version of Android it's the
current newest version of Android 2.3
called Gingerbread on the other side
we've got the Galaxy S running Android
2.1 with TouchWiz I know some people in
the world have had upgrade to 2.2 we
have not been in dab with that yet in
the US so this test is going to be with
Android 2.1 running on it so one of the
big OS differences here well one of the
cool things about Android is that it's
an open-source operating system and as
such it can be completely skins and
modified by manufacturers and users and
that's exactly what Samsung has done so
right here you've got some notifications
in the pull down menu you can go ahead
and automatically select Wi-Fi blue to
the GPS in airplane mode without having
to futz around with any sort of settings
you notice that you've got a four rows
of icons at the bottom all the
applications are encapsulated you've got
a ton of additional widget functionality
go ahead and show you real quickly what
those are Android widgets and Samsung
widgets if a lot here that you can go
ahead and add it's a decent amount of
functionality it's a lot of visual flash
but a visual flash also can take its
toll when it comes to memory processing
so
that we'll talk about in just a little
bit so here we've got the naked version
of Android 2.3 you notice that we've got
a little bit of a dock down at the
bottom with new colored icons the icons
at the top are now green the battery
icon is sort of turned on its side or
turn straight up rather versus what
we've seen on older versions you've got
a new keyboard for for text entry which
I'll show you guys certainly one of nice
things about Android is that it's open
source so you can go ahead and pull in
new text entries I don't know who that
person is so we'll go ahead and leave
their number public up they're gonna go
ahead and send out spam tech messages
you can see is a new keyboard you can go
ahead and use a ton of third party
keyboards as well there's a lot of under
the hood API differences as well as far
as how graphics or process 3d images and
that kind of stuff and we'll see sort of
what difference that makes if any will
we do some speed tests just wanted to
give you a real quick overview of these
and I've done in-depth videos on Android
2.3 Gingerbread as well as the operating
system on the Galaxy S and more
particularly the Samsung skin touch
woods alright so let's talk about the
displays on these two because they are
very similar both have four inch
diagonal Super AMOLED displays with
resolution of 800 by 480 and what Super
AMOLED means is that the touch mechanism
on the screen is glass is actually built
into the glass not sitting right on top
there are a few other nuances in there
but what that's going to translate to
are darker darks richer colors and a lot
better visibility in direct sunlight
however the downside of that is that you
do have a little bit of a bluish kind of
great hint on the Super AMOLED screens
when you use the phone on its own for a
while you don't really notice it but if
you look at it next to another display
you'll notice that there's a bit of a
color tint to it sometimes I find it
bothersome but for the most part that
this boy is absolutely gorgeous a
vibrant and beautiful on the Nexus S
however there's one bit of a difference
the display is a little bit curved I
don't know if you can see that on camera
but it does make for a little nicer
experience moving your finger over and
holding up your head nothing giant up
there but is something to take notice
when you're comparing the two devices
I'm figuring out me
which one is best for you from a
processor standpoint once again the
theme here is identical we've got one
gigahertz cortex a8 hummingbird
processors which are going to be
powering both of these running with 512
megabytes of RAM each cameras again same
stuff on the back we've got five
megapixel sensors on each in the
fascinates case this is the Verizon
Wireless version we do have a flash but
not all versions of the Galaxy S do have
a flash you get in the same five
megapixel sensors there's a flash here
on the Nexus S if you flip it over
here's where we see some differences the
Nexus S has a front-facing VGA camera
use that for video chatting I can also
use that for taking really cool pictures
or yourself out at some clubs
something to put to keep in mind camera
wise the functionality is very very very
similar the VGA is added benefit on the
front if some that you're looking for
and something that you need it's good to
have the option now as far as networks
and how these are going to go on
different carriers the Nexus S is
unlocked but right now it only supports
t-mobile's 3G bands in the US so if your
t-mobile customer you want to use their
variants of the galaxy s you need to
pick whichever one's going to be best
for you if you're not a t-mobile
customer if you're not 18 t Verizon
Sprint you know you're going to be very
limited but you can choose and you may
have to pick the galaxy s if a samsung
built Android device is really what you
are looking for so let me go ahead and
run a little bit of speed test here and
when I'm done I'll run the quadrant
benchmarking test let me go ahead and
clear all the memory from each I've put
AF memory clearing program there we go
right here on the galaxy assets of atom
it's more of a task killer I don't
recommend using these sort of very
regularly but I do want to show that
we're starting from as clear memory as
we can so we're gonna go ahead and kill
all selected apps on Android 2.3
actually do have a task manager built-in
to go into menu and go ahead and see
manage apps and Samsung does include a
task manager on there TouchWiz interface
I just use a third-party one we'll go
ahead and check out running
to let me know what's running and you
can see it's a Settings Google services
android keyboard and stuff that sort of
toys has to be running on there so we've
got a clear memory on each let's go
ahead and try and run some some similar
applications see if we have any speed
difference
let's try one of my favorites and
certainly different applications may
have different speeds I can't do a test
on everything out there but I do want to
show you just some samples so let's
start with one of my favorite games
Angry Birds in this case it's Angry
Birds Seasons and I will try really hard
push you at the same time that's more
difficult than you might expect
alright so I hit in both they got that
Rovio's screen and exactly the same to
amazes almost identical so far as far as
speed goes actually who's ready to play
first on the galaxy s over the Nexus S
so here we go Android 2.3 did not win
Samsung's TouchWiz interface actually
I'll watch things a bit faster go ahead
and close these the music can be a bit
on the annoying side alright so let's go
ahead and try some browser speed and see
if you've any difference in speed here
as well so I'll go ahead and open up the
browser I should mention that these are
relatively clean installs of both
operating systems all right so we've got
a little TechnoBuffalo on each and do a
simple refresh and since the swype
keyboard is loaded up here so what
TechnoBuffalo these are sites that have
been loaded before on each of these
devices so considered a test of websites
that you visit on a regular basis I'll
go ahead and run this test and I'll give
you my general impressions on speed you
can see that Flash content is loading on
both you got flash flashlight support on
the Galaxy S and you have flash 10.1
support here on the Nexus S let's go
ahead and refresh both these go ahead
and do this and we'll hit go at least
try and hit go at exactly the same time
hit it there hit it there let's see if
we have any speed difference and these
are running on both the same Wi-Fi
networks so again it looks like we are
almost head-to-head maybe the Nexus
has a little bit of an edge and it did
finished just a hair sooner so in using
both these advices and noticing speed I
will say that 3d gaming games that use a
lot of 3d stuff things like Need for
Speed or if you want to you to Google
Earth is noticeably zippier on the Nexus
S now is that little bit of speed
increase which we didn't even see in
these tests a reason to go out and want
to ditch your new Galaxy S and pick up a
Nexus S because it's a new phone on the
block most definitely not the galaxy s
on its own is a really capable phone
very quick and very robust and you may
like Samsung's TouchWiz interface
personally I don't like the encapsulated
icons that you get in the menu system
like I showed you guys in the beginning
I'll go ahead and show you one more time
so all these icons are encapsulated I
prefer the native Android look of 2.3
which is going to be available on the
Nexus S however that's just personal
preference both devices are extremely
well capable and very similarly specs if
I have to pick a winner I would pick the
Nexus S because there's a little bit of
speed increase you've got that front VGA
camera and I prefer sort of native
Android in its unskilled miss over
Samsung's TouchWiz but TouchWiz does add
some functionality so really this is
going to be a personal preference I was
picking one again I would pick the Nexus
S but it would be very close I've used
the Galaxy S as my daily phone I was
absolutely thrilled with it and I think
you will be as well so hopefully this
cleared things up for you guys and gave
you a head-to-head comparison of each
phones I am John Rhett endorsing
