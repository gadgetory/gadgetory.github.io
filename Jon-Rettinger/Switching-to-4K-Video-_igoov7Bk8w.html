to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of retinas
wrists formerly called registrant cuz
I'm just not that angry anymore and
other stuff to yell about on the father
now of mellowed up this week on riffs I
want to kind of a talk with you guys
tell you what's going on your tech go
buffalo camera wise i got a lot of
questions about gear what I think we're
doing we might be doing we're probably
going to be ordering to help upgrade all
of our kit this is rector's riffs let's
start getting riff T so another show
that we have to rent TechnoBuffalo is
asked to Buffalo people can ask any
question that they want to ask about
site company me whatever usually answer
four or five questions every week do I
get questions about our gear what we
used to film with what lens we use and
everything so I mentioned it before but
right now we are filming with a canon
c100 i'll be upgraded from a canon 5d
mark 3 and a 5d mark two before then we
actually got rob's like a year ago and
our 5d mark two in our mark 3 got stolen
we replace it with another mark 3 anyway
but now we're on the Canon see how
that's a story for it totally another
day us we're filming on a canon c100
which has been great with using it for
not even that long probably about six to
eight months and I'd love the camera I
love having sure of a film first camera
I don't do any of the camera work that's
Ron and Ralph but at least from what I
see it looks like it's way way easier
all i see is really just the lens sort
of staring back at me and it's been
really good for us and I think canon has
worked out very well all of our lensing
is all canon with your EF mounts but
things are changing very quickly the
world wants more k's they want more case
faster and things are going sort of
trending towards 4k and I've always said
let's hold off on 4k until they're 4k
monitors you know I'm not I don't sort
of run the business just buy every
yellow camera out there till we do it we
don't really review that many cameras
you're taking a buffalo anyway so what
we buy I want to make sure we can use
and there aren't that many 4k monitors
out there they're really expensive and I
really wasn't sure it was the right time
to go for K so we started looking about
what 4k stuff was out there
starting to get less expensive and more
options start to come out I mean you've
got Panasonic gh4 their micro
four-thirds 4k camera which is this a
teeny tiny little body and it's
incredibly awesome what it can do canon
of course has their stupid expensive
c500 coming in at twenty thousand
dollars which fun fact same sensor and
to see 102 c300 to see 500 get a little
better electronic viewfinder and some
other options but really canon
difference is it's a five thousand
dollars from the c100 verses 24 the it's
so crazy that was even an option we were
considering we looked at things like the
red scarlet you know which certainly
awesome but the thing about read that
are found is it is so modular you can't
just pop in an SD card or pop it in SSD
you gotta buy the red kind of hard drive
memory modules knots got to go into the
red card reader it wouldn't use by a red
camera then you gotta buy a grip the
battery and did you go to buy another
battery to swap it out with then you go
out to buy the red battery charger and
it gets absolutely crazy and aside from
all that kind of crazy proprietary
business it records in raw which is a
little bit difficult side to work with
specially of what we do you know Rob
wouldn't make much sense I don't think
for us then we started looking at other
cameras if we want to decide to go for K
we started looking at stuff from black
magic which you should just make some
audio components there now making
cameras or making pretty awesome cameras
so this is kind of the point of the
video I took a while to get here we're
thinking about going to 4k here's what
I'm thinking we're going to do I sort of
like to share it behind the scenes stuff
and I Pierce hear your thoughts on it so
first thing do you think 4k matters
you're probably not before came on I
don't have a 4k monitor but i will say
i'm interested in doing 4k cuz it can be
kind of cool to do sort of zoom and crop
if you take 4k footage you do it at
1080p you can actually zoom in I don't
get any sort of loss at all so don't
take a look like you have two cameras I
could be like hey I'm talking about one
topic and boom sort of a quick crop and
zoom annex I talk about something
different you do a lot more I also think
that 4k footage shot at 4k but
compressed down to 1080p looks way
better than 1080p footage shot at just
1080p and of course you can always
upload in 4k so usually we shoot with
two cameras we've got c100 I mentioned
is our main camera we do unboxing to cut
a setup or camera shoots straight down
and we use a canon 60d for
so we're looking at stuff from black
magic those serve on a more affordable
side we said okay the Blackmagic Cinema
4k camera looks pretty awesome it's a
big kind of hulking square rectangle
type thing the best parts got canon EF
lens mount on it looks pretty awesome
but there's some downsides with the two
it's got no XLR audio ports doesn't have
that many ISO settings it doesn't have
phantom power for those XLR report so
kind of others who are drawbacks we
thought it might be really good camera
to sort of use to go for our straight
down shots when it comes to unboxing so
of course we need another camera and
having sort of one camera for Kane when
knots not going to work well or have a
canon camera shooting with the black
magic there's not going to look the same
the sensor surface shoot things very
differently it takes a lot of work in
post to make sure they'd sort of colors
kind of match and Ron's already got
enough on his plate I didn't want to add
that to him he's he's nodding off camera
can't see but he is it would be a lot of
work we stopped talking about 4 k's and
multiple caves for a minute to thank our
friends at audible.com listen you're
probably no audible right now they are
the world's leader in spoken word
entertainment you could download any
book even wanting to catch up on if
let's say you like romance you want
anybody to judge you reading your book
out in public download that sucker put
your headphones on sit into the tree and
reminisce about I didn't want to say we
should remember this about if you like
mystery you can get your mystery on if
you like fiction fiction if you want to
catch up on the Steve Jobs biography by
Walter Isaacson it's a great chance to
do it you can read them when you're
walking when you're in the gym in the
car that can be read write to you
through your ear holes into your brain
and then you will sound educated at
parties which is pretty awesome go to
audible podcast.com slash techno to get
a free audiobook download of your choice
when you sign up again that is audible
podcast.com slash tech meal and get your
free audio book and sound smarter if
that okay if we want to try going black
magic let's go to black magics do you
want to go to cinema cameras which
definitely work yet to get a ton of
proprietary parts make it work or
they've got a camera they just announced
at NAB called the Ursa which look at the
thing right now it is just crazy looking
it's got a 10 inch touchscreen on it
it's got its own built-in audio controls
which cinema camera doesn't which is
kind of weird no audio controls in the
camera if you want to adjust levels on
the fly you just
and do they adjust levels before you
film and then hope no one's voice to go
up or down if you watch my videos you
know my voice goes up and down like
crazy so we are thinking about going on
the 4k bandwagon and I'm thinking we
might go either to cinema cameras with
crazy other accessories or go cinema
camera and the Ursa and sort of upgrade
everything at once and hope it lasts us
for many years you're so it's also
modular and upgradable similar to
Loretta's you can upgrade the red to the
brain it's a different kind of camera
options that they have black magic on
doing the same thing so that's the
direction that we're thinking about
going I wonder if you guys care about 4k
we start spinning our wheels at all that
the perception of oh you have to
shooting me for k's people think you're
a big deal or not I don't know I just
want to hear your thoughts on it this is
kind of showing we get a chance to talk
kind of one-on-one they just want to
hear you think you care you care you
don't care a again if you guys want to
add anything you think is another camera
we miss we talked about the Sony's as
well but I just love to hear your
thoughts I'll leave in the comments down
below we back next week with normal
riffy episodes where I'm talking about
things in my mind but you wanted to
share the search store with you guys get
your opinion on it's a great way to just
chat to the audience and you guys of
course check us out of tectum Buffalo
compilation greatest tech news until
then I'm John rettinger see you guys
next video bye bye black magic also has
a cinema camera and also have the
production camera the cinemas 2.5 k the
production's 4k there are just so many
names I might have intermix them but
just know i'm talking about 4k i'm
talking about the production or I might
have said cinema so don't yell at me
call me jerkface I can make mistakes too
