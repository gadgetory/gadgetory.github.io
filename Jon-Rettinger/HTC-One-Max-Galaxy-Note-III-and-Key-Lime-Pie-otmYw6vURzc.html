to you by carbonite what's up everyone
welcome back the episode of a rumor
roundup I'm your host Jon ranges to show
where the name should give it all away
we take all the tech rumors from the
week and we condense them into one show
for you up this week it's all about the
big phones HTC one max galaxy note 3 we
got some operating system business talk
about key lime pie and we might know
just might know what kind of cameras
gonna be in the iphone 5s i'm john
ranger this is rumor roundup let's start
rounding up the HTC one max over the
past month or so rumors about the
handset have been heating up with
pictures rumors all kinds of other
things unofficially being revealed what
looks like the HTC One dig look at this
photo it's meant to show the scale of
the HTC One max its supposedly a 5.9
inch full HD display looks pretty sweet
I look at the picture it's got a 4-inch
Motorola device on top of it just shows
how large HTC One max is going to be
incidentally the HTC One max will fill
out an entire lineup of one handsets
including the current flagship and the
HTC One mini which we checked out a few
weeks ago a pretty beastly Snapdragon
800 2 gigabytes of RAM si said gigabytes
an ultrapixel camera boomsound speakers
HTC is pretty awesome sense 5 UI it's
someone clear that wanna see an official
unveiling from HTC but with all died
instantly photos chances are i'll say
something very very soon so following a
really not so mysterious announcement
from samsung earlier in the week hinting
that the galaxy notes will be unveiled
at September fourth event which we will
be at another leaked image of the
alleged their generation phablet has
appeared online revealing the uncovered
back of the device the photo comes to
the Italian site web track which
unfortunately couldn't guarantee its
authenticity the latest galaxy note 3
throw doesn't really reveal much we do
see what it looks to be a redesigned
battery as well as two sim card slots
which probably means is ain't gonna
launch the US based on the previous two
galaxies on handsets I'd expect the
galaxy note 3 to support at least a
three thousand million power battery
galaxy note 3 suspected come equipped
with a 5.7 inch beautiful 1080p screen
either a Snapdragon 800 or octa-core
Exynos processor and
4.3 jellybean lots of the Samsung added
features we've seen in the galaxy s4
live smartphones so google just released
android 4.3 which is really just a tiny
little update to the jelly bean
operating system last month but we
expect it to roll out into next big
update to the OS sometime before the end
of the year which we thought we're
actually gonna have when 4.3 came out
the company is already teased android
5.0 pretty likely gonna be called key
lime pies to go with that dessert being
the name I way up the alphabet earlier
in the week we sell a new song for me
I've finally been confirmed key lime pie
lay deep within chromium the Chrome
browser open source skeleton series of
tests have been uncovered revealing a
number of Android devices running
different iterations of the OS we see a
ton of Samsung Galaxy devices all
running the jelly bean OS designated by
the letter J for example the note 2 was
running Jay Z 0 45 k suggesting that
Samsung will roll on a software update
to the phablet in the near future we
also saw the Nexus 7 and Nexus 4 running
those versions respectively which would
also imply that the devices are running
an early version of key lime pie
particularly elegant if the search giant
unveiled the new OS alongside any nexus
5 handset and based on earlier rumors we
may see both software and hardware
released this fall please 5-inch Nexus
device would be pretty sweet as well it
might give that HTC One max a run from
my pocket the last week we got a glimpse
the camera for one of up Cummings
Apple's iPhones at the time the general
assumption was that the leak module
depicted by the blurry photo is headed
for the iphone 5 c's yes it's a low-cost
handset my pack an 8 megapixel camera
however a second League appears to
confirm the component actually belongs
to the iphone 5s online component seller
Luna commerce was already offering a
number of different iphone 5s parts
recently uploaded a series of photos
that coming flagship smartphones back
camera offering a pretty clear look at
the module the new photos contain two
big clues first the flash module is
totally detached and doesn't show up in
the photos secondly see Apple's official
part numbers beginning with 8 21 /
dynamic component so unclear how
powerful the iphone 5s camera is going
to be but while latest photos suggest
Apple might stick the a megapixel rear
shooter early reports of indicated that
the new smartphone make come equipped
with an improved camera we don't really
know anything until Apple decides to
tell us which we expect will be sometime
the next month or so so stay tuned for
