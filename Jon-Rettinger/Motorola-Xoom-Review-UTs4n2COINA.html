technobuffalo here the four of you for
you of the Android tablet that's kicking
off the honeycomb craze this is of
course a motorola xoom the first tablet
to run androids three-point o operating
system let's go ahead and dig in see if
it lives up to the hype being a slight
device how you interact with the tablet
and how you get your information is
going to be a paramount importance so
that's where we're going to begin with
the navigation and you why there are lot
of differences here with previous
versions of Android the first and most
notable is the presence of a soft home
button we don't have any physical
buttons here on the outside of the
screen so you don't have your capacitive
home menu back and search button or
sometimes physical buttons in the case
of some devices it's completely soft
here and it's always going to be present
in the bottom left-hand corner no matter
what orientation you have your device
always going to be there no matter what
application you are in so there's a bit
of a learning curve and it took a little
while to get used to about two days of
using the zoom as my dedicated tablet i
became used to it very quickly in fact i
tended to prefer it I always knew orders
going to be located if I had the device
turn to the left I knew it was always
going to be there in the bottom left
hand corner it was oriented to the right
it wouldn't matter it was always there
something that I really tended to enjoy
one of the things that I thought was
going to annoy me about the zoom I
really tended to go against what I
initially expected next you've got a
very nice and intuitive notification
system down here below similar to what
you might see if you've ever used growl
notifications they pop up in a very
unobtrusive manner and they don't stop
what you're doing you can see right
there about an email calendar you can
have a ton of other choices you can pull
up setting this very quickly by tapping
the clock and they'll show you all your
notifications you cap the home screen to
get rid of them you've got what I'm
referring to as smart widgets you can
interact with these widgets in a lot of
new manners that you couldn't
necessarily easily do with older
versions of Android so for example I've
got to CNN application right here I can
go ahead and scroll through different
articles find what I want click it and
it will launch the browser emails here
you can see the same thing calendar and
some web choices now
how you're going to access these widgets
might be very familiar if you used
android go ahead and tap anywhere the
five home screens here and you've now
got four choices for choosing four
choices for choosing of course you've
got widgets app shortcuts wallpapers and
more and in the more category you're
going to see a ton of different choices
here book smart contacts email account
gmail label and a few other options if
you want to go back you've got another
soft button down there which is going to
be a left arrow let's go ahead and
select home the next thing that I want
to mention is a button that lives right
to the right of that home button looks
like two rectangles that you're
multitasking which is done in a very new
and I think pretty intuitive way here
with Android 3.2 go ahead and select it
it's going to pull up what your most
recently doing so if i wanted to jump
into my browser i can go ahead and do
that very easily i wanted to go back
into settings where i was earlier go
ahead and do that nice and easily no the
multitasking here really has done very
nice eloquently if you can say that in a
very easy to understand smash fashion
overall using the UI in the navigation
there definitely was a learning curve if
you've ever used an android device
you're gonna have to remember how to do
different things you could have to try
and forget what you used to do on
previous versions of android overall it
took me about three to four days to
really get a hang of the nuances of the
device and learn how to use it all right
so next let's talk about performance
this thing is really packing a
powerhouse of a processor packing
powerhouse processor with the nvidia
tegra 2 dual-core chip this thing should
be very very fast and I found it wasn't
as blistering fast as I expected it to
be launching application for example
could be very slow and that may be due
to a very severe lack of dedicated
tablet applications in the Android
Market which we'll talk about in just a
minute I experienced several crashes
while browsing the web and I think it
comes from a lack of optimization for
the dual core hardware now while android
3.0 honeycomb is supposed to be
optimized it is the first version of the
operating system I do suspect that
future Android updates will alleviate a
lot of these concerns but if we're
looking for a blistering fast tablet
performance you're not going to get that
on the zoom it is certainly
for everyday usage and it is relatively
zippy while doing tasks everyday tasks
such as multitasking but if you're
expecting a huge huge huge speeds
improvements over what you've seen on
your snapdragon android phone or on an
ipad by comparison you're not going to
be overly impressed with the performance
again i do the next one improve with
subsequent software updates next let's
talk about the screen it's got a 10.1
inch diagonal capacitive display and the
resolution of 1280 x 800 should be vivid
but images do tend to look a little bit
washed out let me go ahead and use the
multitasking here and we'll jump it to
the gallery you look at an image that I
took for example using the rear facing 5
megapixel camera it's just not overly
sharp and crisp and clear the screen
does tend to look a little bit washed
out and referencing back to my
performance you can see what i'm
referring to when i say it's not
blistering fast the pinch to zoom here
there's a little bit of a delay i've
used android devices previous versions
of android devices with much lower
processors that have actually been a bit
more responsive but going back to the
images here and the screen it doesn't
pop as you would expect a screen of this
higher resolution there certainly
visible and they're easy to look at but
it's not as white bright and vibrant as
I would have expected alright so next
let's jump in and talk about the browser
I will say this is probably one of the
best uses of tab browsing certainly
there are third-party tab browsers on a
competitor like the iPad but the native
safari browsers doesn't support it and
it doesn't work as well I love the
layout here of the browser you could
load tabs in the background the pinch to
zoom can be a little bit laggy let me go
ahead and jump into technobuffalo here
and you can see what the keyboard looks
like on the keyboard here is extremely
easy to use very easy to type on and the
autocorrect as sort of typical Android
is excellent so I'll go ahead and load
it up here and we'll take a look at the
browsing and this sort of reference back
to the performance it's a little bit
slow it's not as fluid as I would expect
from a modern tablet
very usable though and I think that I
was getting a bit excited with the
properties of what Tegra 2 could do and
perhaps is a little bit of managing
expectations now certainly it's not
going to be a hard internet experience
you're not going to be waiting for pages
load assuming you're on used internet
connection but you're just not going to
get blistering fast performance so go
ahead and see what the scrolling looks
like there go ahead and stop and of
course you can do your multi-touch
pinch-to-zoom I will say though that I
love the browser on this I think the tab
browsing is absolutely outstanding flash
is not yet on it so there might be a
problem for some but adobe has that
it'll be coming very soon that's more of
an Adobe issue that a motorola or google
thing all right so let's go ahead and
jump home and let's talk about apps
since apps are generally what a lot of
us use on our mobile devices now
unfortunately there are not that many
dedicated applications here for the
tablets I'm going to go ahead and show
you what the redesigned android market
looks like they did a fantastic job with
the uoy of this I really looked very
nice if I jump into featured tablet apps
for example there just aren't that many
right now now day by day more and more
show up as developers get access to the
AP is and they have time to develop so
certainly this is a problem that will
rectify itself very soon but there
aren't that many applications right now
that are meant for android 3.0 honeycomb
so what that means is you're going to
have to use legacy applications that
were meant for you know the two dot
whatever operating systems things like
Twitter for example you're going to have
to use an older application and I found
that I had a problem using older
applications with crashing oftentimes
they weren't fully supportive if I
wanted to use something on a regular
basis like I used Bloomberg for example
that would constantly crash while using
an older application that's meant to run
on android 2.0 as I mentioned earlier
you're going to have another icon on the
bottom there you see it right behind and
sign the multitasking which is going to
be your menu what you would get if you
are using an older Android device so
something to keep in mind that
applications are really important to you
right now you may want to wait to pick
up Motorola Xoom however I assume it
weeks and months as where people get to
develop for the platform but that will
be rectified and fixed next let's talk
about build quality you're going to hold
this guy in your hands quite a bit and i
will say built quality feels outstanding
definitely feels professional-grade the
metal on the back the feeling of holding
it on the side I just feels very good
build quality really is outstanding and
speaking of outstanding battery life is
actually very impressive here as well if
we use this on a very regular basis for
emails as I do with the cellular data
turned off on Wi-Fi you're gonna have no
problem getting through two or three
days i granted by day three you might be
close to being powered out but you won't
have much of a trouble battery life is
really really nice one of the things
that I don't like about it is it doesn't
charge and fortunately via micro USB
instead uses a proprietary port if I
didn't like that have to carry around a
separate power charger if I was
traveling with the zoom cameras are
pretty standard you've got a five
megapixel shooter located on the back
dual LED flash it actually has a pretty
high resolution for front-facing camera
here at two megapixel the interface
freezing the camera is actually very
nice and really included here on android
3.0 sort of done in that half circle
fashion so you take some pictures go
ahead and move around that have a ton of
different options ranging from camera
settings to scene modes and they're
quite a few color effects white balance
and then of course flash and you manage
your zoom right from their camera
quality was about average wouldn't
expect from a 5 megapixel essentially a
camera phone certainly it's already
place your daily point and shoot camera
but for getting pictures of your dog
your cat or ever you might want to do
this is really going to probably work
out very nicely for you uh so the
conclusion i think the zoom has
tremendous potential and when i say the
zoom i really mean android 3.0 as a
whole i think it needs one or two
software augmentations here to fix some
of the lagging issues and take advantage
of the wrong horse power that the tablet
has i think that once we get the 4g LTE
upgrade as well it's going to be
screaming fast for the mobile
users I love that it has DLNA support
and I really would like there to be more
application support from day one and
that fault lies with google for not
releasing the sdk until relatively close
to android 3-pointers launch i'd say if
i have to grade this on a one to five
star scale i get some very solid three
and a half but has potential for much
more once we get more applications once
we have to rely less on older apps that
were meant for android 2.0 once we've
got a software upgrade cuda takes more
advantage of the multiple cores found in
the Tegra 2 which most of the cow books
are going to be running i think we're
looking at an outstanding competitor for
the ipad for HP's touchpad and whatever
else may be coming on the market within
that you rim playbook so if you are an
android fan or you just want to give
android tablet to try I do not think
you're going to be disappointed with the
motorola xoom and experience is only
going to get better as more developers
get their hands on it so I look to you
what you guys have to say are you zoom
fans are you not zoom fans you agree or
disagree sound off down below i'm jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and i'll
see you in the next video bye bye
