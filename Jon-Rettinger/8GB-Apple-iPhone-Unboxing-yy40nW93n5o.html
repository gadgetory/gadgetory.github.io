and much-hyped
unboxing for you right you guessed it
the Apple iPhone I caved I didn't wait
in line or anything it's day came out
here June 29th I walked into an Apple
store 10 o'clock p.m. they had tons of
them I couldn't help myself I actually
ended up getting two and I sold one to
help cover some of the cost of of mine
so enjoy the unboxing guys hold off on
the iPhone questions if you can till I
do a review but anything general go
ahead and ask and I'll try and answer
there will be a review coming give me a
week or so and thank you all for
subscribing enjoy it guys enough talking
let's get down to it here we've got the
iPhone box upside down very small as you
can see the iPhone on the front cuz I
fought on the side some info on the back
I phone eight gigabytes Apple logo Apple
logo that's it let's open her up very
exciting
been waiting for this thing for a long a
long time a lot of reading a lot of
speculating panic would actually be open
her up take off the plastic all right
top comes off ooh bucks just holla
there she is there's the iPhone take it
out here she is front side is the back
as you can see pretty small pretty
good-looking see it else is in the box
put your awesome inside it's got this
cool plastic behind it
it pulls up does charge little charging
brick it's actually very small dock USB
cable for charging in the dock and it's
headphones that's everything that comes
in the box right here including the
iPhone itself let me do a real quick
size comparison for you guys so before
we get to that size comparison also
ending here is packet is documentation
fingertips very clever
Kaja some tips on the phone all right
let me show you guys the size comparison
the iPhone best I can show you is with
my outgoing phone the blackberry pearl
from side-by-side for you here
remote you guys have seen the blackberry
pearl in person side there's side view
back on top there's really not that much
difference actually between the two the
you can see there hold it up the iPhone
is just a little bit bigger but not by
much at all
