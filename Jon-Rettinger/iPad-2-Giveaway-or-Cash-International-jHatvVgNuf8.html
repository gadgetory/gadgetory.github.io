since 2007 so the title of this video
didn't give it away we want to give you
a chance to win a brand spankin new iPad
to open of course to anyone in the world
this giveaway is not sponsored by anyone

as our past giveaways have been it'll be
open to anyone in the world if you are

win the cash equivalents of an ipad 2 in
fact a 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi model so that's
going to be four hundred and ninety-nine
dollars just sent to you and all you're
going to need is a paypal account so
that's how it's going to work you for
outside of the US unfortunately with
shipping with foreign apple stores with
power adapters makes it very difficult
for us to sort of get the ipad to your
country so 499 might not buy you an ipad
to wherever you are but at the very
least it's a free 500 bucks that you
didn't have before if you are in the US
you'll have a chance to pick your color
of ipad 2 16 gig Wi-Fi model whether you
want black whether you want white or
that's really it we're also going to
give you the option to take the
cash if you don't want an ipad 2 you
have no interest you want to zoom or
something else or you just want the
money we're going to give you the option
to take the 499 as well same caveat
applies you're just going to need a
paypal account so let's get to the rules
