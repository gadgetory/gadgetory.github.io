some TechnoBuffalo here we've had the
galaxy s6 and the galaxy s6 edge for a
little over 24 hours not enough time for
a review but plenty of time sort of
sharing my thoughts on it so I'm going
to call this a mini review we're gonna
talk about things that I've noticed
things that I want to test further and a
lot of things in-between so talk about
design build quality TouchWiz all the
questions that you had and that I know I
had before I got my hands on these
phones so let's talk with about the
design of both
I've been admittedly very hard on
Samsung the past for their build quality
well it's been use of cheap plastics or
bendy plastics no longer the issue here
these phones look and feel very very
premium it's hard to tell from the
pictures of videos you might have seen
from a World Congress but the glass back
and the glass front do look very very
nice a bit reminiscent of the LG built
Nexus 4 and certainly the iPhone 4 but
they have a nice quality to them all
right like the aluminum also on the
sides of the galaxy s6 me pick it up
first in the morning it feels cold and
it's sort of a neat feel to have so from
a design standpoint I think Samsung is
definitely heading in the right
direction the other big gripe that I
know that we've shared is TouchWiz I
hated the bleeps and bloops it was
incredibly bloated like me after
Thanksgiving dinner or the Super Bowl
thought the icons were kind of ugly
TouchWiz here is looks to be completely
redone the 40% lighter it's certainly
nice there's way less apps installed but
now it's actually useful they're not try
to teach me how to wave my hand over the
phone to answer it they sort of give you
the feature to think you're going to
need the most and if you want more you
can download them from the Galaxy store
if you choose to but they're not forcing
you to you can hide the apps that you
don't want to have the TouchWiz editions
I do think are very nice I still don't
like the way the colors look on it but
now there's a theming engine built
without having to download a third-party
launcher and I will say having said all
this about how much better I think
TouchWiz is I'm still running Noble
launcher but I guess that's the beauty
of Android you can customize it any way
you want the previous fingerprint
sensors that Samsung has had you had to
sort of swipe your finger over it and it
never worked really well this
implementation we just put your finger
over it works very very very well it's
on par with the new touch ID in the eye
6 and 6-plus setup Dixit surprisingly
long time you got to keep pouting your
finger over it once you get it set up it
works and works really well
another feature Samsung is really
touting is the DoubleTap to launch a
camera and that does launch the camera
really quickly I want to test the camera
a bit more it seems to have a kind of a
slower shutter speed I take pictures of
my son we're gonna upload a gallery of
pictures from these phones and by the
time he would take the shot he would've
already moves ended up a sort of like
blurry ghost face of him so I want to
test that a little bit more before I
comment on the camera I do really like
the design as I mentioned but still
camera um I don't like camera go go far
far far away camera hum also let's talk
about the screens here I've tested a lot
of phones with a lot of screens and I
can unequivocally say these are the best
screens I have ever seen on a phone
colors do look a little oversaturated I
get that but this screen looks awesome
you know sometimes gonna get a phone
there's like a sticker over it it has
like a picture of what the UI is gonna
look like the whole screen looks like a
sticker it almost even look real it is
incredibly a high quality so one
question that I had about the galaxy s6
edge came from the Galaxy Note edge the
edge side on the note was its own screen
so you serve lots of a screen real
estate here on the s6 edge it's one
continuous screen so ever you're
watching whether it's it's text or a
video does indeed wrap around I'm
speaking of the edge if you want to use
a third-party launcher it's kind of a
fun fact all the edge features will
still work with a third-party launcher
so I will say out of the two I think the
s6 edge looked cooler but I don't know
how useful the edge is gonna be yet I
mean so let me ask you this what are you
more likely to do to check the time on
your phone go like this and we put the
show up we're just go like this and just
be like oh it's 948 it's probably more
likely what I'm gonna do
being able to flip it over into the
color show while people are calling you
as a neat feature - I don't know how
much I would use it it definitely looks
really cool though
so talking to the guys in the office
here and I think this would have boiled
down to at least for me if somebody
handed me both phones it said John
here's a galaxy s6 and a galaxy s6 edge
they're free - you pick the one you
I picked the edge but if I was buying
one and I had to put my own money behind
it their 100 our price difference from
the two I think I just come to the
galaxy s6 it looks really cool in its
own right doesn't have that sort of wow
factor I guess that the two curved sides
the edge has but still does exactly the
same thing so I want to test whether or
not the edge features are going to be
worked at extra money so I know you guys
probably have that question too but I
can't say first impressions I would
happily use these phones the screen is
awesome the phone looks ridiculously
powerful I've seen no lag at all and I
haven't ever run any benchmarks on it
again I still want to test you know how
the UI is going to perform over
different stresses that we do I want to
test battery life I will say though for
battery I've got a powered USB hub at my
desk and I plug the s6 edge in yesterday
with around 22% battery life 45 minutes
later it was up to almost 90 percent so
it does charge insanely fast didn't
charge that fast wirelessly and of
course wireless charging is built in
with pretty much every standard so if
you got a charge for patio you just
throw it on it and charge did get a
little warm though while doing the
wireless charging so I want to keep
testing testing that the speakers on the
bottom it sound pretty solid I'll but I
did find when I was watching video I'll
just use the s6 edge here I kind of held
it like this it's sort of where I would
go to hold it and my fingers were
blocking a speaker but I can probably
hold it the other direction and that
would go away so I want to keep testing
that as well my big questions that I had
going in and I want to sort of boil this
down for you build quality is awesome
TouchWiz is infinitely better here so if
you were sort of nervous about both of
those I don't think you really have to
be any more sure I would have liked
expandable storage and I would have
liked you've had a movable battery but
that's not here you know that going in
so consider these phones filled they're
gonna be able to live with the 32 64 128
gate configurations no all of that going
in both these phones seem really nice so
far and I think I could see myself using
both of these for the long term in fact
after first impressions I think I would
probably happily sign a contract to use
one of these phones whether or not you
want spend the extra money for the edge
is going to be up to you anything else
you guys want to see us test in the full
review let us know and put it down below
make sure we go over it in more depth I
just want to share my first impressions
and of course check out TechnoBuffalo
I hit the big subscribe button to get
the videos as they come to you we're
gonna have a lot more coverage of these
phones including gallery tests stress
tests and battery tests and everything
in between that we can possibly test and
benchmark for you give you a thumbs up
you always appreciate it until next time
I'm John render from TechnoBuffalo so
yeah the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
