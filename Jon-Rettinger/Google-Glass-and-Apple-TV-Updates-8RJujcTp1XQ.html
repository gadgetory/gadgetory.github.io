to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back there episode of
ask the Buffalo I am a buffalo I'm John
renders to show where you could ask me
any question you've got from the wide
world of technology if you want to get a
question answer on a future episode
every tuesday we put an article up on
the site asking for questions you can
leave in the comments otherwise anytime
of day day or night you could send me a
tweet either at john for lakers or at
TechnoBuffalo just use hashtag ask the
beam will pick four or five depending on
the week of this week it's all about
google glass next-gen iphone apple TV
and what my favorite tech of all time is
this is that's the buffalo let's start
asking first questions comes from
twitter at dallas henley asks at john
for lakers when do you expect google
glass to go public and how much do you
think they will cost so the answer is
probably not very soon in way less than
1500 the Explorer program is opening up
to more people pretty much anybody who
wants it can get in but fifteen hundred
dollars is crazy no google glass has got
a bit of a tough reputation users are
being called anything from glass holes
they're being banned in some restaurants
people to remember this is not a
consumer product quite yet they're
partnering with oakley and other glasses
manufacturers to make it sort of more
consumer friendly look less computer on
your face ish i would wager that we'll
hear more about google glass come io
time but i don't think we're going to
see a production version until probably
early 2015 now would wager about half
price off that fifteen hundred dollars a
week where we'll see so between seven
eight hundred bucks i think is going to
be the final cost probably as much as
you would expect to pay for an unlocked
top-of-the-line cell phone i think is
really where the market can tolerate i
don't think we'll see anything anymore
than that the next question comes from
twitter as well at emory 99 eunice asks
at john for lakers what killer feature
do you think the next-gen iphone would
have out of you think that means would
have or should have but here is what i'm
hoping screen please bigger screen i
know android phones have had it forever
but a giant screen size these hanging
better than four inches would certainly
be a killer feature i think for a lot of
iOS faithful perhaps a lot of android
users to jump ship from iOS because they
wanted a bigger screen size I've said
this every year it's like a broken
record come iphone time but a redone
iowa
that gives you a quick way to view
information some way stiller to live
tiles on Windows Phone or widgets on
Android s be a quicker way to view
information then opening up an
application to get to it a notification
center doesn't do it for me to pull down
to the keep information I need some way
to quickly view information may be some
way of apps running if I could take any
feature from Android and port it it
would be the widget system I think at
Google nailed that one knocked out of
the park I would love some way to be
able to do that you in many applications
on an iphone but end of the day a bigger
screen would probably get a lot of
people to use it but what would your
killer feature be what is the one
feature you want next-generation iphone
to have in order for you to pick one up
to upgrade your iphone switch back from
another platform or switch to iOS having
never use it before i love to hear your
thoughts next let's go to user add Giga
tweet s at John for lakers with the fire
TV out do you think apple will make the
apple TV less of a hobby more of a
serious iOS device to compete so apple
sold millions of Apple TVs ago they've
always claimed it's just a hobby we're
hearing rumors that a new apple TV is
going to be coming very very very soon
I've been rumored that Apple was trying
to compete with the cable companies and
actually sort of kill them by offering
some server either original contents or
offer the channels on their own without
cable companies at all now we're hearing
to taking a different approach and maybe
working worth cable companies to create
some sort of ala carte service that they
get a cut of so even as things stand
right now just a streaming devices I
think the current Apple TV and its
current state if it's pretty nicely with
the fire TV but where the fire TV I
think takes the edge first applications
you've got an app store you can download
games you could play it on your fire TV
and of course being able to do voice
search is really awesome if this was
bizarre Gary Busey try to be commercial
to do anything people really like to use
your voice to search and it's a lot
easier than going to type every letter
of what you're looking for and how does
my noise boom boom boom I do think
though the next generation apple TV is
coming I think it's going to be a more
full fledged iOS device with its own app
store they able to support third-party
Bluetooth controllers or perhaps
something that Apple does first party I
think it'll have games so I think
looking at what the fire TV is doing is
a be a very similar model for the next
generation apple TV is
going to beast whether or not amazon
knew that tried to be able to the punch
or whether or not amazon was just first
to do it an apple is going to be reacted
to compete as yet to be seen take a
break the questions for one quick second
to think of friends and overall good

game on your phone or downloading an app

beauty you / technobuffalo and back to
the questions and for the last question
user at non underscore patel one asked
hashtag ask to be what's your favorite
tech device of all time that's a really
tough one to answer because it depends
on the time but the first thing that
came to mind not something you guys
expect but the original blackberry pearl
i absolutely love them questions not
what's the best tech of all time i think
that always sort of depends on you know
where you're at so right now it's
probably the best tech of all time
because tech advances i remember when i
first got that blackberry pearl i loved
it push email was incredible i loved it
it was small I could still type fast on
it had two letters per key and I got
really quick at it the camera was usable
I could play music it was thin it was
light I loved that device that was what
I was using the day the original iPhone
came out 2007 and I remember doing a
size comparison of the initial iPhone
and I should have sort of given more
heed to that moment because it's are the
changing of the guard going from sort of
almost analog sale controls it's a
digital
only was a real big change but maybe was
a simpler time for me but I honestly I
really loved that original blackberry
pearl was surviving blackberry at its
peak when they finally sort of got what
the consumers wanted and focusing a
little bit less on business that was
probably my favorite piece of tech of
all time maybe if Nintendo original
Nintendo to it probably in there the
first year these kids in my mind was a
blackberry pearl thank you guys for
watching hope you enjoyed i love doing
these questions please keep me come ask
me whatever you want whenever you want
