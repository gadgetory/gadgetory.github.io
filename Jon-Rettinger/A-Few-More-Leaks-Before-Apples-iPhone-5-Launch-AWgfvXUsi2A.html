to you by full sail university hello
there folks is John Q here from
technobuffalo hope you guys are doing
fantastic filling in for mr. noak a dog
Kravitz and up this week on rumor
roundup lots of apple news and rumors
and I know I know apple news some people
are like Oh apples so fantastic look at
their store always filled with stuff and
people always smells like feet or if
you're on the upper other end of the
spectrum you might be all like ooh Apple
you what's this guy who goes to
starbucks is like a macbook throne and
iPad any orders like this venti chai
latte with mocha sprinkles and two shots
of cappuccino espresso makers whatever
the case may be stick around law stuff
has been going on this week including
the releases of a couple of new phones
from Motorola and Nokia including their
new Motorola RAZR MAXX razr m razr HD
and Nokia Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 you
can find the coverage and the videos of
those guys over on TechnoBuffalo as well
as the TB YouTube channel yesterday
amazon recently released a bevy of new
devices 5 in fact three of which are
real contenders in the current tablet
market especially in the 7-inch $200 but
still really really awesome tablet
category than Amazon apparently started
with their first kindle fire for me
seven inches seems like the perfect size
for a tablet it's big enough to casually
web browse watch videos read all in one
hand plus if you're like me and you like
to play with your phone or tablet in bed
and this lying down phone is dangerously
over your face position and you happen
to drop your tablet on your face and it
happens to be 7 inches it probably won't
hurt as much I've done that yep I've
done that more than once for sure more
than once and I'm sure I'm not the only
one who does that but that's the price
of success price of success my friends
pictures of the iPad Mini 3 or she'll
have recently been really onto the
interwebs with a design similar to that
of the heavily rumored mocked up and
leaked iphone 5 the shell seems to
indicate that the mini might be slightly
thicker than the current gen ipad and
that impossibly might belong to the
Wi-Fi only very
judging from the lack of SIM card slot
thingy and the lack of the black strip
you get with your ipad 3g models after
spending an additional hundred fifty
dollars the photos also detailed the new
magsafe style dock connector now of
course you won't be able to use your
current ipod or iphone 30-pin flat dock
connector with the new devices but
according to ilounge the new USB to mini
mag style dock connector cables will go
for around ten dollars each but wait
apparently for the low low price of
twenty nine dollars you can get a three
pack of those new magsafe mini dock
connectors saving you one dollar which
you can use to buy something somewhere
else because everything I mean
everything in the apple store is so
offensively expensive I was never a fan
of the old dock connector cables they
are so cheaply made an apple sells them
for like twenty dollars each you can get
them from ebay for around a dollar but
they kind of crap out after a few months
and I think they might avoid the
warranty I'm not too sure but it's a
principles gosh darnit principles
continuing down our journey of all
things apple you know that infamous
Apple TV set-top box thingy that
everyone's been raving about this year
well it looks like the thing might not
be coming out at least not anytime soon
bloomberg reported that Apple struggled
to reach deals with cable operators and
that the cable folks wanted more control
over apple software which we know is a
no-go when it comes to that Almighty
Fruit Company from Cupertino what is
coming soon of course would be the new
iphone on September 12th to be exact as
indicated by Apple's invite teaser pics
stylistically showcasing the number 12
for the date and the number 5 in the
shadow very clever stuff if you want to
take a sneak peek of the new iphone 5
ahead of time there was a video lead to
recently of a quote accidentally
discovered iphone 5 prototype it just
shows a thing booting up next to the
current gen iphone nothing exciting or
fancy but if it is a real deal you can
definitely get a good sense of the new
dimensions and slightly longer screen
not much of a design change but a change
