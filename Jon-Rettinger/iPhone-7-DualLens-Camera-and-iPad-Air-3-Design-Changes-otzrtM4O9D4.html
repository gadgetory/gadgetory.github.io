from technobuffalo here it seems like a
good week to bring back rumor roundup
because we got a lot of good rumors to
round up this week let's start with the
Big Daddy the ipad air three according
to sources from engadget the ipad or
through it supposedly which will see at
an apple event in march will be almost
identical in dimension to the ipad air 2
so thin light with presumably chunky
bezels but on said chunky bezels or
beside them you will now have four
speakers allah the ipad pro also quoting
cute and gadgets we're also can have an
LED flash on the back which we
relatively new for appellees from the
tablet front also new for Apple if you
believe the folk to digitize which I
sometimes feel like they just throw a
dart at rumors they're like this is
going to happen the ipad air through
allegedly again according to two times
out pro the ipad pro with a 4k screen
and four gigs of ram but i put that one
in the just not gonna happen category i
guess would be the point of having an
ipad pro if your ipad air through is
better which one what we think about
apple calling things pro have I got a
video for you lastly let's talk about
iphone 7 i'm not gonna insult your
intelligence by something you don't know
that i oppose the legend removing the
headphone jack from the iphone 7 we know
that come on so it looks like we've got
renders to show you that is not the
rumor the rumored this week is what's to
be used to take pictures on the back of
said iphone according to the folks at
KGI securities which admittedly of a
spotty record of fast after was testing
two different versions of the iphone 7
plus one of the traditional single cam
sensor on the back with machine on every
iphone and one with dual sensors on the
back foot suppose we take advantage of
new technology from a company apple
bought last year called linux line line
line x societal offering better
sensitivity to light overall better
image quality but also that sensors to
be smaller getting rid of them ugly
camera humps that we've seen on current
gen iphones another nice benefit will be
optical zoom stabilization so if you do
a lot of this on your phone we're taking
pictures it should look like this on
your screen or eventually hit that
shutter button the garcon apple does the
camera department just a little bit late
game free testing and not have a final
design already set in stone other
improvements so you can expect at the
Iron Throne 73 some crossing my fingers
will be wireless charging on board as
well in addition to a new design
supposedly waterproofing on board as
well be some version of waterproofing
the call rumors don't take it with a
giant grain of salt you know what Apple
is gonna do until output goes ahead and
does it I mean I feds I which would be
something in March I mean I feel inside
towards September what do you guys think
what excited about want to hear your
thoughts on it give video a thumbs up
through always appreciate it so next
time you John right you can
technobuffalo so yeah the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
