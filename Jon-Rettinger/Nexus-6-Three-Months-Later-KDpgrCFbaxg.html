to you by domain.com what's up everyone
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here
its Connor to believe but it's been
about three months the nexus 6 came out
and it's still just stupid hard to find
in fact as this filming all model sizes
and colors are sold out on Google Play
so I wanted to give an update how would
it's been like which change in the past
three months a lot has changed our
initial review so disclaimer my testing
was done on the same blue unlocked
version that I used in our review 15 the
review will link it right here or down
below can go ahead and check that out go
watch it and come back here I'll wait
for you reviewing a device like this is
kind of tough everything is new
hardware's brand new software is brand
new so even though we spent weeks with
the device for reviewing it I'm still
learning more and more about it as I go
on so that was appropriate now three
months later to sort of give some
updated thoughts because things have
changed so in the review I was kind of
tough on the screen I initially thought
that it seemed good but not as good as a
spec sheet of five point nine six inches
2560 x 1440 would probably make you
believe I have soft in that stance a
little bit the more I use it the more I
noticed the sharpness and tweaking the
saturation of the display helped a huge
amount so i don't think the screen is as
good as a qHD displays that Samsung's
put out it's definitely better than
initially give it credit for the more I
use a lollipop also the more I could
appreciate the nuances there it's not
just a fresh coat of paint it feels
leaner faster more capable more
intuitive things on here just absolutely
blazingly fast you're probably thinking
like I am no crap it feels fast John
it's got a Snapdragon 805 and three gigs
of RAM that would probably make anything
feel zippy and yeah ID argh you're right
combination of ridiculous hardware and
very capable software makes it makes us
a smartphone users dream I also really
liked it the unlocked version is fully
compatible with AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and
Verizon up tested and all three and
everything work including cdma and
rising so you guys have asking about
that your no riot doesn't have an
official version out yet another small
note something i really liked until
attention to detail that motorola did i
really like the textured power button
makes it very easy to find on the phone
the volume up and down is right below
its your finger cut it naturally goes
there but it makes it really easy to
find Heather textures on it nothing
giant huge deal at Motorola did but I
really like
having that they're also had reports of
the back popping off here we had no such
issues at all on our test devices so
maybe those are a vocal minority but the
ones that we've had we've seen no issues
but I like big phones I always have ever
since the original note going back to
the old dell streak this film note still
feels gigantic to me and I've got very
large hands it's not just the height the
width can make it really tough to hold
and navigate it's not so big that I
wouldn't use it but it's big enough this
was the only phone i plan on using for a
year or longer besides would definitely
give me a moment or two of pause my
advice though try it out first to make
sure you're okay at this I especially if
you plan on putting a case on it that's
going to make it just even giant ER cuz
i mentioned the disclaimer we test the
blue version it looks gorgeous in
pictures but in reality it looks kind of
gross after you hold it even with clean
hands get a case or go for the gray
model the camera on the back much like
the Moto X is still kind of blah my
opinions I had initial review i think
still hold water here it's fine ideal
situations but not low light it's not
great again it's not awful but it's far
for me the best camera out there if
you're taking pictures and ideal
conditions you've got your outside
plenty of sunlight they're going to look
great but you dropped late a little bit
start to look a little washed out we
stopped real fast thank our friends at
domain.com there a place to go where the
next great ideas going to hit you it's
one-stop shopping for all your domain

Dunn ninja cuz i am one the guys at
domain.com want hook our fans up to it's
a pretty solid deal so say fifty percent
on domain names and web hosting when you
use coupon code technobuffalo that's one
word technobuffalo lowercase at
domain.com check out baxa video i do she
had external storage but you know going
in its not going to have it so you make
it works like a wit on the iphone i
would have been nice if it was theirs in
the android supports that motorola mitad
it so you can get up 64 gigs does you'll
be able to make that work size-wise and
of course you get a ton of clouds to
wear
through google or any other third
parties so i love this phone still I've
never said this about a device before
though but I wish it was a little bit
smaller if you like a big daddy phone
though it can be really hard press find
anything better this is incredibly well
SPECT phone it's very well built it's
got a beautiful display very powerful do
anything you want three customizable is
Android you know always is you're
getting the latest from google get the
most updates as they come the most
up-to-date software that Android has
getting a really solid great experience
so if you don't mind a huge phone you're
not gonna find much better than the next
