and from TechnoBuffalo and who'd ever
thought we'd see today when we could
play video games on our wrists
the Apple watch launched nearly two
weeks ago and while it's mostly meant to
feed you notifications and remind you to
stand up it's not just for productivity
there are a lot of fun games too and
these are five we think you should check
out number one on our list is trivia
crack which is free trivia crack is all
about answering trivia questions from
geography to history to science and
sports is probably the most talked about
game late last year coming out for both
iOS and Android it's a dick thing fun
and very challenging and the new
wearable version can be played entirely
on your Apple watch as long as you have
a game queued up or if it's your turn to
answer questions when it's your turn to
play you'll receive a notification on
your wrist to launch trivia crack or
dismiss it for later playing trivia
crack on the Apple watch isn't bad at
all despite it having a much smaller
screen but it works just like how it
does on mobile you'll be able to spin
the wheel answer your questions and
accept requests from other people
directly on your wrist number two on our
list is letter pad which is also free
letter pad is a cool puzzle game that
presents you with a tile of letters a
category and a number of letters that
the puzzle is looking for the goal here
is to try to create words to fit the
spaces that are provided some puzzles
can be really easy and some can be very
hard but luckily you can force touch the
screen to use hints or shuffle the words
and plain letter pad on the Apple watch
is a little frustrating due to the
smaller screen size but nonetheless
continuity between the iPhone and the
Apple watch is great I can start a game
on my iPhone and pick up where I left
off on my Apple watch instantly it's a
super addicting game that keeps your
brain active number three on our list is
rules which is going for $2.99 rules is
probably one of the best brain teasers
on the Apple watch it looks simple at
first but it's really not it's because
the game is designed to trip you up with
every turn changing the rules on a fly
and confuse and bewilder players if
you're looking to warm up your brain on
a way to work or just looking to pick up
a game they could get you to think more
quickly playing rules is a good start
the game displays four colorful icons on
the Apple watch and begins with one
simple rule like tap in ascending order
and after each stage the rules add up to
a point where it can get pretty
confusing because you'd really have to
memorize the rules and
order to clear the stages the rule is
then reset until you memorize up to ten
rules for a board number four is box pop
which is free from the app store box pop
is like a chess game but you only need
to know how the knight crosses over a
chess board to advance through the
puzzles the boards display a bunch of
boxes your starting point and it's up to
you to move to the other boxes in an
effort to line on every box complete the
level and move on to the next stage
once you pass a few stages you'll start
seeing more boxes you can land on but
the more boxes that are available the
more you need a thing one false move can
end the game instantly so be careful
when making a move because you can only
move in an l-shape just like how a
knight would in chess number five on our
list is letters app which is free from
the app store letters app is another
word game that I really enjoy but unlike
letter pad you're given letters and
spaces to fill within 10 seconds the
goal here is to create as many words as
you can in a short timeframe there's no
other competition there aren't any
stages to go through the only
competition here is time so don't
overthink too much however there is
another mode in letters app called Zen
mode which essentially gets rid of the
timer and allows you to play the game at
your leisure it's the exact same game
you'll need to create as many words as
you can and beat your old high-score you
achieve gaming on the Apple watch
obviously isn't ideal because of its
small screen but it's still fun most of
the games we played on the Apple watch
are all very simple games that aren't
very graphic intensive however the
thought of playing an actual video game
on a watch is still a crazy idea to me I
think it's really cool that I can play a
game like trivia crack on my wrist
though again it doesn't quite offer the
same experience as playing on an iPhone
or an iPad still developers are hard at
work trying to develop games for the
Apple watch and hopefully we'll see more
games that are both visually appealing
and fun anyways thank you guys so much
for watching and if you guys liked this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and make sure to hit that subscribe
button and we will see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
