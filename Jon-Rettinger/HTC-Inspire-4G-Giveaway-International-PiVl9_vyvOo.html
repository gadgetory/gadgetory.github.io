gives it away but it is giveaway time
which is coincidentally one of my
favorite times it's just a way for me to
thank you for your support and for just
letting me do what I love I'm geek i'ma
nerd whatever you want to call it I love
technology and you guys give me the
opportunity to get to do this for a
living and there's a way to say thank
you so we gave xbox 360 the way all
kinds of fun stuff this time I am
teaming up with the folks at 80 mg to
give away two hot new phones actually
aren't even out yet we've got two htc
inspire 4G to get out these things are
brand new still sealed not even opened
up right there you can see it on Noah
technobuffalo own did a full unboxing of
this guy and reviews are coming up it's
so new we haven't finished our review on
it but this is a hot hot hot phone it's
funny to say AT&amp;amp;T and 4G right now but
this is running on their new hspa+
network which they just kicked off so
you're going to get some pretty fast
download speeds if he ran hspa+ area
you're going to get a 4.3 inch screen
already to write a 4.3 inch screen
android 2.2 with HTC Sense 8 megapixel
camera HD recording Wi-Fi mobile hotspot
capability and the ability to talk and
surf at the same time so the folks at 18
key were nice enough to donate these
phones to help raise awareness for their
talk and surf campaign that they are
running on their Facebook page they'll
be a link down below which is ATT com
know and just att.com / facebook what
they're saying and asking you to do is
to try not using the talk and surf
feature so simultaneous voice and data
for 48 hours just to see if you can live
without it you know it's certainly a
pretty clear why than doing this
campaign gsm
so these currently can do simultaneous
voice and data where some evdo networks
have some difficulty so that is sort of
the awareness campaign that is going on
so if you like these giveaways and the
chance to sort of give cool stuff

them so take a look down below so what
are we going to do for the giveaway and
actually I have something even better as

three of them so i have three
consolation prizes to give away if you

some sponsored giveaways with US
carriers I've had to make it us only so
cue the awe in the background and you
guys had spoken and I've listened and I
don't like to make people unhappy
especially my audience that is so
incredibly high on the awesome scale so
what I'm going to do for this good one
