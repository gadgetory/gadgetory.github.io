technobuffalo here we are live from CES
2012 with the just-announced HTC Titan
to with its whopping 16 megapixel camera
and LTE speeds let's go ahead take a
first look at this guy and see if
deserves a place in your pocket thanks
to forex for powering our CES coverage
all right so first and foremost let's
talk about the specs of the Titan 2 and
then I'll walk you through it so we are
looking at 4G LTE speeds thumbs up for
that you've got that same 4.7 inch
display on it's always measure diagonal
that's a super LCD screen of course it's
capacitive it's rocking Qualcomm's
latest snapdragon chips a 1.5 gigahertz
s2 and that's a single core chip as I
mentioned on the back a real big deal
here is at 16 megapixel camera with
dedicated camera button that all windows
phone devices have right there it's got
autofocus dual LED flash f 2.6 28
millimeter a wide angle lens and 720p
video recording and also has a 1.3
megapixel camera on the front for
getting your video calling on or taking
your facebook profile page so let's talk
a little bit more about the design of
this it weighs five point two ounces the
4.7 inch display is wvga and that's a
LCD capacitive touchscreen of course
being powered by a pretty beefy 1730
milliamp hour battery alright so that's
all aspects let's take a look at the
device itself a little bit different
than the original Titan will have coming
up a Titan to vs tight in one video on
the front it looks very windows phone as
most windows phones do you do have
capacitive buttons down here they do
light up but you can see them all the
time which is nice on the back of the
phone we've got now a soft touch feel
I've got what appears to be a faux sort
of speaker all right there but that is
not a speaker it's got little soft touch
rubber fuel there's where the speaker
lives duly LED flash that's 16 megapixel
camera on the left hand side of advice
since we're going to charge with your
micro USB on the top power and lock
button my favorite position on the right
hand side 3.5 millimeter headset jack a
microphone for
always read duction tipping it over on
the bottom got another microphone and
that is about it for the spec so let's
take a quick look at some of the stuff
that's going to come on here let's go
ahead and jump on in so of course AT&amp;amp;T
stuff is going to be all over here when
the great things about Windows Phone is
the xbox integration so they've got some
xbox games in here I list surprisingly
this one does not have and I'll teach
connectivity right now she doesn't have
a sim card in it so let's see what else
are going to have HTC hub of course
marketplace messenger of people and YP
mobile is really the only eighteen t
Brenda application that's on this
pre-release device so I'll go ahead and
go back cuts it also going to be on the
home screen so you've got your calendar
and all your live tiles with the Metro
UI that we've come to know on windows
phone 7 so this will be coming out in
the coming months for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless
again this is going to be a 4G LTE
device and of course it'll be hspa+
capable if you're not in an LTE area I
am jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see you guys next video and if you
want to see what this looks like the 16
megapixel camera I will have a few
picture samples at the end of this video
see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
