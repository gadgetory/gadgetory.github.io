TechnoBuffalo comm showing off the asou
spawn pad note 6 this is a direct
competitor to the samsung galaxy note 3
so let's take a look at and see what
makes it so great so obviously the very
first thing you're notice 6 inch screen
1920 by 1080 it's it's actually very
quick it's really responsive which is
great and the reason it's so quick is
because it has a quad core a 2gig quad
core Intel Atom processor and obviously
support for 3G phones so you're gonna be
able to make phone calls on this 2
front-facing speakers and these are
actually optimized to give you really
full loud sound
here's your volume rockers right here on
the side and your sleep and power button
and on the back we have our 5 megapixel
camera and then here is your tray for
your SIM card and your microSD
expandable storage and the last thing is
of course right here a pen yes we're
gonna get into pen mode with this just
like we would anywhere else if you pull
the pen out it opens up super note which
is the asou sort of note-taking app so
you can see it has it does have a hover
guide so you can see where you're about
to tap the screen if you want to look at
something that they've made we can check
out this apple tart recipe so that's
what it looks like I can draw on it if I
want
and then it'll add this stuff over here
I'll show you in a second what that
looks like without an apple tart picture
if we go back and we want to create a
new page we can click on that and if I
type hi it'll actually add it right
there so so there it is hi and then you
can actually search that so and if you
want you can take a screenshot of it
which this is a really nice feature if
you do this it's like making a scan and
actually take a screenshot of whatever
was on your screen and your system bar
is locked so if you want to unlock it
you just pull that right back out and
it'll unlock it and you can go back to
doing whatever it is you want to do
Android 4.2.2 so doing pretty good most
recent most recent live version of
Android that phones are shipping with
for the most parts yeah good stuff
happening here I'm gonna put the put the
pen way it actually feels really solid
the pen one thing I actually like about
the note 3
that's a little bit different than this
is notice that little hitch right there
that's not happening anymore on the note
three it's actually a universal pen so
this is us maybe like one generation
behind in terms of pen insertion I guess
and like the fonepad 7 this is gonna
come in a crystal white you can see this
very nice sort of Sheen to it and I
satin Sheen the black one also has that
same arise me of the the back of the
Nexus 4 that is the asou spomb pad note
