from TechnoBuffalo comm and this is the
Samsung Epic 4G Touch comma galaxy s2 an
Android smartphone for Sprint that
honestly might just be the best Android
phone you can currently buy at least in
the United States why do I say that
let's find out
all right so I've had about a week now
with the Epic 4G Touch the first galaxy
s2 phone to hit a US carrier galaxy s2
introduced way back at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona this past February
and some of the phones have been
available in other parts of the world
for a little while now this is the first
u.s. variant to come we will see AT&amp;amp;T
mobile versions very soon we hope the
AT&amp;amp;T one we thought would be out already
but it's not yet and then the the rumor
is that Verizon will not be getting a
Galaxy s2 because instead the galaxy has
to phone because instead they will be
getting a Galaxy Nexus or Nexus Prime
depending on which rumors you believe
but in any rate the first galaxy s2
phone to hit the states and as we talked
about in the unboxing video also I
should mention those of you who like to
read there's a full written review over
on TechnoBuffalo comm as well but what
Sprint and Samsung did is they stretch
this thing out it's a four point five
two inch display they also added an LED
notification light at the top there
which was blinking a second ago which is
a handy there goes a really handy
feature that I for one so one of those
things that I don't really appreciate
until I have it and then use the phone
like this or you know blackberries or
what-have-you other phones that have
that notification light it's like wow
that's so handy because I don't have to
turn my phone on to check to see if I
have new email or new messages or
whatever I can just glance at it see if
the lights blinking of the way it's not
blinking to go back to my business
anyway those are kind of the two key
most noticeable differentiators this
device against the rest of the galaxy s
line and then of course the size and so
here's the here's the last device that I
checked out for Sprint also a samsung
made Android phone it's the conquer 4G
three and a half inch display the Epic
4G Touch 4.5 2 inch display you know
what before I got this thing I thought
you know this is a nice size I'm not it
could be a little bit bigger but I'm not
yet on that huge screen bandwagon I
don't know they just for you know more
than four inches just seems too big four
inches even might seem too big then I
got this thing and I used it for a while
and partially it's because you know I
haven't had time with all of the latest
high-end Android phones recently because
John gets some of them might get some of
them I get some of them and you know I
get to see him at trade shows that kind
of thing but don't necessarily use them
for a long time and part of it is
because this phone is so thin and so
lightweight
it's a little bit thicker than the
original Galaxy S 2 but still thinner
than 10 millimeters and it's incredibly
lightweight and carrying it around in my
pocket for a week it doesn't feel any
different than a different phone doesn't
feel any different really than having
you know an iPhone 4 in my pocket or the
other phones I've been using lately
because it's just it's thin and it's
lightweight and once it's in the pocket
once I get used to it as long as it fits
in there and I don't wear skinny hipster
jeans cuz I'm not skinny or a hipster
once it gets in there you don't really
notice it it's just a phone so that
being said this thing is blazing fast
Sprint's Network aside which is a big
consideration we'll talk about that in a
second this phone just flies through
things the dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor Samsung net processor is fast
the dual core Samsung processor the
screen is responsive 4.5 2 inch 800 by
480 it's WVGA resolution we do sort of
wish it was it was a a qHD display
because frankly qHD and this thing would
look even better but as it is it really
looks nice Super AMOLED plus display
it's very vivid very rich will look real
quickly at here's some video that I shot
find this video in the gallery you can
see the TouchWiz user interface I don't
find it all that obtrusive I know
Android purists
likely you know are gonna root the phone
and put something else on it which is
cool me I don't really find out all that
obtrusive there's some bloatware on here
honestly it's more sprint stuff than
Samsung stuff that gets in the way but I
think the UI looks pretty nice but here
we'll look at the look at the gallery
here and here's some video I shot this
1080p video I shot outdoors
and you might have seen this already
it's posted to YouTube it's 1080p sample
this is the intro I shot outdoors and
then there's some stuff I shot at the
TechCrunch reader meetup which is
indoors and bad lighting and I'm not
talking about the camera just talking
about the display the display very vivid
the colors pop rich you get that depth
of field you know as best as you can on
a screen the size that's a 2d screen and
really it's just it's fantastic I would
put this up there you know honestly
probably just below the iPhone 4 Retina
display which yeah and the Droid Bionic
qHD the little bit of time I spent with
it also up there as well because you're
lacking that super dense pixels per inch
and again that's where a qHD on here
might have done a little bit better but
it's still it's a fantastic display
suffers a little bit in direct sunlight
otherwise really really good as I said
the processor flies along Sprint's
Network you know where I am it's less
than impressive when pitted next to the
4G offerings from Verizon and t-mobile
but where you are it might work better
calls have been solid the Wi-Fi has been
solid getting back for a second to the
Samsung TouchWiz interface you know
you've got your Android widgets on here
you've obviously got some of that sprint
sprint add-ons that I left on there as
well and then you've got some of the
Samsung widgets and then some of the UI
elements if we go in here click and hold
add to home so I want to add a widget
and I've got this little scrollable
thing at the bottom so some differences
from stock stock Android I think it's
kind of user friendly you know I sort of
dig it I know some people won't it is
what it is again I don't think it's that
obtrusive it's definitely less obtrusive
than older versions of TouchWiz
swearing's cut or Samsung rather is
cut-down they've eliminated you know
several of their hubs and some of the
other things so a little bit easier to
use and a little bit less offensive to
the Android purists out there I'm sure
or I would hope if we go to messaging
here we'll take a look I actually the
phone comes pre-installed with swipe and
I'm not the biggest fan of swipe or the
Samsung default keyboard frankly because
I tend to I still touch typing out
with my thumbs as opposed to using swipe
so I went ahead and installed Swift key
at the advice of a couple folks that I
know who recommended it and so far I've
been liking a swift key pretty well and
the screen you again it's big enough to
really afford a lot of room for somebody
like me who's used to the thumb typing I
really like the blackberry bold because
you know it has the physical keyboard
I've turned haptic feedback off just cuz
you know I don't really like the haptic
feedback all that much and also on this
phone as with many Samsung phones the
haptic feedback really makes you realize
how plasticky and all of this thing is
so the lightweight awesome the plasticky
hollow feeling not the best when haptic
feedback saan and you get the haptic
feedback it honestly kind of feels like
they're just spring in there going Boing
Boing Boing which is not the feeling
that I at least want out of my
top-of-the-line
bleeding-edge smartphone that being said
haptic feedback off works pretty well
and I'm really liking I'm really liking
SwiftKey myself even though I cannot
type and talk at the same time turn it
into the wide way and the wide way here
in horizontal orientation you just got a
ton of room for typing again you can
argue that if the screen was higher
resolution you could make even more use
you know with more pixels in a 4.5 2
inch display you could do even more that
being said it is what it is and at least
for somebody like me for typing you know
this is great and this is where I can
really see the benefit feel the benefit
of one of these larger displays
otherwise the camera the still camera
works very very well I think
it's an 8 megapixel camera with
autofocus LED flash you've got a 2
megapixel front facing camera for a
facing camera you know not much to write
home about but it works well for video
chatting self-portraits that kind of
thing the main camera one thing that's
really nice about it even though there's
no physical Hardware camera button which
is kind of a drag physical hardware
there's no camera Hardware button which
is kind of a drag one thing that's nice
is there's a virtual two stage camera
button so press
hold focus release in the shoe which is
kind of cool because you know it's kind
of like you can do a little bit more of
that thing that photographers do with
you know focusing you could do you know
I'm not going to be able to do it cuz
I'm a terrible photographer but Mike
Pearlman I'm sure could do it I could
focus here on but I could focus say on
animal and then bring it back over here
I don't know that's not related to it
but you can do some of that kind of
stuff from my perspective as a total
hack photographer as a point-and-shoot
camera really works well impressed with
the quality of photos especially in
natural lighting conditions you know the
flash isn't gonna do a ton for you but
it's a camera phone where you gonna do
as for the camcorder itself you can
check out it posted to YouTube and also
on the site that sample video I shot the
intro of the video shot outdoors and
good lighting conditions you know pretty
good for 1080p its camcorder I mean it's
camera phone 1080p not standalone
camcorder 1080p so yeah it's a full
1080p resolution not as awesome as a
good camcorder in not so good lighting
conditions the other part of the video I
shot at the TechCrunch reader meetup you
get some blurring you know you get that
low-light suffer suffering of image
quality and I have the the flash on you
can leave the flash on continually when
you're shooting there's a digital zoom
which is controllable with the rapper
switch and there's the lock switch which
I didn't mean to hit but I was going to
show you that you can leave the light on
during videoing and that's what I did
when I was filming the part inside where
I was actually filming a Samsung
prototype Windows 8 tablet and you know
the light was necessary for getting the
image but it probably didn't help things
but at any rate they actually it's
interesting they actually shipped the
phone with 720p as the default instead
of 1080p because the image quality's a
little bit better but very good for
still pictures and definitely you know
definitely above average for video for a
camcorder but the 7h weet 720p quality a
little bit better than 1080p I was
trying to say 720p and 1080p at the same
time and I said 7/8 tweet I don't even
want to know
what that means otherwise what else can
I tell you battery life has been fine
although I found that trying to use four
G's SAP the battery particularly night
that I was in downtown San Francisco and
reception in general just not good and
the phone kept trying to find a signal
and latching on to signal then turning
off and that was kind of a drag call
quality has been very good the phone's
got this you know kind of plasticy
heavily feel on the back there it's
still got this chin on the bottom which
you know I don't know if that's there
for economics or just has to be there to
fit some of the innards inside sorta too
bad that's there but it doesn't really
get too much in the way overall it's a
solid solid smartphone it's a solid
solid Android phone I I you know really
liked it I've had some qualms like I
said with Sprint's performance but the
performance of the device itself has
been terrific if you don't like TouchWiz
and I think this is the least offensive
version of TouchWiz yet or looking at
another way the best version of TouchWiz
yet but if you don't like it you can
route it and what else can I tell you
one ninety nine ninety nine officially
on contract already has been discounted
around the web I would put this up here
up there with you know this device the
HTC Sensation for t-mobile I also like
quite a bit the mytouch 4G slide I like
quite a bit because it has a good
keyboard on it
but with the screen this big maybe you
don't need a keyboard that being said
the other variants of the galaxy 2's
coming soon to a US carrier near you
Alysha on Verizon in which case you're
probably gonna get the Nexus Prime or
Galaxy Nexus or whatever it's called
so overall a big thumbs up for the
device the biggest pros about it
superfast processor really rich vivid
display and to have a phone with the
display this big but it's still this
thin and lightweight is awesome cons I
would say Sprint's network performance
has been a con at least for me out here
in the San Francisco area I would also
say the plastic e feeling of the phone
you know is a con it's sort of a matter
of user preference but to me a little
bit of a con and yeah you know not that
TouchWiz if you're an Android purist and
you prefer
stock Android that would be a con as
well but overall my buying advice if you
want to go get an Android phone right
now arguably this is the best one out
there in America I say arguably
otherwise if you can wait wait a couple
of weeks because you know tis the season
for all these phones to be coming out
between now and you know Halloween
probably so you will have some more
choices in the near future there you go
let's get these other guys out of the
way and focus the Sprint Samsung Epic 4G
Touch Galaxy S 2 available now thanks to
the folks at Sprint for lending us this
one much more on this phone including a
written review if for some reason you've
gotten through this whole video review
and you want to know more about what I
think of this phone or more importantly
you can go over to the review and post
your own comments if you've used this
phone we'd love to know what you think
over on TechnoBuffalo comm so next time
my name is Noah thanks for watching Oh
