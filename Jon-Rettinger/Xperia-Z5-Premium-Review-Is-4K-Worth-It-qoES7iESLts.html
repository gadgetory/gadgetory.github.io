to you by domain.com
the sony xperia z5 premium is the very
first 4k smartphone in the world but
saying the z5 premium is a 4k smartphone
it's kind of like buying a universal
remote that supports all kinds of
devices and using it just for your TV
you could totally do it it just doesn't
make a lot of sense - here let me show
you what 4k video looks like on the sony
xperia z5 premium
okay that's it you've seen it all you've
seen all the 4k video that you can watch
because the only way that you can watch
4k video on the z5 premium is to either
watch a pre-loaded video or watch the 4k
content that you shoot with the camera
everything else on the device is
rendered at 1080 so yeah there's a 4k
display on the front but that's about
all it is sure it's representative of
where we're going and where the future
is going and what we can do now but in
practice it really just falls flat now
that's not to say that the z5 is crappy
or useless or not a great phone the z5
on its own without the premium tag is
actually a very good phone it's a little
more expensive than I'd like but it is
Sony's
flagship line so at a price of 629
pounds I really am expecting a lot it's
got a Snapdragon 810 under the hood some
decent camera optics front and back
three gigs of ram and a really nice
bright display in my seven days using
the device I didn't feel particularly
overwhelmed by the quality of the 23
megapixel camera on the back the app was
really messy there were way too many
modes you have to switch to turn on 4k
video it wasn't a great experience
overall and the quality of the photos
that it took were fine
subjects were pretty sharp but lower
light photos were a little noisier than
I would have liked and colors were very
very washed out I will say though that
two-stage shutter button on the side oh
I wish more manufacturers would put that
button on those devices I love having
that thing there and I used it a lot the
build quality also feels kind of weird I
don't know what it is about this phone
like on paper it seems like it should
feel awesome the glass the plastic the
combination of the two it just doesn't
really gel the outer edge feels too
cheap compared to the glass and the
glass is too fingerprint II compared to
everything else and it just feels like a
kludgy mess it's a little bit thicker
too because that fingerprint scanner is
on the right side which i think is a
great place for it but that added bulk
while I don't think we need thinner
smartphones this added bulk really does
make the whole thing feel like a bit of
a blocky sad
veiss I really like the placement of the
fingerprint reader on the side but it
did not perform very well in my
experience even just a little bit of
sweat is enough to get it to ask you to
try again and again and again granted
Brandon did not have the same experience
with his review so you can check that
out over on the site I do want to give
Sony props though this is the first om
skin since og cents way back in the day
that I actually really like things here
are actually material and it does seem
like Sony actually went to the extra
effort to make sure that things feel at
home on Android except for this glorious
Fantasia background that you can have as
a live wallpaper the z5 premium also
does have the water-resistant writing
that the z5 has so you absolutely can't
stick this thing in up to 1.5 meters of
water for up to 30 minutes so that is
definitely something to consider that's
not something that you get with the 6p
it's not something you get with
Samsung's devices so if you're looking
for something in the five six hundred
dollar price range that is
water-resistant and this might be the
phone for you if you're a die-hard for
Sony's Xperia Line then look picking up
a z5 makes perfect sense you know what
you're getting into picking up a z5
premium on the other hand makes no sense
at all whatsoever unless you're
interested in seeing what 4k looks like
on one particular video then you're not
gonna find a lot here for you since
everything in the UI from top to bottom
is rendered in 1080 yes that does get
you a crazy high pixel density of 801
PPI but are your eyes really that good
at that point it's really well beyond
diminishing returns and well into stupid
territory our eyes can only see so many
pixels per inch so going all the way up
to 801 definitely does seem like
overkill look I'm not one to balk at
progress but progress for the sake of
progress is a different thing entirely
in my book it's a little bit wasteful
look there's there's not a lot to do
with a 4k display on a smartphone just
yet we just can't handle outputting in
4k all the time so while I appreciate
that it's possible now just because you
can doesn't mean you should and in the
case of the z5 premium you
as I was doing this review I was
thinking domain so I was thinking
domain.com and I wouldn't made sure that
what is 4k dot video was indeed
available for you guys to pick up so you
can head over to domain.com use the code
TechnoBuffalo and get yourself 20% off
of the domain what is 4k dot video which
we apparently need because there isn't a
whole lot of 4k video to watch on the z5
premium anyway that was a sweet domain
that you guys can register and remember
when you're thinking domains
I think domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
