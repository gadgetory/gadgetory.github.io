TechnoBuffalo here with a smartphone
Smackdown I'm going to put the iPhone 5s
head-to-head against the brand new Nexus
5 with a new fresh approach let's go
ahead put these two heavyweights
together and pick away one of the more
difficult head-to-head videos I've ever
had to film I did a little bit
differently I set out with really one
goal so first assume you don't have a
platform Allegiance and are just looking
for a new device and considering these
two you walk into a store these are both
sitting in front of you we don't usually
get the chance to compare two devices
that came out so close together
especially flagship ones usually they
got five or six months separating them
and that is just an eternity the
smartphone world so for each category I
broke it down by which phone I'd pick
was only basing my decision on that
category alone I really want to make
this a real world usage test so let's
start with screen on paper this should
be an absolute blowout the Nexus 5 is a
bigger four point nine five inch screen
and doesn't go into the absurb fabula
you know six plus inch category Nexus 5
is a way better resolution in 1920 by
1080 in a better PPI a-- 445 versus a
326 on the iPhone 5 but the story isn't
just in specs alone as we noted in
review the Nexus 5 screen looks kind of
washed out like they had a waterproof
screen protector on top of it similar
what we saw on some of the Sony phones
that actually are waterproof it looked
like things were just a little bit
washed out 11:36 by six forty four inch
Retina display still looks incredible
and difference in PPI is really next to
impossible to sort if you just look at
it side-by-side videos look incredible
on the 5s and I'd say the pictures look
a little bit better on it than the Nexus
5 but for me the bigger screen wins out
I pick up the Nexus 5 just based solely
on the screen alone I prefer a larger
screen size and I can just see more on
the Nexus 5 now let's talk about Cameron
again not all about the raw specs at all
both support 8 megapixel sensors I'm not
going to talk too much about aperture
optical image stabilization or software
that's a little with them apps to
replace what gets shipped so things like
photosphere panorama and slo-mo aren't
really gonna come to play here it's all
about real-world usage what I'm most
concerned about with this test though
camera isn't all on its it used to not
matter that much to me as long as
pictures look good on Facebook or
Instagram I was pretty happy and I
didn't care
then I had a son and somebody I'm taking
pictures and videos with absolutely
everything so when we tested the Nexus
5's camera it look
good instills but not great some images
especially in low-light looked
incredibly washed out in normal
conditions though pictures were pretty
good not the best of our scene but very
very serviceable video I thought there
was absolutely awesome that built-in mic
is probably the best I have ever seen on
a camera as I mentioned my kid kind of
comes back to the play here he sleeps a
lot and I don't want to wake up with the
flash plus it's kind of bad for his eyes
so low-light images are really really
important to me and here's for the
iPhone 5s really shine even without its
newfangled dual LED flash pictures at
virtually every condition just look
better video fidelity was probably a
wash on both devices but the mic the
Nexus 5 again was clearly better if this
told you anything my son was born I
picked up five s to the hospital with me
to use only as a camera
if camera is my deciding factor here I'd
pick up the iPhone 5s let's jump into
hardware I'm not gonna talk about 64-bit
versus quad-core again it's a rural
usage to test both of these phones are
insanely fast and well positioned to be
usable in the future what it's like to
pick up and hold these devices though is
really what's important to me to a lot
of people a phone is just a tool but to
me it's kind of an extension of who I am
that sends a message I really loved
unibody design on Apple's iPhones they
always do an incredible job with their
devices chamfered edges and machine
drilled holes and the cold when I pick
it up in the morning I just love that
feel however I switched back to an
iPhone it really says to me at that time
my life I'm striving for simplicity it's
like visiting an old friend I haven't
seen in a while we can just pick up
where I left off and feel like no time
has ever passed Nexus 5 though feels
incredibly solid to hold it for if it's
metal for textured plastics and it just
works the soft touch back feels really
good the ceramic buttons scream quality
and the elegant buttonless front looks
like a tech toy from the future each
time I hold it I'm really surprised by
the fitness of device remember I switch
back to Nexus 5 and they're pure Android
devices because I'm craving variety I
want something more than a background an
icon arrangements make the phone my own
I want information at the glance not
hiding inside an application this one
could really go either way like flipping
a coin but calling it a tie is a super
cop-out so today if I had to pick up one
based on just look and feel I go the
iPhone and gold so they all fit in the
room with these two devices as far as
I'm concerned is value for 349 bucks you
can get yourself a brand new 16 gig
Nexus 5 the color of your choice and not
get stuck in a two-year deal you can
easily take it to AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile or
Sprint and it's just going to work you
can sell it maybe a year later for about
half the cost to pick up whatever
you want the early termination fees no
hassle the iPhone and 16-gigabyte reform
can be had for 199 bucks 150 dollars
less but with a two-year deal so ask
yourself here's a kind of person that
likes to switch phones are you happy
it's what you have for a few years
that's really a big factor here to
purchase an iPhone unlocked and to do a
nexus 5 it's gonna cost you a whopping
649 clams certainly you'll make more
when you sell it but that's still a
gigantic pill to swallow in front you
want to go to a 32 gigabyte the waters
get a bit murkier only 100 bucks
separates a contract free Nexus 5 from
the 5s if you want more than 32 gigs on
Nexus 5 you're gonna be out of luck but
Apple is super happy to say a 64 gig
phone for me though I'm the kind of
person it likes to switch phones quite
often to couldn't guess the notion of
being on a two-year deal the single
device makes me really anxious and start
to sweat this one if I had to pick one
device based on price and value I'd go
to Nexus 5 every day of the week each
device has a ton of intangibles mr.
tough to put any particular category I
love the idea of touch ID even if in
practice doesn't always worked out well
for me I like NFC and face unlock on the
Nexus 5 the idea of using NFC to pay for
things at Google Wallet seems really
cool to me and I always feel jazz sees
it but rarely to ever get the chance to
actually put into practice I appreciate
how I can customize Android to suit just
me and if I don't like the experience
there's always a custom ROM or theme
that'll just make me smile again
yeah iPhone experience is simplistically
elegant and app experience in iOS is
still superior ironically though I've
got 802 11ac Airport Extreme router at
home and only the Nexus 5 supports the
faster bands the Nexus 5 nearly takes US
making it the winner in this competition
but just barely I could already hear the
anger but don't put too much stock in
who won or lost remember rocky lost to
Apollo but still came back to be the
champion both are incredible devices
depending on the time of the day which
where the wind blows could have gone
either way I love both of these phones
they're extremely premium top airline
phones you can't go wrong with either
device this is a real-world usage which
I picked up bass in different categories
I didn't want to put too much emphasis
on the specs or what speeds were or what
benchmarks X that doesn't translate to
how the real world usage is hope you
