TechnoBuffalo and this is a look at the
HTC hd2 which has the largest screen of
any smartphone available on the market
right now we're going to be taking a
look at this device compared to the
iPhone in future videos but we're gonna
start off by talking about the device
kind of on a higher level we're going to
talk about the hardware and the premise
behind the HTC Sense interface so let's
get started the device has a beautiful
thin design it's 11 millimeters thick
which is actually a little bit thinner
than the iPhone the screen is 4.3 inch
diagonal at WVGA resolution so that is
800 down and 480 across as comparison
the iPhone is 480 down and 320 across so
it's about double if you do the math in
terms of how many pixels there are on
the screen the screen goes from edge to
edge and all you really have are just
five Hardware buttons on the bottom here
and I'm going to zoom in a little bit
because they are adorned with a
beautiful brushed metal coating let's go
around the device a little bit on the
left side we have a volume rocker on the
bottom we have micro USB for syncing and
for charging and there's a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack which is great
so you don't have to get a converter
Jack or something like that and there's
the little microphone there is nothing
on the side or on the top turning around
to the back we see a beautiful piece of
real brushed metal so if I take this off
which is kind of difficult let me give
it a try
and I flick it you can hear that it's
actually metal and not plastic as found
on a lot of other smartphones out there
the battery is of size twelve hundred
and thirty million hours this device has
pretty good battery life it'll get you
through about that day in a corner maybe
a day and a half with moderate amount of
usage I should mention that this device
right now is only available in Europe
but you can import it get it unlocked
and put it on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but it's
gonna cost you a lot right now this
device is about $700 but it's coming to
the u.s. in quarter 1 of 2010 rumor has
it that it's coming to t-mobile but we
haven't heard yet exactly where it's
coming on the top here we have a speaker
next to a 5 Meg
pixel camera and a dual LED flash so you
really get a lot of light from this
device when you're taking pictures with
the flash and then there's a nice
rubbery coating on the top of the device
up here and down here which makes the
device feel very firm in hand
okay so let's turn on the device this
device is running windows mobile 6.5
Professional so right off the bat you
get this unlock screen that is
characteristic of windows mobile 6.5 and
it's great because you can tap the
little lock icon and you get a drop-down
of any area that you can action on so if
you have a new SMS you'll have a little
SMS indicator a new email like I do here
you'll have an email indicator missed
calls voicemail and so on and what this
will do is if you unlock one of these
particular notifications you'll actually
be taken to that respective application
so it really saves you some steps I'm
just gonna unlock the whole device and
be taken back to this screen so let's do
a bit of an overview of the HTC Sense
interface you know that the Sense
interface first made its debut on the
HTC Hero it's comes in a very different
form on the hd2 but the concept is the
same
HTC has kind of put together these
multiple panels that are customisable
really and you can kind of get to them
by sliding your finger along the bottom
and the graphics on this device is
beautiful it runs on a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor and it has a
tremendous 448 megabytes of RAM of which
about 200 is usable so you can really
multitask a lot on this device here on
the main screen we have some pretty cool
things we have the weather clock and so
what it'll do is reach out with GPS to
find out where you are whether you're in
New York or Paris or Australia in a
particular city it's going to show you
the weather in the city that you're in
and it will also animate the background
with a beautiful weather animation let
me demonstrate sort of what that looks
like by going to the weather demo so if
it's sunny you will see a ray of
sunshine kind of go through the time if
it's raining you'll get a windshield
wiper that comes down and takes the
droplets off the screen if it's snowing
you get frost on the screen and so on
and so forth let me try to get the
weather animation to go let's see there
it is so right now it's cloudy and
clouds are sort of filtering in from the
sides very nice
now some other things that are useful on
this main screen we have a link right to
our calendar right here which takes you
to actually the calendar tab in HTC
sense also we have a very useful row of
icons down here and if you flick upwards
you get an additional four what you can
do is customize these to either be a
website or a contact or a program so you
can really access the things that you
like to use on a regular basis right
from this main screen if I tap on the
plus button and I say I want to add
another program I can flick down the
list it as beautiful flick scrolling so
you want to add the marketplace and
there it is going over to the right we
have favorite people and what this will
do it'll actually synchronize with
Facebook so if you see a little F in the
bottom left corner that means I've
synchronized that person's contact with
Facebook so it's pulling their
information and as we're going to talk
about in a future video it'll actually
pull down their birthday their Facebook
updates and their entire photo album or
albums if they have more than one so
it's a really smart way to sort of bring
together all of these people that you
call on a regular basis the next tab is
email and they make it really easy to
flick through your email quickly and
sort of see who has emailed you without
actually drilling into your email
application and we're going to talk
about this experience compared to the
iPhone in upcoming videos
jumping along a little bit we're not
going to cover everything here but we
have an integrated Twitter tab right now
so you don't actually have to launch the
Twitter application or download a
Twitter application you can use the one
that just comes built-in and it works
quite well so if you want to tweet
something new you tap up here what are
you doing you can attach a picture you
can attach your location if you want and
you just tap update when you're done you
can also see your mentions your direct
messages and your favorites from the
screen if we go to the right this is the
full weather forecast which again makes
use of that gorgeous background
animation and we can add additional
cities so I'm gonna add Paris let's say
I'm traveling here it is and here is the
weather for Paris right now and I could
flick between where I am now here in
Pennsylvania
or I can go back to Paris with beautiful
screen animations going over to the
right we have a stocks tab which is very
simple and if you want to see more about
a particular stock you tap on it and you
tap there for details right now I am
over edge if you import this device from
Europe you're only going to get edged
you're not gonna get 3G coverage but of
course you do have Wi-Fi if you want to
use that here we are in the photos and
videos tab which makes really good use
of the powerful Snapdragon processor
watch this if I turn over into landscape
I get this beautiful animation that lets
me flick through pictures and let's say
I want to see this one it comes forward
in a beautiful animation and it has
pinch-to-zoom like the iPhone this is
the first time Windows Mobile has been
able to do multi-touch and it's really
implemented very very well I think
thanks in part to the really fast
processor so let's go back into portrait
so that was just a quick look at the HTC
hd2 the screen is absolutely gorgeous on
this device and it's a very good
contender for the iPhone if you ignore
the fact that the iPhone has a hundred
thousand apps that you can download it's
seriously a very close contender in many
different ways as we're going to find
out in future videos where we talk about
the internet browsing experience the
multimedia experience and some other
things like that more coming soon on the
HTC hd2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
