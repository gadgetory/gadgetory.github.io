TechnoBuffalo here yesterday January 27
to the surprise of no one I will unleash
their iPad their much-rumored and much
type tablet while the announcement of a
tablet device wasn't so surprising the
specifics of it may have been a little
bit shocking to some certainly was an
roi believe of disappointment a little
bit about what the tablet was so I'm
going to give my take on the device
itself what I think about it or I think
that lies in the industry and really
whether I think it's going to be a
success let's go ahead and get started
this is not going to be a recap video of
all respects I did that yesterday post
announcement so first I think tablet is
definitely the way the pc market is
trending we've seen tablet devices be
announced from HP toshiba asus and now
apple however the utility of a tablet
device I'm still not convinced about
your lacking a full physical keyboard
most of them lesser convertible tablet
sort of swirls out and you lose a lot of
the functionality of a standard laptop
or even a netbook so I'm a bit uncertain
and unsure so what the niche market is
for the tablet I initially thought that
Apple is going to sort of carve that out
with a magazine ebook text book reader
but they didn't announce that yesterday
I think the most exciting thing about
the tablet and the iPad in particular
isn't what Apple announced but the
potential for the device itself what
they sort of unleashed yesterday is
nothing really more than a fat bigger a
little more horsepower ipod touch you
know it does browsing it's got the
e-book reader sort of talked about in a
minute but didn't bring any
revolutionary features that people were
expecting an apple is often a victim of
their own successes an apple has
innovated so many times in the past
people expect a revolutionary device
every time Steve Jobs Act stage and
unfortunately that's just not always
possible so you look at the ipad to the
rumors that preceded it front-facing
camera Oh LED display bigger than nine
point seven inches you know none of that
really came to fruition I think that's a
bad thing not necessarily Apple
certainly can't structure their business
model based on rumors and speculation or
they can structured on is based on
consumer interests think consumers will
ultimately purchase and i'm a bit unsure
so where the ipad slots at least as it
is now the platform has a lot of
potential i really like the e-book
reader store that Apple announced
yesterday I think certainly that's going
to be a big boon to the publishing
industry but also to the iPad that's
actually when the big reasons out
consider purchasing the ipad i currently
have a kindle too but i find the e
display well nice on the eyes and non
stressful I've to be a bit boring
oftentimes i wish i had a color display
or even a touchscreen certainly did the
ipad slots in very nicely a book tour
competitively priced I believe starting
at 409 on up may be able to sort of get
access to the new release catalogs that
you would expect I think what's most
exciting about the ipad isn't what Apple
announced put the potential for the
device I really at the hands of
developers that's where would be the
ipod touch in the iphone i think
differentiated itself certainly the
browser on the iphone and ipod touch is
fantastic but there are a lot of device
stuff and now a good browsers you look
at web OS or Android both of them very
capable devices i think what separates
apples platforms are the app store and
the developers then we're looking
forward to seeing what the developers do
with the ipad and that's when we'll see
if starts really differentiate itself
for example we saw come in a few months
back a Sports Illustrated demonstration
what they could do with the ipad i would
have liked to see magazines as
integrating to the ipad i think we're
going to see that very shortly you know
company can very easily set up an appt
essentially the magazine subscription
that can be a very interesting way to
sort of get your digital content I was
very intrigued by the New York Times
demonstrates as well sort of having the
video play within the browser certainly
wasn't flash-based most probably to most
people chagrined myself included I can't
help but they gonna look at the ipad
that's gonna be great for using on a
toilet I know people gonna laugh but
probably a pretty good device for that
too you're sitting there you want to
flip through a newspaper read a magazine
so literally bring bags of questions how
are you going to input text on a device
as well I don't how I segue from toilets
text but that was sort of the way my
warped mind works well the ipad has an
on-screen keyboard similar what the
iphone has certainly a 9.7 inch screen
is bigger than the three AA tijd found
on the iphone but you're still left with
sort of no physical buttons type on
it's got thousands of multi touch inputs
on the screen supposed to be very
responsive but you can supposedly type
using just your fingers as you would a
standard keyboard when to landscape mode
I'm a bit skeptical veteran I think you
need to have lisanna device that size
from sort of physical buttons and enter
apples keyboard accessory clearly sure
is showing that their users want a
keyboard but not sort of integrating
when it's a device I'm making apple have
benefited out into the keyboard is going
to be usable with the new sort of
keynote and the iwork features that they
announced as well text entry is going to
be a big deal and speaking of I work and
sort of the new suite of applications
they announced enthusia don't know what
I work in sort of apple's version of
office here's where I'm bit uncertain of
how this is going to work if I'm
creating a spreadsheet I'm going to want
to save that spreadsheet to a desktop
maybe mail it later since they didn't
know things for a file management system
how am I going to save that spreadsheet
or save that word document order save
that excel sheet you know whatever the
equivalent is is an iwork how are you
going to do that how are you going to
open it back up laterz it can save
something to a cloud heck what really
didn't specify a sort of made me feel
like perhaps what they showed yesterday
was an unfinished software I think that
there's a lot more potential we're going
to see from the ipad when it finally is
unleashed in about 60 days but without a
file management system not so sure how
useful having a folk office suite of
applications are going to be in this
case i work is anybody really going to
make presentations on the fly i can see
definitely being useful for giving
presentations so I can hand this out to
someone that I'm pretending to turn it
over and say look at this here's my
presentation I can see the utility in
that as far as creating and editing on
it mmm not so sure do that some very
cool features with the photo gallery
where you can pinch and zoom your way
and welcome bored with all that stuff
the more with the iPad being i'm not
sure what the market is I don't think
the market Ford has yet been defined
Apple did a fantastic job pricing it I
think sort of starting at 499 price
point was well below what most people
accept it are expected rather and that's
for the 16 gigabyte non 3g version sort
of going all the way up to eight hundred
twenty nine dollars for a 64 gigabyte
version with AT&amp;amp;T s3g and speaking of
three
gee I think what Apple did was evilly
brilliant with these new micro sims soon
as the i first iphone was released
locked 18teen the u.s. it was almost
immediately well a few months later have
to be a lot how many other companies out
there you know have micro sims or use
micro sims right now the answer is
pretty much zero so while shipping the
device unlocked and applicants a we're
giving the customer the choice that
really give you any choice you can't go
to tmobile the only other GSM carrier in
the US and pick up a micro sim swap it
in and set up a data plan I haven't
worked there's no alternative apples
essentially locking the device locking
the device which is pre interests
extremely I think we'll see some micro
sims come out in the future but for
right now you're kind of up the creek
without a paddle with that and let them
sort of interesting model also segments
in between having 3g and not having 3g i
thought was very interesting it's giving
that consumers more choice but Apple is
not necessarily known for if you're not
out very much you're always near a Wi-Fi
connection no need for 3g save your
money but if you want the 3d connection
having the option is quite nice
especially for a 29 29 99
all-you-can-eat plan with no contracts
go month-to-month i was really nice i'm
going out i know i'm going to need data
i can just go ahead and turn that on
activated I think cancel it when I get
home and I'd have to worry about to rip
and next month's data rates I think that
something that is you know quite nice
feature overall I think I will
definitely purchase an ipad just mostly
out of curiosity and you know something
to read on the toilet I think initially
we're going to see a big success with
the iPad and think received things sort
of taper down until an expected next
version where all these rumors will
start up again it's gonna have a camera
when I bola led ultimately never live up
to expectations I think the ipad is def
be a young device similar when the
iphone was introduced it didn't one or
two things very well but laughed a lot
of the features and most people expected
i think ultimately will see the ipad get
those features namely a front facing
camera for video conferencing and
perhaps a different or improved text
input but for right now i think that's
it's a interesting device certainly
intriguing and at the very least it's
going to drive the tablet market forward
it's going to force companies to
innovate so if you would hate apple or
hate the ipad it's kind of hard to
ignore that it's going to drive the
tablet industry forward and force these
other company
HP Dell a suits and the rest to
integrate I think in that effort is very
good for the consumer pc industry so it
might take sort of on the ipad do you
agree disagree on my way off base and
you're never going to use on a toilet
maybe just use it in bed you know leave
a text video response and sort of
curious to what you guys think about the
