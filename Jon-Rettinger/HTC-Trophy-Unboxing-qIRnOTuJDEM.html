TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the unlocked windows 7 powered HTC
trophy let's go ahead and see if this is
worthy of a spot on your mantle alright
so the box insert a typical unlock HTC
fashion is very familiar at the name of
the device on top and image on the front
which is actual size HTC branding
nothing on the left nothing on the right
other than letting you know it's Windows
Phone and some specs on the back which I
will run through as we go and take a
look at the phone itself so we'll bring
in senior stavo hopefully not senior
stab Oh off my finger cut plastic let's
go and take a look as device I've not
seen one of these I get in person I know
a lot of you guys were waiting for this
to be able to go ahead and slide it on
out there you go and here is the device
looks very similar in form factor - the
speaker to the HTC surround I'm taking a
look at before so I'm gonna go ahead and
run through some of the specs with you
guys and see what this guy is going to
do for you alright so it has a 3.8 inch
WVGA screen with the resolution of 480
by 800 it's got 8 gigs of internal
storage 512 of ROM 576 of RAM it's got
the HTC hub which I've demonstrated on
the HTC surround didn't give you access
to weather stocks picture editing a few
other kind of cool things it's got a 13
hundred million power battery it does of
course have 3G but it's HSPA for bands
920 100 meaning no 3G here in the US you
are going to have on the back sort of
the requisite Windows Mobile stuff 5
million bits of camera with autofocus
and LED flash people at recorded video
at 720p and this is all coupled with 802
11 and Wi-Fi so I'll go ahead and pull
off the plastic I know you guys created
when I don't pull off the plastic on
these devices
alright so let's let this focus in
see what we've got so you've got your
sensors on the top right their proximity
and such
you've got your sort of standard ice
mandated Windows Phone 7 capacitive
buttons you've got your home button back
button and search on the left-hand side
this is a very thin device I've got a
volume rocker up and down micro USB
charging port on the right side of the
vise we've got a camera hard button
microphone 3.5 millimeter headset jack
and the lock button which is on the left
side and a lot of phones are familiar
with having a lock button on the right
this is reverse you're going to get used
to that let's go ahead and see what else
we are going to get in the box with your
HTC trophy I'm willing to guess though
that it's pretty much the standard HTC
Rho of accessories put some contact us
stuff start here and correct it is a
sandy HTC stuff so you've got your wall
plug with USB port you've got a inline
stereo with microphone and volume
adjustment and then you've got a USB to
microUSB port for charging and that's
pretty stock phone accessories let's go
ahead and do a quick comparison here
with the HTC surround that there's
definitely sort of bears a striking
resemblance with this route of course
has the speaker that gives it a surround
name which does not really worthwhile to
have that extra weight and fatness that
speaker doesn't really do much but in
case you've seen it the surround laying
around 18 key storage or in a friends
pocket here is a quick size comparison
and it is a no-brainer here the trophy
is much thinner I would much much rather
put the trophy in my pocket then I would
the surround just due to weight and size
alright let's go ahead and give this guy
just a first power on I can see what
this looks like
sync the batteries already in there no
the battery is not in there or there's
something covering it to go ahead and
check it out
all right HTC has put a little plastic
piece in there to cover the batteries
you turn on transport go ahead and pull
it off push the yellow backing on in
throw the back on let's get this guy
quick power on of course I'll cover
everything else in the full review of
the HTC trophy let's go ahead and power
it on and see what she looks like
HTC
that first boot up is obviously slower
it's gotta go through a ton of things to
configure the operating system first
boot up though in general boot up time
with Windows Phone is actually
relatively fast much quicker than
experienced with a lot of other
operating systems which is always nice
there's no waiting for your phone to
turn on so probably let me know I don't
know SIM card in there which I don't
let's go ahead and just get started
we're going to English and let close no
sim air accept Terms of Use phone
setting this will just go to recommended
settings check different time zones
don't this one about it I'd let you look
go ahead and pick whatever is in and go
next date in time not now I get sort of
a walkthrough on installing apps you can
see sort of the load screen those little
red dots are scrolling across the top
icons are popping down one of the things
about Windows Phone 7 people asking was
how come you can't tell the signal
strength or battery level while using
the applications a lot of time they hide
like that he had actually pulled them
down sort of interesting so right now
it's the selling sort of the default
applications it's probably the HTC hub
that got installed go ahead and hit next
all done and now we should finally be in
the operating system and we are indeed
in the upland system and here is the HTC
trophy's OS obviously looks very
familiar
to the other Windows Phone 7 operating
systems the only differentiation is
generally the hubs and this in case
we've got the HTC hub which is probably
going to try and pull in weather and
data but it's not gonna have access to
it it's not connected to Wi-Fi but I
will connect this and give you guys
through a full overview in the review
for all your exclusive HTC trophy ish
