technobuffalo here Microsoft's Xbox
event just wrapped up and they went
through a ton of stuff in just about a
55 at a time frame did you miss the
announcement I'm gonna take you through
step-by-step of everything that got
announced some things that didn't get
announced there but came out afterwards
it all kinda Xbox goodness stick around
let's go through it together alright so
let's start at the beginning Microsoft's
own Don Mattrick took the stage and he
said and I quote we spent the past four
years working on this so that was kind
of cool they gave a brief Xbox history
and they finally said the name of the
next generation console it's not the
xbox 720 Xbox fusion the official name
is the xbox one poor HTC and they call
it the xbox one because it's an
all-in-one entertainment system and
we'll get talked about that more as you
go along but it does a lot of things in
one console hence the name Xbox one so
they talked about a new controller and
connect was also announced talk about
that a little bit later it's not a new
stuff with Kinect really heavy emphasis
on TV there's a totally new TV
experience and you can access that TV
experience there's some pretty baller
voice commands that worked really well
you know TV on switch to music and all
kind of other stuff it uses your voice
just incredibly well in voice commands
allow you to instantly switch between
games TV music movies full internet
explorer and other apps so that was kind
of cool they announce something called
snap mode you can snap back and forth
different things allows you to view two
things at once like watching a movie and
doing a quick web search kind of neat
also one thing that's really excited
about a skype for xbox totally built in
so you can skype your friends while
you're playing a game you could talk
some trash you just use it for skype on
your TV a lot of ESPN centric stuff was
also announced our unique notification
to your favorite players and teams so
that's kind of cool if you're big into
sports it can also snap very stats next
to live support a game so kind of cool
to next thing xbox one guide it's a full
TV Guide what it's gonna do and they
didn't announce this at the keyed up
they announced it afterward it's
actually going to work on top of your
cable boxes DVR selects solid content
but I put the Xbox UI on top of it kind
of neat I get trending in favorite
options there but the big deal
here this Justin specs what is the xbox
one going to pack so 8 gigabytes of RAM
USB 3.0 blu-ray drive which so he's the
head of the blu-ray consortium kind of
cool to see a blu-ray drive in there so
bigger games more storage of course HDMI
in our outs eight core GPU 500 gigabyte
hard drive note that solid state or not
they're three separate outbreak system
that are kind of cool first there's the
Xbox OS is a full Windows kernel and
finally there's an OS allows you to
switch between the other two instantly
so that's kind of cool so the windows
kernel hopefully would be some cross
compatibility between Windows games and
xbox games so let's talk about connect
first of all good news can be included
with every console it's now a 1080p HD
camera voice commands are now totally
more conversational with it it can read
your heartbeat also which is crazy you
just rest sense of separate movements
movement of the wrists and just more
details we could give a much better
connect experience on to the controller
it looks the same but underneath that
she'll there are 40 design changes
dynamic impulse triggers like you put
feedback on the triggers which are kind
of cool it's got Wi-Fi direct radio
stack in there it's got all kinds of
cool precision directional pad stuff
built into it integrated battery of
course obviously more support for all a
smart glass stuff that Microsoft
announced I guess the last year's e3 I'm
so natively part of the platform there's
all kinds of other stuff that's natively
in there so Xbox Live so that's kind of
cool for the servers to support that
they're going from 15,000 servers to
300,000 servers which is crazy I love
stores for music movies games and all of
its going to save in the cloud kind of
cool taking a cloud the dedicated game
DVR built-in will save games to the
cloud it's better for you know queuing
up multiplayer games as well they told a
talk a lot about games EA fifa madden
NFL NBA live UFC EA came and talked
about a lot of it always going to be
powered by ea's new sports engine called
ignite so that's kind of cool they
talked about the gaming engine sort of
ten times more animation depth of detail
that showed 3d crowds dynamic sidelines
and daily streams of new content so kind
of cool then Microsoft Studios came up
talked about all the rest of their games
so forza motorsports five
be available at launch that was kind of
cool and they showed a new game called
quantum break which looked pretty good
awesome the 15 exclusive titles in the
first year eight will be totally new
franchises there could be a halo TV
series which steven spielberg is going
to be involved in so that's kind of cool
a lot of NFL stuff so I'm appropriately
dressed here for it essentially let's
integrate with NFL supported games as
will pull up fantasy stats and all kinds
of other school stuff there as well so
your big fantasy sports buff like me
you're gonna like it so the Xbox one is
gonna launch we don't know the date but
sometime later this year presumably by
the holidays or get much more info at e3
and then Activision came up and talked
about the next call of duty call of duty
ghosts me built on a whole new engine
there's new dog companions dynamic maps
character customization downloadable
contents can be coming to Xbox one first
and sort of a lot of other cool stuff
that came out of it so let's talk a
little bit more about the games and what
sort of came out of that so I give
activation credit they demoed games they
said on a totally Xbox one console it
wasn't generated on a PC and simulated
it was actually running on reference
hardware's a lot of stuff came out
though after the after the keynote
really didn't get an ounce so used games
games are tied to a console so
essentially when you put your disc in
its gonna install the game on your hard
drive and if you want to give that this
to a friend there Gore sell it for
example they are going to have to pay a
fee in order to use that game don't know
what don't know what the fee is how it's
gonna work if not kick the internet but
you know kind of interesting so you can
give internet we also don't know if it
requires always on stuff so that's the
other big question mark we don't know
the price which is a big question mark
as well we also don't know backwards
compatibility but hopefully we will know
all of that come III which is now just a
few short weeks away so we got a ton of
news on the Xbox one I love to hear guys
thoughts what you think about it you're
excited not excited just they announced
crazy amount of stuff and a 15-minute
period so I give Microsoft credit
they've had years to work on this the
console looks super big but hopefully
that bigness will keep the cost down you
know they'd have to pay that much to
shrink the components but it's
definitely a large console but you know
take that for what it's worth it doesn't
look
ab but certainly is going to take up a
lot of space in your component cabinet
anyway guys I'm excited about it looks
very cool I'll can't wait to get our
hands on it take a look at some gameplay
of course at e3 we will be there
covering it in force to get want to hear
your thoughts please get the video big
daddy thumbs up we must def we
appreciate it i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video
