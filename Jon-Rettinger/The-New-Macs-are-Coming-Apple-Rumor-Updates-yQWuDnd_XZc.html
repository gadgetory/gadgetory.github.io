technobuffalo here and if you're
thinking about getting a new mac gonna
want to pay attention because there are
upgrades coming and upgrades coming very
soon we're going to go through each one
of apple's laptop and desktop lines and
talk about when these upgrades are going
to be coming or at least when I think
they're going to be coming based on the
information that's been provided let's
go ahead and get started from the top
with the littlest guy and apples line up
the mac mini it's been about 127 days
since the last update which puts it
about mid cycle so if you're in the
market for a mac mini you're probably
going to be okay go ahead and hop on
that and get your home theater PC on or
whatever you're looking to do with it
you're probably going to be all right
the same is true with the imac and
that's both sides of the imac there were
some concerns with the 27-inch with some
discoloration screen flickering those
appear to have been rectified and the
newer fixed models in the supply chain
to your safe to go ahead and order the
imac it's also been 127 days since those
were refreshed again puts it right in
the middle the granddaddy of apple's
computers the mac pro's been 358 days
without an upgrade that is a year which
is inexcusable for a powerhouse
workhorse flagship machine has
completely ignored the Mac Pro there's
been rumors dating back about six months
ago that Apple was going to getting the
six-core xeon Gulf town processor to go
in the mac pro maybe one of the i7 chips
couple the i7 chips fro you know if
you're looking to get a mac pro don't I
can't stress that enough don't get a mac
pro wait for the updates i would say any
tuesday now they're going to be coming
reason i say Tuesday's it's generally
when Apple has updated their product
line I don't think any of these updates
i'm going to talk about are going to
come with answer a press conference and
you're going to be sort of quiet behind
the scenes upgrades you wake up one
morning you see that they are there so
Mac Pro don't buy macbook the last the
macbook line the plastic unibody guy
it's been again 127 days since that's
last upgrade which again puts a
mid-cycle looking to get in at apple's
lower-cost laptop which is a really good
value you're safe to go ahead and buy
that
that fear of that getting updated when
you wake up next week so really the one
that everybody wants to talk about the
macbook pro it's been 261 days since
that sucker got upgrade and there are a
ton of rumors circulating about it so
the chips have been ready to go it's
been no secret i don't think that apple
is going to be using the mobile core i5
chip that's Intel's Core i5 chip in
their next line of MacBook Pros the
delay at least from what I've heard and
what I've read has been with switchable
graphics we seen laptops in the past
with switchable graphics that means the
laptop has a dedicated video card and
also an integrated option we've seen
this on some of the Sony's and some of
the Asus models and you've been able to
switch them manually so if you're
looking to play a game flip a switch the
software solution suddenly you're using
your more powerful dedicated graphics
card if you're just doing web browsing
you want to save some battery life you
flip the switch to the other way and
using the integrated option we've seen
some sort of switching on the fly where
you plug your laptop and a lot of Mexico
dedicated that's really the extent of
what we've seen turn a mainstream
laptops NVIDIA has its new technology
called optimist and I'll won't bore you
with the technical details essentially
what that does that's a computer switch
for you so if you're doing something
graphic intensive it'll switch to the
dedicated if you go back to the viewing
a web page or something non grab it'll
go back to integrated that you are ever
having to do anything I think that's
what Apple has been waiting for to put
in their next line of macbook pros that
technology appears ready to go so I
would really think that we will see an
update to the macbook pro I would say
within the month so then the next four
week so if you're looking to get a
macbook pro wait wait wait can't trust
that enough today's date flows that are
wondering is februari 24 2010 so
definitely wait to get a macbook pro
you're going to be getting outdated
hardware there's a huge difference
processor wise between the core two duo
chips that are in the macbook pros now
and the core i5 chips again not going to
go through technical specs but a huge
performance difference one that's
definitely worth waiting who is just a
speed bump from core 2 duo from 2.2 to
2.4 and say don't worry about it you're
probably ever goes to differ
this is a significant upgrade to the
core family of processors definitely
worth waiting the next one and one that
I'm looking forward to most is the
macbook air has also been 261 days sort
of been apples black sheep in their
family they haven't done much with it
doesn't have the same design cues as the
other aluminum laptops doesn't have the
full multi-touch glass trackpad with the
integrated buttons so has the big click
button on the bottom it doesn't have the
black trim around it still running some
outdated specs you know there's it's
been passed by many other ultra
portables when it was launched it was
really the flagship and the pre boy for
the thin and light but since then we've
seen the sony vaio x the adamo XPS on a
ton of other thin and light that sort of
usurp to that crown for the macbook air
I don't think Apple is going to take
that lying down I think we are going to
see an update to the macbook air and
this is one of the computers where I
think we are going to see a full page
redesign I don't think any of the other
models are going to see a complete
redesign other than the macbook air and
it will probably see an extra USB port
and definitely a slimmed-down desire to
keep up with the adamo XPS which took
the crown is the world's thinnest laptop
we may see a maybe a core i3 chip in
there or maybe a more powerful ultra low
voltage core 2 duo with hopefully four
gigs of RAM perhaps a reduced cost and a
little bit better performance overall
I'm a big fan of the macbook air and I
think that wants to get an upgrade to
that that may become my laptop of choice
so guys hope you found this helpful with
looking to get a Mac computer as to when
you should buy or not buy you know I'm
gonna get a lot of questions I'm sure
about the iphone or the ipod line i'll
cover those in a separate video i wanted
to cover just the laptops and desktop
options at apple offers so if this was
uh you know bit helpful i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i'll
see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
