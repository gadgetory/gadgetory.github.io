technobuffalo here in the topic of this
video probably not surprising not iphone
4 but actually iphone 5 the next
iteration of the iphone with verizon
announcing their cdma only version the
iphone forward left with a very big
question mark what's going to happen
with the iphone 5 and the product
release cycle ever since the first
iphone was announced and released in the
june or july timeframe we've seen a new
iphone iteration ever since within that
same three to four week period so now
it's februari verizon's got or neither
now it's january rides again have the
phone coming out in February and that
coincides with apples release cycle just
a few months later in july are we going
to see an iphone cdma version announced
now and then a new version announced in
july there's a few months later that's
going to translate to a lot of really
pissed off people who migrated over
carriers or saving their upgrades and
then missed out on a brand new phone
just a few months later they like to
understand missing out on a new phone
every year but releasing two very
similar devices within about four to
five months of each other it's going to
be a really tough sell to the nation's
largest cdma carry and of course I'm
talking about verizon so what's going to
happen are we going to have to separate
release cycles well 18t get the newest
version of the iphone coming out in june
or july and verizon will always be one
generation behind its maybe their
version of the iphone five won't come
out until next June or July I'm sort of
inclined to believe that we will see an
LTE version of the iphone and updated
one to the one that was announced today
in june or july so the question now begs
in poor verizon people always sort of
stop waiting do you jump the gun down
and pick up the CDMA only iphone or do
you try and tough it out and wait a few
more months and see what comes out in
june or july if anything it's really
going to be a hard decision to make
personally i am not going to be
switching carriers AT&amp;amp;T is my creative
choice and has
quite a while and I'm going to stick
with it one interesting thing that we
didn't see today was announcement of the
white iphone still been lurking in
mystery somewhere there have been a few
of them kicking around or some
aftermarket stuff you can get but a lot
of people thought we were going to see
that today as well and on unrelated note
this background I figured talking about
a whole lot but I'll show my android
love the android logo or eating the
TechnoBuffalo logo it's called the
android nom nom not right uh I'll to put
a link to it down below if you guys want
to get the wallpaper we've tied back
through wallpapers available on
TechnoBuffalo for iPhone iPad Android
device desktop whatever it might be so
if you want that links down below people
been asking for it so this is going to
be a bit of an annoying waiting period
for a verizon phone the night you jump
the gun now or you want to wait I don't
know what to tell you if you can if you
waited this long I say wait a few more
months would probably be my advice it's
gonna be hard to turn your back on a
verizon capable iphone i want to hear
from you guys and what you're gonna do
jon rettinger TechnoBuffalo see the next
video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
