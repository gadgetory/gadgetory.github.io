with some predictions for you for Mac
world 2009 close you that don't know Mac
world is one of the two annual
conferences that Apple holds each year
to announce new products and to get
developers a sense of where the product
line is going to be headed so I've
broken down my prediction into three
categories one sure thing to possible
and three don't hold your breath I don't
have any inside sources just from where
I think the products are headed in some
of the rumors that i've been reading
let's get started in the sure thing
category I think snow leopard is going
to be featured really prominently at the
macworld 2009 while my hair looks crazy
um I think they're going to announce a
ship date I think tank announced pricing
which I assume will be the same price as
leopard which I believe was one hundred
and fifty dollars I think they're gonna
announce final Spieth features and specs
heck they may even announce you know
when it's going to go gold be ready for
production I think so look heavily for
snow leopard and also guys any computer
you're writing novels running leopard
will be able to run Snow Leopard no
problem as long as it is intel-based I
think we're going to see redesigns Mac
minis for sure they're going to spec
bump them as well I don't know what
they're going to look like but I would
assume they'll take cues from the
redesigned macbooks possibly aluminum
and glass it'll bring the mini up to be
a viable Mac computer once again hasn't
been bumped quite a while and really has
been behind the times as far as
advancements that the other Apple
computers have had so for those you
holding out for a headless Mac stay
tuned for redesign mac mini I think
we're going to see a speck boost for the
imac whether it gets a redesigned or not
I'll get to later but for sure we're
going to see a speck boots the probable
price cut for the imac i think we're
going to see a new macbook air I think
specs you're going to say the same but
it's going to take the black bezel and
glass trackpad that the new imacs or I
started the new macbook and macbook pros
took so nothing drastic there just a
minor overhaul of the sx of it i think
we're going to see some iphone software
updates and we're finally going to see
one of these think we're finally going
to see mms finally gonna see copy and
paste really going to start to see some
of the features that we've been
clamoring for since day one of release i
really expect apple to an outset what
it's going to be a three point
a software update or whether it's just a
two point whatever they're at at that
point I really expect to see that very
very very soon so those are what i think
we're definitely going to see actually
one more thing i think we're going to
see your redesigned Mac Pro's as well
they're going to keep the aluminum
enclosure but probably take on a little
different aesthetics we're also going to
see in updates to them with quad-core
graphics are quad core processors and
IntelliJ sing I don't think those are
going to make their way into consumer
level imac until the prices drop but
they're definitely going to be there in
the new mac pros so you're holding out
for a mac pro wait till january so once
the possible things i think we may see a
touchscreen imac people have been
rumoured rimming that snow leopard is
optimized for touch screens who knows or
been some rumors that apple has already
contracted out touch screens to some
asian companies i don't know but i think
it would be very cool to see how that
could work I think we may see a tablet
the long rumored tablet perhaps two to
three times size of the iphone running a
tablet eyes version of OS 10 whether
that's leopard or snow leopard as yet to
be seen I do not think we'll see a
netbook from Apple I think the macbook
air they're entering de otra portables I
don't think that they see a viable
market for the netbook right now to make
it run OS 10 properly be useful and keep
at a relatively low price I just don't
think Apple can do it so don't hold your
breath for a netbook we may also see an
iphone spec bump just storage wise from
16 to 32 gigs which could be nice there
so the things some that think they think
are probable now some that don't hold
your breath doubtful things but maybe if
we may see iphone 3 point oh the next
version of the iphone possibly with a
front facing camera with some of the new
features i mentioned earlier mms and
copy and paste possibly get turn-by-turn
directions i think we're going to see
possibly see something that's come out
but i think it's really doubtful so if
you're looking to get an iphone i think
it's fine go ahead and jump on the
iphone bandwagon I don't think we're
going to see any updated ipod since
Apple just updated those I believe in
what October
so don't hold your breath for any
updated I pause you know Apple could
very well surprise us all with the
release I'm sure that will also see new
redesigned 17-inch macbook pros to look
like the current macbook pros with the
black bezel on the glass yeah other than
that who knows they could release more
cinema displays are another possibility
you know they could release a whole new
product no one's ever thought of maybe
the release i car or a video game system
who knows another possible announcements
they may announce some partnerships with
let's say netflix for example they may
enable some more movie rentals on the
Apple TV well that would hurt movie
rentals for itunes would help build the
Apple TV business model we may even see
Apple TVs integrated into LCD
televisions that are apple branded which
would be kind of cool so guys are just
my predictions with you agree or
disagree let me know in the comments or
leave a video response and what do you
guys think something I missed something
that you like to see Apple come out with
something you think they might come out
with you know let me know these are just
my takes my opinions hope you guys
