an overview and walked through for you
of the new 5th generation iPod Nano also
known as the Nano with a video camera so
this is the product red 8 gigabyte
version it also comes in 16 gigabyte
flavours and a ton of different colors
so before I get into some of the music
and the things that you may have seen on
previous iPods let me go right to the
main attraction on this and that is the
video recorder so we'll go right down to
video camera get a new option there and
you get some of the video that you've
taken in sort of clips show up right
down below so you can see I was playing
around with some of the effects I'll go
ahead and show you what this looks like
so loads and launches up very similar to
what you find now on the iPhone 3GS pick
it up and it does make use of the
accelerometer so I've got a coffee cup
right there you can see me start
recording to record you just hit the
home button and you'll see that zero
starts counting so we're recording live
right now and you just simply record one
thing I should notice and shouldn't
mention to you is that the camera lens
is right on the back and it seems to be
where you're always putting your fingers
whether you have it facing up of this
way or you turn it the other direction
it seems to be your finger always gets
right in the way I would have perhaps
preferred it right in the middle but
it's not too bad something to make note
of so let me go and turn this off so I
stopped that recording one of these
really cool features that I didn't
necessarily expect with the iPod Nano or
some of the great effects that they have
now unfortunately you can't access these
effects before you start recording you
can't make transitions as you're going
but there are a lot of really cool ones
let me show you what they are to access
them you just hold down the home button
and you get a whole list of them here
and let me go ahead and walk you through
what they are move the camera up and
I'll go to a little bit of a black
background so you can see you've got
sepia even right now my finger is right
over the lens
need to go ahead and move my hand sepia
normal black and white x-ray scroll down
you get film grain
security-cam cyborg I'll show you what
some of these look like bulge collide Oh
motion blur mirror some of the things
that maybe you're familiar with from
photo booth light tunnel dent strech
twirl and I believe that is it's let me
give you a quick demonstration what some
of these look like you may have seen
these cyborgs one in my quality overview
let's pick thermal for example see what
thermal looks like go ahead and select
it and now I can't start recording in
thermal if I like to and I can turn it
and use the accelerometer and start
recording looks pretty neat to the heat
to the heat up for my hand comes off
it's blue I think it's opposed to be red
either I'm dead possibly zombified or uh
it's not really a heat sensor just sort
of put some colors behind things let's
take a look at some of the other ones
let's check out security cam which we've
all been caught doing something bad on
the security cam but now you can catch
your friends that sort of gives you that
grainy look you expect to see someone
sort of trying to grab an ATM machine
and run out of the store it flickers a
little bit to give it sort of a older
vibe to it so that is the video recorder
and how that works now this does not
have Wi-Fi built-in so one way to get
the video off is when you seek your iPod
you can pull the video off of it
actually one cool thing that Apple's
included is when you plug your iPod into
your computer your device now shows up
almost as a drive you can go right in
there and pull out the files put them on
your desktop and upload them to youtube
or whatever else you want to do let me
go ahead and close out of there and if
you want to see the quality of the video
check out a previous video that I did
that shows the quality of it and stay
tuned for the channel I'll be doing some
comparisons with other popular video
cameras no most notably the iPhone 3GS
so those videos are archived by date and
you go ahead and view the ones that were
recorded look lo it looks like the date
is they can go ahead and play it back
and speaking of playback this also has a
built-in speaker
which is actually right there in the
30-pin connector you can't even see it
let me show you what that sounds like
and I'll play back one of the videos
actually I recorded so we'll play back
take this one's 30 seconds long and you
be able to hear me talking I can turn it
for playback use the accelerometer go
ahead and play and you can adjust the
volume using the scroll wheel it
actually sounds pretty good let me show
you what that sounds like with some
music didn't have to hear me all the
time so I'll go back up to music and
just like previous generation iPod nanos
this has an accelerometer so you can
scroll through via Cover Flow so I'm in
green day here I'll just pick a song
very quickly so I'm getting to any
copyright issues and start playing and
that's what the speaker all the way up
it's very loud so just a quick sample of
how the speaker sounds on the new iPod
now I can't tell you that it's very loud
and certainly easy enough to listen to
if you're cleaning up your kitchen or
whatever you want to hear some music you
don't have your headphones not a problem
so speaking of headphones you actually
need them for something other than
listening to music and you need the ones
that come with the Nana so let me show
you why that is we get out of music this
now has a built-in radio which is quite
neat so go ahead and select the radio
and now it's telling me no radio signal
please plug in headphones for radio
connection so go ahead and plug the
headphones in we've got them handy right
here
alright so that is plugged in and now
I've got a full FM radio transmitter
it's actually not bad then go through
and you can find scroll through manually
you can sort of scan and that does not
come through the speaker I'll just come
through the headphones but the reception
does seem to be quite good you can see
I've got the volume all the way up from
the headphone so you can still sort of
hear it alright so enough for the radio
it works
it's our radio people have asking for
this for quite a long time it's nice
when you go to the gym or you just want
to listen to whatever terrestrial radio
station that you like in terrestrial as
opposed to a satellite radio now one
thing I should notice you can actually
live pause radio stations while you're
using this it's actually quite neat and
so you can almost give yourself a little
bit of a buffer so if you know is going
to be commercial coming up hit pause go
to the bathroom drop a deuce come back a
few minutes later and you can't skip
your commercials so let's keep moving
along with some of the other features
that are in here let's go to extras and
voice memos this has a built-in
microphone and the voice recorder looks
very similar to that's found on the
iPhone and takes advantage of the
built-in microphone I can just start
talking you can see that little needle
right there is moving as I'm yelling at
it yell and at the Nano and you just hit
record and it archives and just as you
would expect as did the videos by date
so we'll go back it also has a pedometer
and a few other cool features that you
found on sort of some previous other
nanos but the pedometer is most notably
one of the new features so there's your
pedometer and go and sort of set it just
go ahead and set your weight that's
information about yourself you can go
ahead and check out some of the settings
weight dailystep control screen
orientation and your history now it's
free it's very interesting now the Nano
used to be known for just doing music
but now it's really does so many more in
music doesn't seem like an afterthought
but it just does
everything so well does music
fantastically it's now a very capable
video recorder it's for voice recorder
and you use it for radio it just does so
much right now so I'm very impressed the
Nano this is actually the first nano
that I've ever owned I never had a need
for one before so I'm quite impressive
it and so far can I definitely recommend
it
