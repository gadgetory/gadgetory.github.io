TechnoBuffalo here I received a decent
amount of questions about Sony's new
PlayStation Move particularly how
compared with Nintendo's offering the
Wii Remote thought I put these two
controllers head-to-head and show you
what differences are let's get dirty
all right so before we start talking
about 3d sensors and LED lights and such
let's talk about the physical
differences between these two
controllers and how they feel in the
hand obviously these two are motion
sensitive controllers all I do they're
motion sensing a little bit differently
on Nintendo connects to an infrared
sensor hooks up to your TV and in turn
to the console itself and the text
motion left right up or down
I won't detect forward or back so
there's no 3d detection here primarily
the controllers are done via motion
based so traditionally where you push a
button to say jump if you lift the
controller up that same motion would be
achieved depending on how you're holding
the controller your button choices are
actually quite limited you've got a
up/down left direction of a traditional
four-way navigation with an A button got
a positive or negative button a one or
two and a trigger on the back holding it
like this that's us - just a few buttons
holding it more traditionally if you're
playing a classic game like on tendo
Super Nintendo or like if access to sort
of the buttons that you may be used to
with the same navigation and the one or
two og function as the A or B with
Nintendo if you want to play a Wii game
you have to use the motion controls you
don't have an option to use a classic
controller or anything else it is
exclusively motion based Sony's move on
the other hand is not exclusively motion
based you can use a Dual Shock
controller for most games that aren't
move exclusive and primarily all the
major releases will be move and
traditional Dualshock 3 compatible now
Sony's controller detects motion a
little bit differently
I can certainly detect left right up or
down but this big rubber ball on the top
houses an LED light which speaks to the
PlayStation Eye essentially a very high
quality webcam which is required to use
the move and what that does is what's it
recognized 3d space so you have full
range of motion keep it full circle up
or down anywhere you want to go if you
get a full I guess 6 axis type
compatibility the PlayStation Eye is
really just a high-definition webcam
with a speaker built in it can capable
of recognizing so
of high quality 60 frames-per-second at
5:40 buy for 80 or 120 frames per second
at 320 by 240 the medium games our topic
that people feel very passionately about
I you really Pro one camp or another a
very few people sort of straddle in
lines which console they prefer and I am
one of those I own a PlayStation and
Xbox and we and I appreciate them all
very differently so the move adds a lot
of sort of extra functionality so we
talked about buttons on the Wii Remote
let's look at the buttons on the
PlayStation Move so you've got your sort
of typical DualShock esque buttons
you've got the square the X the triangle
to 0 select on the left start on the
right and trigger on the back in fact
Sony is really pushing their buttons and
literally pushing the buttons as one of
the selling points of the PlayStation
Move over the completely buttonless on
Microsoft's Kinect coming out relatively
soon now both these controllers deliver
true one to one motion the Wii does
require a Wii MotionPlus
it doesn't add on the hooks up to the
bottom to get that true one to one
motion I found it to be very smooth I
really haven't any jerky feelings with
the PlayStation Move at all whereas it
intended we without the Motion Plus
differ use one although it doesn't
always work as smoothly as you would
like
so again well the nice things about the
movies get that added functionality of
the motion controls um also you're
getting a library of games that are
really more dedicated to a hardcore
gamer the Wii is targeted mostly towards
party games certainly there are some
more adult-themed games majority of the
catalogue are deemed toward the younger
demographic a sony's done a really good
job about targeting their console
towards the hardcore gamer and the move
is for an evolution of that so things
like God of War to be able to control
crotteaus uh in the new and different
way without sex are you feeling like you
are a cooking mama or managing little
pets so you've got access to sort of use
these controllers in a very very new way
for very adult themed games certainly
we've seen games on the Wii that a use
sort of a gun motion but now with the
PlayStation moving it
that's that same sort of control scheme
get in high-definition the Wii is not an
HD console PlayStation 3 is certainly
leading the charge for high-definition
so you can access to a ton more games
and you're going to use it in sort of a
new and inventive way now Sony's also
releasing a least amount of party games
with this as well if that's your thing
the PlayStation Move bundle comes with a
Sports Champions game which is very
similar to the Wii Sports game that
we've seen in the past now both
controllers are not without their
accessories the Nintendo Wii has a
nunchuck accessory which gives you a bit
more functionality has some motion
sensing in it as well and the
PlayStation Move has a navigation
controller which essentially brings full
DualShock compatibility and controlling
options to the controller you can see it
right here with its two triggers on the
back this is actually not required you
can hold if you'd like and you can deal
with the awkwardness a DualShock 3
controller in your left hand if you so
choose so this is actually not a
requirement but let's talk about price -
this is actually sort of a very
expensive endeavor if you need to get
the full kit to get access to
PlayStation Move meaning you need the
move controller you need the navigation
controller any de PlayStation Eye it's
going to set you back about a hundred
and thirty dollars which is about $70
shy of the total cost of the Nintendo
Wii console itself in addition to of
course what the PlayStation console is
going to cost you this is a very
expensive proposition now the future of
the PlayStation Move is going to be
determined a lot by the developers all
the majority of developers have said
they will support and move so we will
see sort of the PlayStation games that
we've grown to know and love Metal Gear
Solid god of war and such with move
compatibility and something I'm really
excited about I really liked playing the
Wii I enjoyed it but I felt like I
couldn't enjoy my full catalog of games
you know Call of Duty like the full Call
of Duty not the sort of we up version
that I had to do on other consoles so
I'm really excited about taking my my
gaming enjoyment instead of taking it
into the 3d world and not being limited
to just left or right
up or down but really sensing motion so
I'm thinking lightsaber games
and such you're really going to be a lot
of fun swords and guns we've already
seen a lot of adapters actually put this
into a gun and let you use it as a
trigger so really I'm very excited I
hope this is just a simple explanation
for people I didn't get into sort of
high tech things I know how the hardcore
gamers are looking for but I wanted sort
of an overview a high-level sort of look
down so what differences between these
two controllers are particularly answer
what this little ball at the top is
that's been what mostly questions have
been geared to hope you guys in joyed
are you excited about the move you care
not care you waiting for the Kinect I
really want to hear what you guys have
to say I am John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you the next video bye-bye
