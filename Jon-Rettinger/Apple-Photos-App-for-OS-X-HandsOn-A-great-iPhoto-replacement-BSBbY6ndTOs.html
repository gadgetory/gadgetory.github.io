from TechnoBuffalo and today we're going
to be checking out the new Photos app
for Mac OS 10 Yosemite now the Photos
app isn't out to the public just yet
it's still in its beta form and was
seated alongside the first beta of OS 10
point 10 point 3 so let's go ahead and
see what this new Photos app is all
about the Photos app which is replacing
iPhoto and aperture feels right at home
with OS 10 Yosemite because of the flat
and two-dimensional UI you have four
different types to choose from photos
shared albums and projects and it's
basically like a desktop version of the
Photos app for iOS now taking a closer
look at the Photos app real quick I have
a few of my photos here in proper order
I can zoom out and see my collection I
can zoom out once more and see my photos
throughout the years essentially just
like the iOS app everything is super
smooth I remember using iPhoto a few
months back and it would take a long
time to load all of these photos and
videos so far the app is holding up
really well so what's awesome about this
new Photos app is the ability to sync
between iOS and Mac now for example I'll
take a picture on my iPhone or my iPad
and since both are using my iCloud
account I'll see those photos a few
seconds later on my Photos app on my Mac
now I can also share them online and
export them directly on my desktop and I
could use a more professional editing
tool like Photoshop or Lightroom to edit
my photos and speaking of which this is
by no means an aperture or Lightroom
replacement app it's mostly for
beginners who want to have a cleaner
organized collection of their photos
while also having the ability to do
basic editing now moving on to the
shared tab this is where you can see all
the photos or albums your friends and
family have shared with you or albums
you shared with your friends and family
you can like a picture or comment on it
see a list of people on the same shared
album as you and add photos now moving
on to albums this tab is where you can
check out different albums on your
iPhone or iPad you have all photos faces
less import panoramas video slow-mo etc
and below that are the albums you made
on your iOS device or albums you
previously had on iPhoto now I have
several albums like vsco cam afterlight
instagram snapchat that were created
when I exported a photo on my iPhone
moving on to the last tab which is
projects this is where you can create
photo books or cards within the Photos
app and you can
choose from three different formats for
books and cards square classic and
softcover for books letterpress folded
and flat for cards now we're not going
to make a book right now so let's skip
this part and go back to editing as I
said earlier this app is not gonna
replace Lightroom or aperture but it
does offer basic editing tools like the
ability to enhance the photo rotate crop
adjust how bright or dark your photos
are or adjust the different tones of
black and white filter just like on your
iOS device
but it doesn't offer more of a complex
editing experience like aperture or
Lightroom so in the end it's more for
consumers rather than professionals if
you're looking for a more intuitive way
to organize your photos and videos on
your Mac and seamlessly integrate it
with your iOS devices and the Photos app
is an awesome addition to your current
workflow however the only downside to
this app is that you'll have to consider
upgrading your free iCloud account from
five gigs to 20 gigs or 200 gigabyte
options otherwise you won't really be
able to take advantage of the iCloud
photo library it will sync a few photos
if you have enough storage but iCloud
photo library essentially uses your
iCloud storage which means all of your
photos and videos are backed up on a
cloud that's why it needs all that
storage you can use the Photos app like
a regular photo app and use up local
hard drive space but the cooler features
like syncing between iOS and OS 10 won't
work unless you have enough iCloud
storage space anyways that's it for this
