TechnoBuffalo we have the brand new
Samsung Galaxy s5 here in the office and
with it comes a fingerprint reader
inside the home button we'll walk you
through how to set that up and how it
works in this video okay so we have the
galaxy s5 open I'm in the settings menu
and then you're gonna select fingerprint
scanner to register your fingerprints so
we're gonna click that manage it since
we don't have any registered right now
and it's telling us that we have two we
can use our thumb for the printer print
fingerprint lock rather and the verify
your Samsung Account also PayPal is
adding support for that too so here we
go register the fingerprint I'm gonna
take my thumb and swipe down we got one
with a green light there two three four
five six seven eight so again this
requires a swipe so it's a little
different than say the iPhone 5s where
you just sort of push your fingerprint
on and give it different angles so enter
a password here let's say Todd okay your
fingerprint has been registered type
okay to go to select screen the locks so
basically now we're gonna go here then
select the way to unlock the phone I'm
gonna say fingerprint because that's the
way we want to do it we have one
fingerprint registered my thumb and we
should be all set here okay so now when
the phone is locked see right here it's
locked we have the option to choose an
alternate password or as this says here
we can use my thumb to unlock the phone
didn't work on the first try so it took
four tries right there but it eventually
worked and now we're inside the phone so
generally I found with the iPhone 5s it
works a lot better than the swipe
mechanism here and obviously it wasn't
that accurate there even though I
registered my fingerprint eight times in
the settings menu so I think Samsung
could do a bit better to make it more
accurate is it a big deal that you're
just swiping several times to unlock the
phone no and we can see even right now
if it works better but here's one two
three so that took
three times right there I think they
could work on the accuracy but overall
not that bad and it's certainly another
option for unlocking your phone as
opposed to a password or a pattern or
anything like that okay that was a quick
look at the fingerprint reader on the
galaxy s5 let us know what you think in
the comments down below and if you have
any other questions be sure to let us
know too what's up everyone thank you
