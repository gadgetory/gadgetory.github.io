for lakers calm here yesterday was
driving home from hanging out and I
noticed my phone wasn't working I kept
getting a message saying inserts itunes
with the little cord and the itunes logo
figured i had a crash no big deal got
home plugged it in said items can't
recognize a phone invalid sim and
invalid imei number so that was never a
good sign tried to do a force restore
that gonna work so i made appointment
with my apple store local apple store
today brought the phone in and took a
look at it and replaced it on the spot
with a brand new iphone which was very
impressive no questions asked the whole
thing took 20 minutes once again i am
very impressed with apples customer
service you know you do pay a little bit
more for their products but i'm starting
to think more and more that that extra
little bit is worth it for the
ease-of-use experience you know I've had
phones break before I've had to go back
to AT&amp;amp;T and there's always trouble and I
gotta send it back to the ATT store wait
a few days for it to show up and then
send back the old one so it's just a
really simple exchange they gave me a
brand new phone and I was out the door
really which is a pleasant experience so
I want to ask you guys what is your
experience been at the apple store have
you guys had good ones bad ones you know
what do you dread having to go in there
because you're not gonna get anything
done have you had a bad time talking to
Apple customer care you know let me know
leave text comments or video comments
just want to make a real quick video
just some curious to know what you guys
think and I guys that's it it's friday
the fourteenth here in California it's
about 150 I try and wrap up work and go
out myself a good weekend I hope you
guys do the same should I check out the
