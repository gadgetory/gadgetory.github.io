from TechnoBuffalo here and today we are
taking a first look at the brand new
just announced pixel 2 and the pixel 2
XL writer as you can see i am at the
google event there you go mkbhd cameo
right there so a lot to like about these
phones let's start with the screens so
the screen on the pixel XL 2 that I have
right here stayed the same it's 5 inches
but to the XL jumped from 5.5 to 6
inches the technology that changed both
phones are now utilizing OLED panels the
XL so as a full HD screen since 1920 by
1080 whereas the pixel XL 2 has jumped
up to qHD powering this guy you've got a
snapdragon 835 4 gigs ram available in
64 or 128 you notice on the bottom
though there's something missing on
these phones we are missing a headphone
jack that is now gone the way of the
dodo and the iPhone boy do have though
is a aluminum unibody back sort of has a
texture on it doesn't feel quite like
aluminum but because the back is metal
wireless charging is not going to be
here the camera though is a giant deal
the original pixel camera was awesome
remembered had a DxO score of 89 at the
time was the highest that had ever been
given to a mobile phone they up to their
game here this one got a DxO score of 98
which is pretty unprecedented it's a
little bit better than 12 megapixels an
8 megapixels on the front without an F
1.8 aperture but there's a lot of of
course when it comes to pixel phone's on
a soft worked week so first very similar
what we seen from HTC and of course
since it pretty much is bought the
engineers from HTC you can now squeeze
the phones and things will happen you
can launch the assistant in self which
by giving it a squeeze and they claim
that it'll work in a case and all some
difference between accidental squeezes
also you'll notice the UI here is
different the dock is different the
pixel launcher so you've got your dock
right across the top and persistent
google search and then you've got your
navigation buttons down below I don't
quite know how I feel about that as I
sort of go through and scroll through
screens but
is what it is google search now lives at
the bottom of course android 8.0 Oreo
ice here as well also new we now have an
always-on display and you'll see things
all start to populate here like
notifications and other things as the
software gets more mature and if this
was a bit of a quadrat miss fear if I
was gonna play music the phone will
automatically know what song was playing
and show it down below and you could
play a drinking game at the event here
how many times Google said machine
learning but that's what's sort of
taking care of all the heavy lifting
here with the phone it looks pretty nice
and it feels pretty nice in the hand I
know a lot of you guys are big into
speakers we now have front-facing
speakers on these phones on the top and
bottom and spec wise the XL and the
irregular pixel are almost identical say
for the screen size and resolution and
battery size here so the XL is gonna
have a battery of about twenty seven
sixty whereas the sorry the pixels got a
battery of twenty seven sixty whereas
the XL is about thirty five twenty are
gonna be available October 19 for six
forty nine or eight hundred and forty
nine dollars the colors are white blue
or blog I pretty much called it you'll
see though they did do a turn of a pop
of color on the side you can see right
there on the XL you've got an orange
home button I will say though the OLED
technology on these screens look really
nice and you can clearly see a
difference here and I know that
difference is gonna translate over to
YouTube but I want you guys to get a
real quick early look at these phones
the big question here is what do you
what do you think is it worth an upgrade
is it something that you want to move
from original pixel you're gonna switch
from another Android device or move from
an Apple phone I love to your thoughts
on it this is a real quick first look at
the brand new pixel XL - so then you
guys also you think about these live
videos we're doing from the events or to
your thoughts on that until next time
