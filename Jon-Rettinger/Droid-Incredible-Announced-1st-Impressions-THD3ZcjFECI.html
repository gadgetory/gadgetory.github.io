from technobuffalo here if you're a geek
like me if you're watching this video
there's a good chance you are you love
flagship smartphones the few devices
that are released each year that pushed
their respective platforms and carriers
to another level and are really loaded
with all the hottest new technology well
we got the announcement of another one
today a much long rumored and much-hyped
phone dubbed officially the droid
incredible a new smartphone running
android 2.1 for Verizon Wireless let's
go run through the specs because that's
really what separates this handset from
the rest of the pack so it is running
HTC's custom sense interface if you've
seen it I demonstrated actually on the
nexus one on a custom rom and Brendan
demonstrated actually earlier in the day
on the HTC Desire it's a really
impressive skin on top of android 2.1
and really adds a ton of new features
for instance it adds something called
leap view which essentially a pinch and
zoom to access all your windows I
believe you get access to seven home
screens I really can customize the
device quite a bit HTC also added
something called french stream which
actually unifies all of your social
networks from Facebook Flickr Twitter
all into one very similar to what
Motorola has done with their motoblur
interface it's got an eight megapixel
camera that is not a mistake an 8
megapixel camera with dual-led flash
it's got a 3.7 inch wvga screen which
means 480 across and 800 down which is
also amylin amo led of course capacitive
those you guys might be wondering what
AMOLED or wvga or any of those numbers I
just went over means the mls screams
means you're going to get much much much
darker blacks and much brighter colors
actually use less power the resolution
that I mentioned is extremely high so
that means you're actually going to be
getting much crisper fonts you're going
to get really bright you're looking
icons and things that just look a little
bit clearer and they also make the font
look a bit smaller but you're just going
to get sort of a clear overall
shirt it features an optical joystick so
no more track balls to be a thing in the
past it's got a proximity sensor a light
sensor digital compass of course all the
other standard smartphone features
including GPS Wi-Fi a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack so the big question is when
can you get your hands on one especially
if you're a Verizon Wireless customer
looking to make a switch over to verizon
of pre-orders are going to begin on
April nineteenth and they will be
shipped and fulfilled and in stores on
April 29th a price is going to be 1 99
99 after a hundred dollar manufacture
mail-in rebate this phone is really the
nexus one with HTC Sense and a much much
better camera so if you're waiting for a
verizon nexus one to come out this may
actually be a better bet for you I'm a
big fan of the sense interface I like
Android as a whole but sense really
takes it to a next level and add sort of
a more custom flair to it adds a little
bit more 3d graphics makes it feel a bit
more polished you're going to get all
the good 2.1 features including
pinch-to-zoom sort of 3d trays and all
kinds of other fun stuff you see me
demonstrate in previous videos I'm very
excited to get my hands on the HTC
incredible looks to be a fantastic
device that is really what verizon users
have been waiting for certainly there's
been versions of the nexus one out now
for t-mobile and for 18 TV you can buy
directly from google's website but the
verizon version we've been waiting on
and now it looks like it's becoming
relevant before it even launched because
of the incredible sort of boasts it and
beats it in the megapixel and user
interface Department sorry guys excited
about incredible I'm really looking
forward to getting my hands on it like I
said I think it's going to be a
fantastic phone for verizon wireless you
guys curious what you have to say leave
comments down below or bigger responses
whenever you like i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i see in the next
video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
