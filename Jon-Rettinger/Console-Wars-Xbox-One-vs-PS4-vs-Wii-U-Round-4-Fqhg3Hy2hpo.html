the console wars to PlayStation 4 showed
off its assets in the hardware
department taking down the Xbox one and
CPU and GPU performance the matchup is
now three to one and in the next round
we're going to be taking a look at
it's a medium aureole oh hello Mario
cool what can I do you for
why don't do you include Nintendo in the
console war well to tell you the truth
Mario I feel Nintendo has very little
place in the console wars and this round
tell you what back to the console
the console wars is finally back from
hiatus and for those who don't follow me
on Twitter the delay was thanks to a
little addition to my family so between
my busy day job and first months of
fatherhood it's been a bit tricky to
find time to play games
let alone make an in-depth analysis of
several platforms I feel like I owe it
to the viewers to actually base the
console wars on experience and not just
pull facts out of a hat the beginning of
my story with Nintendo stands back two
and a half decades the Christmas of 1989
little did I know back then that that
particular event would define how I
spend my spare time for the next 25
years the NES was the machine that saved
the gaming industry from the slump of
the early 80s which was caused mainly by
the market being flooded with content
more suitable for landfills than living
rooms so what changed exactly a certain
Japanese company came along with
characters and stories that people
actually cared about and with gameplay
mechanics that were easy to pick up and
very difficult to master
after joking around on Nintendo's
expense I think I owe it to them to
clear up some annoyingness conceptions
that I seem to run into quite often so
free your mind of all the Nintendo
related negative hype and listen up
Nintendo is undoubtedly in many ways
alienated a large slice of its younger
audience with the questionable
copyrights policies that restrict
youtubers from creating let's play
videos Nintendo currently offers a
creators program for youtubers where it
takes 30 to 40-percent ad revenue
generated by the videos and the company
can still take a hundred percent of the
ad revenue if it's not happy with the
content so I can definitely see why
people are up in arms but consider this
the amount of youtubers with let's play
content has grown exponentially over the
past couple of years and more and more
people are spending their time watching
gaming related videos and streams and
actually playing the games themselves
and this trend has evolved into an
entirely new form of media consumption
that I think is somewhat in direct
competition with people actually paying
and playing the games
and I think Nintendo has issue with this
as well and they've made a conscious
decision based on old-school principles
not to consider the video watching
audience as potential buyers for their
hardware and software and Nintendo knows
exactly that there are thousands upon
thousands of youtubers who are willing
to give that 30 to 40 percent cut to the
company just to be able to stream
Nintendo games obviously in the process
Nintendo has pissed off a lot of people
but the company knows that their core
audience is very loyal and this kind of
negative PR can be brushed off with a
single shrug it all comes down to what
Nintendo things will affect purchase
decisions of their hardware and software
this or this another very popular
statement that I wholeheartedly disagree
with is that Nintendo needs to release
its content on mobile platforms iOS and
Android
again brand evaluation and dilutions
into play Nintendo sees no benefit in
releasing its content in venues that are
populated with hundreds of thousands of
shovelware games that are worth less
than the dollar they cost for every
smash hit mobile game there's a thousand
greed filled free-to-play abominations
that even the developers themselves in
their heart of hearts are ashamed of
profit margins of mobile games are
highly overstated the company sees no
reason to pay Apple and Google are cut
for hosting inferior versions of Mario
and Zelda especially when seven million
people are still willing to pay 40 bucks
for games like Animal Crossing on the
3ds grand illusion assigned in Tendo
designs gained around tight mechanics
and controls that require physical
buttons and I really don't see the word
compromise in the company's vocabulary
sure there's huge potential for a quick
cash grab but in the long run inferior
controls combined with the variable
experience caused by horrible
fragmentation especially on Android
would only dilute the appeal of great
great Nintendo classics I personally do
not want to see this happen
say what you want about Nintendo it's
one of the very few companies that stays
true to its core and is willing to
sacrifice some income to maintain it
many have been quick to dig Nintendo's
grave ever since a flop of the Gamecube
but lucky for us Nintendo is in it for
the long haul and they've played their
finances smart enough to last them for
decades to come even if they're making
bubkis and speaking of bupkis the
exterior hardware design of the Wii U
doesn't say much it looks like a pretty
minimalistic rounded brick nothing too
offensive and flashy but definitely not
something I'd like to have on display in
terms of technical number-crunching
prowess and space on a triple core
PowerPC CPU codename espresso coupled
with a 550 megahertz AMD GPU codenamed
latte you know sometimes the code names
for chips really speak for themselves I
mean the Wii U offers about a quarter of
the number crunching performance of the
Xbox one and less than a fifth of the
power of the ps4 so any direct
comparisons are completely redundant the
Wii U is closer to the ps3 and xbox360
in performance than it is to its
generational counterparts but don't get
me wrong this does not mean the Wii U
can't produce beautiful visuals it
definitely can some games even run at
1080p 60 frames a second but what the
Wii U will never do is push modern games
with ultra-high res textures complex
physics tessellation and other
cutting-edge graphics processing I mean
forget about thank felides kooky
characters really don't need much of any
of that fancy-pants graphical flair and
blue dazzle although I would not mind
some extra anti-aliasing in some cases
other than that Mario 3d World Mario
Kart 8 and Bayonetta 2 all look gorgeous
for what they are and aren't any less
fun without the high-end graphics all
the Wii you will never achieve the
levels of photo realism as a competition
smart use of colors and simple textures
combined with polished shader effects
can provide gorgeous fully fleshed out
worlds
are quite sufficient for the likes of
the Mushroom Kingdom and Hyrule but for
the many worlds that are not out of
Nintendo's own sketchbook that's another
story thanks to the similar hardware
architecture between the ps4 and Xbox
one and multi-platform development is
pretty much a breeze but this puts the
powerpc-based Wii U in an awkward
position reporting games requires some
extra effort on top of that ports
require significantly downgraded
graphics plus some extra development
time thanks to that Wii U gamepad
despite some optimistic statements from
Nintendo before launch aspirations of
big third-party titles such as Call of
Duty Arkham Knight
Metal Gear phantom pain or any other
multi-platform games for that matter can
be buried and forgotten Nintendo has
done very little to keep the third
parties happy and one by one Ubisoft EA
and Activision have quietly backed away
from actively supporting the Wii U
Ubisoft ended up taking the hardest hit
with decent launch games the tanked
thanks to the horrific ly bad sales
numbers of the Wii U despite third
parties jumping ship for Nintendo this
isn't as big of a loss as what most
would think the lion's share of Nintendo
platform hits and cash cows have always
been Nintendo first party titles with of
course a few exceptions to make the rule
but getting back to the console itself
the Wii U gamepad is an essential part
of the Wii U Hardware the tablet /
gamepad Hybrid has been somewhat of a
hard sell to hardcore gamers and it
definitely took me some convincing that
it can offer anything beyond sheer
gimmickry the gamepad is also a bit
tricky to explain to casual gamers who
already own an iPad or Android tablet
and an all.we for that matter the naming
scheme didn't help the situation either
I mean Wii U is a dumb name it ended up
misleading even the mainstream media to
think that the gamepad was an accessory
for the original Wii I mean even the
super we would have been a better name
in this regard in terms of ergonomics
the Wii U gamepad is fine the matte
textured buttons and triggers are sturdy
old-school Nintendo quality
and the d-pad is actually sublime for
games that require speed and intricate
position shovelknight perfect example
simple and pure gameplay mechanics only
possible with physical controls so
smartphones and tablets you can still go
ahead and suck it otherwise the Wii U
gamepad is quite comfortable the rounded
ridges in the back help it feel more
like a controller and less like a tablet
while it kind of reminds you of a beefed
up 3ds the ergonomics are clearly more
thought-out and comfortable compared to
what the competition offers the analog
sticks and triggers are quite
satisfactory they offer quite a bit less
range of motion but overall the Wii U
gamepad holds its own surprisingly well
against the Xbox one and ps4 controllers
it does however weigh half a kilo or
pound which means that it's not as
comfortable to handle for extensive
gaming sessions nor is the battery life
equipped to do so the 6.2 inch screen
does a good job of draining the battery
within three to five hours so keep the
cord handy in terms of touch screen use
even after two years it still has some
ways to go most of the gameplay
mechanics tied in with the use of the
screen are fun nothing mind-blowing and
nothing really that couldn't be
accomplished with the physical buttons I
guess the main problem is the majority
of games force the use of the gamepad
but take very little use of its features
which just makes it an expensive heavy
controller after over a year of use I
still find myself neglecting to utilize
the second screen no matter how much I
make an effort of it it doesn't come
natural to look down to check the map on
Mario Cart or switch over to use touch
screen functions mid-game it more often
than not breaks the immersion and offers
anything that can expand upon the gaming
experience Nintendo took a risk with the
Wii mote and that risk definitely paid
off the company took another risk with
the Wii U gamepad and that didn't
exactly pan out but as they say if you
don't risk it you ain't gonna get the
biscuit that being said the Wii U
gamepad does have a built in feature
that the competition can't offer at
least out of the box streaming to the
gamepad or remote play works flawlessly
late
he is superb with next to no delay and
the wireless reach is about 30 feet or
10 meters a bit less than with the Vita
and the ps4 but sufficient for
moderately sized home surprisingly the
Wii U offers a buttery smooth frame rate
that trumps that of the ps4 and Vita
combo and it effortlessly handles even
the fasted pace of action games like
Bayonetta 2 with I think surprisingly
little compromise the 6.2 inch screen is
adamantly sharp but the contrast and
viewing angles leave some room for
improvement it's definitely no oled
screen which is understandable for the
price tag the Wii U gamepad is also
equipped with near-field communication
and the purpose is quite simple if
you're still a noun as to the appeal of
the Nintendo brand and its family of
characters the number of amiibo sold in
the first two months may convince you
otherwise
sometimes the sum is larger than all the
technical parts and in the Wii U's case
that is absolutely true from a technical
perspective the Wii U has more in common
with the shoe than it does with its
console brethren the deluxe model only
has 32 gigs of storage space which of
course can be expanded with the external
hard drive but it's clear that it's not
intended for digital downloads and
you'll end up playing most of your games
off game DVDs and this means the DVD
Drive will be running constantly making
the Wii U the noisiest of the bunch the
Wii U is not cutting edge technology and
the faster you get over this fact the
faster you will discover what Nintendo
is all about I can give you a hint and
another
and perhaps another
if there's one thing that you can be
sure about is that you will not see
unfinished games of the likes of
Assassin's Creed unity in battlefield 4
on the Wii U Nintendo is old-school in
this sense as well it releases games
that are completed and they shine with
Polish that is something that cannot be
said about many games these days and
even the my tier of gaming Giants have
succumb to this atrocious trend for
better and for worse Nintendo is
conservative you may not agree with the
company's policies but at least they are
pretty consistent I can't be said for
everyone
I'd probably not invest in the company's
stock as some of Nintendo's decisions
really don't invoke investor confidence
I mean what the fuck but the games the
games continue to be truly just that
good Super vine tight gameplay mechanics
and with a level of polish that should
be the industry standard in Tendo has
exclusive games that invoke a sense of
joy and sheer fun that at this stage of
the game the competition simply cannot
touch
but unfortunately while we're still in
the hardware rounds we you simply cannot
compete so no points are awarded in this
round however what Nintendo managed to
achieve is my newly discovered respect
for what the Nintendo brand encompasses
follow me on Twitter and stay tuned for
the next installment of the console wars
