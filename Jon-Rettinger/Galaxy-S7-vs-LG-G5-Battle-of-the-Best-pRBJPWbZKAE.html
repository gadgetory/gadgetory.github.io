smartphone pretty much everyone out
there is good there just varying degrees
of what they do better we put a poll out
on Twitter to compare to smartphones
overwhelmingly you guys wanted to see
the LG g5 versus the Samsung Galaxy s7
this comparison I'm not gonna focus on
specs and compare processors Ram both
phones work fast both phones will do
pretty much whatever you need them to do
let's jump right in with the camera
starting with the Samsung Galaxy s7 it
does share its camera third galaxy s7
edge if you want to use that fist
comparison as well both Samsung devices
Rock a 12 megapixel rear camera with an
ass 1.7 aperture optical image
stabilization or oh is I'd call it ice
and a 5 megapixel front-facing camera
with a wide-angle lens
LG on the other hand took a fresh
approach with the g5 did that risk pay
off the g5 comes at the pretty unique
camera setup it's got two cameras on the
back one is 16 megapixel with an F 1.8
aperture and oh is as well say next to a
wide-angle lens at 8 megapixels as well
as a megapixel front-facing sensor the
galaxy s7 s got better dynamic range in
the LG g5 the g5 tends to crush shadows
whose all taking the loss of a ton of
detail both LG g5 cameras are sixteen by
nine while Samsung went back to the
tried-and-true four by three this gives
it less horizontal coverage but way more
vertical they're different resolutions
to 16 megapixels for the LG g5 versus 12
for the s7 giving the LG an edge in
pretty good normal light you will
however absolutely notice distortion
when shooting white photos at the LG g5
this is just kind of par for the course
the camera this Wyatt at half the
resolution in a wider field of view the
white camera just will not compete when
it comes to the finest of details so a
verdict on the camera the white camera
on the g5 is a totally new way to look
at pictures and take them on a phone the
dual camera was kinda gimmicky on the g5
it was there mostly for the selfie
camera but capturing so much in the
scene for one picture is really cool to
see the galaxy s7 has faster autofocus
and just better shot the shot time it
also offers better processing but it's
just really tuned for me though if I got
to pick one of these suckers up I'm
picking up the LG g5 photos look way
more natural and I think have more
accurate colors so while it always helps
Samsung's cameras in high esteem I think
they've been the market leader when it
comes
displays the screen on the galaxy s7 is
a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED 1440 by 2560
display the g5 is a little bit bigger at
5.3 inches in the same resolution both
have almost identical screen to body
ratios just like a hair over 70% which
is a gross way to say a little bit more
than 70% the screen on a g5 is world's
better than what we have in the g4 and
versus almost any other phone this would
be a way closer battle but it just can't
compete with the galaxy s7 and galaxy s7
edge screen you've got Super AMOLED
display you've got guerrilla glass
you've got incredible viewing angles the
blacks look really black colors look
bright vibrant outdoor visibility is
better than what you get on the g5 if I
got a pixel on these phones just based
on screens 100 out of 100 times I'm
going to the Samsung so without
intangibles there's a lot that both
these phones brings the table Samsung
has refined the galaxy s6 built almost
perfection and Elliott added expandable
storage 1960 at waterproofing
all that coupled with fast charging both
wired and wireless the gear VR Samsung
pay gorilla glass you've got a really
well rounded phone but it's not perfect
software while silvina Samsung's ever
made it is still bulky and oftentimes
cumbersome the speakers are muffled
presumably from the waterproofing and a
3000 milliamp hour battery goes super
fast LG like the popular kid in high
school brings its friends along and
these friends are important to some an
extra battery the cam plus and the LG
360 cam if you need a removable battery
your shirt should start and stop with
the g5 but the phone is not perfect so I
commend LG for taking your brand new
approach to phones but the benefits of
modularity at least as it exists today
are outweighed by traditional design and
that's IB 68 for me if they're partners
or even LG themselves will start to
offer more modular friends the g5 could
be a huge hit I think we're getting
there but having a phone that's modular
having a phone who's modules are useful
are very different LG did an incredible
job with the g5 I don't think we'll see
the full vision realize until we get to
the g6 they're both really solid options
but based on the comparisons and
tangibles screen and camera think I got
to go for the Samsung
what do you guys think do you agree or
disagree did you pick up one of these
phones give the video a thumbs up be
certainly always appreciate it leave
comments down below
till next time John renter from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video so
as you guys debate which phones you want
to
do battle next I want to thank our
friends at Atlassian and TechnoBuffalo
we have staff all over the country in
the world they make it super easy to
work together with JIRA we can assign
and track tasks and projects with
confluence we can create and share
content we can message each other about
text and video with HipChat we can
manage kotas redesign our site in real
time with bitbucket check those folks
out they do a really good job good
