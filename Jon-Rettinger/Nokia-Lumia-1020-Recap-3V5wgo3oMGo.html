TechnoBuffalo here let's talk about the
Nokia event and the Lumia 1020 lots of
stuff from Nokia at AT&amp;amp;T this morning as
the EOS officially became the Nokia
Lumia 1020 you can dig into the nitty
gritty on a spec sheet but if i were to
recap it's a 4G LTE 32 gig windows phone
8 device with a 4.5 inch 1280 by 768
AMOLED PureView HD Plus display 2 gigs
of RAM NFC on board and a crazy good
camera so let's talk about this camera
because really that's what this phone is
all about it's pretty much poised to sit
on top of the smartphone camera mountain
if it shoots as good as it sounds
seriously the camera has a whopping
41-megapixel sensor with Zeiss lenses a
nice large f-stop 2.2 aperture and 2nd
gen optical image stabilization it'll
record in 1080p at 30 frames a second
for video and while photos will take
that entire 41 megapixels up the phone
will also make a 5 megapixel version of
your shot that's optimized for texting
or uploading social media emailing all
that stuff so software wise new key is
upping the ante on manual controls which
is something I appreciate as someone who
loves video and photography on my
smartphone so they're giving you the
option to manually control flash focus
iso shutter speed white balancing and
exposure while using their pro camera
app so that's not a huge deal to basic
smartphone users who just like to point
and shoot but it is a nice feature set
for people who like having a little bit
more control over the pictures they're
taking they're also going to be
launching Nokia photo masters for the
Lumia 1020 at first but hopefully
they'll roll this out farther to other
Lumia devices and it's an online kind of
class that will help you become a better
phone tog refer via tips tricks and
other content so that'll be really nice
for anybody who's a budding photographer
but would like to know how to make their
pictures better it's a little bit of a
bummer that the Lumia 1020 doesn't have
expandable storage especially with that
41 megapixel camera but Nokia and AT&amp;amp;T
are trying to mitigate
that with their 80 cloud storage locker
service so if you pick up the Lumia 1020
you'll grab 50 gigs of storage for free
which will be really helpful when you
need to store those huge full res photos
and as for accessories Nokia's including
a leather wrist strap with the phone and
we're guessing that's probably because
it's going to be a little bit heavy
carrying around all of that camera
technology plus you don't want to drop
it I'll get to why in a second there's
also a wireless charging backplate
available for separate purchase and a
different seventy dollar nokia camera
grip accessory that has a snap on grip
with some extra battery life a tripod
mount and a dedicated shutter button so
that's nice do you want it to sort of
feel like a point shoot camera and it
looks like we're going to see the 1020
here in the states as an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive
for two hundred and ninety-nine dollars
subsidized on contract later this month
which I know seems a little bit pricey
especially considering that you can get
an HTC One on t-mobile for ninety-nine
dollars but I guess if you're replacing
a point-and-shoot in that price range
and also obviously combining it with a
smartphone it's not really a painful
idea or a huge stretch that's on sing
it'll be available in matte white black
and what I'm calling oh my god my eyes
yellow so bright will we see the 1020 on
verizon or t mobile here in the US not
at this Junction or at least until we
get variants like Nokia did with the 929
25 and 928 so maybe at some point we'll
see the Lumia 1020 5 and the 1028 later
this year or early next so international
users likely won't have the same carrier
exclusivity problems we have here in the
States you guys are lucky jerks but
overall we are pretty excited about the
Lumia 1020 it might be more geared
toward the photography enthusiasts in
all of us but pictures are kind of a
huge part of social media so it makes
sense to carve out this niche with
PureView technology for mukhiya and give
budding photographers the best
experience possible on a mobile device
will have an unboxing just as soon as we
get our hands on that hot little phone
but until then we are actually dying to
know what you think are you excited
about the
camera are you disappointed in the price
do you love the camera grip add on all
of the above do you agree with all these
things let us know in the comments and
we will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
