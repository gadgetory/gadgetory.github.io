John render from TechnoBuffalo here
today Tuesday August 18th so let's at
the stage of bliss come and announce a
new version of the ps3 this was the much
limit and probably much hyped slim
version that had been circulating around
the internet for quite some time so this
is actually going to be $100 less than
the outgoing ps3 model you better pick
one up for $300 the first week of
September it is 32 percent smaller than
the outgoing ps3 uses 34 percent less
power and it's got all these same
features of the existing 80 gigabyte
model meaning you're going to get one of
the best firmware upgradeable blu-ray
players on the market August you're
gonna get access to sony's vast game
catalog for the ps3 and all their
downloadable content on the PlayStation
Network it's gonna pack hit 120 gigabyte
hard drive it's gonna run you 300 bucks
and as going to be available the first
week of September in addition the
outgoing ps3 model the kind of fatter 80
gigabyte version also has $100 price
drop which is really available today oh
I can't see why you could run out and
buy one of those when the slim burn in
just a couple weeks away I think it's
definitely worth holding out for the
really the big announced it would just
be size and the redesign a new case the
components had shrunk that cost those
components had shrunk so it only made
sense that Sony would update their
console it's just a competitive in the
really ongoing console wars the Xbox the
way you get less standard features was
already coming at a lower price the Wii
was certainly priced lower than the ps3
so now the ps3 are actually gonna be
presented itself as almost a valium
console you're getting a lot for $300
regardless of which side of the fence
you fall on in the Xbox versus ps3
debate you're now getting a lot for your
$300 you were getting bluetooth you're
getting an internet browser you're
getting like I said one of the best
blu-ray players on the market even to
get a firmware upgradeable blu-ray
players
run you even the cheapest now around 100
250 bucks so for you know a little bit
extra you get the ps3 features you get
the downloadable movies TV shows
downloadable games you really are now
getting a lot and the ps3 I can finally
say is a reasonable value at the
previous price point 400 bucks it was
hard to justify it certainly was far
from an impulse purchase
but now for those that have been holding
out you've been rewarded I think a very
nice looking slimmer ps3 kind of went to
wait watch and then change a few pounds
off so what do you guys think about this
announcement certainly you're happy
about the price cuts what do you think
about the design losing these sort of
glossy finish the older ps3 get more of
a matte finish right now you think it
looks cheap you like the design of it
personally I'm a fan
I think it's thin I think it's
relatively good-looking machine I think
that people are going to enjoy it so
leave text or video let me know what you
think for exclusive content check me out
