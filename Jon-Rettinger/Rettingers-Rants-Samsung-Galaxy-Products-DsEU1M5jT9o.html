to you by 23andme
what's up everyone welcome back there
pisode of renter's rant i'm Rios John
Ranger this week I want to rant about
too many damned Samsung devices I am
staring at four different product lines
that are really almost totally
indistinguishable
I love Samsung phones but enough with
the variants renters rants let's get
ranting so before you say them some fans
get all angry and jelly at me let me
explain to you where I'm coming from so
today we unbox this guy the galaxy s4
zoom which exists in a world where this
guy exists the Galaxy camera now tell me
why we need to separate product lines
for both of these this is a big screen
quad-core device the camera is Wi-Fi
connected LT in there it's just not a
phone this is a smaller screen super low
resolution phone that also has a camera
why are there two separate product lines
why is this a galaxy s4 why is this one
a galaxy camera makes zero sense to me
aside from that why does the Galaxy Note
exist in the world of the galaxy mega in
its own separate line decide from that
there are two separate sizes of the
galaxy mega why do we need two separate
phone lines of giant phones why not just
make it the Galaxy Note larger the
Galaxy Note 6.3 it's too confusing for
consumers we've got the galaxy s4 we've
got the galaxy s4 active you got the
galaxy s4 mini and aside from that we've
different variants to the galaxy s4
there's gonna be different quad core
versions coming out soon after 19600
Snapdragon 800 slide from that there's
also the octa-core version the Samsung
Galaxy s4 you see where I'm going there
are too many damn products you guys make
awesome devices your hardware is
incredible the software is baller your
screens are gorgeous I love Samsung
products but there are way too many even
for me to keep track of how could a
consumer out there who just wants a
phone make sense of any of it - welcome
to an AT&amp;amp;T store a carrier store whether
it's you know t-mobile Verizon ever it
might be I can understand that they're
only a few products that they've got
there you say okay I want the galaxy s4
they got it for anything do you say what
the s4 the s4 active
I understand actually the s4 active that
makes sense
can't see why they wouldn't release a
case that might make the rest of the
Samsung Galaxy s4 a sort of active esque
but I get it I understand why that
exists there's a huge need for that
product no issue there at all and I'm
not even saying I've got numbers it's
all these different devices why are they
their own product lines tell me give me
a good reason why these are two separate
product lines I just I didn't understand
it there's a new Galaxy camera coming
out there gonna be a new galaxy zoom
coming out it just it's mind-boggling to
me that Samsung is doing this there are
new devices coming out it seems like
every 13 hours there's a new galaxy s4
variant there's a new Samsung Galaxy
whatever it might be name coming out
whether it's Note mega camera I'm not
just saying this because I'm up and
angry I have people that come to me
friends are like I want to get a new
device I really hear good things about
Samsung what should I get it's hard
telling there's so many different
choices where they go and they're like
hey I don't that much money to spend I
wanted s4 there's an s4 mini but was
also a galaxy s3 to out an upgrade to
the galaxy s4 which is very in the
galaxy s4 do I want they want the
Snapdragon 600 don't want to wait for
the Snapdragon 800 or should I order the
octa-core version you see what I'm
saying too many devices and yes that was
done in just one tape by the way I'm the
Micro Machines guy I just seems like why
can't they combine all these lines they
can keep all the same products but just
make it fluence people can say okay
there's a big phone series there's the
Galaxy Note series they come in
different sizes pick to what's best for
you you want a better camera okay
there's a Galaxy camera line do you want
one of the smaller screen it also has
cell capabilities do you want one with
the larger screen that just has Wi-Fi no
problem there at all the galaxy s4
straight line do you want one that's got
waterproof capabilities that make sense
you want a smaller one there's the
galaxy s4 mini I understand that tablets
- there's Galaxy Tab versions and
there's all kinds of other different
tablet variants that are coming out and
will be coming out just too many product
lines simplify its Samsung make it easy
for your consumers make easy for us to
tell people what to get so I can give
you garden cash let me thank our friends

what secrets your DNA might hold you
ever wanted just to see what that going

career status for conditions that could
be passed on to children and a much more
fun of kids you're worried about what
you might have 23andme is gonna be a
really good way to go the 23andme first
offered the personal genome service in
November 2007 for 999 dollars it
provided only 14 reports but today you
