to you by full sail university welcome
back to their pursuit of ask the
Buffaloes to show you can ask me jon
rettinger whatever question you have
from the ever-expanding galaxy of
technology don't know what phone to get
don't know what operating systems coming
out next it doesn't matter anything you
want to know this is the show where you
can't ask it up this week we're going to
talk some galaxy note 3 we're going to
talk about samsung's galaxy s4
announcement we're going to talk the
next generation of OS 10 and now it
might or might not be similar to windows
8 and a lot of tech in between this is
asked a buffalo let's get asking first
one comes from kevin kim 1111 OS hey
John what do you expect to see in the
next Galaxy Note 3 we're hearing rumors
of screen sizes just getting much bigger
even hearing rumors of a 6.3 inch screen
size we saw Samsung's gamepad adapter at
the galaxy s4 event and it went from
five inches to six point three inches I
didn't think we're gonna see the
opticore processor make another
appearance for international variants I
think we'll see a more commonplace
quad-core Snapdragon chip for us and why
is that well blaze a little nicer with
LTE networks that are going on here in
the United States really you get import
the octa-core version if you like and of
course the new Samsung software suite we
saw unveiled with the galaxy s4 all
kinds of cool new features yes I'm very
excited about the galaxy note 3 this one
comes from Fernando Isaiah rider who
says we've seen tablet pc hybrids for
many companies do you think we'll start
seeing something similar from Apple
maybe the iPad pro or a mat pad gotta
love those names by the way certainly
you're referencing windows 8 windows 8
was really the first operating system
designed for Microsoft to be optimized
with touch in fact you get the best
experience with windows 8 when you are
using yo finger so certainly there's
flagship products that are tablet-based
like the surface but all manufacturers
have really done some crazy things with
windows 8 got Lenovo's yoga pad bends
backwards all kinds of crazy desktops
that turns tablets whether you like
Windows or not it's nice to see
the thought of that model of what a
desktop used to look like really being
potion people a choice they can find the
desktop that works best for them they
want a traditional you know big screen
and a mouse and keyboard next with the
advies options bond something that will
sort of suit your lifestyle you can pick
up and take with you there are those
options as well I think we're going to
see something similar from Apple yes and
no i think we are definitely going to
see a touchscreen OS common probably
come relatively soon we're starting to
see the melding of iOS and OS 10 that's
probably going to become even milder
with the next version of Apple's
operating system of course the desktop
upper insist on being OS 10 I think
we'll see mobile apps that start to work
on the desktop that'll probably be the
first time that we see touch implemented
into screens I think it's going to be a
full-on tablet no I don't think is gonna
be straight up tablet I think we'll see
maybe weird convertibles or perhaps you
can a touchscreen imac might be the
first touchy screen that we see from OS
10 and i might be coming sooner than we
think what do you guys think would you
want a touchscreen Mac are you happy
with just windows 8 I really don't care
at all love to hear your thoughts leave
them in the comments down below Steve
asks hi John I Steve what are your
thoughts on Samsungs presentation of the
galaxy s4 was that an effective method
of presenting a product or was it just
an embarrassment on samsung side well
that's a good question so if you just go
went to New York for the samsung galaxy
s4 veiling it was the biggest venue I've
never seen a product unveiled at was
hosted at Radio City Music Hall where
the famous rock cats performed it was
just a gigantic venue and being in the
center of theater the u.s. they did it
in a very theatrical way they had sets
that changed and moved they had a little
bit of a cheesy host that made some
jokes but really Samsung got a lot of
flack for being a little bit
misogynistic really displaying women in
a 1950s ask fashion they had women that
were talking about trying to find a way
to marry a doctor or use your phone
we're getting your nails done and all
candor I don't really notice it when the
keynote was going on but certainly in
retrospect I went back and watched it
video actually see where people are
coming from I did however notice that it
was super cheesy really really beauty
ridiculously cheesy and I think Samsung
a lot of ways invited that they used
some cool effects what if you're going
to put on theater you'd be prepared to
be critique as if you are theater and
Samsung Todd I've done a flak from
they built an awesome product but for
some that was overshadowed by the crazy
keynotes that they gave and some of the
crazy things I had on stage so we step
aside from the questions for a min thank
