to you by AMD what's up everyone welcome
back to another episode of ask the
buffalo the show where you can ask me
Ashley sceva aka not John Redinger any
question you might have for the wide
world of Technology every Tuesday we put
up a call for questions on TechnoBuffalo
comm you can leave your comments and
questions in that post otherwise you can
send them to me any time of the day or
night at TechnoBuffalo or Ashley ask Ewa
on Twitter just use the hashtag ask the
B so I'll see it and usually I answer
between three and five questions every
episode let's get answering because this
is ask the Buffalo TechnoBuffalo comment
or Josh asked if you were choosing
between chromecast or an Apple TV which
would you choose both can do YouTube and
Netflix and both work well with iOS
devices is it worth it to get a
chromecast if you already own an Apple
TV
well here's the thing Josh so actually
as of this recording which is Friday
afternoon chromecast doesn't quite work
with iOS yet so if I had to choose right
this second it would be Apple TV but I
think what it really boils down to even
with compatibility is two things number
one where do you buy your apps and your
movies and your television shows and
number two what kinds of devices do you
have in your home if you're an Android
based home and you have an HTC One and
you've got a Nexus 7 obviously to me the
chromecast is the better choice if you
have of course Apple products in your
home you want to get an Apple TV because
you're able to do mirroring you're able
to use airplay there's so many options
that Apple TV offers you sure they can
both do YouTube and Netflix but the
other thing is that a box like Roku does
YouTube and Netflix really well so I
think depending on what you're looking
for in terms of streaming from your
mobile device to your television set I
would say as of right now if your Google
household get a chromecast if you're an
Apple person you love iOS Apple TV is
the way to go at artistic revenge asks
which do you prefer for a smartphone
Android iOS or Windows I actually have
this dream of a phone
that is designed like an iPhone has the
same level of productivity as Android I
really like widgets but also has the
camera of Lumia and the notification
system of webOS for me I want that
perfect chimera of smartphones and I
don't obviously think that'll ever exist
because webOS is dead
for day-to-day driver I do have an
iPhone but I also have an HTC one that I
use as a secondary device because I like
to have my finger on the pulse of both
for right now I do use an iPhone as my
daily driver at Kevin Wilson 94 asks it
seems like the 3.5 millimeter audio jack
is gonna be a limiting factor in
thinness do you think we'll see it
superseded I do think at some point
Bluetooth is going to end up just kind
of being a natural part of our
smartphone experience so I don't think
we'll have headphone jacks anymore on
our smart phones but the problem with
that is is that Bluetooth technology is
not quite the same in terms of there's a
lot of tininess to it and a lot of
bluetooth headphones and headsets and
things like that even in the higher end
stuff you just don't get the same rich
audio quality that you might see from
say a hundred and fifty dollar pair of
audio technica cans for your ears for
right now I think the audio technology
is not quite there it's gonna take a
little while to do that and lastly king
of tweets asks hey what is your
education I did graduate high school and
I also have a two year degree of an a a
associated the arts degree in English
and then I have a four-year degree from
Chapman University in television
production so um this is definitely not
anything that's new to me however I did
for a while when I went to school kind
of want to write comedy so I wanted to
write television which I do get to
script stuff still I get to write the
show and and all that stuff but um yeah
so now I do technology which I've loved
since I was a kid with all the great
stuff that I learned in terms of my
official education so that's where I
went for university and it was great but
no plans for masters because really this
kind of stuff right here for a video
production person is your master's
degree um you don't necessarily need it
working out the field way more important
I think before I go I wanted to tell you
guys a little bit about
AMD's newest chip the a-series mobility
APU aloo is tough for a while to find
the right chip for mobile that combined
media performance with great
productivity until now the new a series
mobility APU is the world's first
quad-core chip designed specifically for
tablets and touchscreen laptops like the
Acer Aspire v5 it's also adaptive to
your choice of environment so let's say
you have a hybrid tablet with the
mobility chip on board but you want to
drop it into the AMD turbo dock well the
chip will know it's in there and it'll
deliver up to 40% faster GPU and CPU
performance by taking advantage of any
additional cooling the dock might have
available so that's super awesome if
you're using a device like the Acer
Aspire v5 you have access to a full
Microsoft Office suite making it the
perfect choice if you need to get some
heavy-duty productivity apps going on if
you want to learn more about getting the
best of both mobile and desktop worlds
in your processor head over to AMD comm
to check out the a-series mobility APU
that's it for this week's ask the
