from TechnoBuffalo here at the full
review for you of Apple's new iPad 2
let's go ahead dig in see if it lives up
to the height so before I get to the
review I want to run through the specs
on the iPad 2 very quickly it has a nine
point seven inch and that's measured
diagonal IPS display the resolution of
1024 by 768 or 132 pixels per inch or
PPI and those specs are exactly the same
as a previous generation it's got a
fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating
which I find is kind of funny if you
turn the screen off you can see all the
oil that has ever graced my fingertips
and I didn't just eat some french fries
and touch this I keep generally clean
hands but no matter what there's really
very little you can do as far as keeping
fingerprints off of this so keep that in
mind
oleophobic or not it's being powered by
Apple's new a5 system-on-a-chip which is
actually built by Samsung with a clock
speed of one gigahertz on each core and
it is dual-core now they've been reports
that that's going to throttle down to
800 and up as high as one gigahertz
depending on what application you were
running but Apple is advertising it as a
dual-core 1 gigahertz processor it now
has two cameras whoo it's got a camera
on the back let's go ahead and check out
the butt of the iPad 2 you can see it
right in the upper left hand corner to
the left of the 3G antenna if you have
the 3G model it's capable of recording
video at 720p at 30 frames per second
and I'll put a link down below to the
tests I did of the video quality it's
really bad so this is mostly going to be
used for FaceTime and very short video
video recording don't think this is
going to replace your camera or gonna be
able to take out wedding shots or Ansel
Adams like pictures of waterfalls not
gonna happen this is a very low quality
camera and speaking of the low quality
cameras if you go ahead and head on out
to the front we've got that little
pinhole VGA camera which is also going
to take videos at 30 frames per second
all
little obviously and much lower quality
then even the low quality found on the
rear facing camera but we'll talk about
that a little more as we get into the
review what's going to keep this guy's
lights on is a 25 watt hour battery life
which Apple claims is going to deliver
10 hours of battery and that actually is
a little bit of understatement
I was easily able to get 10 hours of
battery life out of this in fact I got
about 10 hours and 14 minutes with
brightness turned down about medium you
can see where actually where it is right
now is where it kept it and I had video
kept on loop I did turn Wi-Fi off with
Wi-Fi on you're going to probably lose
about two hours out of that but if
you've got a long cross-country flight
and you're flying somewhere you're going
to be able to watch plenty of video on
the sky without it killing out on you
which is very nice and it's gonna
deliver about two hours better battery
performance then it's close competitor
the Motorola Xoom which is a whole extra
movie so if media is going to be
important to you something to keep in
mind let's go ahead and jump back to the
home screen start of rounding out some
of the specs it's got 802 11 and for
Wi-Fi it's got a 3-axis gyroscope
accelerometer speaker and mic all the
stuff you'd expect this new package is
33% thinner then the last generation
iPad you can see my iPad 1 vs. iPad 2
video down below as well to see the
thinness comparison
it feels really light in hands and ever
thought the first generation iPad was
heavy or fat but this one definitely
feels light and it doesn't sacrifice the
sturdiness or build quality it feels
really solid and secure in the hands
feels very nice and one of the things
that I do like about the iPad 2 is you
don't have that wiggle the iPad 1 head
when it's on a flat surface it now stays
nice and solid on the iPad 1 if you put
on a flat surface and you hit the
corners it would sort of do a little bit
of a jiggle go ahead and look like I'm
watching webpages there we do a little
bit of a jiggle that jiggle ain't gonna
happen on the iPad 2 it's gonna come and
actually there are I believe 18
different versions of this ranging from
16 up to 64 gigs either just with Wi-Fi
or with 3G on either AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon no
4G to be had on this in either HSPA+ or
tea varieties and the price range is
going to have a very wide range at 499
to 829 and if you're interested in the
Smart Covers which we'll talk about
those are going to set you back eat a 39
4 polyurethane or almost 70 bucks for
leather all right so we've talked about
the specs you know what's in here how
does it perform well the iPad 2 is
largely the same as a first generation
iPad if you've used a first generation
iPad if you've used an iPhone you've
used an iPod Touch nothing else has
really changed here it's that same
experience on a larger scale now a lot
of people say why would I want an iPad
it's the same as an iPhone just bigger
or it's an iPod Touch but larger and too
big since that's true using Apple device
and being happy using Apple device you
have to be willing to live within its
limitations
you have to know going in that you're
not going to have flash support in the
browser unfortunately you're not going
to have access at least without
jailbreaking to some third party video
players Jack we're able to play back
every audio and video format you're
going to be limited to the Apple
ecosystem and you're gonna have to use
iTunes as that hub now if you're ok with
that you're going to have a very elegant
experience the OS works very well if
you're not ok with that you're never
going to be truly happy with the iPad e
you may want to look elsewhere and I
think that being able to live within the
limitations we're really the definition
of what you'd call a fanboy you're not a
fanboy words the new F word that you see
thrown around on YouTube quite a bit
definitely something to keep in mind so
let's talk about the browser the new a5
chip does make this very fast again I
never thought the first generation iPad
was a slow device but we're looking at a
very quick experience again if you look
at my iPad 1 versus iPad 2 video it
loads pages very very fast noticeably
faster than the previous version there's
a new Safari engine in here it might
help that it's got an extra bit of RAM
it's up from 500 and up from 256 to 512
here but things just load fast
applications load very quickly pinch to
zoom here is really quick again I never
thought the first generation was slow
but if I want to load some
like let's say my favorite Angry Birds
things just load very quickly on here go
ahead and launch it up you get the
splash screen
Rovio and things are ready to play
generally a few seconds before what
you'd have on the first generation so
there we go
ready to play do a quick rotate you can
go ahead and get going it does load fast
one of the biggest benefits I think
we're going to see from the iPad 2
versus the iPad 1 haven't been realized
yet so this is technically capable of
twice the speed of the first generation
and technically capable of delivering
nine times a graphic performance all the
applications and all the games that are
currently found in the App Store were
designed for the iPad ones power so not
much of difference now with the iPad 1
and the iPad 2 however moving forward
it's presumed that developers will focus
a lot more on the iPad twos prowess so
we'll see a lot of the benefits of the
faster processor of the dual core of
that actually the extra core the extra
ram in here sort of as we move forward
set is yet to be realized
so here's Infinity Blade one of the
arguably more graphics intensive games I
demonstrated during my iPad 1 vs iPad 2
video it looks beautiful but it looked
beautiful on the iPad 1 I really like
the thinness and I like the design of
the iPad 2 it feels very good in hand
although it's going to be very tough to
say upgrade from an iPad 1 to an iPad 2
you're going to get largely the similar
same experience what you're not going to
get or what you are going to get rather
from the frustration to the second arrow
loops cameras which is also going to
give you access to photo booth which let
you do all kinds of fun little video
things here pictures you can use it
doing video or stills go ahead and turn
that you can see there are nine
different choices here I demonstrated
this in a previous video again link to
that will be down below showing what all
these different choices are cuz if I
move my hand you can see it doing all
kinds of different stuff it's fun it's a
little bit of a gimmick something you
can use to taking you Facebook
self-portraits but again nothing that's
going to replace your everyday camera
it's a fun addition it's not a
compelling reason to upgrade a lot of
people were interested in the color
Apple has had a hard
I'm shipping white devices that aren't
MacBooks recently so here we have
obviously the white version of the iPad
2 as far as the white versus black goes
I decided to go with the white version I
thought it was different it doesn't look
yellow to me like people are reporting
and I haven't had any screen bleeding
issues on the sides but I kind of wish
that I had gone for the black version
the white one for whatever reason feels
a little bit cheap and looks a little
bit cheap to me I don't know that's
because I'm associating the white now
with the plastic MacBook but if you have
a choice between the white or the black
I definitely recommend going into the
Apple store and deciding which one's
going to be right for you if I could go
back in time probably would take out the
black one although I am very happy with
the white model that we have here so
really in summation conclusion it's the
iPad it's everything you know or love
about the iPad just a little bit faster
again I think we're going to see these
benefits as developers continue to build
and take advantage of the new platform
here you've got things like Smart Covers
HDMI out and such which are nice
features but they're definitely aside
selling features so here is the Smart
Cover for example I'll go ahead and show
you real quickly what this looks like
again did a full demonstration of this
it is a very expensive cover for your
iPad ranging anywhere from ganna from 39
all the way up to $70 to cover your iPad
so it uses magnets on the side it'll
auto align on the iPad 2 if you just
sort of drag it across the bottom on the
left and that is it and it will wake it
or put it to sleep depending on whether
it's open or closed you can go ahead and
turn it into a little bit of a triangle
and you can prop your iPad up while
typing and you can prop it up while
watching movies or whatever you want to
do to not hold your iPad if you need to
hands it's pretty stable go ahead and
see that right there
I wouldn't necessarily put much pressure
on it but it does work to cover for your
iPad if there's nothing however to cover
the back of your device
so you may want to invest in a
third-party case go ahead and close this
up and put it right back down
here so if you are been waiting so if
you've been waiting to get a tablet and
you weren't sure if the iPad 2 was for
you even looking at the iPad 1 even
looking at the Motorola Xoom if you can
live within the limitations of the Apple
iOS ecosystem go ahead and jump right
into the iPad 2 you won't be
disappointed you're going to get a fast
browsing experience you're going to get
one of the most elegant mobile browsers
that I have seen one that just works
very very well on delivers content
beautifully the screen while the same as
the last generation still delivers very
bright content I would have liked you
seeing a little bit higher resolution if
you have a previous generation iPad or
if you've got an older tablet that still
works there's not much of a compelling
reason to go ahead and upgrade despite
the extra year developers might have to
develop some games you may be may be
better off sleeping this generation and
saving your money for the iPad 3 zoom 2
or whatever webOS device may be out then
and you guys love to hear your thoughts
do you agree or disagree is the iPad 2
for you did you buy one
have you been enjoying it are you not
enjoying if you're taking it back did
you wait in line all that good stuff
anything else that you'd like to see on
the iPad 2 leave your comments down
