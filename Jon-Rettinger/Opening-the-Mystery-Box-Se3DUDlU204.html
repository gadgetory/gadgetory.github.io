from TechnoBuffalo here we got a
surprise box from the folks at Mophie I
wasn't sure what to do with it if we
should just open it up on Instagram or
Facebook and I put out a post on Twitter
asking if you guys wanted to see what
was inside of here and the answer was a
pretty loud yes I put it up on the desk
behind I mean people could see the
background and David Lee asked if I'd
wear this mask while I did the unboxing
little Michael Myers II so I'm gonna
just put that aside we haven't checked
out David you definitely should will
link to him up here alright so we would
generally don't know what is in here not
a sponsor or anything you just sent this
giant box if you could me take a look
I've got a guy in the front looking a
little Messiah II backlit hands out like
they had a plane crash and this guy's
got batteries feels like don't worry
guys might not have food or water but
you can totally play pokemon that kid
seems jazz about it alright so I really
do not know what is in here
so let's open it up you know it was
really heavy though for whatever that's
worth so let's go ahead and kick off
this lid system let itself is super
heavy push that off to the side and we
have not surprisingly just a lot of
Mophie packs here looks like there's
some stuff underneath so Mophie redid
their lineup different materials now
there's USBC support so let's see what
we got
we've got movi pack with look at that
USB see is now here in sort of a more
traditional movie look I've always liked
movies because you can get that charging
indicator to let you know how much juice
you have usually if you buy ones that
come fully charged they pick it up at
the airport you are good to go
also I leave quick charging is onboard
as well I believe part of their new line
as well was this new kind of a colored
series sort of matches up with the
iPhone color so rose gold so to speak
now plastic on the side also brought the
cost of these down same thing same
indicator this is what the rose gold one
looks like we also have okay so this one
is uh Murphy's had some similar products
but there's a new materials for it
this has the cables built-in so it's got
lightning and I believe you pop this off
and there's micro USB but
do you totally gonna lose this here just
gonna fall fall off I wish it was
tethered somehow to that cable but if
you want that you've got the cables
built-in continuing more traditional
movie look here just bigger batteries
bigger milliamp hours all charging with
micro USB except for that one
so what's underneath here take a look
that parts heavy all right so it says
movi power for all I think there's more
stuff here ha the cheat sheet to see
what's actually in here we've got just a
balls ton more battery packs it's an
actual term of measurement ball its ton
it's more than like a balls ounce or
like a balls pound more this is a little
nice little light pack for traveling
done up in all blue micro USB here
you've got bigger versions of their new
packs there there's the gold version and
then a giant pack here which is let's
say 20,000 million power battery so a
lot of my power batteries here with
three full size USB ports and charging
via micro USB
we've got smaller version the one that
sort of meant for the iPhone at their
product line with that cable that comes
off and is it's probably gonna get lost
but if you need to use it you've got it
built right in there and it tucks away
we've got this guy another version with
the cables that come off just different
million power sizes and I think we have
opinion under here heavy materials Oh
same unnecessarily large amount of micro
USB cables for charging each one of
those things we've got some USB C cables
for the USB C power bricks and we've got
just another bigger micro USB cable and
this is everything new in movies product
line so we'll see how they work I'm
usually like movies in the past but
there's been an onslaught of lower cost
competition we've bought a lot of packs
from from anchor in the past we featured
a lot of those especially the USBC
battery pack so it's like movies trying
to get caught up
different ranges from 12 hours extra up
to 48 hours of extra battery life so
we'll link to stuff down below in case
you want to learn more I think all this
is actually available for purchase so
that's what you think
surprise in boxing always fun from the
folks at movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
