John retina from TechnoBuffalo here with
an unboxing that I'm very excited about
this is sort of a yearly ritual now we
have the iPhone for a 32 gigabyte black
version ready to be unwrapped so without
further ado let's go ahead and get
started and for those of you that may be
wondering at home here is the 3GS box
next to it just a little bit thinner
here on the iPhone 4 side so of course
we will use the big ol knife to dig in
go ahead and cut through the packaging
and the way the Box looks is very
familiar to older generation iPhone it's
got a picture of the device on the front
Apple logo Apple logo iPhone 4 iPhone 4
and then some specs on the back but
enough about the box it's what's inside
that counts go ahead and open it up
we've got just a bit of cardboard on top
nothing on the side and I have not held
one of these or seen one so I'm very
excited to sort of see what this looks
like here is the iPhone 4 and until you
it feels very solid in hand very
impressively so actually if both put
that off to the side for just a minute
and we'll dig in and see what else we
get so inside design by Apple in
California odds are you can have your
fingertips and I believe the sim removal
tool has sim removed itself from the
packaging so fingertips iPhone 4 and a
few Apple stickers shows you that we're
wondering push that off to the side and
sort of your standard array of
accessories you've got your USB wall
charger USB and sync cord and headphones
look to be the same with the the inline
mic but enough about that let's take a
look at the iPhone 4 itself since that
is the main attraction of the show here
go ahead and pull off the plastic which
is sort of a one-time thing that sort of
satisfying whooshing noise and the thing
is very very thin it feels really nice
in the hand so let's sort of go through
it real quickly and I'll compare to some
other devices so you can gauge sort of
its thickness and thinness you've got
the same size screen sort of in that a
standard iPhone thing for a while now a
home button which feels a bit click here
at your front-facing
VGA camera there is your speaker and the
microphone port one on the bottom one on
top on the left-hand side you've got
those new volume buttons sort of our a
little bit larger a bit of a difference
and you've got your new profile switcher
right at the top there is one of the
antenna bands on the left-hand side and
we've got the other intended band on the
right of those you guys that might not
know Apple actually integrated the
antenna into the stainless steel of the
phone which should help with reception
and speaking of the side of the phone
you've got your Micro SIM card right
there at the little hole for a paperclip
to pop out the Micro SIM card top there
is the hold and power button 3.5
millimeter headset jack and that other
little hole is that microphone we talked
about and there is one of the seams for
those antennas on the back we've got a
new five megapixel camera and VGA I'll
give you a five megapixel camera with
LED flash a little bit about the iPhone
4 and then your 30 pin connector and
speaker on the bottom speaker and
another microphone on the bottom so that
is the iPhone 4 it's your quick size
comparison so you can see how thin or
how thick this is or some other devices
you might be interested in first and
foremost let's compare it to its
outgoing cousin here is the iPhone 3GS
which now looks downright phat by
comparison let's put these two on top of
each other you can see the thickness or
thinness the definitely is noticeable
difference there this is supposedly the
iPhone for almost a quarter thinner than
the outgoing 3GS you can definitely see
it and feel it right off the bat it
makes sort of the 3GS feel a bit
plasticky and chubby in the hand let's
go ahead and continue sort of the size
towards other devices you might be
interested in here is the much much
larger Evo 4G it looks like the
grandfather or the father here to the
children because it's so big but it is a
very thin device let me go ahead and
show you the thinness of it you can go
ahead and compare and see also kinda fit
in your pocket so there is the Evo next
up we'll compare it in size to the Droid
Incredible for Verizon end up pretty
similar in size actually there's that
let's go to stack them you can see the
thickness the Droid Incredible is
difficulty thicker and finally the last
foam you guys need to considering is the
Nexus One
all sir Android devices here is the
Nexus One and a bit thicker so I'm going
to go ahead and dig into the iPhone 4
certainly there'll be a ton of coverage
coming up today tomorrow the next days
we'll be walking through all the
features doing full reviews and
demonstrations anything in particular
