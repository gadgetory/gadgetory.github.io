to you by full sail university what's
going on everyone welcome back to other
episode of renter's rant at the show
where all right didn't brave on anything
from the world of technology and
sometimes a little bit outside of it up
this week we're gonna go away from
phones and tablets and talk about cars
and why I can't do in my car what my
couple hundred dollar phone and tablet
can do this Rangers rants let's go and
get started alright so want you guys to
do something for me think about your car
or your parents car or a friend's car
and what is in the center console of
that car what the car can do and what
the car can't do and pick out your phone
think about what your phone can do well
your phone can and can't do and think
about the price discrepancy between the
two now granted your phone can drive it
at the mall can't drive you on a date
and can't really impress all your lady
friends but your phone can do a lot of
things your phone can check email your
phone's got a modern browser on it your
phone can do I am your phone can yell at
you to remind you you got to do stuff
your car can't do any of that now before
everybody starts saying a John
distracted drivers you shouldn't be
doing that when you're driving anyway
totally understand that certainly you
shouldn't be doing that while you're
driving but there are a lot of ways you
get the same technology or phone can do
to the driver so it's not distracting
you can do audio so when someone sends
you a message you can hear it through
your phone so they're not to start
fiddle in your pocket to see you texted
you what you shouldn't be doing anyway I
your passenger can't enjoy your browser
your passenger can watch move your
passenger kind of full access center
console can do some cars lock it down
some cars don't some cars now consents
who's sitting where who's activating
what give you access the center console
but your car should be able to do
everything your phone can and we have
not seen that at all we're seeing baby
baby baby steps onto that a few weeks
ago at CES we saw a GM and Ford step up
a little bit we saw my for touch get api
so final it'll be app integration in
there we saw Chevy's MyLink finally get
app integration so we're going to see
these apps slowly start to develop your
phone can of course download
applications you listen to pandora die
hard
radiating listen to Spotify but you
can't do that in your car and
fortunately you can plug it in and you
can fiddle with your phone and sort of
have it work that way you can do some
a2dp stuff we don't get sort of the same
experience you get in dash or via your
steering wheel controls that you can do
with your phone but we're finally
starting to see these baby steps take
out actually Tesla's founder Elon Musk
was one that really started pioneering
this when he famously said why can't my
car do what my phone can do Tesla's one
of those companies that's really pushing
the industry forward they've got that
giant 17 inch touchscreen in their Model
S and their upcoming model x very soon
what they did was they essentially
tacked into apples supply chain to get
the panels they were using in their
MacBook Pros have bigger panels made
stuck them in there and give you a
high-definition display and you get Bo
ability to access your car from your
mobile phone and do all kinds of
controls from there and other car
companies are doing the same we're
certainly seeing something similar with
Cadillacs cue system it's a modern touch
screen interface works well it's
intuitive but it's slow and you're
waiting for pages to load never use
Jaguars interface it is abysmal and
riddled with all kinds of slow-moving
things that take forever just to get to
your freaking navigation we saw
something like Q and X 2 point 0 which
is pretty baller demonstrated in a
Bentley Continental so there's a lot of
cool technology a lot of cool merging of
stuff now certainly they must walk a
very fine line at make it not
distracting to the driver making sure
that it adds the driving experience but
it's not just entertainment things that
the cars could be doing it also be
giving you directions BMW is doing an
awesome job of integrating heads-up
displays and some sort of infrared
technology to see what's in front of you
when there's a lot of fog and get it on
a cool screen but it's a hugely
expensive and something that not
everyone can afford unexpected
transition over the next 5 10 ish years
to really see a full merging of all that
stuff and I'm excited to see what card
you're going to do over the next decade
what features do you guys want your car
to have that maybe your phone can have
or feature you could dream up that might
be in there we saw at CES Audi have cars
that can park themselves it's not the
parallel parking stuff we say in the
past I mean you literally pull up to a
parking structure hop out of your car
and your car goes and find the spot in
parked itself when you're done is some
in your car it comes back and picks you
up car too
knowledge like mobile technology geeks

be a part of the whole industry that's
gonna see this evolution over the next
few years so thank you guys for watching
