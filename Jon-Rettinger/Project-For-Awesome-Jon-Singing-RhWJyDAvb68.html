this is going to be a very different
kind of video I promise you are not
going to see any technology here no
iPhone comparisons no and roy brought in
I want to talk to you about project for
awesome you may have heard me tweet
about it it was started by the great
vlog brothers Hank and John Green as a
way to galvanize YouTube community for a
cause we all have a tremendous voice and
there are youtubers out there with
hundreds of thousands and millions of
people that watch them we can use that
voice for good so they put together this
project called will conveniently project
for awesome when essentially the
youtuber community once a year tries to
raise money for a charity of their
choice this year I've been working with
the green sort of helped put this
together in just a very little bit I've
been trying to help if you look at the
link below go to project for awesome
calm and you can actually did on some of
the products that I've donated including
my very first video camera and a ton of
other awesome prizes you can buy raffle
tickets to win you can win a kinect for
you know ten dollars per ticket or
something very cheap you can win shake
Carl's beard you can all kinds of
awesome stuff and you're supporting
really fantastic charities so hit the
link down below to get to that but be
linked down below for project for
awesome as well but this video is my own
personal project for awesome video and
it is a peel to you guys something
that's very very close to my heart when
I first started thinking about what
charity I want some support it became
very very obvious to me this isn't
anything that I talked about on camera
it's a very different type of video my
father about two years ago I was
diagnosed with prostate cancer prostate
is the specific to two men if you don't
know and it's one of the most common
cause of cancer in American men
diagnosed with it about two years ago
has always been extremely healthy an
athlete when he was younger and the
twins it's been very tough he's been
undergoing treatment is making a full
recovery and as of now has no sign of
the cancer left in his body which is
obviously fantastic but I want to try
and raise money today for prostate
cancer research it is a scourge for
or most American men and scourge for men
all across the world so I am reaching
out to you guys to help support a cure
for prostate cancer and to do so I'm
gonna do something a little different
and something that I have never done in
the past I haven't really asked you guys
to donate or do money in the past so I
figure I'm get something that I've never
done in the past boys talking about
technology geek senal that business but
you've never heard me sing and the
reason for that is I can't sing I was
not blessed with any sort of musical
ability but to help raise money for this
cause which I really believe in I have
written a song right here with actual
lyrics that i am going to sing i'll put
a little bit of a beat behind me and
i'll try and sing the best I can but let
me preface is one more time with saying
I do not sing but I will embarrass
myself for a cause and I hope you guys
will enjoy my awful I think I'm
tone-deaf type saying so it's very short
and I'm gonna go and pop my beat right
now and let me get singing boenish all
right prostate cancer can be a scourge
for some men it can hit you when you're
50 years or ten blame genetics radiation
maybe the cell phone in your pocket with
your help I though that we can kick it
and stop it if you are a man
to make you frown once they removed it
you'll have trouble sitting down if only
for a while it's most common cause of
cancer in most men I can't think of
anything else if I'm men other than 10
so I'm gonna end this song help me
donate to prostate cancer research
jetsons know hey guys i just wanted to
do something that was sort of off the
beaten path and just helped galvanize
and bring together my audience for a
community of technology enthusiasts some
people call us geeks some people call us
nerds i call us passionate and
knowledgeable and I'm hoping that we can
use this passion for a really good cause
so there's going to be a link down below
to project for awesome if you want to
buy tickets for some of the great
products that people are raffling off or
if you want to donate directly to the
prostate cancer foundation they'll be
linked that to that down below I
personally donated I'm kind of help out
with project for awesome but I think
it's really important to give back even
just a little bit whatever you guys can
can afford to give whether it's one
dollar two dollars ten dollars 100 or
whatever it might be every little bit
might be just that amount that pushes it
over the edge for it here hey guys thank
you for listening to my story and for
all of your support over the years
project for awesome one win</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
