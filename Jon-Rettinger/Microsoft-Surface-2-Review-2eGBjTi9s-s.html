techno before you for you of the surface
to the sequel to the original surface RT
everything has changed here about the
tablet a lot of improvements but is it
worth your tablet buying buck especially
in a very crowded atmosphere let's go
ahead and see if it's the right tablet
for you so as I do with all my reviews I
want to give a disclaimer I use this not
as my only tablet but in conjunction
with the new surface pro 2 and an iPad
Mini for the better part of four days
previously I had used a surface pro for
about four months as almost my only
tablet so I was very familiar with the
user interface and have a tablet perform
so before we get into Windows 8.1 and
the OS I want to talk a little bit about
the hardware the hardware is so
drastically improved over the original
surface RT I can't overstate that enough
it is as different as the original iPad
versus the iPad 3 it feels lighter the
screen is higher resolution the material
somehow feel better I like the gray
color the kickstand which is a little
bit awkward to have on your lap and I
has a second angle which makes it so
much easier to view on your lap or on a
desk everything about this tablet feels
nice it feels especially light and if
you compare it to the surface pro 2 it
almost feels like half of a tablet when
the issues I had with your original
surface RT was that a felt really laggy
as powered by a pretty well SPECT egg
row 3 but a hard time managing HD video
and another app running side by side not
so here with the surface pro 2 which is
updates game 2 quad-core Tegra 4
everything on this tablet feels iffy in
fact if you never went into the desktop
you would have no way of seeing powered
by a Tegra 4 you might think a core i5 4
is under the hood HD video plays
awesomely and works great when you want
a multitask with HD video and something
else no issue with that at all there is
no app slowdown and I noticed no lag
this is a very very very quick tablet
talking about the operating system I'm
not going to sort of harp on that too
much as we've covered Windows 8.1 quite
a bit but there are a few really nice
things here the Microsoft has done the
first is in the camera app you would
expect that to really be that much the
camera has been improved the pictures
don't look overly awesome but it's still
a tablet I could you know take this to
your kids soccer game take pictures
because I hope you're not going to do
not take this out in public and take
pictures but if you do find yourself
taking pictures Mike Copps done a really
nice job the photo editing suite it's a
pretty in-depth photo editing takes you
beyond just regular red eye and crop you
can actually do some real tweaks images
that are pretty powerful and things you
wouldn't expect on you know lower end
tablet speaking of lower and tablet the
starting price and this is a bit hard to
swallow a 449 bucks for a 32 gig model
if you want to up that it's been axed
100 bucks and get the 64 gig but the one
saving grace for the price per storage
that it does have a pretty conveniently
now located micro SD card slot they made
it much easier to get to and the
location behind the kickstand so I
mentioned things seemed really quick
things seem really zippy the tablet
itself feels absolutely incredible to
hold but when you do hold it so holding
a tablet with a very odd aspect ratio
when you're using it on a desk with the
type cover or anything it's a really
nice tablet to work with you've got a
nice big screen but you're holding on
your lap or holding in bed it's not very
comfortable
and especially awkward way to try and
hold it in portrait just feels very
weird and very tall that's a personal
preference thing I never got used to it
I always refer to work on this either on
a desk or on my lap but I never got used
to actually holding the tablet and
browsing around so something gonna have
to try and store free decided whether or
not this is the right tablet for you so
as I mentioned HD video everything works
great one thing that you're not going to
get with the windows 8.1 RT operating
system if you're a can get a full
desktop applications and I figure to use
your legacy windows app so if you want
to use Photoshop or you know play
Starcraft or steam whatever it might be
this is definitely not a tablet for you
you're going to want to look at the
surface pro 2 or the original surface
pro which gives you a full desktop and
the ability to run all those legacy apps
but you can still access a desktop only
thing you can do with it is run a full
Microsoft Office suite which now
includes outlook so you can have free
access and give it to you right out of
the box for Word PowerPoint Excel
out looking the rest of the office we
which is kind of nice the opportunity if
you do a lot of typing or spreadsheets
or if your student you want something to
watch videos on or do some heavy editing
this actually works pretty well and
there was no slowdown at all using the
office suite on the type of Ford process
of reusing it on the i-5 I'm also
reviewing a surface pro to sort of in
conjunction with this I really notice is
zero difference with those two at all
one of the big issues I have with the
Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 platform isn't
with the hardware it's not what the
software it's what the applications and
that's really where I ran into trouble
with the surface 2 and the surface pro 2
the day isn't that app support date
expect now if you put this side-by-side
and you base it just on the built in
applications with an iPad air even iPad
4 and iPad Mini the Nexus 7 or any of
the variety of Android tablets the
stacks of really well it performs great
video looks awesome it's quick there's
plenty of video stores you can watch TV
shows music and move either at the Xbox
music and all kinds of other ways to
access your things here but where it
starts to really fall behind from the
competitions in the apps the apps just
are not here yet now maybe it's good
it's a relatively new operating system
but maybe it's because developers aren't
seeing it worthwhile to code for the
Windows 8 and modern UI and that was
really a problem Facebook for example
just to launch their Facebook app now
certainly you can view a lot of these
applications in their web varieties and
I did I use Facebook on the website I
use Instagram on the website but I would
like native applications that work with
this pretty large and beautiful screen
and that's just not here that's holding
it back on the surface Pro surface pro 2
you can access the legacy app so their
applications are pretty much everything
has ever been built for Windows you can
pretty much use on that but not so with
the surface to so I was really
disappointed with that but if you're
looking for a tablet that's really high
for productivity it's probably the most
productive tablet you know in that range
of the iPads and Nexus 7 you can get a
lot of work done with it I still have a
hard time with media creation you know
aside from words
sweet but if you want to do sort of
passive media consumption or you want to
create some documents it's a really
really good tablet comfortable it's
light its well-designed it's got a USB
port a full USB 3.0 port which a lot of
other tablets don't offer
it's got expandable memory it's got the
pretty cool way of charging using a
magnetized connector it's got incredible
battery life I was able to go almost
nine and a half hours of using this
tablet and between charge now turn the
screen brightness down very much I had
it about 80% obviously connected to
Wi-Fi and it worked really really well
so it's gonna come down to what you want
if you want a tablet that can run
Microsoft Office the no-brainer this is
a great choice but I'm something that
can do everything that's going to have
all the apps and all the games and being
able to check your email and watch
YouTube videos you might want to check
your app compatibility to make sure that
there is an app available for the
windows modern UI or Windows RT to make
sure that's going to work for you if you
might find yourself a little bit
disappointed overall though the tablet
just out of the box incredible
experience but the app selection really
hindered it back and that's maybe no
fault of Microsoft but perhaps they
could do more to try and lure developers
the tablet gets a pretty solid 7.5 it
had better app support it would have
been up to the 8.5 perhaps even nine
range I love the way it feels another
way it works I'll probably use this as a
tablet in my home for a while but you're
the kind of person relies a lot of apps
you know we're gonna have one tablet in
your house or your office you really
want to make sure that the apps you want
are going to be here or at least going
to be coming in the very near future so
what'd you guys think do you agree or
disagree through review of the surface -
am i way off do you see a huge benefit I
didn't mention that I leave something
out do you disagree with what I'm saying
