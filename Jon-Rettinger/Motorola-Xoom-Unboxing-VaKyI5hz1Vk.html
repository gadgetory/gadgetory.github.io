TechnoBuffalo here at the done boxes I'm
really looking forward to this is the
first Android 3.0 honeycomb tablet of
course it is the Motorola Xoom spelled
with an X don't confuse that with a Z
the way you'd expect to spell it let's
go ahead and get started alright so
here's a picture of the zoom on the box
interestingly enough the Box doesn't
come sealed so maybe that meant there
was a last minute firmware update or
whatever the Box doesn't come sealed so
when you buy it don't pick it up like
this or you're gonna drop your $800
tablet and yes that was not an error
this thing is going to cost you $800
which is a lot of money for a tablet so
here's a picture of the device on the
front some specs on the back nothing
really on the side nothing on the side
package contents we'll see what that is
in a minute I'm talking a bit about
Android 3.0 honeycomb
marilla zoom with Google powered by
Android 3.0 on the verizon network this
is a CDMA device at launch and will
support Verizon EVDO Rev a but it will
be upgradable and the rumor and what it
looks like it's going to be it's
actually going to be a hardware upgrade
to Verizon's 4G LTE so stay tuned
TechnoBuffalo for details on that
there's a lot of optimization to your
meant for the tablet and for those that
have been following that Android 3.0
news you'll know that 3.0 it's the first
Android operating system that's
optimized for the tablet so you get a
new YouTube interface new Google Maps
and a tablet version of Angry Birds
which we've seen but enough of me
talking about the tablet let's go ahead
and dig in and I will run through all
the specs and I have actually not held
one of these yet person so I'm actually
really looking forward to it
so here is the Motorola Xoom it feels
pretty nice in the hand we'll take just
a minute let's see what else you're
going to get in the box one point of
note if you do buy this from Best Buy in
at launch it's available from Best Buy
retailers or your Verizon Wireless store
if you buy it from Best Buy you are
going to
to activate one month of data you can go
down to their lowest plan which is $20
per month and then you can choose to
sort of cancel it after that but in
order to get it out of the store you are
going to have to activate it the Wi-Fi
is not locked on it but in order to take
it out of Best Buy you are going to have
to pay for that if you buy it from
Verizon store you will not have to so
you may be better off heading to your
local big red retailer so we've got some
paperwork
nothing anybody's ever gonna read we've
got a micro USB cord seen that under a
lot of times and we've got a charging
cable and it doesn't charge via micro
USB looks like it needs a little bit
more power than micro USB can provide so
you've got a proprietary charging jack
you can see right there interestingly
enough there are a lot of dock
accessories and the dock accessories
charged via the micro USB with the main
charging for this guy does not so here
is the tablet and it looks very tablet
II let me run through the specs very
quickly and then we'll do a walk-through
of the device it is a 10.1 inch and
that's always diagonal when you hear the
screen size a 10.1 inch capacitive
touchscreen oh it's a pretty nice
resolution of 1280 by 800 and from the
specs standpoint this guy really does
bring the heat so to speak within videos
dual core Tegra 2 so that is 2 cores
with 1 gigahertz of power each of each
core you're gonna have a gig of ram of
course Android 3.0 honeycomb on the back
hopefully we've got a 5 megapixel camera
right there with dual LED flash on that
can take video at 1280 by 720 which is
720p for all your video folks out there
and that can shoot at 30 frames per
second it also has a front-facing camera
which is not VGA resolution as we see on
most front-facing cameras this one's
actually 2 megapixels which is quite
nice it's got support for a DLNA which
is a way to send content wirelessly to a
television or a DLNA and able to buy so
video and music you know whatever it is
you're looking at 802 11 + BG + 32 gigs
of internal storage there is somewhere
on here we'll take a look when we get
there a micro SD expansion card slot
bref is right there however that is not
activated at launch bryson and motorola
have said that'll come at a later
software firmware not firmware update so
now let's go ahead and peel off the
plastics I can already see the comments
people saying peel off that plastic so
let's go ahead and do that and take a
look at the tablet and I will enjoy the
probably three minutes that I have a
tablet without fingerprints on it let's
go ahead and pull this thing off and a
screen should be pretty durable it is
Gorilla Glass on top of it so let's go
ahead and pull off all the plastic and
let's do a tour of this guy so more
plastic on it yet even more plastic okay
I kind of want to keep it on that's it
it's already got fingerprints on it I
may perhaps just have especially greasy
hands I didn't just see french fries but
maybe I'm just a greasy dude in general
alright so we've got that whooshing
noise I'm not gonna throw this across
the room pulling off everything and
let's take a look at what we've got on
here from a port standpoint because
there is a lot this is definitely an
expensive tablet but you do get a lot in
the spec department alright so there is
the screen obviously I have to point out
the screen you probably don't belong
watching any sort of videos so there is
the micro USB charging port right there
you mentioned the proprietary charging
dock on the top you're gonna have a 3.5
millimeter headset jack I'm not sure if
that's a SIM card or if that's where
looks like that is where throw it on the
floor but it appears that that was
actually a dummy SIM card in there so
that's where your LTE SIM card is going
to go I'm go ahead and push the back so
I don't bust open this tablet they'll
slide back in place on the left hand
side you've got a volume rocker up and
down bottom stuff we already showed
there's some dock connectors down there
as well on the left hand side nothing on
the back Motorola logo you've got
speaker dual speakers there's your dual
LED flash I'm actually just flicking off
the camera by accident there's your five
megapixel camera and on top was all that
stuff we just showed so let me go ahead
and
bring in probably what a lot of you are
going to a cross shop the zoom with and
again zoom with an X I here is a quick
size comparison with the iPad and you
can see how greasing my fingers actually
are I get that right angle there and of
course we'll do a full iPad versus zoom
comparisons but in case you guys are
sort of wondering what this is gonna
look like from a thickness standpoint
there you go on first blush and
certainly haven't turned this on yet the
zoom does have a nice build quality to
it it feels in a really good and solid
I'm speaking of turning it on you're
probably noticing there isn't a any
physical capacitive buttons down here as
we've seen with normal Android devices
the home and you search and the rest of
them they're all soft buttons here on
the OS so if I can figure out how to
turn this sucker on which is always a a
treat I will do a first boot up for you
alright so the power button actually
does rest on the back right there
so when you're holding it your finger is
not going to touch it but you can just
access the power button alright there
and I also want to mention that there is
a microphone on the bottom there as well
so for video chat or Skype whatever you
want this is going to work for you so I
will power this thing on and see what
the first Android Honeycomb boot up
looks like so I get to an Android or
sorry Motorola dual-core that we saw on
the Atrix or their new splash screen
which is still kinda cool to see
dual-core allegedly honeycomb takes
advantage of the dual core processor
much more than we've seen with previous
versions of Android in particular
Android 2.2 Froyo so hopefully we will
have blistering fast video performance
and overall multitasking so with that
looks like a honeycomb there's all kinds
of honeycomb animations going on welcome
and there's a little Android guy waving
he's saying hello to you personally
let's go ahead and hit start touch
screen works that's nice touch skip to
complete setup and continue using Wi-Fi
instead activating on Verizon Wireless I
find that incredibly annoying that I had
to sign up for a data could get this
from Best Buy let's go ahead and well
we'll go ahead and let it activate
Rison wireless so stay tuned for a full
tour of Android 3.0 honeycomb camera
test ipad comparisons all the stuff that
you expect from TechnoBuffalo for a new
hot device like this anything in
particular that you guys would want to
see that you might think we might not
cover be sure to leave your comments
down below and we will check it out for
you and sort of while this is activating
i've got a bonus for those you that
stuck around the 7-8 odd minutes we've
got the motorola protective portfolio
case keeping in vein would be pretty
high pricing this thing's gonna be $40
if you want to pick it up from Best Buy
or your Verizon store however if you buy
a case you do not have to activate a
data plan though which is nice of them
let's go ahead and pull this out and see
what it looks like if I can do that
and it is just about what you'd expect
it is a case that lets you sort of prop
it up at different angles
it's got throw that rubbery feel to it
it's got some hard plastic on the side
to hold your zoom with an X in place and
you can sort of prop it up and do what
you want with it so that's the case I'll
show you in a future video what it looks
like on the case in the meantime
activation is complete so touch next to
continue was set up maybe a little bit
on the slow side this is EVDO Rev a
certainly Verizon's LTE as I've said on
many many and many times is blistering
fast and really kind of nice to use so
I'm not going to bore you with the setup
process estate student TechnoBuffalo for
the rest of the coverage I'm John rent
injure from the aforementioned
TechnoBuffalo sure to check out the
website for all your tech news and I
will see you in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
