to you by harry's what's up everyone
welcome back the episode of rumor around
up I'm realest jawed renters to show
where we take all the tech rivers from
the week and I just smash them like this
and give you the four or five most
pertinent big giant rumors what could be
coming with Mike becoming the potential
to possibly definitely some day might
come and what for sure is definitely
might happening a busy week we'll talk
about the galaxy s5 google play edition
where is it the Galaxy Note 4 and
upcoming gears 3 might be best buds for
life 5.5 inch iphone might not be
delayed and new ear pods are coming but
they're gonna plug into someplace weird
don't be a pervert those are my roundup
let's start rounding them up the Samsung
introduced at Google Play dish to the
galaxy s4 which I love checked it out it
makes sense so they're gonna follow that
sucker up with a google play edition of
the galaxy s5 or in the week we're
treated to a leaked photo the alleged
device in the wild though you don't know
much other than it's got a google boot
logo which could very easily be loaded
onto any Haluk cs5 devices actually a
picture of a boot logo put up there and
be like hey this is your phone fun fact
I used to do this to friends as a joke I
take a screenshot of their phone's home
screen and open up their putting the
pictures I'd open up that picture and
they think their phone is broken and try
and like do stuff you should do with
your friends too it's a fun April Fools
may get a June fools so back to the main
point in hand there's no reason to
believe the phone isn't teen on its way
unfortunately though surely after the
galaxy s5 launched a full res image
showed up on the google play store
showing and galaxy s5 and then it went
away and replaced the galaxy s4 so HTC
recently released a google play edition
of its brand new HTC One m8 flagship
farts smartphone so we'd probably
imagine Samsung months to get in on that
action 02 got in the last generation but
what's holding them up here something
i'ma talk about quite a bit google i/o
kicks off later this month and that's
where i think they're going to discuss
the events that android and other
platforms it's totally possible if
they're going to use that's time on the
stage to announce the pledge to the
galaxy
five when surprisingly they gave one out
to everybody and so usually do this
every year to give out something giant
last year they announced at galaxy s4
Google Play edition so you're later
makes sense if we don't see it that way
to this month and we'll start to wonder
if Sam so I'm just pulled the plug on
the device for some other reasons but I
would probably stay optimistic that IO
is a time some google play action while
we're here with Samsung it feels
comfortable let's stick with it I've
Samsung 62 its recent product release
cycle then I think we're going to see
the galaxy note 4 announced later this
year in September but that's something
surprising a new report suggests the
company could also unveil the gear 3
SmartWatch at the same time according to
the korea herald the company's preparing
to launch a follow-up to the SmartWatch
at IFA 2014 alongside the next gen
phablet I have phase where the original
original Galaxy Note was launched to in
the fridge kind of always happened there
we will be there at the event covering
it so you'll know the minute that it
happens the upcoming SmartWatch will
apparently be bundled with the Galaxy
Note 4 1 anonymous insider says so the
hell knows suggesting this won't be the
rumored gear solo it's supposed to be a
standalone watch phone instead it's like
it could be an iterative update of the
gear too meanwhile the sim enabled
SmartWatch will apparently fill the void
between the two devices that many people
never knew they wanted or needed that
point that will potentially launch us
some around the same time when the first
android wear products are to hit the
market as for the gigantic probably 19
inch Galaxy Note 4 we're still not sure
what to expect from the upcoming phablet
rumor has its and shows olive l2 rumors
and in my head I'm sing for you I
promise that Samsung's going to shake
things up with a new floor vector for
the device brand new shade of color to
go through plastic back which could be
anything from a curved screen to a
three-sided display probably won't get a
fish a look at the note 4 released a few
more months so it's possible Samsung's
still working out the final details I
love the Galaxy Note land devices all
jokes aside I think they've launched a
lot of flagship features at filter down
to other devices with the notes but
would be surprised to see a new design
that's going to sort of filter down to
the next generation galaxy s6 I wouldn't
be surprised them to go metal a little
bit of curve and some crazy battery
technology also it would expect 2k
screen which is going to become more and
more standard what you guys think what
do you want to see on your Galaxy Note 4
and you care
about the gear or this dedicated bone
watch I couldn't measure only having
this dealer hello oh like Dick Tracy you
guys finally Dick Tracy is I feel old
all right so we covered samsung let's
talk a little bit about the 5.5 inch
iphone we've been talking about for
quite a bit so it's kind of well
expected now Apple is going to launch a
4.7 inch iphone sick in September and
then later in the year when we say
larger 5.5 inch version talked about
this almost every week so the reports
originally suggested the larger I
thought was going to be delayed issues
with the battery although I've got good
news for you fab 11 folks up may have
been struggling I'm milking enough life
out of product such a large screen but
now I port out trying to suggest Apple
has overcome these issues and that
partners will start building the device
soon I've said it the previous question
I love giant screens I love a giant
screen to iPhone so according to I'm a
totally Massacre this leo Baba apples
partner started providing volume
shipments of the 5.5 inch iphone 6
batteries last month those are expected
to continue through June they also
suggest Apple's working to build 20
million larger iphone 6 units this year
about half the iphone 6 units at helps
manufacturers so that they can pretty
even division here the report out of
china is a super rough translation but
if legitimate any reference to a battery
for larger iPhone 6 models suggest that
there is progress being made which is
good news Julie the phone wasn't
affected to launch until the fourth
quarter of this year and then hopefully
this means we will see it much much
sooner of course start to have a delay
and the device has even been announced I
get that but if you follow the rumors
this is just a rumor show we might get
that 5.5 inch phone alongside a 4.7 inch
phone you could pick what size is better
for you for me I want 5.5 inches in my
pants don't just don't go there guys
before I get to the next rumor Lewis you
question look at his face what
adjectives come to mines tired
hail but probably like super furry as my
wife likes to remind me all the time I
really don't like to shave mostly
because it's a giant panda but to do it
so I want to tell you about our friends
at harrahs so they are less than 1 years
old and they are already disrupting the
entire shaving industry and offering
better shaving experience a better value
than they already established razor
Goliath so the company makes these
awesome german-engineered blades and
they care so much about the quality of
their shave and the razor in your smooth
silky skin they wouldn't just bought the
entire freaking factory this thing's 93
years old that makes them they're like
we just want to buy you check out
Harry's com use promo code techno say
five bucks off your first purchase and
stuff comes right to your door it's
really high quality stuff fifteen
dollars you can get you a set that
includes a handle of three blades and
shave cream shipped to your door even
offer a custom engraving option to
engrave your initials on your razor
there are no more excuses bring anybody
else to borrow your razor your new I'm
talking about back to the rumors since
we did two for samsung let's see two for
Apple to keep everything fair like a
political campaign Apple is reportedly
paving the road for new generation of
headphones that are gonna plug into not
fed from port into the Lightning port
instead which is kind of weird the news
comes from our friends at 9to5 mac which
cites apple's new specs for it's made
for iphone ipad ipod it's mfi a program
ahead of a future software update so
there are a number of advantages to
using the Lightning port over the
regular 3.5 millimeter jack so new
headphones they would receive a lossless
stereo digital audio while also sending
woozily improved audio into your device
using a built-in microphone talk on your
phone plug me in certain headphones
could even launch a Pacific app
automatically for example plugging in
your beats lighting headphones might
trigger the beats music apps open up so
you know three billion dollars you go to
something apolis lightning port could
also transfer power in the same way it
does while charging our iphone that
means it could charge more complex at a
future your paws or even draw a reserve
power from your headphones to charge
your smartphone on the go but imagine
how big headphones of that to be there
also some lb disadvantages though
lightning headphones almost certainly
won't work at any other smartphones and
eating gonna have to buy a set prepare
to use with your Android devices or even
older Apple products no no
Apple loves making things different they
probably won't even work with your
macbook that was also planning adding a
lightning port on the 6th generation I
was 10 computers poof it's possible they
could sell a special adapter though but
obviously wouldn't be cheap and just a
giant panda but it's worth noting though
that an alleged leak last month
preempted this week's rumor claiming a
future year pod model would plug right
to lightning port these built-in sensors
to measure your heart rate and blood
pressure the poster later admitted
taking the whole damn thing up looks
like you know fiction imitating truth
might have been that far off we could
see it and veiled later on this year but
who knows I hope the streamers not true
I don't want my headphones to monitor
stuff I don't want headphones to plug
into the charging port plug into 3.5
millimeter headset jack don't be so damn
different apple another that's a private
area three point five millimeters works
fine just plug in and be good to go you
