welcome back for another very very
exciting game review and it's time we
give PC gaming some love because after
all I do most of my gaming with my
trusty old PC I plead the first Mass
Effect on a PC a couple of months back
and truthfully I was a bit bewildered by
the freakishly high review score the
first one received I have to admit while
I like the first game I was slightly
disappointed the story was good but
overly political most of the characters
were a bit boring and technically also
the first game had its issues but the
game did pull me in enough to get me
excited about the sequel the second part
of the trilogy pulls you in from the
very first scene with a Normandy is
destroyed by a surprise attack by the
Reaper recruited collectors
commander shepard goes down with the
ship the game gives you the possibility
of importing your character from the
first game so all the choices you made
in the first Mass Effect good ones and
bad will be transferred into the new
adventure and once again you can choose
to play as the good guy or as the badass
renegade but some I don't know maybe
it's because I'm a bit of a goody
two-shoes but some I always tend to take
the high road
my conscience starts to get the better
of me when I start punching innocent
game characters in the face well at
least most of the time two years have
passed and Shepard is revived and were
built by a pro human organization called
Cerberus led by the elusive man 4.click
by Martin Sheen not unusual for people
who know what you and I know the elusive
man is a character that commands respect
and come on you really can't say no to
Martin Sheen whether the mission is to
save the world or slaughter some babies
that one man one very specific man might
be all that stands between humanity and
the greatest threat of our brief
existence the Reapers good to see your
memories still intact anyways the
illusive man sets you on a mission to
put together a team willing to risk
their lives and capable of taking down
the evil collectors who have been
abducting entire colonies of humans in
the outer rims of the Milky Way
so you set out to the four corners of
the galaxy to recruit a motley crew of
misfits and some old friends as well you
will encounter other members of your old
team in different parts of the galaxy
who have moved on with the careers and
lives after the commander Sheppard's
rumoured demise the story of Mass Effect
2 is very much character driven and the
actual character development and
individual stories of the characters are
what said Mass Effect 2 apart from the
first game a large credit to the
characters is the excellent voice talent
you've spent too much time fighting
thugs who think custom-painted armor
makes the professionals while I still
think the voice actor playing commander
shepard is a bit stiff the game itself
features a star-studded cast the likes
of which has never been seen in a single
video game Seth Green is back as the new
Normandy sarcastic pilot Joker here you
know this is really nice edie took up
the slack in every department I could
get used to this kind of help and Tricia
Helfer from Battlestar Galactica voices
the ship's built in artificial
intelligence eating I have the capacity
to a comment
the slacking of any number of
productively suspect humans Shepard that
was a joke
Yvonne Strahovski from the TV series
Chuck plays the sultry Cerberus agent
Miranda Lawson and I had to see that the
character of Miranda is one of the best
game portrayals of a real person the
likeness is impeccable down to the teeth
earlier discussion I think we're crazy
but I haven't forgotten assuming you're
still interested oh I'm definitely
interested glad to hear it
I'll be by the next time things are
quiet carrie-anne moss plays a mobster
queen and michael hogan from Battlestar
Galactica
plays the chief of seasick police at the
Citadel this isn't the Presidium all
they have to worry about our protesters
outside their free speech zones or
someone's poodle crapping on the grass
we also find the excellent Adam Baldwin
and a great cast of other recognizable
voice talent it's simply the best
ensemble cast that I've seen and heard
in a single video game and it's very
cool to see games finally starting to
attract even the most respected actors
we tried to keep you as intact as
possible we need Shepherd just as you
were when you defeated sovereign the
individual storylines of the team
members this time are genuinely
interesting and you actually end up
caring whether most of them live or die
and in Mass Effect 2 the choices you
make may end up getting your crew
members killed in the end and this time
upgrading your weapons armor and ship
will play a part in this and the game
truly does reward you immensely for
leveling up and exploring the galaxy the
first game did not immerse me enough to
get me exploring random planets but in
Mass Effect 2 side missions are more
interesting and more than just skin deep
and speaking of skin you probably
remember a couple years back
all the talk about the sex in Mass
Effect and yes in Mass Effect 2 you can
develop a romantic relationship that may
or may not lead to you putting on some
Barry White
luckily the scenes are done with very
good taste but still it's not a kids
game so parents take responsibility
the pacing of the game has been
tightened up to great avail the missions
are just the right length to keep you
interested and this time you don't need
to backtrack from where you came after
completing a mission in the first game
developing your characters it was a bit
confusing and mostly unnecessary I
basically finished the first game using
the same squad with very little help
from biotic and tech skills but the
skills play a much larger role in the
second game enemies attack in more
numbers and without biotic and tech
skills who will not survive I played the
game with the new Vanguard class which
truly suits my aggressive style of
playing had not the type to shoot from
afar I like to take my enemies head-on
and the Vanguard class offers some very
cool new skills for this style plane
including the charge but you can
customize your character to suit your
own style playing there are some puzzle
elements of the game in the form of
hacking and opening locked doors and
containers is frequent business in Mass
Effect 2
but luckily hacking feels authentic
enough and the challenges become routine
in no time to upgrade weapons and armor
you need to mine for minerals and Mass
Effect 2 this is done by scanning the
planet in launching a probe the mining
has been getting some criticism from
Xbox gamers but on the PC scanning the
planets with your mouse is pretty
straightforward but Mako land vehicle
from the first game is now gone and I
have to admit while it was fun driving
around with a Mako for about five
minutes in the first game the driving
sequences were overly long too easy and
utterly unnecessary you'll also be glad
to hear that the excruciatingly long
elevator rides are now gone and the
loading times at least on the PC are
reasonable the story of Mass Effect 2
takes you to all four corners of the
galaxy and beyond and the game lasted me
about 23 hours having finished all the
character during side missions as well
without spoiling the ending after the
main story is completed you will have
chance to go back to the Normandy and
explore the galaxy and complete all the
side missions and smaller quests so the
game is good for about 30 hours if you
want to explore every star system
there's also a great deal of replay
value because the game will be a
different experience if you decide not
to take the high road
gameplay why is the first game on PC was
mediocre at best
sometimes even awkward luckily Bioware
has taken the complaint seriously for
Mass Effect 2 as the gameplay mechanics
are refined to the point where every
part of the game is now a pleasure to
play combat mechanics especially are now
spot-on and the characters do what you
want them to do graphics wise Mass
Effect 2 is gorgeous the old Unreal
Engine 3 has been tweaked to the extent
the truly breeze life into the several
year old engine
despite the PC version being held back a
bit by the limitations of the Xbox 360
the graphics on the PC version look
awesome
the possibility of running the game at a
higher resolution on the PC and the 60
multiple of anise tropic filtering makes
the game look even better than its Xbox
360 counterpart there are a few soft
textures here and there but still
everything looks great and more
importantly feels real the game has a
very cinematical style which is nicely
complemented by the depth of feel
effects in different scenes I ran into a
few bugs here and there like nothing
game breaking and in a game of this
scale of magnitude a few bugs are
expected I got it I've been serving here
eight years I've never seen anyone have
this and stay on their feet artistically
the game is also beautiful it's got a
lot of influence of movies like Blade
Runner and any Star Wars the different
worlds in Mass Effect 2 are worth
exploring it's only based on the visual
Splinter
I played Mass Effect 2 on myself build
gaming PC which is kind of ancient in PC
years it's over a year old you can see
the specs on the screen I had all my
settings at max with the resolution of
1680 by 1050 pixels and the game
actually runs smoother than the first
game on the PC which was a nice surprise
I played through massive ik - in Windows
7 without a single crash or issue which
isn't always the case for some games on
the PC overall it's hard not to be
impressed by Mass Effect
I had a lot of complaints about the
first game but Bioware outdid my
expectations in almost every aspect of
Mass Effect 2 the storytelling the
character the gameplay the graphics the
whole experience is vastly improved from
the first game and every self-respecting
gamer who either has the xbox 360 or PC
needs to play Mass Effect 2 so toss your
iphone games in the trash where they
belong and play a game that is worth
every second of your time Mass Effect 2
is an epic and cinematic gameplay
experience that pushes the boundaries of
modern gaming Bioware has raised the bar
very high for single-player role-playing
games which hopefully bodes well for
future alchemy RPGs while I might have
given the first game in 8.5 Mass Effect
2 scores a 9.5 and that's about it for
my review catch you later and follow me
