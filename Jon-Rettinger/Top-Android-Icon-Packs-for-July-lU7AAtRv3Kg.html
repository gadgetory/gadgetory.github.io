it from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
showing you guys three icon packs you
should check out for the month of July
we've done several videos in the past
showcasing other icon packs so if you
guys haven't seen those yet make sure to
check out the links in the description
below so the first one on our list is
the polycon icon pack which is free from
the google play store the polycon icon
pack is beautiful flat and fits well
with Google's material design this is
actually one of the newest icon packs
that I've seen on the Google Play Store
and it's so new that there's actually
only a hundred or so icons included and
I know that may sound very disappointing
but the design and color of each icon
are just top-notch
the attention to detail and the cherry
pick colors in style are beautiful now I
do want to note that the icons are a bit
smaller than normal and I'm not sure if
that's intentional but if you are using
Nova Launcher you have an option to make
the icons bigger now just like any other
icon packs out there if you have a
certain app icon that isn't themed yet
you can make a request inside the app so
the developer could start working on app
icons that aren't themed other than the
request feature it also comes with a
couple of cool wallpapers that play
nicely with polycon for an icon pack
that looks this beautiful and offers
high quality icons you'd expect a
developer to charge a dollar or two for
its app fortunately the polycon icon
pack is free and I suggest you guys
check it out for yourselves so the
second one on our list is the reven icon
pack which is going for $0.99 in the
Google Play Store the review icon pack
has a very distinct look it offers
shapeless icons while the colors are on
the darker shade which is a nice change
from the bright material design palette
most developers use there are over 3000
icons that are supported and there are
hundreds of alternatives to choose from
to make your setup unique there are also
50 qHD wallpapers included which fit
with icon pack perfectly in addition
reven also comes with an analogue clock
widget included which looks a lot like
Google's stock clock app just in case
some of the apps you're using are in
theme yet icon masking is supported so
any uh theme apps will be masked to
mimic the look of revange design
according to the developer review
receives regular weekly updates so
expect to see more icons in the coming
weeks and months so the last one in our
list is the silhouette icon pack which
is free from the Google Play Store the
silhouette icon pack is probably the
most unique icon pack that we've shown
you today it works very well with dark
themes in fact it's probably one of the
best dark theme icon packs that I've
seen
there really isn't a lot of flat dark
themes available in the Google Play
Store but silhouette is probably at the
top of the list when it comes to that
category icons are flat and dark with a
splash of color behind each icon giving
them a unique look there are over 700
icons supported and optimized for qHD
displays and I know it isn't much
compared to the review and I compact but
silhouette also supports icon masking so
you'll be able to keep a uniform look in
addition to the awesome icons are also a
bunch of cloud-based wallpapers
available for download inside the app
anyways that's about it for this video
and if you guys want to check out some
of the other icon packs we've covered
