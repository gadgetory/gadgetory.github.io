getting ready for for New Year
celebrations and making plans at the end
of the year for me is one of my favorite
time just when I get a look forward to
what's coming next
and what's coming next is the galaxy s 9
which is crazy that the essays been out
for almost a year we should see the s 9
debut and like the February March ish
timeframe don't believe the rumors that
you'll see it at CES in January we're
starting to get a good sense of what the
S 9 is going to be what its gonna look
like and what it's going to have inside
of it so let me run it down for you so
first it's gonna be more of an iterative
upgrade it's gonna be like an S version
of the S 8 and the s 8 plus we saw some
screen protectors leaked actually from
slash leaks we saw a few things got
revealed here first looks looks pretty
similar infinii display is going to
remain almost no bezels on the sides and
blend down bezels on the top and bottom
so that's nice I also expect the screen
size to say the same at five point eight
and six point Q for the s 9 + s 9 plus
respectively and this by having thinner
bezels on top we will see improved iris
scanners for yes making it a bit more
accurate we're asking to see sort of a
face unlock type feature we have a face
ID on the iPhone the iris Tanner worked
pretty well worked with a lot of
conditions and through sunglasses so it
should just work better here on the s9
and I would not expect the in screen
fingerprint reader to be on the s9
despite a lot of rumors I'd expect that
a few months later when your brand new
OS 9 becomes obsolete when the note 9
hits
so reading out the specs should see a
lot of new things inside of the s 9
despite the phone not looking that
different powering this guy is a beast
the snapdragon 845 got announced a few
weeks ago obviously it's more powerful
but what's going to matter I think for
the end user better battery life and
improve your key abilities and improved
AR key abilities so everybody wins when
a new processor comes onboard we should
also see six gigs of ram standard here
up from the four on the s8 and the SI
plus as well as fingers fingers cross
for just a bigger battery overall nope
Samsung has put a couple generations
behind them now from from the note 7
debacle so it's a bigger battery to make
everybody happy
if you could take one knock on lash Jen
Samsung phones there were awesome
devices but the stupid thing upper
reader located next to the camera sensor
was a bad design I'm just gonna say it
I've said it before and if somebody guys
disagreed put a case on it doesn't
bother you your left hand it doesn't
bother you but for me it bothered me it
looks like the S sign is going to fix
that the fingerprint reader is going to
move where it should be and that's below
the camera sensor so sorry your old
cases won't work this time around but
the camera sensor at the fingerprint
reader is going to be below should be a
bit improved on the s9 we don't know the
megapixel edge or angstrom aperture
information should be a little bit
better it was almost the same from the
s7 to the SI it's expect to jump here
from the s8 to the s9 we're hearing
though that the s9 + may adopt the dual
sensors that we see in the note line of
phones while the s9 should retain the
single sensor so that one a grain of
salt obviously all this is unconfirmed
subject to change but I expected that to
be the way the same thing goes with the
next-gen phones on the software front I
have good news and bad news for you I'll
start with the good Andrew Oreo out of
the box so that's that's awesome on the
bad news front it's gonna be like Bixby
central with a galaxy s 9 Samsung's put
a lot of money resources they're not
going to band and ship on that so
they're hoping that they let you remap
that button to something else you're
gonna be disappointed you're gonna get
Bixby in your life whether whether you
want the speeder to be in your life or
not she's gonna be in sconce net phone
so that about sums up the Galaxy S nine
I'm hoping the rumors are wrong about
different cameras on the smbs Titan plus
I've liked it done in the past
essentially it's the same phone just
different sizes so perhaps they get dual
sensors on both but again who knows
we'll see in a few short months we don't
know colors they don't know price or
release date but I mean I probably
expect at this point around 900 bucks
and like March ish and hopefully they
print the blue color to the US don't
just release it abroad I really want
really want that blue and when you buy
your brand-new shiny gouts the s9 just
remember about six months later it's
gonna be obsolete when the Galaxy Note 9
hits as such as the case with
smartphones now your films very rarely
the newest hottest kid on the block for
long
sake you excited about the s9 I can't
wait it's gonna be probably the next
phone that I pick up and purchase
I like the plus versions maybe you guys
like a smaller even the comments down
below and let me know sure subscribe hit
the big bell to get notified new videos
pop up until next time I am drying
render from TechnoBuffalo hoping I get
my hands on s9 sooner rather than later
these games
