Hazleton with technobuffalo today we're
checking out the LG Nexus 4 also known
as the google nexus 4 we have the 16
gigabyte version here but there's also
some a gigabyte model this one will set
you back 349 that's without a contract
the ante a good bite model will set you
back 299 here's the phone itself still
got the stickers on them he let off and
see it's got that really cool kind of
gradient sparkly finish to it that's an
8 megapixel camera on the back with a
single LED flash I'm up front here you
have another sticker to remove this is a
4.7 inch display with a 1280 by 768
resolution it's running a quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro processor
it's got two gigs of RAM 2100 milliamp
hour battery which is not removable you
can see I'm already getting fingerprints
on this of course runs Android jellybean
4.2 at NFC and then a 1.3 megapixel
camera up top there moving around the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack is up top
but the silver looking volume buttons
here on the Left microUSB charging on
the bottom next is some screws kind of
makes it look sturdy and it feels very
nice in the hand here and then the power
button of course so we'll hit the power
button and while it's booting up let's
go through the box so inside you've got
the charging dock cable the actual cable
the warranty and guide information and
that's it so no headphones or anything
like that put this aside the stickers
out here it looks like you've got the
sim pin as well to pop out the sim card
okay so we'll walk you through english
united states let's skip the sim card
for now since I'm just doing the
unboxing will skip Wi-Fi the regular
location date and time that's not right
this phone belongs to technobuffalo
finish so real quick there make yourself
at home touch the circle oh geez we're
getting a little guide here okay okay
let's just get out of here any case okay
so now we're on the home screen let's
quickly go through some of the things it
feels really quick what comes pre-loaded
of course you okay you've got Chrome
pre-installed you've got all of googles
apps that means currents gmail obviously
Google+ Google search news and weather
check out google search for all you know
what we don't have a connection so we'll
skip that part new keyboard i was using
this actually the other day on a friends
so let's test you know all of what so
it's sort of like swype if you use that
before so i can say hi my name is todd
tips Todd's kind of hard to do oh he
doesn't wanna get my name but generally
works pretty well hi knit my name is a
lot or week take you up to today it's a
top today generally takes some getting
used to but it's actually pretty nice
one of the things I do want to show you
is there's the new camera controls that
allow you to take 360 sort of panoramic
shots I will say yes and you'll notice
seat now when you click on the screen
you can actually go to any of the camera
control so if you want to take an HDR
shot or work with the flash turn offer
on you just do that hold it down it's
really nice and and easy to do if you're
just sort of taking a picture so let's
do I haven't used this yet to find the
panorama mode but I know any other it is
so what this will allow you to do and
it's hard for me to show you on camera
though is to take a picture sort of of
your entire landscape and more than just
a panorama but a sort of 360 snapshot
for your friends to view so I thought
that was pretty cool you can share it
right to a Google+ account stuff like
that in the meantime I'm going to be
doing a full review but that's a quick
look here you can see it's really a
great sized phone it's got all the power
you
on it does have LTE chip on board we've
seen that a number of reports but it's
not running on LTE networks so you're
going to get hspa+ with this right now
any case that's a quick look at the
Nexus 4 from LG and Google and this is
