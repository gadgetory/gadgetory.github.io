from technobuffalo in it's been about
six months since we review this guy the
one plus one and I wanted to share with
you guys my impression of the device
after using it for several months so
let's go ahead and get started two
things I love about the 1+1 are the
specs and the price you still won't find
a phone as affordable as good-looking
and as equip as this one it may not have
the latest processor or tech inside but
it's held up very well and she continued
to hold up in the coming months
performance wise this device is
top-notch it barely lags and it
definitely is a device that can compete
with flagships like the HTC One m8 the
Samsung Galaxy s5 but how does it stack
up to newer smartphones like the Nexus 6
the note 4 or even the droid turbo now
surprisingly it holds up really well
it's still very responsive and I can run
the latest apps and games without a
hitch which is great and to be quite
honest I don't see too much of a
difference in terms of performance
between the Snapdragon 801 processor and
the Snapdragon 805 processor is found in
two current devices everything is still
buttery smooth now in terms of
durability the oneplus one still looks
relatively new we have experienced
somewhere around the back of the
sandstone surface and the chrome room on
the front is starting to show little
where with bits and pieces of the finish
coming off though that's expected from
day to day use I personally don't use a
case on my one plus one though
durability and how your phone holds up
will always vary on how you use your
device the screen is a 5.5 inch 1080p
LCD display and after seeing hugh HD
displays from samsung LG and motorola it
pulls the oneplus one's display out the
water I'm not bad-mouthing the oneplus
one screen whatsoever it's still a very
good-looking screen but just know that
they're a brighter higher resolution
displays available on newer devices now
moving on to battery life I was very
impressed with what this little guy can
do now on my device I have pushed under
patient is enabled I make several calls
a day send messages not once have I need
to charge my phone midday lots of busy
work day without an issue and to me
that's a true test of battery life
however there are some newer smartphones
with bigger batteries and newer tech
that can easily beat the oneplus one's
battery and newer devices like the
samsung galaxy note for the motorola
droid turbo or the sony xperia z3 have
fast charging capabilities which will
get you up to six hours of battery life
in about 15 to 25 minutes is the one
plus ones battery so
as impressive as we thought it was yes
and no for a device has been out for
months it's still pretty impressive to
get battery life they can get through a
busy workday and fast charging whoa most
users won't even need that option
considering it should last a full day
anyway on the software side of things
the oneplus one run cyanogenmod 11 s in
in my opinion it's still a terrific OS
cyanogenmod lets users customize pretty
much everything from the lock screen to
the boot screen you have added features
like gestures and options to enable
software keys or hardware keys and you
get the beautiful stock Android look
features that sets it apart from Samsung
HTC or LG software updates have been
pushed out several times since our
review and urban major improvements
throughout the OS like stability and
performance improvements where's with
other devices we may be waiting on
updates from manufacturers and carriers
and that doesn't really happen with 1
plus once 1 plus approves is a software
update it gets pushed out to all the
oneplus one users similar to what Google
does with its Nexus devices like a Moto
X Nexus or even an iPhone the hardware
and software works together seamlessly
six months later the OS doesn't feel
slow or tired so before I wrap up this
video as I mentioned in our review
there's still that silly invite system
that one plus wants you to go through
and several months later it's still here
at one point 1 plus did offer pre-orders
for the one but it was just limited and
was only available for a certain amount
of time servers crash people were upset
and some people weren't able to
pre-order their device will it get
better from here on out well we hope so
but it doesn't appear the device will be
easier to get maybe we'll just have to
wait for the next iteration of this
device so six months later the oneplus
one while not showing off the best specs
anymore still stands up against it are
pricier flagship devices if you're
looking to jump into cyanogen the device
is probably your best bet factor in the
price which starts are just two hundred
ninety nine dollars for the 16 gigabyte
model and the one plus one is still a
solid device six months later anyways
