night here in the United States I can't
sleep figured I actually hence the hence
the bedhead figured i'd make a little
video throw up on the site and youtube
so what i'm going to do today is I'm
going to compare the controllers of the
three main video game consoles the
Nintendo Wii the xbox 360 and the
playstation 3 give you guys a little bit
comparison show you sighs and i'll talk
about wait can we show that in the video
so first up xbox 360 wireless controller
all the controllers are going to show
her the wireless this is the only one
that can't have a wire but it's got a
first battery pack in the back at
removable this also comes in a wired
version which i'm not going to show you
guys it's not terribly heavy feels good
in the hands it's got full-on Rumble
support built-in analog stick and look
sick your old classic up and down and
then the you know a BB buttons around
here ABX and why i believe start button
the Xbox button take you to xbox live
which is xbox live is amazing by the way
if you guys haven't checked it out VI
should do a video on that start button
shoulder buttons on top here here here
and here down here is where you can plug
in your wired headset to use on xbox
live when you're playing games and here
is where you charge a headset
proprietary port plugs into your xbox
for wireless this does not use bluetooth
uses a Microsoft proprietary wireless
format so it has how it transmits
wirelessly next up is the PlayStation 3
6 axis controller Travon really had that
much of a chance to play around with I
downloaded a couple games from the
PlayStation Store but mostly i'm using
my playstation 4 blu-ray movies which i
should do another video on they look
pretty good i guess it looks like a
regular place in playstation controller
haven't had a playstation prior but my
remembers what they look like
you know the two analog sticks this does
not have Rumble support as of right now
I know they're adding it it's got your
up and down and then your classic
PlayStation button to diamond the X the
triangle the X a circle and square for
shoulder buttons like Xbox controller
select and start and a button that
launches the console turn the donner
turns on the controller which is nice I
should say to that both of these can't
turn on the console and turn off the
console just by using their buttons in
the middle this controller I just turned
it on and you can see right there the
light tells you if you have one
controller connected to connected or
three connected which was extremely
light I mean almost weighs nothing i'm
shocked at how little it weighs almost
like to have more weight to it the
reasons called six axis is actually
works similar to the wii controller
which I'll show you in a minute in that
fact that it's got the gyro CENTAC
gyroscopic sensors let me turn to the
left at no turning to the left to turn
to the right nobody turn it to the right
you know up down is the same so that's
that's pretty neat haven't a chance to
play around that yet but that's what it
does and charges by a mini USB port
right here to plug into the USB port on
the console next controller I'll show
you guys is the wii remote or wiimote
review guys call it this is certainly
very different together three and i'll
show you them all next to each other in
a minute here maybe you guys have seen
this maybe you haven't set the up and
down power button big a button home and
plus and minus and a one and two now the
other controllers you hold them with two
hands this way meant to hold one hand so
i'll show you guys here get that frame
you hold it almost like a remote control
on the back there's a trigger button we
rest your finger so as you're moving it
you can hold down the a button the up or
down on a keypad now this thing is
lacking you know most of the button to
other controllers because it's uses all
motion sensored so up goes left right
you know or right it goes right love to
go left and you shake it does different
motion
which is really revolutionary for the
week so that is the wii remote and one
attach it to the wii remote is what's
referred to as the nunchuck which is
this it plugs right into the bottom this
also has a gyroscopic sensor so this
knows when you move it left or right and
connected with a cord there you hold on
each hands and certain movements do
certain things so you can move them up
shake it and they all do connect they
all correspond to certain movements on
the screen to the game you're playing so
by comparison something like shaking is
still left or right with the equivalent
of hitting a button on the xbox 360 or
the X button on the PlayStation 3 so
here are the controllers take off the
nunchuck for ya let me show you guys a
quick size comparison the 38 if I can
get this in frame for you xbox obviously
PlayStation and the Wii Remote sorry
that angles not so good for you there ma
as you guys can see the xbox controller
the PlayStation controller pretty
similar in size xbox controller
certainly heavier but i think that
weight is welcome and the wii
controllers smaller than all of them you
know resting on top and resting on top
you can barely see it by comparison as
well I've deep to nunchuck here two guys
can see it um actually little bigger
than you think but it's just in your
hand pretty nicely so there are the all
the controllers kind of laid out for you
just take a look there so what I have I
have played my xbox a lot and the
graphics on that are amazing and for
what I've seen to the PlayStation the
graphics look just as good as the as the
xbox if not better movie that's out of
the PlayStation hooked up with component
ergo hdmi and the xbox hooked up with
the component may be the difference the
wii looks little cartoonish
but the controls are the controls were
fun I should also mention that the
closest asian uses bluetooth so you can
use any cell phone bluetooth headset to
connect to the playstation online
employed people anyway guys this was a
controller video give myself some ideas
for new videos the blu-ray all do review
on i'll compare the xbox and playstation
or you guys want to see and maybe
something on the wii as long and I guys
hope you're in bed that you guys can
sleep I'm gonna give it another whirl
here as also don't forget to check out
the new website i'll post a little thing
around here but it's john for lakers dot
blogspot com that's jaaon number for
lakers like the team dot blog spot.com
and thank you to everybody who's been
helping to contribute to the site and
try and make it a success we couldn't do
it without you guys so thank you and I
