TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
newest Android smartphone and Verizon's
lineup this is the sequel to the widely
popular original droid this is of course
the Droid 2 so I'm very excited take a
look at this I was a big fan of the
original enjoy it sort of ushered in the
Android era on Verizon and it really
embraced the operating system ever since
let's go ahead and dig in of course we
will use the obligatory big ol knife to
dig into the review unit sent from the
folks at Verizon will hack into the Fed
Ex pack after usual push that off to the
side we'll go over all the specs and
such as well so here we have the Droid
alright so the box here looks very
similar to the original Droid it's got
the number 2 right there I tell you
apart droid to Verizon Google by motor
I'll go over all the specs as we get
further into the phone but here's a
little bit more about it
adobe flash player included so it's full
flash support a DLNA which is quite nice
for watching some of your content on
other devices a little bit more about it
hearing aid capable what's in the box we
will see all that in just a minute and
on the back another picture so let's
talk about specs real quickly first this
is going to run you $1.99 99 after
rebates in a two-year contract on
Verizon it is running the most current
build of Android Android 2.2 with
Motorola's revamped and very useful
actually motoblur I've done a full
overview of what this looks like when we
first took a look at the Droid X 3.7
inch WVGA touch screen and we'll talk
about that when we get to the phone
which is right here so we're talking
about that WVGA touch screen which means
it's got a resolution of 480 by 854
capable of 16 and million colors so
let's take a look at the device before
we go look at the accessories usually I
do that in Reverse so it's a very
familiar streamlined droid form factor
you can definitely tell if this is part
of the Droid family so you've got the
motoblur of icons you got a menu icon
home button the back and a search a
really nice screen it's got a
nice feel to it go ahead and slide it
out because does have a full QWERTY
keyboard a revised Corti keyboard one of
the things that I really didn't like
about the initial droid was a keyboard
particularly the d-pad seemed to take up
a lot of unnecessary space motorola has
fixed that and now some arrow keys here
into the d-pad and you get a bit more
flush keyboard you take a look at the
side there's not all that much room I
will take a look at the keyboard though
when we do a review of it when I first
blush does appear to be relatively
useful on the back we have a five
megapixel camera and this phone is
powered by a t-mobile TI OMAP processor
clocked at one gigahertz so if we're
gonna keep up with snapdragons of the
world there is eight gigabytes of
on-board storage as well as a gigabyte
micro sd card we'll see in a minute and
the battery should be about 1400
milliamp hours so take a look at what
else we got on the side there is the
charging microUSB port for a typical
jury looking for in fact on the back of
the speaker grill the battery that
slides off you have a dual LED flash on
the right-hand side volume up and down
and dedicated camera button top we've
got power and lock 3.5 millimeter
headset jack bottom we've got microphone
let's go ahead and see what else we're
gonna get in the box when you go ahead
and pick up your droid to pull up a
plastic we have the charger which is
pretty common we've seen quite a bit
plugs into the wall here's a USB cord I
think this one's probably already been
reviewed nothing else in the box
other than some paperwork which means
the battery must already be in here it's
go ahead and take a look looks like the
battery door has also been improved
initial droid one of the complaints
people had was that the battery door
would slide out this one nearly got it
looks like you have to give it a bit of
a push to get it to slide out go ahead
and take a look at the battery and make
sure it is indeed 14 out of 14 hundred
million hours and I am NOT a liar
there's the 8 gigabyte card you can see
it already installed right there
this is 3.7 volts and fourteen hundred
million power hours so I did tell you
the truth go ahead and slide this back
on it's attempt to and this has been a
first look at the Droid 2 again stay
tuned to the channel for a ton of
coverage on the Droid 2 we'll be putting
it through its paces and comparing it
with some of the competition go ahead
and slide that right back into place and
really you have to give it a nice push
I've just quite nice over the initial
Droid there we go got it in place let's
take a look at how us is going to
compare to some of the stablemates
Verizon lineup on the Android family to
consider which Verizon Android phone is
best for you so here we've got the much
larger Droid X considered the big
brother the little brother of the Droid
2 both mean by Motorola running the blur
operating system or the blur skin rather
on the Android operating system and see
the size difference here between the two
you know for having a full slide-out
keyboard the Droid 2 is actually very
thin here we have the Droid Incredible
and see these two side-by-side probably
- you may be considering the incredible
is a very thin phone and actually
surprised at how thin the Droid 2 looks
by comparison and let's bring in the
iPhone 4 he doesn't see what this looks
like as you decide perhaps which one
might be best for you and you can see
them both right there I should mention
it does have support for a Verizon's
mobile hotspot you connect up to and
believe five devices using Verizon's
EVDO Rev a service which is quite fast
so stay tuned to the channel for a full
you know overview of the operating
system and some more hardware and looks
on a ton of other droid 2 coverage I'm
John Grainger TechnoBuffalo see in the
next video bye bye
