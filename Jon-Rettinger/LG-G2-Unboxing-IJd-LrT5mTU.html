TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the LG g2 the latest flagship to come
from the company I'm pretty excited look
at this guy the Optima she was one of my
favorite devices the past few months I'd
love the Jeep Rose hopefully a sequel
the g2 is equally as awesome let's open
it up take the first look here is the
box for the LG g2 a variant of this
coming to pretty much every major US
carrier is LG's latest flagship and
let's ceremoniously strip it out of its
box and there it is sitting there doing
its thing go ahead and pull the tray out
with the phone with it for just a quick
second say throw it on the ground
accident there's a phone number in there
which is why I did that
we've got a Quick Start Guide for of
course getting started quickly a SIM
card is a nano SIM LG g2 I could
probably understand that side of it
product safety and warranty informations
we've got a sim removal tool which is
kind of cool in the shape of a G we've
got some connection cable this is just a
standard micro USB cable and a
relatively large wall works but let's
take a look at the phone that I
foolishly threw on the table here is the
LG g2 I'll go ahead and peel off the
plastic and see if it can power on and
we'll run through all the specs and
remember where that power button is
we'll certainly talk about that at
length as a peel off screen protector
here from it's 5.2 inch screen it's
harder to do than you'd think
there we go you are looking at a 1920 by
1080 screen are they pretty beastly 424
PPI which is ridiculously clear I can
say just by looking at the screen right
now it looks pretty awesome
it's an HD IPS screen in case you're
wondering I think LG to some of the best
jobs actually with their screens and you
can sort of see what it looks like right
there very very quick Android 4.2.2 it
launched being powered by a incredibly
awesome Snapdragon 800 clocked at 2.2 6
gigahertz which is crazy iPhones have
that much power now it's got 2 gigs of
ram onboard available either 16 or 32
gigabytes but no external storage make
sure you get one that's going
to fit all of your storage needs the
main camera on the back is a 13
megapixel affair in the front is a 2
megapixel job I don't I call it an
affair so I'm just
cheating on itself with the front facing
camera 802 11 ABG and it is dual band
Bluetooth 4.0 a very large 3000 milliamp
hour battery which is just 200 milliamps
or of what the Galaxy Note 3 has with a
way bigger screen so this battery should
last quite a while at least that's the
expectation it we's 14.3 grams or 5.0 4
ounces available in white or black so
take a quick look at the phone and what
its going to have on it
so again 5.2 inch screen with on-screen
buttons I'll go and go into apps and see
what comes bundled with it the 18th tee
stuff you usually see TT code scanner
AT&amp;amp;T drive mode and family map good
Kindle comes pre-installed on at
Facebook there's probably some LG things
on there they can see how many icons you
can see in one row is pretty impressive
a quick remote it's got IR support
evidently on it quick translator video
editor and the rest to go through
widgets see if there's anything sort of
fancy going on there the LG's done
analog clock and it looks to be about it
but the big story here aside from this
crazy gorgeous screen and really fast
processor is on the back and also
appears to be a fingerprint magnet on
the back these are the buttons this is
the volume up/down volume up and down
button and the power and lock button
which i think is gonna be very weird
there are no buttons on the right-hand
side and no buttons on the left the idea
is that you hold your phone in the back
when you're using it in your phone
serving at your fingers naturally sort
of go there I'm not too sure how hard or
easy is gonna be to sort of realize that
that's the home button it does have an
LED ring that I'll go around it and
which one's the volume but only time
will tell and that is what reviews it
for to see if it actually works or not
so anything guys want to see about the
phone be sure to let us know leave it in
the comments down below and we will show
you kind of excited take a look at this
guy it's sort of a really nice flash up
I think LG's done a really nice job
improving their devices over the past
few years the Optimus G was pretty solid
device and expect the its sequel to be
equally impressive and right guys let me
know what you think anything else you
want to see about the device leave in
the comments down
