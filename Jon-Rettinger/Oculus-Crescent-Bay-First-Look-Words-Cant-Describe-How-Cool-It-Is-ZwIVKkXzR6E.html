Hazleton from technobuffalo at CES 2015
I'm here with the oculus Crescent Bay
prototype it's a new version of the
oculus that we saw last year and this
year it has sensors on the back as well
as the front now last year these sensors
were added so that when you're moving
around in an environment actually
interacts with you so if you get a
coffee table in front of you in the
video game you move towards it it
actually come towards you and as opposed
to like older versions of virtual
reality where it would still move away
as you're going through these sensors
allow you to really interact with it so
now you have it on the back and what
that allows is for better integration
with the 3d audio that this feature so
in a game say you're normally playing on
your playstation 4 and you hear audio
sort of the right and left and all
around you with your normal headset
that's great when you're looking at the
TV here you can actually move around the
audio is moving with you because that's
the way it would in this virtual world
so let's take a look we're going to try
it out and then i'll give you my
impressions afternoon so right now I'm
in like a mechanical room I can hear
audio it's loud
there's a siren going off and so over
hear the sirens to my right but as I
turn I can now tell it's in front of me
where it's blinking it's deep root I
have a t-rex a huge t-rex in front of me
it's growling right in my face was so if
I turn is a left here it's still right
here I can steer the audio so are we
going it's pretty terrified right now it
looks like we're gonna get an unreal 4
account of demo whoa it's like bullet
time in the middle of a fight here see
it's like out in the middle of a
first-person shooters cops like right
here right here and a huge robot bullets
coming holy cow police cars there's
explosion this is insane and I can see
everything's in slow motion like this
rocks coming there's a gun here shooting
bullets are flying it's terrifying we
stopped the video just real fast to
thank our friends and good peeps at
lenovo yoga is not just for people in
stretch pants anymore want a you guys
about the yoga tablets to pro is a
full-featured multimedia tablet that
gives you just a new way to entertain
you ever been just like watching a video
like all which i could show this to
somebody was things got a freaking
projector built into it i can show a
50-inch image on any wall or screen that
kind of mobilize your home theater it's
got a rock in 13.3 inch 2560 x 1440
pixel resolutions they're not gonna miss
a thing it's great for work and play
watching videos or when your boss comes
and make it look like you're doing some
work it's incredible how real this is
and where this will probably take gaming
in the future and media consumption and
it's super loud and students like
shooting rockets
there's huge explosion in front of me
the car is flipping Wow
holy cow like I think the car is
flipping over me and I could see this
guy the fastener right here like in the
car as it flips over me and this huge
metal guy robot is right in front of me
shooting okay so that was a quick look
here at the Crescent Bay prototype from
oculus I think she saw some of my
reactions in the video the weirdest part
is that you feel like you're inside this
world especially last seen unreal for
engine I'm standing there with like cops
all around me this crazy guy at the end
shooting bullets and then I was on like
another planet with an alien just
looking at me right in the face and the
audio to is just so real so I guess
you're turning around it just feels like
you're really there I can't wait to see
where this takes gaming and all kinds of
soft in the future just multi media
consumption in general but crazy stuff
can't wait to see it hit the market this
