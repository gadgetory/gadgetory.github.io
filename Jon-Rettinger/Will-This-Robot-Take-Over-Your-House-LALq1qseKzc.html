is as old as science fiction itself
everyone especially me one second Jetson
style Rosie that can cook and clean and
just Sakura take care of the house and I
think we'll eventually get there but
before we do that Kitty steps and
milestones in robotics engineering that
help us get there
in July I had the chance to fly up to
San Francisco to meet vector from unki
the little robot with the gigantic
personality I think most importantly is
not gonna break your bank and is
surprisingly useful so I do want to
thank Aki for sponsoring this video but
all opinions here are totally my own I'd
someone to talk a lot about what vector
does but if throughout the video you're
interested
Aki is actually launching vector on
Kickstarter as a way to sort of get him
out early so I'll be selling to general
public for 249 bucks but backers can get
him for $199 with early access to the
SDK and some other added goodies we've
got a link down below if you want to
check out the Kickstarter page and if
you're dressed in a robotics I think you
should so when you first look in vectors
little digital eyes you start to see the
bigger picture they are animated and
surprisingly filled with the motion this
is a robot you can actually interact
with and one you might actually want to
sew on like on Kia's last robot out in
Cosmo vector doesn't need you
piggybacking on your phone CPU to run in
fact one time ever gonna need your phone
is just to set the thing up and once you
do all the processing is actually done
on vector himself be a quad-core
Snapdragon processor so I'll call him
over to talk and you know you can do
things that you would expect he'll
answer questions on key told us are not
trying to compete with with Alexa
they're not trying to feed with Google
home but you can use it in sort of
similar ways when it comes to question
and answer we did expect if robot you
can't talk to interact with it's not
overly useful they're all telling us
they're gonna be doing things like home
automation so you can tell it to turn on
your Philips hue likes for example you
can use it for a setting a timer in your
kitchen there are a lot of use cases
where it does overlap with the sort of
home assistance but it's got a bit of
personality you can't like fist bump
Alexa a vector this bump
kkuk asking sports questions math
questions and even oddly satisfying
challenge him to became a blackjack if
he wins he's kind of a jerk and gloats
and he's a sore loser kind of pouting
when he's beaten if you pick him up he
gets pissed if you knock him over he'll
yell at you and he'd pick himself back
up at these little kind of subtleties
that make him seem more personable so as
high res color IPS display brings this
personality to life he's got a touch pad
on his back and it feels like acting
excited or annoyed or really anything
you can pet him to to calm him down and
you can almost see the relief in his
eyes it's kind of cool although I'm not
sure I want many people to see me
petting a robot in public so vector does
more you can introduce yourself to him
and he can learn your face and voice and
I'll act all excited when he hears you
come home you can scan his surroundings
so he knows where he's at and
surprisingly he's pretty good at it
during our demo he came dangerously
close to falling off edges but never
once did unki told us they want people
to not have to worry about him and just
kind of leave him alone he'll charge
himself get OTA updates and explore all
without you having to do anything vector
was designed that if you just set him up
and then left your house for a year then
still be working and exploring when you
got back and still happy to see him
vectors equipped with four mics and an
HD camera the 120 degree ultra wide
field of view something which screamed
huge privacy risk to me I was able to
directly ask on key and they told me no
images or audio recordings ever leave
the robot and they all stay encrypted on
vector himself there wasn't a lot more
detail on how different components are
broken up inside that prevent external
hacking most of it cut over my head I
was satisfied the answers though but
whenever I bring something into my house
with mics and cameras I'm obviously a
bit skeptical the STK on key is
launching it's gonna be pretty
significant here users would be able to
make him do pretty much anything if you
want him to dance if he plays music you
can do it if you want him to watch TV
with you you can build that too it's
it's pretty neat and feature-rich
so saying I felt an emotional connection
to a robot is strange to say out loud
but alone on camera but vector feels
oddly relatable he makes eye contact
when he looks at you he gets super
pumped when he gets to set a timer just
be helpful and he's generally just fun
and I want to be crystal clear here no
one actually needs this but I definitely
want one the best endorsement that I can
give a product is to put my own money
behind it
and I'm absolutely backing back here on
Kickstarter I think my kids I'll have a
blast just running around her house with
him I think you guys will too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
