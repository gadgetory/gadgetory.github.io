it's kind of strange to believe it's
been a cool decade since Apple took the
wraps off the og I so in fact some you
guys may have never even been around
when the iPhone first came out and ever
had one never seen one we did hold
retrospective all nest bone will link to
it down below but I couldn't show you at
the time with what the shipping OS
looked like on that first phone because
Apple updated very quickly after
shipping smartphone world has changed
like a crazy amount in the past ten
years and certainly Apple's of the stage
for what Android is going to be and sort
of reset the table for how we use
smartphones I want them to take a look
back at the very first operating system
that launched on the iPhone
not about doing some dramatic injure
about it being a simpler time in 2007
but it really wasn't was complicated its
own right
most people had Blackberry phones some
had Windows Mobile but mostly people
just had split phones and then Apple had
been rumoured to making a phone for
years unveiled the iPhone and it brought
with it a ton of really cool stuff a lot
of things we hadn't really seen before
at least not seeing all of these things
together in one device first there was a
widescreen iPod Touch control brought
visual voicemail with something that was
really new to people multi-touch
gestures at least for me with something
that was like crazy easy to actually see
we take it for granted now thinking
about a pinch to zoom up pictures was
insane I remember showing my grandmother
when I brought the original iPhone to
her house pinch-to-zoom and like her
brain just like fell on the floor and
melted it also brought things like HTML
email Safari web browser so that a text
messaging and a YouTube app and Google
Maps that was back when Apple and Google
will still be FS and going out to dinner
and having date cell time you're
probably asking yourself all right John
yeah we know this what's different about
iOS 1.0 well check out that calculator
app interface Apple got super suit
ripping off another calculator look and
also unique to iPhone OS 1.0 was a
really basic super slow camera app that
Apple subsequently fixed in later
versions of iPhone OS this version the
phone is so rare it's actually signed by
woz on the back so now that we know
where we started let me give you a
history of how we got to where we are in
2008 we saw iPhone OS 2.0 not brought
with it the App Store which I have to
tell you how much that changed things
2009 saw iPhone OS 3 which you're
finally gifted with cut copy and paste
as well as spotlight voice controls and
finally MMS that's web 2010 and the name
scheme changed and iOS 4.0 was born the
iPhone and iPad now received
multitasking folders and FaceTime 2011
was when Siri was finally born into the
world along with iOS 5.0 we also got
notification center and iMessage so
getting a little more modern out in 2012
iOS 6 came along and Apple and Google
famously got divorced and ditched Google
Maps for Apple matte
we all know how well that went
originally 2013 iOS 7 came along and the
look and feel of iOS changed they
ditched the skeuomorphic design for
Johnny I've inspired flat design they
also brought control center airdrop
introduced in iOS 7 also we got a new
camera app multitasking FaceTime
received a ton of improvements 2014
brought along iOS 8 there are some
pretty big improvements there things
like continuity widgets third-party
keyboards and homekit in 2015
iOS 9 brought along things like
low-power battery mode context-aware
Siri and some iPad improvements as well
like picture-in-picture and split for
you and I brought it on don't spend that
much time telling you what 2016 brought
with iOS 10 but we got things that can
prove the IMF's platform that include
its own App Store and various animation
effects Syrian Maps got big-time
improvements the ability to open apps
and better transit directions other
things we got were like race to wake
which certifications Apple News we
designed Apple music and it redesigned
lockscreen
was any one of these OS as it was your
favorite when you which point did you
jump onto iOS at which point did you
leave Iowa say in the comments down
below
speaking of comments let me jump back to
comment today this comes from our new
Mac Pro and iMac finally coming and it
comes from prop RC who says the new Mac
Pro is just a PC tower lol I kind of
thought that too but Apple said they're
going to make their Mac Pro modular I
mean pretty much every PowerPC is
modular
even the pre trashed in Mac Pro is
modular you can pop stuff into it so you
guys remember what was called iPhone OS
at times what was your favorite feature
or - lack of the video thumbs up we
appreciate it
till next time drive right in just a
second buster
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
