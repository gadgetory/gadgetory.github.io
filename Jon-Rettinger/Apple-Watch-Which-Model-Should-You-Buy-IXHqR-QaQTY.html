to you by domain.com what's up everyone
both like the episode of Retton Jers
rich the show where I just talk and rant
and rave about whatever is going on
so I'm getting a lot of questions about
the Apple watch a lot of people have
want to know which ones they should get
if they should even bother to expensive
any killer features and kind of
everything in between I had the
privilege of going to the Apple event
and trying on all different models to
Gappa watch including the 10 to 17
thousand dollar Apple watch Edition so I
thought I'd shed some light on which one
I think I'm going to get personally
which ones are going to get into review
what the straps felt like all things
that might help you decide if you want
to get one which one you should get or
if you should skip it completely
altogether the big caveat here we ran a
story this week saying Apple watch 2.0
is coming relatively soon if you look
back to the original iPad launch Apple
just kind of wants to get it out to
gauge the market then the iPad 2 came
and it was a very quick turnaround
between 1 and 2 and I thinned it down
and added a lot of cool features I
expect the same to happen with the Apple
watch so I think said that here are my
general thoughts and impressions I spent
a lot of time with the Apple watch sport
the less expensive model in the 42
millimeter size the 38 looked fine it
looked a little bit small on my wrist I
don't have sort of giant wrists to say
the least but it looked a little on the
small side so I'm using all the 42
millimeters the baseline for prices but
if you are some of the wants a 38 you
can subtract 50 bucks 100 bucks
depending what model it's everything I
am going to say so first the model that
I think seems to be the sweet spot is
the Apple watch sport in space gray the
black band and sort of the black case of
the watch looks really nice really sleek
in fact it looks very similar to the
black version the regular Apple watch it
cost about $250 more here's a looking
about a $400 ish entry-level price which
is very very expensive but from a look
standpoint it looked almost identical to
the watch that was significantly more
expensive now the rubber band was nice
was kind of a pain to have to do though
with one hand so bear that in mind the
sport is aluminum the Apple watch
stainless steel I notice no different
than how they felt they look a little
bit different but there was very little
to worry about in terms of weight or
also
Halla watch looks general and i say all
this while I'm wearing a moto 360 just
for fun replicas you're wondering what's
on my wrist so I think the space gray
sports it can be a really good sweet
spot let's look at all the models to
find the one that seems right for me
taking price out there's a really sweet
looking Apple watch one with a black
aluminum band that comes in at a
whopping eleven hundred dollars and I
just I can't justify an $1,100 price
point for watch the changes are is gonna
get up bring it within about ten months

you think domains think domain.com and
then you talk about the Apple watch the
addition stuff things that cost $10,000
$17,000 this is where it's gonna be
gonna go from more ramps from wrist I
get spending a lot of money on a fancy
watch a Rolex an Audemars Piguet
whatever maker you want to do for a few
reasons first those very rarely are
hugely depreciating assets obviously
they do depreciate mostly but you can
sell a 10 year old Rolex for a very
close price point to what you bought it
for imagine your Apple watch Edition
you're buying gold for I know save
$13,000 an Apple watch Edition 2 comes
out what price point do you think your
watch is gonna be at and you start
telling me the price of gold there ain't
much gold on that watch can affect that
price very much looking at maybe at best
a 50% depreciation it seems so silly to
me when you buy an expensive watch a lot
of times you want to make a statement
you want to take a listen I've made it
I'm successful something good just
happen in my life this is the watch that
I want to show let me spend that money
on an Apple watch Edition you're sending
an entirely different message that's
what you might send if you had a fancier
more traditional it's a Swiss maid watch
I'm not sure that's the message you want
to be sending to people that's just my
two cents but maybe your
going to disagree it is in no way an
investment and just says maybe I got a
lot of money look at my new toy which
maybe that's what you want to say now
I've been said all that kind of stuff
why I think the apples watch sport is
probably the best one at least for me
I'm going out to a nice dinner if I'm
going out with my wife on a date which
we very rarely get to do anymore it's a
baby at home I don't really want to get
smart watch a thing I don't want it
buzzing I don't want it glowing I'll put
on a normal traditional watch that sort
of negates the need for a fancier watch
that you get in the regular Apple watch
or certainly with the wee expensive
addition so if you're watching this
video debating on without to get an
Apple watch do you think maybe you're on
the edge Apple watch sport is a really
good way to go the space gray it's kind
of understated it looks all black hard
to tell if it's even the sport or it's
the addition again of a hard time
switching bands says a friendly heads-up
there I think that seems to be really a
good entry-level sweet spot if you want
to call that price point entry-level at
all I just kind of want to share my
thoughts on a lot of people been asking
what I think about the Apple watch if
it's worth getting if it's not worth
getting that's gonna be up to you we
still haven't seen really any killer
feature but what it does it does very
well UI is very smooth it works well as
expected
everything about it does as advertised
it just doesn't do all that much yet the
thought though is if developers take
advantage of ins can start to do much
more the same story we've heard with the
iPhone and the iPad 2 the developers
have taken crazy Vantage of those so
perhaps we'll see the same thing happen
with the Apple watch have you guys what
