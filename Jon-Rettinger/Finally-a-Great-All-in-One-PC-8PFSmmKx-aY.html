reputation these days most people don't
consider them that slow computer like
they once were and we're just good for
browsing the web or checking email but
they're not also considered to be the
best of the best that can handle 4k
video editing as well as VR gaming right
out of the box but Dell is looking to
change that mindset the new all-in-one
27-inch Inspiron 7000 can do just that
but is there really both a beauty and a
beast let's talk about it so let's get
specs out of the way first thing our
unit is powered off of an 8 core AMD
Rison processor with 16 gigs of RAM and
rx 580 GPU a 256 gig nvme SSD coupled
with a one terabyte hard drive for data
storage it's also got a 4k anti-glare
IPS display that dominates the front of
this machine it's a fairly beefy system
inside and considering they crimp all
these components inside an all-in-one
which is a fairly small and compact
footprint I'm pretty impressed so the
screen on this all-in-one machine is
really following that design trend from
Dell of an infinity edge display I mean
you're gonna have thinner bezels on the
top and the sides of the display but the
bottom is gonna have a much bigger
chunkier bezel but at least that bezel
serves double duty it sports Dells
performance stereo speakers under the
grill as well as a Windows hello
compatible IR camera and a webcam I
still have my gripes with the webcam it
is decent quality but it's probably in
the most unflattering position possible
though I really like Windows hello it's
convenient it's fast it was fairly
consistent throughout my testing
speakers were also fairly decent
definitely loud enough to be used for
any movie night with friends or if you
want to fill up your home office of
music the big story of course is that
27-inch display it's an IPS panel with a
matte finish that kind of helps prevent
glare and the colors look super vibrant
and sharp playing back 4k content on
this display looked fantastic
and they'll amount a huge fan of that
anti-glare display technology it didn't
take away from quality at all jumping to
i/o on the back of this thing is almost
every single port you could ask for it's
got a USB C port though no Thunderbolt 3
here multiple USB 3 ports an HDMI out
port and even an HDMI IN port so you can
actually plug in a console of your
choice and use this thing for all its 4k
display goodness there's
even a full-size SD card slot and an
Ethernet port so you're getting kind of
all the creature comforts of a desktop
tower but in a pretty stylish all-in-one
form factor so besides just watching 4k
content on the display you're probably I
don't want to use the computer to edit
4k video and do some moderate to high
intensive gaming and this Michigan
handles all of it really well I had no
issues whatsoever editing 4k video back
in Premiere Pro playing it back full
quality in the timeline and rendering it
out it was all super fast and on par
with other Intel machines the rx 580 is
also a very capable graphics card
big-name titles like GTA 5 rocket League
and battle grounds all ran extremely
well at moderately high settings mostly
thanks to that eight gigs of video ram
you can play games and 4k on this thing
they're gonna have to adjust your
settings accordingly to get pretty
decent framerate I will mention though
that we had some issues playing
battlegrounds kind of the hottest game
out right now but at the time of this
recording the game is still in alpha and
not very well optimized though it is
still definitely playable on this
machine so the RX 580 graphics card and
the eight core eyes and CPU inside of
this machine the computers actually
already right out of the box and Dell
loves to tell you that on the website
so grab your VR headset a choice plug it
in and you can play VR games without any
hiccups fan noise was an initial concern
of mine and especially with an
all-in-one having all those components
crammed in and I thought it was going to
be really loud but Dell did a pretty
good job venting and cooling all these
components and even under load the fans
are definitely on and audible but it
didn't sound like a jet engine was
taking off from my desk bottom line I
had zero performance issues of this
machine this is my first time
extensively testing a rise in base PC
and I was really pleasantly surprised
with how well it performed day to day
tasks like checking email and browsing
the web and doing some light photo and
video editing was super speedy and fast
and even with some heavier tasks like
full-on 4k video editing and some
moderate gaming the system handled all
of it really well another thing worth
mentioning is that for being an
all-in-one this machine is surprisingly
upgradable unscrewing a few screws on
the back gets you access to the guts in
the machine and the RAM hard drive and
even the nvme SSD can all be replaced
and though it's not encouraged by Dell
some reports online say that with a
little bit more work the CPU can also be
upgraded so I really do like this Dell
all-in-one
and I have had a lot of negative things
to say about it but though I know you'll
ask let's talk quickly about peripherals
Dell will tell you all these great
things about their keyboard and mouse
combo and how it won a bunch of awards
but though that may be true I don't have
a lot of praise for them I will say the
keyboard is actually surprisingly a
pretty solid wireless keyboard had a
really good key travel and it was pretty
comfortable to type on but the mouse
just felt cheap and lightweight and put
my hand in kind of an awkward position a
wired or wireless mouse of your choice
is a simple and easy solution to this
problem but I did think it was worth
mentioning and wrapping things up with
pricing we have one of the higher
configurations that Dell offers for this
machine but you can get a baseline
configuration of this machine for just
$9.99 so to answer my original question
yes the Inspiron 7000 really is both a
beauty and a beast
despite its plastic build that I thought
was a little bit cheap it really is a
good-looking computer that packs a lot
in a really small and compact footprint
