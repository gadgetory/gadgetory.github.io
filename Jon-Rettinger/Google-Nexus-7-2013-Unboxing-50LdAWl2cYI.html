technobuffalo calm with an unboxing of
the new Nexus 7 for 2013 how much is it
changed let's dig in and find out we've
got the new Nexus 7 here for 2013
slightly different box this time around
still got that seven showing up in the
logo we've got the 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi
version here let's go ahead and get this
blue sleeve off and set that to the side
let's slice that get that out of the way
and here we go here it is the new Nexus
7 we'll just go ahead and set this to
the side for the moment and see what
else is in the box a wall wart with the
Seuss's branding on it Quick Start
warranty and safety guides sorry not
quick start guides a quick start guide
and we have a micro USB cable we'll go
ahead and get the plastic off of here as
soon as it wants to let go come on let
go there alright hopefully this has a
charge always a big question when your
in box and there we go alright so along
the right-hand side we've got the power
button we've got the volume rocker up
and down on the bottom we have the micro
USB port nothing along the left side up
top we've just got the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack we do have the 5
megapixel camera here on the back and up
front we've got 1 point 2 megapixel
front facing camera I'll bring in the
original Nexus 7 to show you as you can
see slight height difference and it has
definitely trimmed down quite a bit and
I can tell you it feels a lot lighter
it's a lot more comfortable in the hand
than the original Nexus 7 they did keep
the soft touch back however they got rid
of the dimples that we saw last year is
taking forever to boot up this is a
interesting sign for android 4.3 of
course this is a first boot so there's
going to be a little bit more to set up
than usual but it's looking pretty nice
I
say I'm rather impressed with it on
first glance there we go finally so
there we have it folks we have the new
Nexus 7 now a whole lot else tell you
about we'll have to see once we do the
hands-on exactly how Android 4.3 works
out oh there's already a system update
that's always fun and it's shutting down
even better but when we do the hands-on
will give you a quick tour of the
hardware let you know about the software
and we'll do a little bit more
comparison to last year's Nexus 7 until
then this has been Sean on e4
