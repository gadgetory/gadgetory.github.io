TechnoBuffalo here if you've been
watching my channel for a little while
you know that I'm kind of a sedimented
guy last week when I celebrated my four
year anniversary on YouTube I got a
little bit misty eyed at the chances the
opportunities that you guys have given
me I'm not going to rehash all of that
but the moral is you guys have bestowed
upon me a trust to bring you consumer
electronics news and further than that
you give me a chance to live my dream I
get a wake up every day and play with
cell phones play with tablets look at
laptops it is my dream come true when I
look back from where I was four years
ago as a nerd with the camera and how
far it's evolved now I'm a geek with a
camera is just amazing and I'm so
incredibly thankful and these sort of
next phase of my consumer electronics
life milestone type thing is happening
right now you might have seen it on the
interwebs I am so excited and proud and
thankful that you guys give me
opportunity to announce that
technobuffalo is joining the revision3
family and I say a family because
they've got just a great group of people
and some awesome shows before I started
doing the consumer electronics thing I
used to watch revision3 all the time I'd
watch shows like diggnation geekbeat TV
and the rest of the fantastic content
that's put out on there if you guys
might recognize some familiar faces on
there as well mark soldierknowsbest I'm
a big fan of ben heck I've been watching
him since he first made his portable
Xbox laptop he's got his own show up
their household hackers got their own
show some of the what I consider to be
the brightest folks in the world of
video are on revision3 not sure what
they're doing with me but hopefully
we'll be able to put something up there
that'll be entertaining so what's going
to happen to the YouTube channel
nothing's going to change it's gonna be
exactly as it is you're still going to
have to deal with my bad jokes my awful
puns my pasty face and my hatred of
shaving you're really just going to get
three pieces of new content per week
that's a strange way to make three
three three new pieces of stuff per week
that you wouldn't get otherwise on
Monday it's going to be asked to Buffalo
where this guy is going to answer all
your questions from the great wide world
of technology get that in frame they
would go you can ask me anything that
you want on Wednesday you're going to
see John kwatra you the latest apps that
are out there from android to iphone
windows phone 7 to webos to what other
operating systems went missing I think
that's it but it's going to be one of
those and he's going to talk about apps
which is kind of awesome and I'm Friday
know Kravitz is going to bring all that
together in a nice package this is my
hand package and he's going to give you
a rumor roundup and sort of recap all
the rumblings and grumblings that are
not coming from a stomach but from the
internet about what might be happening
what might be coming so for you guys
they're asking when should you get your
next cell phone when should you get your
next laptop Noah's going to have those
answers for you now than that nothing
else is going to change with the youtube
channel it's going to be the same
content we've been putting up it's going
to be the same videos that we've been
putting up if you want to check out that
new stuff you can still see it on the
YouTube channel otherwise you can check
us out or revision 3.com / TechnoBuffalo
or just go to revision 3.com if you
don't want to watch us and watch some of
the awesome shows that they have out
there the folks at revision3 have been
so incredibly nice and kind and I can't
tell you how excited I am to be a part
of the revision 3 team so nothing is
going to change at the YouTube channel
it's just another avenue to sort of get
the TechnoBuffalo name out there to sort
of bring on a bigger audience and just
to have some fun and be able to do this
stuff on a larger grander scale so my
bad jokes can echo across a larger land
and there's a prime example of my bad
jokes so I'm going to end this before I
embarrass myself further technobuffalo
is now on revision3 this is an
opportunity that came about because of
you guys and your support so thank you
for supporting TechnoBuffalo thank you
for supporting me thank you for watching
the videos
this would have ever happened without
you and know that it's nothing that I
ever ever take lightly it's a huge
responsibility least that's how I look
at it and I will always do my best to
honor it so in the honor of saying thank
you I'm going to do it the most geeky
nerdy way possible that i can think of
thank you thank you thank you for my
tablet face thank you for this chance
and opportunity thank you to the
audience thank you to revision 3 thank
you to my neighbors who probably think
I'm crazy talking to a camera and now
holding a tablet out for not calling the
cops thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
