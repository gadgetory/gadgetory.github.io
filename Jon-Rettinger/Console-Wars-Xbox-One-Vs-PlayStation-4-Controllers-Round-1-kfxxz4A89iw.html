the last console generation and since
then the world has changed what we
expect from gaming and home
entertainment has evolved in this series
we'll be taking on the new generation of
gaming with an in-depth comparison of
the ps4 and Xbox one
once again you can expect an in-depth
analysis of every aspect of the devices
hardware software entertainment and
online features third-party games and
exclusive games it's all going to be
covered in depth so get ready for 12
rounds of heavyweight game console
action this is the console games
Oh
hey there it's LP from TechnoBuffalo and
it's good to be back
some of you may remember me from the
first season of the console wars which
started back in 2009 since then we've
had over 30 million views for the series
and I have you guys to thank for that so
thanks for tuning in but let's cut the
chitchat and get started for the past 30
years
it's been proven time and time again
that the best Mel between mind and
machine has been thanks to a pretty
simple piece of hardware the game
control sure there's been attempts at
quote more realistic types of control
but we always seem to return back to the
good old game controllers I think it's
mostly because we don't want realism we
actually want something that is more you
want to be faster stronger and more
precise than in reality and the game
controller simply enables our instincts
and thoughts to be better translated
onto the screen let's start off with a
successor to hands-down the best
controller of last generation when it
comes to looks the Xbox controller is
the prettier of the two
it's a snazzy looking device that is in
line with the design of the hardware
itself the Dual Shock 4 isn't as pretty
but it looks the part
it looks like a very functional piece of
hardware it's nice to see that both
parties have now designed a device sized
for adults when it comes economics both
controllers excel the Xbox one
controller feels definitely similar to
its predecessor having grown in size
just a tad I had very little complaints
about the 360 controller other than the
minor complaint about the ridge under
the triggers which left my middle finger
a bit numb at times but thankfully this
has been improved with Xbox one
controller as there's not too much
pressure exerted on my middle finger
anymore
the Dual Shock 4 has grown much longer
and rounded at the ends and that now
rests comfortably in adult-sized hands
your fingers are spread out evenly
across the surface and there's no hiding
it the DualShock 4 simply sits in your
palms
allowing all your fingers to relax
comfortably
the controller is certainly built out of
plastic the feels of high quality no
squeaking whatsoever even when a lot of
force is put into it and luckily the
same can be said about the Xbox one
controller both devices feel extremely
well built and it's clear that game
controllers can no longer be considered
as toys the exception makes the rule the
Xbox one controller has a nice matte
texture to it not taking into account
the d-pad buttons bumpers and triggers
which have that same glossy feel similar
to predeceasing models I'm still not too
big of a fan of this design choice as
the glossy buttons can get a bit sticky
when greased up the Dual Shock 4 has a
completely new and distinct crisscross
texture in the back not only does it
provide a nice grip but it also seems to
offer some minor heat dissipation
resulting in less clamminess it's a
welcomed new feature for those who
suffer from sweaty palms centrum a
common disorder among us gamers the
standard directional pads are somewhat
of a relic from the olden days the deep
pads on the DualShock controllers have
always been decent and the d-pad in the
new controller is no exception to this
rule it has an extremely tactile feel
which results in fast and precise
movements the lousy d-pad was my biggest
complaint about the original Xbox 360
controller but I'm happy to say that
it's no longer an issue whatsoever the
Xbox one's newly designed d-pad is
almost flawless although I could still
do without the glossy texture despite
the improvements typing and navigating
with Xbox d-pad doesn't feel as fast as
the ps4 counterpart the DualShock 4's
d-pad just feels a bit more responsive
when for example typing text with a few
exceptions button layout has essentially
remained the same on both controllers
the a B X&amp;amp;Y buttons feel pretty much the
same as on 360 controller but the
x-squared triangle and circle buttons
have been tweaked a little for the ps4
range of motion is now shorter this
actually enables you to mash buttons a
bit faster
and the buttons require much less to
press down and the buttons now actually
feel quite similar to the Xbox one
controller the edges of the new thumb
sticks on the Xbox one controller have a
nice and gritty texture to them they may
feel a bit rough on the thumbs at first
but end up being absolutely great for
intricate precision movements as you
only need the tip of your thumb for a
nice grip for the Xbox one controller
Microsoft had decided to increase the
range of motion for the thumbsticks and
simultaneously decrease the resistance
in all honesty I think this is a misstep
I actually prefer the Xbox 360 thumb
sticks which felt great for fast-paced
shooters and for example driving games
and quite ironically the DualShock 4 has
incorporated basically the Xbox 360s
successful thumb stick design instead of
rounded somewhat mushroom looking thumb
sticks the top is now concave with a
texture on the edge much like on Xbox
one controller yet it's a little softer
on the touch the range of motion and
resistance is a definite improvement
from the DualShock 3 and like I
mentioned the thumb sticks feel very
similar to that of what I consider to be
the best controller of the past
generation the DualShock 4 offers
delicate precision in games like the
excellent resogun in which less than
perfect control may get you very far and
this is the reason why touchscreen
gaming won't be replacing analog sticks
any time soon
but what about them triggers you asked
the DualShock 3 somewhat mediocre convex
trigger design has been abandoned
completely or an entirely new design
that actually feel like triggers they
curved out nicely at the ends which puts
a stop to your finger slipping off in a
heated battle the triggers have a
moderate resistance that feels just
about right they are a massive
improvement over its predecessor in
every conceivable way but how do they
fare against the competition among the
largest innovations of the Xbox one
controller are the new impulse triggers
which means that there are small rumble
units built into the triggers themselves
it adds a nice subtle effect when for
example shooting a gun the recoil is
transferred directly to your fingertips
so that is kind of cool actually but a
small concession has had to be made to
accommodate this new feature namely the
triggers are quite a lot larger
now essentially half of your index
finger rests on the trigger it's
comfortable enough as the triggers are
shaped and angle to suit the new size
but I have to say that I prefer the old
Moore trigger esque feel which the
DualShock 4 seems to have incorporated
quite well I still very much enjoy the
Xbox one triggers and the range of
motion is actually a bit longer than on
the DualShock for making the trigger is
quite ideal for for example car
acceleration and braking where you
really need to regulate how much of the
trigger you need to press the built-in
Rumble works quite well to let you know
when you are losing traction or braking
to harm the effect is less noticeable in
other game types but it's a subtle
effect that I can appreciate
while I kind of prefer the xpac triggers
for driving games the DualShock 4's
counterparts seem to offer a slightly
better overall feel for everything else
interestingly enough Microsoft is opted
to go with some clicky switches for the
bumpers while the DualShock force L ones
and our ones have more of a subtle feel
to them it's really a matter of
preference for these but both seem to do
their job
quite well I personally prefer the non
clicky variant
one of the new gimmicks I mean features
of the DualShock 4 is the LED light
mainly used for motion tracking the LED
has a couple of these and features
including that it will change from green
to yellow to red when your health
deteriorates so if you notice your
fingers going right like et pointing
towards home it's probably time to duck
and cover
otherwise it's a bit of a nuisance as
the glow can reflect off TV in front of
you which can be a bit distracting at
times the DualShock 4 also has a
touchpad which adds some new
functionality to the traditional button
layout necessary functionality that is
yet to be determined in killzone you can
command the owl robot companion with
horizontal and vertical swipes it works
well enough there's actually a subtle
dotted texture to the trackpad so you
can essentially feel without looking as
you are swiping either horizontally or
vertically it's a subtle thing but it
definitely feels natural
my ultimate fear is the games will use
the touchpad for quick temperaments this
has its place on mobile platforms but if
I'm going to be doing something like
this to trigger a finishing move or
animation in for example the next God of
War or whatever I might as well do this
time will tell as to what functionality
the trackpad will actually offer but as
it stands today it's much more of a
novelty and adds very little extra value
gone are the days of the traditional
start buttons on the Xbox one the start
and back buttons have been replaced by
the menu and view buttons the
functionality of these pretty much
remains as start and select on the
DualShock for the select and start
buttons have been replaced with the
share and options buttons the latter
obviously brings up options no surprises
there
but the real innovation here is the
share button with a single press of the
share button you can start sharing your
video game stream to anyone and everyone
a dedicated button makes it just that
much easier and definitely decreases the
barrier of entry for anyone to just
start streaming and sharing gaming
videos on a whim as cool as the share
button may be the placing of the buttons
isn't perfect they're a bit too close to
the trackpad and for some reason I keep
searching for the buttons over here
dagnabbit Sony has even decided to slap
in the speaker which I kind of found
amusing with a Nintendo Wii controller
it's great for integrating ingame audio
like audio logs and whizzing bullets and
whatnot a much appreciated addition to
the DualShock 4 it's something borrowed
from the 360 controller namely the audio
jack where you can plug in a mic
equipped headset for hidden game chat
you can also plug in any pair of
headphones for ingame audio which is a
unique feature for the DualShock for
both the Xbox one and ps4 come equipped
with a single ear microphone headset but
I really can't recommend them if you
have the choice to use something else I
use a pair of astro a 50s but some for
some reason Microsoft had decided to
drop Dolby 5.1 support at least at
launch meaning that a lot of wireless
headsets including my a 50 s don't
support multi-channel audio on the Xbox
one
thankfully the battery pack is now
integrated into the Xbox one controller
while it is a nice cosmetic improvement
for a 500 bucks device I'd kind of like
to see our charitable battery that's in
on the other hand the double-a batteries
maybe behind one of the aspects that is
unquestionably superior to that at the
dual shot form namely the battery life I
clocked in a measly nine hours of play
with the Dual Shock 4 and a whopping 35
hours with Xbox one controller so the
Xbox one definitely has the upper hand
in this regard but admittedly it's not
too much of a hassle to plug in the Dual
Shock 4 to be charged via USB every once
in a while as the ps4 will output power
via USB even while in standby mode I'm
also a self-proclaimed PC gamer so PC
support is what I really appreciate
during last generation the Xbox one
controller has no PC support at this
time but Microsoft has hinted that
support is coming at some point the
DualShock 4 is recognized as a game
controller by windows out of the box but
the problem is that the selection of
games that support it is extremely
limited there is a workaround however
the tricks your PC into thinking that
it's a 360 controller it's a bit of a
hassle to set up but with it the
DualShock 4 has unofficial PC support
and what about backwards compatibility
well the Xbox one controller does not
support the Xbox 360 Dual Shock 4 does
support the ps3 for a limited selection
of games to wrap things up when it comes
to controllers the features and specs
and all that extra nonsense is purely a
secondary in the end the male between
mind and machine is what matters how the
controller feels and how it plays and
how your instincts are transferred onto
the screen
overall Microsoft has been quite
conservative with the refinements of the
Xbox one controller it's essentially a
subtle evolution from the debatably best
controller of the last generation the
Xbox one controller is a fine piece of
hardware but I can't help but feel that
it hasn't done a big enough job to push
things forward on the other hand it
seems that Sony has listened to every
complaint about the DualShock 3 Jurgen
omics are vastly improved and for the
triggers and thumbsticks
they're simply put outstanding for all
these reasons combined and for the
simple fact that the DualShock for Julie
feels next-gen the PlayStation 4 takes a
victory in the first round
hardware design is up next and we're not
just comparing the external features
we're also going to be delving deeper
under the covers hit me up on Twitter if
you have any questions I'm happy to
answer them and stay tuned for the next
installment of the console wars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
