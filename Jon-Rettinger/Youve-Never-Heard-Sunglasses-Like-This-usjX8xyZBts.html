things that you've seen before new
variants of stuff you've seen it's a new
phone it's a new tablet it's stuff that
you generally know what you expect what
if I told you I got something brand-new
that I have literally never seen before
these are the Bose frames usually I
think about Bose you think of this this
this sunglasses might not come to the
top of your mind
but both is getting in the sunglass game
but obviously with some smart tech so
obviously there's sunglasses that you
wear but they're also bluetooth
headphones you can also make phone calls
with them you can listen to music
it's sunglasses with like a soundtrack I
know that these were shown like in super
early concept at South by Southwest but
as far as I know we're the first channel
it's actually like had these physical
retail units will be a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars these two different
versions there's an alto and a Rondo
we've got the alto version it's a Bose
box so I want to thank Bose for sending
these over and sponsoring this video but
all these impressions are hunter sent my
own and these are legit products that I
wanted to check out actually I saw
Michael Fischer's impressions on them
it's out by Southwest and kind of since
then I wanted to take a look at America
alright so here are the sunglasses
looking straight on
it looks like sunglasses on the side
that you can definitely see that there
is some battery and electronics going on
in there in the little pouch
giorgia gala and it is a magnetic
charging cable to charge your sunglasses
so it suckers on all right so the
general idea is like you to wear
sunglasses and you got to make phone
calls listen to music you don't have to
carry two things you'd have to charge
two things you just have your sunglasses
and they can do it all so that you look
like normal sunglasses but again
definite on the side you can see that
there's a little bit of a little bit of
chunk happening there for all the
electronics I should also mention this
is gonna do at some point some sort of
augmented reality type stuff so like you
can talk to me so I could look at like
an Italian restaurant I could tap the
button and it would tell me like the
hours of operation or how long the way
it is that kind of features are coming
all right so I've set these up with my
iPhone 10 and smacks and like there's
sunglasses so they got to hit a couple
things first they have to be comfortable
and then you feel comfortable on my face
I don't have like a the biggest face the
world are available in smaller large
boat sent us the large so like I
probably go for the small but it's not
uncomfortable on my face
I tried listening to music and you know
pink bows you'd expect the audio
fidelity to be good it sounds really
good I mean it almost sounds like I have
headphones on but obviously I can hear
everything around me so the one caveat
if you're wearing these indoors people
will be able to hear your conversation
or your music but if you're outdoors it
actually tends to kind of blur into the
background noise so it's nice upon pair
of sunglasses and walk around and be
able to make phone calls there's one
button which will pull up Siri or Google
assistant that works really well I would
test it outside our office is like right
by a freeway so there's a pretty nice
job even with a lot of ambient noise
being able to like hear stuff so I think
if you want just like to carry one thing
with you commute or you don't have to
worry about charging multiple devices
this is a pretty sweet setup so this is
a brand new like product category I'm
gonna use these for a while this isn't a
product you can do like first
impressions and be like here's the
definitive review of the Bose frames I
want to try them good I want to try them
for for days and weeks and see how call
quality is battery life holds up see how
audio is and get
in situations there's a lot of stuff
that I want to test and something that
you guys want to see us test let us know
in the comments down below we're gonna
do a follow-up video so totally new
pride from bos let us know again down
below what you guys think it's like the
look let me know until next time I'm
John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo
and I may be rockin out some baby sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
