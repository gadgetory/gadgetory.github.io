first couple days the MacBook Pro
recorded it a little while ago so you'll
notice that it's Pat chopped in half the
second part just picks up I haven't
learned how to use iMovie well enough to
make it a seamless transition here I
wanted to get this up for you guys tried
to answer most of the questions that you
can or most questions that I could any
way anything else you guys want to know
in always asked I'll try to get back to
you as soon as I can
it's nice to be able to help people out
and trying to buy new computers because
I used these videos for for so long
trying to buy mine
get special thanks to a guy over in
England danny is aces his name had some
great reviews on his 17-inch MacBook Pro
so thanks to him and guys enjoy here's
part one hey guys john here again thank
you for everybody for watching the first
couple videos and all the questions this
is just gonna be a quick mini review of
the macbook pro and my first two days of
it really my first two days with OS 10
altogether there's a lot to be showing
you the computer itself some of the
programs i've downloaded and some of the
cool tricks I learned the computer
behind me is the new santa rosa macbook
pro excuse me I got some notes here for
you it's a 2.4 gigahertz Intel Core 2
Duo processor with 4 megabytes of shared
level 2 cache it's got 2 gigabytes of
SDRAM it's got 160 gigabyte hard drive
15.4 inch glossy screen with a 1440 by
900 pixels the NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT
with 256 of RAM built in your eyesight
video camera the built-in super drive
and all the rest you guys know this is
the stock model it's picked up from the
store to be honest I really didn't want
to wait for it to be delivered so let's
get down to it let me show you guys the
computer ok so here is the computer
itself obviously it's sitting here
turned on first thing is the MagSafe
adapter I'm sure you've all seen it
it's just simply magnetic no plugin
requires each has a hold it right near
report is plugged in automatically so if
you walk by and knock it boom pulls out
your computer doesn't go falling down
with it
people have laughs but I've actually
tripped over a quarter not a laptop
before down so I'm very happy to have
this I have an external hard drive plug
in say 160 gigabyte Western Digital
Drive I'm actually unplug it here plug
the MagSafe I just yelled at me for
disconnecting it properly or not
properly okay so the computer itself
you've got your classic Apple logo the
real brushed aluminum look it's a real
classy look it definitely sets itself
apart from other laptops and I think
just by the way it looks the front of it
it's opened by this little latch it's
not magnetic
like the MacBooks pushing then opens up
little big deal blow right light right
there let you know that it's on there is
your super drive it hardly even see it
on the side right here you've got your
DVI port for external monitors I know
it'll support up to the 30 gigabyte or
30 gigabyte the 30 inch Apple Cinema
Display so if you're really show almost
anything Gigabit Ethernet firewire 800
firewire 400 USB port and the lock and
you clearly see how thin this I mean
it's less than an inch thick and really
not terribly heavy at all I mean I would
have no problem taking this with me on
an airplane or throwing you in the back
I mean it just weighs nothing on the
back of it here the vents notice so it
vents it's just the same with the lid
closed if you want using the clamshell
mode on the other side here there's a
Mac safe I showed you earlier USB port
audio in audio al one of them and your
Express card slot one thing to know
though there are only two USB ports on
here that's the only negative up out of
their computer two USB ports not enough
you're gonna have to buy a
USB hub or splitter I forgot what
they're called with its own power supply
I'm actually gonna be buying one of
those so back to the computer
pretty pretty standard back that this
cool little button will show you how
much better you have in it
I got a fully charged those two right
there pull up and take out the battery
and the RAM modules are below it so let
me turn it on here and show you some of
the programs that I've gone on as well
as the OS one other really cool thing
about the computer
you can't seek to this daylight now as a
backlit keyboard it's got an ambient
light and sets are built-in so on a
computer knows that you're in a dark
environment if you were to light up you
can't see it there but take my word for
it
keyboard lights up I'll show you guys
one time when it's dark out alright so
hopefully you guys can see the screen
here well enough first thing I'll show
you are kind of the simple things and
the fun things that you can play with
right off the bat first it comes with
this cool Apple remote sure you've all
seen it if you haven't it's very sleek
slim six button design and what it does
is it runs a program called front row
which I will show you right now push a
little menu button right there
loads it up and what it does is it
controls all your videos DVDs photos
music really everything so if you want
to listen to some music and far away
click it you know same thing like iTunes
shuffle songs it'll access your iTunes
library and pull anything up not gonna
get too much a detail on it if you want
to know more
being there comment I'll show you some
more but there are a million videos on
front row I'm sure you've all seen it so
that is front row so first thing I got
I'm going to show you guys here is the
screen I went with glossy I know a lot
of you who think about getting the
computer are deciding between glossy or
matte I spent a lot of time just adding
this probably more and I should have
looking at two in the store for hours
ask me people I eventually want with
glossy just because I thought it looked
better and to be honest the glare on the
new MacBook Pros I have noticed a glare
at all I've got a lamp you can't see it
but right above me here when I use it at
night with a lamp there's no glare the
colors look beautiful
I have had any eye fatigue I just think
that the glossy just looked better that
was one thing I wanted to show you guys
the second thing that I want to tell you
is I decided to get the Apple one on one
it's called it's a hundred bucks you can
go to the Apple store once a week and
you can sit and talk with the I what
they're called geniuses I guess and I
did that yesterday really only having
the computer for a day and and just that
one hour is able to learn it for a
hundred bucks it's worth it you're gonna
have somebody come to your house they
probably charge at 200 bucks or so so
you can really go through a scam all the
questions you have and I give you one of
these no no notebooks I guess to write
in any question that you guys have
definitely a worthwhile all right so now
I'll show you some of the programs that
the computer has this is the stuff that
that it came with first I'll show you my
dock it's got finder right there
dashboard what dashboard does it opens
up these little mini programs called
widgets which are very Angela
programs so here the widgets that I have
running you can download them from Apple
calm or Dashboard widgets calm and they
do all kinds of cool stuff I've got
yellow pages and Gmail I've got a
fantasy baseball email gas prices stats
on all your computer know if just kind
of cool a tell you know how much free
RAM you have that's not being used all
kinds of stuff building network
connections so I can see what networks
are locked or not
OS 10 doesn't by default tell you when
networks are a lot kind of annoying if
you want to hop on a hotspot or anything
else you might want to do so that's
dashboard I downloaded Firefox it's not
the default browser so I was used to it
from my PC real quick it looks like
regular Firefox everything else is the
same Safari is a default</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
