Ashley s cabinet area top stories first
up this week motorola on the news after
introducing my crate offering x iphone
users and easy way to transfer their
iCloud data to a shiny new Moto X during
setup of your Moto X you'll now have an
option for I have an iPhone which will
prompt you for your iCloud credentials
logging in start the transfer which
ports your contact and calendar data to
your google account pretty nifty if
you've been considering leaving apples
ecosystem for Google's I wonder if
they'll roll this out in KitKat across
all Android devices microsoft officially
released windows 8.1 today finally
giving users the option they've been
asking for since Windows 8 initial
launch the ability to skip the live
tiles and boot directly to the desktop
other updates include being smart search
up to four simultaneous apps running a
new movie moments video editing
application goodbye movie maker and pre
installed skype and SkyDrive apps it's
free for existing windows 8 customers
and 119 bucks to upgrade from previous
versions of Windows in gaming anyone
with a Wii U is probably eagerly
awaiting a new Legend of Zelda but
unfortunately it looks like we'll be
waiting a little longer to hear any news
at all Zelda series producer Eiji onuma
says he will be ready to talk about the
next installment of the franchise until
e3 of next year so eight months from now
still no word on art style timeline
control schemes or pretty much anything
else about the game so I guess we'll
just have to wait and speculate folks
hoping to get an official final fantasy
7 on their phone or tablet will probably
also be waiting while as final fantasy
producer Takashi Tokita says quote
phones will be able to
tane the space it takes it's over a
gigabyte people are probably going to
have to wait a few years unquote um
hello I have infinity blade 3 on my iPad
it's almost one and a half gigs so sir
where is my chocobo racing and where is
my materia mastering where for a
wildcard story this week android 4.4
kitkat is right around the corner and
we've assembled a list of five features
that are on our wish list what's on the
list true SMS backup and payment systems
as well as easier NFC sharing and voice
commands all made the cut maybe feeling
we'll see some of our dreams come true
when they announced and make KitKat
official but I'm actually curious as to
what you're hoping to see when KitKat
drops in the coming weeks that's the
