technolo flow and today I have a new
tutorial for all of you I'm gonna show
you how to install CyanogenMod 10.1 on
the galaxy note 2 okay so before we
begin I just wanted to mention that this
is a routing video so this will void
your warranty so please do this at your
own risk
I'm just showing you how to do it and
these files might not work for you you
have to make sure that this is the N 70
100 version of the galaxy note 2 I'm
going to go into here go down to about
device and show you right there the GTN
70 100 this is the non LTE version of
the galaxy note 2 so just make sure you
have that device before you begin or
else this will not work alright to start
off we're gonna get this thing rooted so
you want to go after you download all
three of my files I have them all in the
description for this video as well as on
the link on TechnoBuffalo you go to the
CF autoroute thing right here go down to
this download down here and click this
it'll download the zip file and then
these other ones are the CyanogenMod the
G apps that you need as well as the open
recovery for twerk so I have to get all
four of those files downloaded I like to
put them all into one folder just so I
can keep it all together you want to go
click on the CF autoroute right click on
that and click on extract and I like to
extract it to its own folder so I'm
gonna click on that and now you get the
CF Auto root folder right here double
click on that and you have odin odin ini
and the CF autoroute dot ta r dot md5
file you want you want to make sure
that's the exact file and make sure that
this is the N 7100 version you can get
this for the other versions if you have
a different version of the galaxy note 2
but this is for the N 7100 version of it
so you want to right click on add any XE
click on run as an administrator it's
then going to open up a window just like
this so you want to make sure that a
yellow box shows up right there now you
want to put your device into download
mode now to do that you want to hold in
the power button power it off and then
once it powers off you want to hold in
the down volume button the home button
as well as the power button and then one
said boots back up you should see a
screen let me turn this off really quick
just like that and then when it boots up
you will see this screen and then you
want to hit up on the volume button to
then put it into download mode and
you'll see this as downloading do not
turn off target so you just put that
down for now and then you want to go
back to your computer you might see two
yellow boxes here what I like to do is
just read go back into Odin it'll only
show up as one just so you know that
that's the right one you want to click
on PDA and then search for that folder
that you created earlier I have routing
galaxy note 2 or I have all my other
files click on the CF autoroute folder
and then click on the dot ta our md5
file right here the auto route and then
click open now all you have to do is hit
start and then this will actually route
the galaxy note 2 so I'm going to hit
start and it'll start saying a bunch of
stuff in the message box as well as
you'll see a blue bar go across and then
you'll see that it starts to root and
then once you get a green Paz box on the
Odin that means that it worked perfectly
fine and then your device will start to
do this you'll see a little red android
guy in there and it'll start flashing
all the files for the route and then
once this is done it'll reboot and go
back to your home screen so there we go
it's rebooting now we go back to your
home screen and it won't be anything
different but you will have a program
called supersu installed and that means
that it is rooted and that's just what
you need to get signage Ahmad on to the
galaxy note 2 there we go it says
Android is upgrading and now we should
just boot right back into the home
screen there we go
you want to slide to unlock and now just
check really quick that you are actually
rooted by going into apps and then
scrolling over until you see that little
Superman like icon this is super su you
can click on it and make sure it loads
fine as well as you know it'll probably
pop up and say do you want to follow me
on Twitter for the developer you can
just say no thanks alright now that
you're back at the home screen you want
to go to your my computer file open this
up make sure that you can see your
device if you can't it's no big deal
just unplug in the USB cable that you
have right here and plug it back in that
way it'll recognize it on your computer
double click on this and then double
click on the storage and then you want
to create a folder called roms I like to
call it roms just because it's easy to
remember just call it roms and I put
this to the side open up your file that
you had the
downloaded all the files from before you
want to then drag and drop the CM the
CyanogenMod 10.1 whatever version you
have this is the nightly version that I
have they upload these almost every
night
they update these see this was the last
one was updated today I'm just using an
older one but you guys can use whatever
one you want so drag the CM 10.1 nightly
file and the G apps file over and put
them right into your roms folder folder
that you created on the phone and this
will just copy it right over put your
device back into download mode I'm gonna
scroll across here close this hit power
off okay and then you want to remember
to hold down the volume button home
button and power button this will then
reboot the phone and hopefully you get
right there do you get this message then
you hit up on the volume button and you
go back into download mode now you want
to re open up odin once again smooth it
up a little bit so you guys can see you
want to re open up odin really quick all
right here hit run as administrator now
you want to make sure you have that
yellow box again hit PDA go to that file
or the folder that you have all your
stuff in open recovery tour if you want
this one the dot ta r file you want that
hit open and then hit start and this
will install twrp which is the team
wayne recovery project which is the
custom GUI interface that will let you
you know touch buttons and that kind of
stuff it's a lot better than using
clockwork recovery in my opinion it you
can it just looks better and you can do
a lot more stuff with it so once this
reboots you will then see that you will
be on go back right to your home screen
you won't have anything different and
now the way that you actually get into
the twerp is you just reboot this once
again so hit restart or you can just
power off no big deal hit okay
now you want to hold volume up and the
home button not volume down you want to
hold volume up the home button and then
make sure it reboots and then as long as
you're holding the volume up and the
home button it should boot right into
TWRP there you go you see team win and
then this will pop up these are the
custom GUI interface that I was talking
about before
so now
this is really good that means that
everything is working properly anywhere
Rudin you have everything ready to go so
now you're gonna hit wipe go to advance
wipe hit dalvik cache and cache and then
hit slide away this will just get rid of
all the junk files that are on your
device and make sure that everything is
working properly hit back hit back again
one more time and then you want to go up
to install and then find the folder that
you created earlier so there's my roms
folder right there now if you're not in
the SD card folder and you're all the
way back at root all you have to do is
scroll down find SD card right there and
then scroll down again and find roms or
whatever you name the file before it's
gonna click on that you should see the
signage 'mad and the G apps file right
there I'm gonna click on that and then
just slide the custom flash there slide
to confirm the flash and this will
actually install CyanogenMod right on
your device now CyanogenMod does not
come with the google app so it doesn't
have the Google Play Store or anything
like that that's why we had to download
the G apps file now we'll actually
install Google Play and all the other
Google stuff that comes with the galaxy
note 2 so once this finishes installing
it takes a little bit not too long
though there it goes
you're gonna hit back on this and then
you're gonna click on G apps and then
install this so this will install again
the Google Play Store and everything
like that this is actually really quick
because it's a pretty small file so once
this finishes you're good now you can
hit wipe again right there and this will
wipe the cache and the dalvik cache
again really quick
now what I like to do is I like to go
all the way back and hit wipe again but
this time I'm going to hit slide it to
factory reset this will reset it to the
factory defaults of the CyanogenMod this
will not erase everything that you just
did this will just make sure
everything's working properly so I'm
going to slide to factory reset let that
finish it's really quick it back hit
back again and now all I have to do is
hit reboot and then click on system and
now if everything works properly this
should boot with the CyanogenMod logo
and we'll see right here so there we go
you can see that it has the CyanogenMod
boot logo right there and it's just
going to go through the animation stages
this might take a little while if it
ends up taking like more than 5
it's all you have to do is boot back
into torque and then do another factory
reset that just seems to clear it up for
me but I'm gonna let this sit let this
finish and I'll show you what it looks
like once it boots up all right there we
go here's the boot screen I'm just gonna
go through this really quick and here we
go here is CyanogenMod 10.1 show you
guys really quick and here go to about
phone scroll down you have 4.2.2 Android
so all the way down to the bottom you
can also see the unite we build that you
have installed right there a 10.1 a
really nice thing about CyanogenMod is
that it does actually have over-the-air
updates now so you click on sign in
Jamaat updates and it'll actually search
for over-the-air versions that you
haven't installed yet and it'll find the
ones that are ready to go I don't think
I have Wi-Fi and all the stuff on but
you can actually install the
over-the-air updates that way so it's a
really nice feature that they have put
into 10.1 I think it was in an older
version as well but this is great so
this actually works everything
everything works fine data works fine
texting works fine again just let me
know if you guys have any questions down
in the comments below I'll probably be
responding as robo 13 so look out for
that account just in case you guys have
