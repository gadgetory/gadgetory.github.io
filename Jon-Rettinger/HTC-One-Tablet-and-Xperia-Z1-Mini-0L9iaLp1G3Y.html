to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of rumor
roundup I'm rios John Ranger this is the
show where we take all the tech rumors
in this week there were absolute ton we
picked the four most important and share
them with you so even have to follow
every single story you get one watch one
video know what's going on in the tech
world of this week rumors of an HTC
tablets twitter for android tablets
might be getting legit apple TV might be
getting a brand-new fresh software
upgrade and the xperia z1 mini looks to
be a thing this rumor roundup let's go
ahead and start rounding them up
according to a mysterious image they've
done China's Weibo HTC is poised to
unveil a tablet it looks to be in the
seven ish range that essentially just
looks like an HTC one that just went
super fat the first to design she see
one looked really good sign HTC one mini
looks really good presumably it's gonna
look pretty good on HTC One max but on a
7-inch tablet it looks like it might be
too much of a good thing it's got a
weird aspect ratio it's 4 x 32 don't see
in really many tablets anymore say for
the ipad and sort of the metal on the
sides just looks a little bit weird on
the tablet format and they got the
boomsound speakers presumably will make
their way and I've doubt it's gonna be a
pretty kick-ass tablet but it just
looked weird from the picture but I've
got an open mind perhaps HTC will blow
me away they usually do with their
devices the build quad is usually
awesome so I'd expect the same thing
from this as of yet unannounced unnamed
in just rumored tablet and if you were
thinking about picking up one of those
unannounced android tablets if you were
to pick it up today if it existed you
would find a native twitter app that
looked really bad essentially it's the
same twitter up on the phones just blown
up it looks like android tablets are
finally getting a full version of
twitter so according to android next
they were just browsing around the IFA
show floor seeing what was there and
happened to come across a samsung galaxy
note running a brand-new version of
twitter and it wasn't just the twitter
app that we've got on smartphones or
just looks giant it was totally designed
for android tablets complete with some
of the features i really want
including landscape support columns and
way way more it seems weird to say that
it's finally coming to android tablets
Android tablets are a thing they're a
popular thing I don't know why Twitter
was like nope we're just going to drag
our feet use the phone app but just
scale it up so hopefully it's coming
very very soon no idea why someone let
it on the show floor at IFA but if you
look carefully at these trade shows
oftentimes you can find unreleased
operating systems and new applications
just sitting there out in the open
people forgot to wipe out so if you're
going to CES that's a bit of advice make
you're the first one to find the new
scoop one of my favorite devices at my
home is my apple TV and it looks like
it's going to be getting a brand-new
fresh coat of paint All Things D says
that the brand new software update is
going to include a new airplay feature
it's going to allow you to stream your
purchased content on someone else's
television which is kind of cool almost
like a chromecast reportedly be able to
tell Apple TV to pull down a movie TV
show or music from the cloud instead of
just streaming it directly from your
iDevice so I imagine though this is
totally purely speculation that was also
going to read you the icon to make him
look flatter an iOS 7 ish I would also
imagine that this new updates probably
only going to work with the newer
generation Apple TV is the one with the
updated chips that can show 1080p video
I love my apple TV ability I do that
would be great as opposed to just
screaming from your one device obviously
you can stream from the cloud without
bringing a device with it I've been
going to do it on someone else's TV
could be kind of cool and make the apple
TV chromecast ish if this rumor is true
it's like we'll see the new update hit
the same day as iOS 7 which is September
18th the minis phones are now a really
popular thing you got the s4 minute HTC
One mini and Sony one to get in on that
game a new leak that came out last
Tuesday points to a smaller xperia z1
and we saw it next to a full-size
smartphone according to the folks
android central aspects you can actually
main pretty similar to what the z1 is it
all for that ginormous 20.7 megapixel
camera the pretty same powerful beasts
win overall awesome Snapdragon 800
processor the biggest trade off because
it's got to be something is going to be
storage does he won mini supposedly go
and offer just 8 gigabytes of storage
out of the box it's also going to be
smaller 4.3 inch screen that's going to
ditch 1080p resolution only bring
720p to the table but you're also coming
a lower price so did you which
originally leap the Xperia z1 mini
suggest we might have to wait though
until january 2014 to finally see this
phone which i say push off it exists I
say we will see it before the holiday
season when every phone kind of comes
out let me take a minute to thank our
