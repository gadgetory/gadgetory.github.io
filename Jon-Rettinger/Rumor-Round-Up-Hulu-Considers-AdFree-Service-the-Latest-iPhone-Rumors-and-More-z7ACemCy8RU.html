to you by carbonite is hulu going ad
free is Google's reborn Google TV just
around the corner and are a slew of hot
smartphone set to heat up the summer
it's techno Buffalo's rumor roundup
hey what's going on everybody I'm Noah
Kravitz editor-at-large for
technobuffalo and this is the rumor
roundup for today Friday August fifth
2011 first off a tweet yeah it's always
tweets cousin these rumors a tweet from
the official hulu support account has
people wondering if the online TV
service is gearing up to launch another
pricing plan this one without at now if
you remember from a couple episodes ago
who's on the sale block right now
everybody from Apple to I don't know
Netflix Microsoft lots of people's names
lots of companies names are being
bandied about as potential buyers for
the company but so far nobody has
stepped up and paid the price in the
meantime hulu support has been busy on
Twitter answering customer questions and
complaints about all those ads that show
up in TV shows that they're already
paying seven ninety-nine a month for on
hulu plus well one of the responses let
people know that hulu is apparently
considering a new pricing tier that
would be ad free now it was just a
couple months ago that hulu knocked the
price of hulu plus down from ten bucks a
month to seven ninety-nine so maybe
they'll reinstitute the 999 a month plan
but have it be totally ad-free which i
personally would like i can't stand
especially because the online ads it's
not just to lube but adds an online TV
oftentimes you'll see the same ad every
time those bad enough that especially if
you're paying for the content there's no
way to skip the ad but if i have to see
the same i can't believe it's not butter
at or whatever at it is no offense to i
can't believe it's not butter over and
over again during an old episode of the
OC i just can't stand it anyway this
also comes just days after Fox announced
that they're going to be instituting a
paywall to ensure that only verified
cable subscribers get next day access to
Fox shows online everybody else is gonna
have to wait a few additional days so
interesting to see what who does now
they're still up for sale but they might
be considering a more expensive ad free
subscription plan speaking of TV google
TV 20 was shown off at Google i/o a
couple months ago in San Francisco I was
there and I got a little bit of a
preview of the next generation of Google
TV based on Android 3x at this point
based on Android 3 honeycomb and
everything else going off the Android
platform moving towards Ice Cream
Sandwich where tablets and phones and
Google TV set-top boxes can all live in
a land of happy happy apps that work on
many devices not just one at any rate
the original Google TV not exactly a
smashing success it may have cost
logitech CEO is job you can read more
about that on technobuffalo but the next
version of Google TV looks much better
there is a leak earlier this week or not
really Ali quetta video of somebody who
shoehorn a beta version of honeycomb
onto the current google TV box and
apparently hardware manufacturers
including sony and logitech are ramping
up to unveil new hardware to go with
google TV 20 now the next version of the
software itself will be compatible with
existing boxes so if you've got a
logitech revue or you've got one of
those sony internet TV is powered by
google you'll be able to update your
software to run the new platform and a
little birdie told me that while the new
hardware is still a little ways away
probably in time for this year's holiday
shopping season the new software is
getting pretty close to roll out so you
might want to look into one of those $99
logitech revue boxes the prices were
just slashed if you're interested in
being one of the first on the block to
try out the brand new version of google
TV and of course what would a rumor
roundup show be without a slew of mobile
phone rumors first off a document
uncovered earlier this week apparently
leaked from an internal verizon memo
regarding minimum advertised prices has
four phones on high notice for launch in
the very very near future first up is
the HTC vigor which looks to be HTC if
not verizon's flagship android phone for
the rest of the year this one's going to
have a 1.5 gigahertz qualcomm snapdragon
dual-core processor their new line of
dual-core processors with the audrina
220 graphics processing units inside of
them and it also might have a full HD
display 1280 by 720 on a smartphone also
the document in question was a second
HTC device which is probably just a
color refresh to the incredible 2
although it does look pretty sharp and
white and silver a new LG device which
might be an updated version of the
revolution which is an lte-enabled
android smartphone on verizon that was
launched earlier in the year but does
not have a dual-core processor and then
last but certainly not least is the
fabled the mythical the oh where oh
where are you droid bionic from motorola
this phone was launched way back one at
CES january it had everybody all excited
it just looked flat out fantastic and
then i went away and what happened to it
and apparently it's gotten a refresh
from the inside out beefed up specs a
redesign case all sorts of stuff i guess
there were problems with testing with
the verizon LTE network who knows what
exactly exactly happened but it showed
up on this recent document there's some
specs kicking around one nice thing is
that it's apparently going to launch
with android 23 up for Gingerbread on
board instead of two dot to froyo which
if you know what that means you know why
you're excited and also now there's a
twitter account using the model number
of the bionic that's between cryptic
messages probably written by some PR and
marketing people talking about the
launch being imminent so stay tuned for
that but it looks like for hot new
verizon smartphones or three hot new
phones in one refresh color of a hot
phone send me out phone coming in the
near term you know computer disasters
eventually happen to everyone your
computer can crash you could get
infected with a virus you might drop it
it might get stolen it might burn up in
a fire you never know what's going to
happen in this world but if you get

computer disaster then there's no need

with your purchase also in mobile phone
land the packs the motorola packs for
sprint has been leaked recently and this
looks to be a dual core version of the
motorola expert smartphone which is a
candy bar phone with a keyboard on the
front kind of an android for BlackBerry
users and then of course iphone rumor
time the latest has iphone 5 possibly
being a much bigger deal than we
expected which means it would be as big
a deal as we originally expected before
our expectations were lowered possibly
not launching until october instead of
September as everybody's been saying but
also apparently rumored to be already in
certain carriers hands for testing but
clad not only in a dummy body but also
in some kind of sealed briefcase that
only certain people have the code or the
lock or the fingerprint rubber it is to
open up so who knows but if in fact the
phone is out for testing it could mean
that a launch is just a couple weeks
away or it could mean that in the wake
of the iphone 4 antennagate fiasco Apple
saw fit to push iphone 5 out to carriers
for testing a little bit further ahead
of time you know that's the problem with
these rumors shows it's all rumor we can
make it up I might have an iphone 5 in
my pocket but I probably don't alright
