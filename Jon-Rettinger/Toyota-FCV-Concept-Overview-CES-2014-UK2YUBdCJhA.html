TechnoBuffalo here I am standing in
front of Toyota's latest this is the fcv
concept but either stands for fun candy
vehicle or fuel cell vehicle which means
this guy is powered totally by hydrogen
let's go and take a first look so this
gorgeous futuristic car will be hitting
roads in California in some production
forms sometime in 2015 so it's a fuel
cell car it's an alternative fuel
meeting it's powered by hydrogen so
essentially what that means is you can
fuel the car with hydrogen in about
three minutes get a range of about 300
miles and what the fuel cells are gonna
do using a combination of science and
what seems like magic it takes that
hydrogen goes through the fuel cells
converts it to electricity this is
essentially an electric car that you
don't have to plug in you can feel like
a traditional gasoline car just with
hydrogen and you can drive just like you
could any you know petrol powered car so
you get that fun and that speed and the
performance of an electric vehicle with
the convenience of gasoline it's kind of
a perfect marriage California has said
they're gonna be pumping millions of
dollars to hide it infrastructure and if
you're worried about how hydrogen might
be affected in super hot or super cold
climates they use a test mule to test
this thing in the freezing Tundras of
Canada and the really really hot desert
it's mostly erupted all our performance
we're gonna get all the benefits of an
electric car that instant torque and the
range of a gas powered car again
combined that convenience of just really
refueling in a few minutes and going on
your way it's a gorgeous car to see it's
a combination of LCDs and beautiful
lines the other takes cues from their
Lexus division Toyota division kind of a
culmination unearthing gorgeous that
Toyota is working on can't wait to see
this guy on the roads in some form I in
2015 so what'd you guys think of the FCV
could it be the next car in your garage
finished of all the channel for a while
you know I love alternative fuel
vehicles and I think fuel cells really
could be the future of what comes next
so I love to see Toyota really pushing
it into doing an awesome job so it's for
this guy on the road again sometime in
2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
