technobuffalo here we are at the
precipice mostly I just wanted to use
that word of the galaxy note5 coming
sometime in the next probably three
months and leaks already coming fast and
plenty so I thought I'd be fun tell you
the top five things you can expect from
the galaxy note5 is you decide whether
not you want to upgrade or just wait for
this device to hit the market let's go
ahead and jump right in coming in at
number five drumroll a ridiculously
gorgeous display the Galaxy Note family
of phones is kind of always showing off
the latest and greatest from Samsung
last year we got the quad HD display
that eventually trickle down to the
galaxy s6 this year rumors have gone but
way back and forth point either Ultra HD
display quad HD display and samsung may
have settled on the ladder quench report
from Sam mobile if so we hope the
advancements been made to the panel also
trickled down to battery life either way
though I don't think can be as a point
if the screen is going to look but I
mean how much sharper how much sharper
do we need to just just a lot of pixels
in in that screen number this this many
a new S Pen Samsung typically upgrades S
Pen each year in addition to the task
that one can perform with the S Pen that
you could before Elite cases are
suggesting the galaxy note 5 will ship
with a brand spankin new S Pen that can
get this auto reject itself like like a
I was going to make a bad joke I'm not
going to do it it can auto eject itself
perhaps with a specific software or
maybe through voice command or more
likely to split a little lever that you
push I think you can expect from that
expect increase handwriting accuracy
that's usually the case each and every
year I'm probably like 85 to 95 thousand
new features of which you'll probably
just use three of them number three I
did this in case you didn't know is gear
VR support at a samsung galaxy note 4
ushered in Samsung's entrance it's a
virtual reality with the gear VR and
objectively I've tried it and its beauty
awesome I'm found much like practical
use for it oh then it's like look around
and be like wow watching a movie on
moon that's trippy but it does work it
works well you put headphones on and
it's really immersive we finally got a
new gear vr galaxy s6 and s6 edge I
would assume that we're going to have a
new one with the galaxy note5 perhaps
instead of making new versions for each
phone but does make one that can expand
the contract somehow either way expect
new virtual reality options especially
if the screen bumps up in resolution
number 2 the 3 b's a big bad beastly
processor rumor has it Samsung's going
to stuff it's just ridiculously powerful
processors galaxy note 5 and that means
a step up from the already badass XE no
7420 in the galaxy s6 which is already
just super impressive in its own right
but it was the first time we saw a shift
away from qualcomm chips in u.s. phones
and i expect that to continue so
according to Sam mobile the note 5 is
going to pack a brand new Exynos 7420 to
which is a not sexy name for a very sexy
chip that's going to cram GPU ram and
LTE modem all to a single system on a
chip use of a single solution should
also hopefully improve battery life
talking about that screen earlier
performance beyond we see already at the
galaxy s6 and the number one thing you
can expect with the galaxy note 5 this
USBC to to be the pork and may be
expecting is the wrong word i should
probably say i'm i'm hopeful that we're
going to see it that'll enable even
faster quick charging but probably more
importantly should also bring we faster
data transfers between whatever computer
system you're using and your smartphone
so that means you have to wait just wait
tap your wrist i'll wait four gigabytes
of music and photos to load onto your
device it's also reversible which is
nice you have to sort of be like oh is
this way up is that way up or if you're
just in the dark you can just just plug
it in and be good to go so those are the
top five things that you can expect from
the galaxy note 5 or any of them killer
features i think you absolutely has to
have and worth waiting i like to hear
from you dear friend about what you want
the galaxy note 5 to have do you want to

but also list the top
5 the next time John Ranger from
