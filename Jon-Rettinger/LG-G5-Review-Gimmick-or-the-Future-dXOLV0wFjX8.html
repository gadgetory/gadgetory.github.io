TechnoBuffalo and today I have for you
the review of the LG g5 now this has
been a very highly anticipated phone and
I want to cover a couple things that I
didn't cover in our hands-on at Mobile
World Congress so if the information
you're looking for isn't in this video
click on the links above or below let's
start out by addressing some of the
comments we saw in our hands-on video a
lot of you said that you thought the
phone was ugly now I don't completely
agree but I definitely don't think it's
the prettiest phone on the market I
think that award as of now goes to the
s7 edge where the g5 does knock it out
of the park is the feel the design as
you can see is a little more grounded
the edges are curved and it feels really
nice in the hands the power button which
was previously on the back remains there
but now doubles as a fingerprint reader
it is also one of the fastest
fingerprint readers I have used to date
it was so fast in fact when I first set
it up I wasn't even sure if the phone
was locking was opening that quickly the
only place you bring that build quality
into question is at the bottom chin
where the modules come often on so
there's a little bit of a panel gap
right there but I don't even know if
you're allowed to complain about that
since you are getting different modules
and has all she calls them friends and
unfortunately we did not get those from
LG for this review so I remained
friendless my review of this phone is
really as a standalone device but even
without the modules you can still swap
out the battery which a lot of people
were really excited about but to be
honest in my uses I didn't really ever
do that combined with fast charging in
the very very good battery life on the
g5 already it's not really necessary in
terms of display you're looking at a
2560 by 1440 5.3 inch display and it
looks really good
and what about camera camera camera or
cameras in this case there's two on the
back one regular and one ultra wide the
primary rear facing camera is a 16
megapixel shooter and it looks really
good from a distance photos look very
detailed very sharp when you zoom in you
do notice a little bit of macro blocking
in the shadows but nothing you really
can't get over not the greatest camera
on the market but what really sells this
phone for me is that secondary 8
megapixel shooter with the ultra wide
length I'm a huge fan of the aesthetic
obviously less resolution with the main
shooter but it's totally worth it and
being able to shoot 4k video on that
ultra wide lens really sealed the deal
for me where my Kobe beef comes in with
this phone is the app drawer or
lack of an aperture I do not like LG's
skin now this is a easily fixable
problem because you can just put a
launcher on top but I don't really
understand why they removed the app
doors I guess they thought it was
cleaner but really ends up happening is
you end up with a ton of app clutter you
can go into the settings and pull up the
app drawer but it's just sort of shoves
it in the corner of the screen so it's
like floating and it looks disgusting
again
not great performance on the g5 with the
Snapdragon 820 was flawless buttery and
smooth and so the biggest thing here
clearly for LG are the modules I think
it's a great idea I think they've gone
down this route of creating and
innovating and trying to do something
new the vision is to have one phone that
sort of swaps its purposes with the
swapping of that bottom chin however I
think a couple things that are holding
them back are number one
swapping the modules out isn't a very
quick and efficient process unless you
have monstrous nails for that little
button that ejects the chin and the
bigger issue is that there aren't that
many modules LG has made a couple and
they're trying to get more third-party
manufacturers to get involved but the
success is completely reliant on what
other modules come out right now it's a
bit like having an app store with only
first party apps in there you need more
to mix it up and make it worth it so I
do give this one a Buy I really like it
do I think it's set out to achieve
exactly what LG wanted I'm not so sure
about that unless their goal was really
just to get their feet in the modular
world and see how the public responds
and so you guys are the public let me
know what you think in the comments
