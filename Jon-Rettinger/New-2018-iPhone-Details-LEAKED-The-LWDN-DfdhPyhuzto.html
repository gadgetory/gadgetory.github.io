everybody I am Robert Rosenfeld and
welcome back to the lowdown this is the
show that breaks down the top stories
the chat world and gives you guys the
info that you really need to know today
we're learning more about the specifics
on those three new iPhone models
launching soon also for tonight is
slowly rolling out to many Android
devices though there are some hoops that
you're gonna have to jump through to get
things all up and running I'll tell you
about that and when they finally be
getting a new budget Apple laptop this
fall to replace that really old MacBook
Air let me break this all down let's
talk about all these rumors here's the
lowdown
like I just mentioned we're learning
more about that trio of new iPhone
models launching this fall and it looks
like Apple may finally be moving closer
to building an iPhone that officially
supports a stylus as one of its new
flagship features we're hearing reports
that the newer premium models of the
iPhone and maybe even that budget model
will have Apple pencil support similar
to the newly refreshed iPad in the older
iPad pro models reports are also
indicating that Apple's lower end iPhone
model would come with a starting price
tag between $6.99 to 749 and even that
updated iPhone 10 maybe a hundred ollars
cheaper this time around in the current
model available at 899 instead of the
starting price tag of $9.99 that we have
now but that's just the beginning we're
also hearing rumors that a 512 gigabytes
storage option is available for the
higher-end iPhone models no pin point on
price just yet but I'm sure a next-gen
iPhone 10 plus with 512 gigs of storage
is gonna cost a pretty penny though many
users will definitely appreciate that
extra local storage space Apple is
ramping up production on all 3d iphone
models right now and we could see an
announcement coming in just a matter of
weeks we're hearing right now maybe the
week of the 14th in September may be the
time we see these new iPhones for
tonight is slowly making its way from
Samsung devices to a wide range of
Android phones and tablets there's some
work you're gonna need to do to get
things up and going the cross-platform
battle royale game is available on many
Android devices though you're going to
want to double check epics website to
make sure your device is compatible and
because Epic Games is bypassing the Play
Store for their own installer it's a bit
tricky to get the game up and running
you can currently sign up for the
fortnight Android beta waiting list on
epics website and you can log in with
the account you're currently using to
play for a night or create a new one and
after a few days of waiting you should
receive an official invite that you can
use to register and download the four
night installer onto your device and
you'll be ready to go and play though
you'll need to keep that installer on
your device because that's the way the
game is going to stay up to date users
have begun getting their invites so it
looks like the beta is beginning to roll
out to more and more users on more and
more devices though you may still need
to wait a few days and things are of
course a bit easier if you own a Samsung
device just head to the game launcher
and search fortnight and you can start
playing right
and Apple may be working on a low-cost
laptop that would finally replace that
aging MacBook Air insiders and rumors
have been reporting for months that
Apple is working on a lower-cost
entry-level machine that would abuse
some time this fall and those rumors
have picked up again after a little bit
of a lull we don't know a whole lot
about this machine right now not a lot
of specs not even initial starting price
point but honestly almost anything would
be better than the current barrier to
entry of Apple laptops right now the
lower end MacBook Air that's honestly
largely been unchanged since it was
released 10 years ago we can speculate
that it'll probably have a lower end but
much newer Intel processor a Retina
display and maybe even a refresh look to
more mere the design of the MacBook and
the MacBook Pro and speaking of the
MacBook it was long rumored that it
would become the replacement to the
MacBook Air dropping in price point to
be Apple's newest entry-level machine
but that has not seemed to happen yet in
the past few years and the MacBook still
sits at a relatively expensive starting
price tag of $12.99 we may see this new
budget Apple laptop launch sometime this
fall and I want to ask you guys these
series of questions what would you guys
like to see I'm really curious what kind
of design what kind of screen size port
specs and of course remember that this
is Apple's idea of lower end and Apple's
definition of budgets so what do you
guys think a realistic starting price
point would see and would you pay it
leave a comment down below and let us
know and better yet send us a video
message on Twitter or Instagram for a
chance to be featured on the next
episode of the lowdown and on the last
episode of lowdown we talked all about
the new products from Samsung unpacked
and without getting in between the note
9 wars or the comments down below I
liked what DIC VIII had to say he said
this a Bigsby speaker an incredible
amount of foot spa on the part of
Samsung introducing a speaker based on a
software feature that few Samsung owners
care about other than how it can be
disabled Bigsby may not be very loved by
many users out there and rightfully so
but I do have to give Samsung credit for
at least building something to take on
Apple Amazon and Google more products
from these companies means more
competition and no matter your smart
assistant of choice more products and
more competition ultimately lead to
better products for everybody that is
your lowdown for today everybody thank
