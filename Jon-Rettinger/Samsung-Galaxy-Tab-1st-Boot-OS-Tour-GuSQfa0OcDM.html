TechnoBuffalo here in boxing's are all
fine and good but what you want to see
it I know I want to see is how Android
looks on a tablet let's go ahead and
power on the Galaxy Tab and take the
first look it's all through a very
thorough walkthrough the operating
system once I have some chance to play
with it and sort of get to know the
nuances but for right now let's just
power this guy on so it is running
Android 2.2
there's the power button on the side
let's go ahead and see if we have any
juice and it looks like we do go ahead
and peel off the screen protector here
from Galaxy Tab and as that's sort of
booting up I'll review the specs advice
in case you haven't seen it it does have
a 7 inch screen resolution of 1024 by
600 again Android 2.2 running Samsung's
1 gigahertz AAA cortex chip you might
have heard that called a hummingbird 512
megabytes of RAM 3 min because a camera
on the back with autofocus and flash 1.3
megapixel camera on the front and this
will does have actually full flash
support so this looks very familiar
Android style and go ahead and slide to
unlock and looks like stock Android just
larger going to scroll through here
looks sort of ripe for a for a launcher
you've got some sort of dedicated
Samsung things here so you've got a
dedicated daily briefings widget this is
not running a TouchWiz I can see right
there this is the sort of the GSM
version there is not a SIM card in there
so this is just running on Wi-Fi so
we'll be watch that connect to it let's
go and see what sort of widgets they put
on here we do have one two three four
five home screens by default let's see
what Samsung put on here let's go and
jump into widgets and here's what we're
gonna have so a key weather clock analog
clock calendar calendar clock daily
briefing feeds and updates Google search
home screen tips latitude market news
and weather picture frame that you guys
read the rest is power control program
monitor Yahoo Finance and YouTube what
I'm really curious about here is how
flash is going to work on a device
well they're not flashed 10.1 is going
to be a bit slow we're not slow so I'm
gonna go ahead and connect this guy to
my Wi-Fi network and let's check out how
flash works all right so a few points of
notice before I go and hook this up to
Wi-Fi and show you flash and you go the
applications you actually do have sort
of a TouchWiz looking away that the
icons are showing here they're serving
caps lived on their own you go ahead you
can sort of scroll through horizontally
to see those of course it does have an
accelerometer looks to be extremely
responsive as I rotate it it's very
quick actually one of the faster
rotating times that I've seen them the
Android device and personally enough it
comes shift and sort of already loaded
on here within active applications
widget to sort of lets you manage your
programs all right so now let's go ahead
up this thing up to Wi-Fi and see how
flash works all right so we are hooked
up to Wi-Fi I went to my youtube channel
youtube.com slash John for Lakers you
can see that flash is actually really
smooth here that video is playing really
well go ahead and let it play for a
second this is really the first time I
was seeing flash on a mobile device he's
playing a YouTube video that isn't jumpy
that just works very smoothly so I hats
off to Samsung go ahead and double tap
to zoom in and out and does work it's
actually working out pretty decently so
I know the big question everybody wants
to see at least I wanted to see where
two things keyboard and Hulu so I'll
show you both of those real quickly so
first let me go ahead and tap the
address bar here this is the keyboard
looks very iPhone ish and of course when
you rotate it you go ahead and get a
landscape version and I'll be doing a
sort of full thorough walkthrough on
what this is gonna look like in a
keyboard and such but to take a real
quick look at Hulu since I'm curious to
the plays I assume that you guys are as
well let's go ahead and delete all this
and let's try Gullu and see if this
works we have not really seen Hulu
working on any sort of a phone let's go
ahead and watch your favorite anytime
and see if this see this works we'll
figure it out together live on video at
least live for me you're watching this
at another time
browser is very snappy here
on the Galaxy Tab it's sort of typical
Android it works well pinch-to-zoom
worked very well as well so hello we
noticed that you are trying to access
it's currently not available working
hard to support it to continue to browse
alright so this that probably take care
of that question let's go ahead and see
if it will let us play anything so
here's a clip from or whatever's loading
here Hulu weaned let's go ahead to get
that will let us play although it does
not look promising
so it does look like a no dice here for
Hulu playing the content didn't start
let's just double check and try clicking
one other video to see if we get
something to come up here
of course again I'll be doing a full a
sort of overview of the OS showing you
how the browser worked in sharing the
nuances of it this is just a first look
in the first power on I was really
excited to see what it looked like I
thought maybe you guys might be as well
well I should looks like content is
loading here let's see if it plays still
loading we may actually have full who
support here on the Galaxy Tab get the
setting control just popped up on the
right still loading no oh such a tease
video is currently unavailable we
apologize for inconvenience so there is
no Hulu support here unfortunately and
it does let you know again that you've
got one application running so if a that
you guys want to see you in particularly
leave the comments down below so just a
our first look to be a plenty of a
Galaxy Tab coverage coming up including
a vs with the iPad I'm John Revengers
and TechnoBuffalo I'll see you in the
next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
