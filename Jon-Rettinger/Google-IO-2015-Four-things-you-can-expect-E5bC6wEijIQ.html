brought to you by domain.com what's up
everyone John render from TechnoBuffalo
here are you sick of all the apple news
you sick of Apple watch video after
Apple watch video you friend I got
something for your Android love and soul
I am leaving in just a few short weeks
to go to Google i/o attritional e we see
ton of new stuff happens I figured let
me give you the top four things I expect
from google i/o not listed on here is
between a butt ton and an ass ton of AP
is for everything that's usually what
like ninety percent of the keynote is
about ten percent is kind of the sexy
fun stuff and that's really want to talk
about so number one no particular order
Android M Android marshmallow Android
marmalade who knows but here's what I
expect it to have but again addition to
just a ton of AP is interactive
notifications a notifications got way
better in lollipop but you don't
interact with them replied to a Twitter
notification for example right from a
lock screen I think we're going to see
built and before everybody yells at me
that routing you can route custom rom
custom wrong I know that here's what I
can expect from Android or for Google to
release on stock Android way more google
now integration this is where the api's
i think are actually really cool
allowing third parties to access google
now i'm a huge huge google now user i
use it on iOS use it on android and it's
incredibly useful but letting more
third-party application take advantage
of it i think we'll take it to the
proverbial next level so smart gesture
is the next thing i think it's going to
start taking things from the skins that
we've seen so perhaps from LG double tap
to wake up from samsung wave your hand
over it to not only end a phone call but
also take a screenshot and hopefully a
slew of other smart and awesome gestures
ultra power saving mode we've seen that
on a lot of the skins or custom ui's
everyone a column but you could to see
that baked in I've been hoping for this
one for many years this one's just soft
spot in my heart an elegance backup and
restore option please let make it easier
to move from android phone to android
phone I'd really really truly genuinely
appreciate that also hoping for things
like built-in visual voicemail would
also be
super nice to have baked in and this is
not a thing that I hope for every year
but let the skins sit on top of Android
instead of being baked into Android so
perhaps then I know I'm living in
dreamland if you want to download touch
with you can download TouchWiz if you
want to download LG skid you could
download LG skin that would make updates
lot more seamless they filter out the
phones a lot quicker but I know that is
just a pipe number two more watches lots
and lots of more watches will be a ton
of Android wear updates not so sure
we're going to see the next version of
android wear since we kind of just saw
that it's now currently on the LG watch
urbane I think we're going to see little
screenshots of what we might see for
Android wear running Android M hardware
side things going to be highlighted by
the Moto 360 to which i think is what
they're going to give away to attend to
use communit number three your favorite
product you love to hate release
information on google glass the first
explorer edition has come and gone we're
bearing a lot of grumblings at google
glass was dead and then no Google asses
back and now they're getting close to
releasing a final version you're going
to hear more information with the final
version is going to be whether or not
glass completely dead or more likely
here's what it's going to look like
here's you can get it no more Explorer
edition no more beta here's what Google
glass does things have changed the
Google haces first announced things like
microsoft hololens are bringing ton more
to the field than having tiny screen
over your i ever did so i think we're
going to see a completely redesign of a
glass if you've got that idea for new
website you want to start you've been
itching to start run on the shower or
domain com has you covered it's a place
to go when the next great idea hits you
it's a one-stop shopping for all of your
domain and web hosting and email needs
plus did list of extensions are growing
like crazy so you can now have not just
calm you could have ninja NYC dot
website or a ton more our friends at
domain.com and hook you up with a great
offer save twenty percent on domain
names and web hosting when you use
coupon code technobuffalo all capital
letters one word at domain comms check
out anything domain names think
domain.com and last but not least this
one makes me very sad the formal death
of the gpe edition phones that's google
play edition it was a fun experiment if
you wanted a galaxy s4 for example but
you didn't want
the blow to touches at the time you
could get one you wanted HTC One m8
without sense you could do it it was a
beautiful thing and like most beautiful
things they eventually wilt and die and
i am very sad to say that but happy that
i'm not saying that be a nexus line is
dead like i said last year that
certainly stayed yeah but i do think gpe
is a thing in the past and you guys are
gonna be bummed about it too i certainly
am those are my four thoughts and things
were going to expect from google i/o
there's gonna be a ton more of what do
you guys want to see what do you want to
have happen tell me and if it happens i
will share with you because i will be
there snap pictures filming videos and
just overall been a little bit silly
with my developer friends and I think
you guys for watching hope you enjoyed
