to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of ask the
Buffalo I am your host John Rhett enger'
and this is the show where you can just
ask me any question that's on your mind
anything like what did you have for
breakfast I'll answer it I've answered
weirder questions usually though it's
stuff about tooth technology and
sometimes a little bit outside we got a
lot of stuff to talk about talked a lot
about what phone to get we're talk about
the equipment we use here in the office
and what goes into making our videos and
how our scheduling kind of looks so a
little bit behind the scenes and then
some tech stuff this is that's the
Buffalo let's just start asking first
question comes from Josh hey John on
average how many videos to record a day
do you record all the revision3 shows in
one day the answer is no that would that
would probably kill me we record four
shows for revision three those are the
the shows that usually have an ad read
in them so our video editor Ron Frieda
is in the office Monday through
Wednesday so most of our filming is done
Monday through Wednesday and we'll sort
of break it up within those days so you
might see same shirts on a couple of
videos on different days and that is the
reasoning behind that though I should
probably just bring different clothes
and and change so hopefully that helped
answer into the question next question
comes from Twitter ads baozi
four-five-six asks at John four Lakers
at tuck neon buffalo hashtag ask the B
what editing software recording
equipment do you use to make a
TechnoBuffalo videos well that is a good
question so our primary camera that used
to film with is a Canon c100 we've got a
ton of lenses go with that as well and
for a secondary camera we do two angles
we have a 60d Canon as well to shoot
that audio wise we've got I'll pull it
right off my side here some audio
technica packed I got two of these if
you want to do interviews these could be
Wireless but we've got them wired right
in to XLR to the c100 we used to use a
separate mic and then would sort of
record the audio and video separate and
sync them up but once we got the c100
going XLR right in made life a lot
easier when we do sort of a lot of
questions and tech stuff we do have a
teleprompter that I sometimes use for
reference
that one just has to have an iPad that
slides in it's got a mirror that comes
up on it's pretty standard Manfrotto
tripod and some Audio Technica
headphones that Ron uses to monitor a
Ralphie's monitor and that's really yet
I want to go for K but we're so invested
in Canon lenses and I can't see any
justification for buying a C 500 for a
bajillion dollars so we're looking at
maybe going something like the
Blackmagic with the Canon Canon mount on
it you know maybe looking even if we go
away from Canon at the gh4 there's a lot
of 4k options out there but I don't want
to serve just jump in to a camera I
really want to get something no we're
just gonna use we don't typically review
cameras all that much here so I don't
feel like we have to get one just to
review but I want to find something it's
gonna be perfect for us heard rumors a
Canon was gonna do it see 200 at NAB but
that did not found to be true and that
that made me sad so as long would they
answered your question hopefully that
helped next question comes from Twitter
at west MLG asked at John 4 liquors do
you expect to have many different types
of iPhone 6 to come out like a bigger
screen or something like the 5c here's
what I expect sir expect there to be no
more C branding so if you want to get a
C plastic phone you should probably get
it now or wait to that one 6 comes out
it probably will be super discounted I
think we're gonna see one iPhone 6
announced and available within a couple
weeks and that'll be a 4.7 inch screen
up point 7 inches 24 inches we have
right now or the super Retina display
whatever tasks gonna translate to sort
of that new design language that we've
seen I think we're also gonna see
announced not released to later in the
year a larger screen sort of iPhone
phablet maybe they'll call it an iPhone
Pro perhaps the new iPhone 6 will be the
iPhone air that's going to be five point
five inches certainly Apple's been
experiencing with that size we've seen
certain models that have come out
schematics moving in leaked parts that
does not mean it's gonna actually be
released we saw different size iPads
that come out long before the iPad Mini
ever came out so no Apple testings years
and years years in advance so perhaps
it's for you know an iPhone 6s time
might be 5.5 inches but if I were to bet
say we're going to see two iPhone 6 is
but one available right away hopefully
that helped answer question we stopped
the questions for one minute and let me
thank our friends and overall good peeps

fiction they've got everything right
there and of course all of the new
releases and top 100 books that are

and back to the question next question
comes from parth bagua who asked hey Jon
would expect for Google i/o this year
it's gonna be a very very busy Google
i/o and of course we will be there I
think we're gonna see mention of Google
silver devices which is gonna be the
death of the Nexus devices which I'm not
super happy about maybe we'll see one
last round of Nexus devices I think
we're gonna see a mention of Android 5.0
something with an L maybe licorice or
lappers ice cream which is delicious I
think we'll see a Google glass consumer
release info come out so what it's
actually gonna cost and what its gonna
look like when actually goes on our
faces maybe the last revenue next
devices you know may be the new Nexus 10
maybe a Nexus 6 and certainly just a
bajillion API it's probably a lot of
talk about Chrome and a lot of the
unsexy stuff that makes cool services
just work really really well I would all
be my guesses for what we're going to
see at Google i/o thank you guys for
