technobuffalo here I don't make that
many videos about dedicated apps i'll
make one that about every few months
showing all the apps that I use but
every now and then one comes along that
really merit two-tone attention and
today one such app is available it's
called infinity blade eases the Unreal
Engine and it is epic and awesome and
the graphics are unbelievable for a
mobile platform that's not a dedicated
gaming platform like the PSP or even a
nintendo DS so enough of me yeah brand
let's go ahead and check out Infinity
Blade alright so this is available in
the App Store it's going to cost you 5
99 on the iPad and there is an iphone
version available for the same price
you're not getting any discount based on
size let me go ahead and launch this guy
so it is based on unreal technology
recruiting used in countless games and
sort of seeing it use on a mobile
platform is really cool so it is Game
Center compatible we're gonna go ahead
cancel get a bit of a a splash screen
here and the translation from the ipad
to the camera coming uploaded to YouTube
it's not going to do the quality and the
graphics and what this looks like much
justice this is one of those
applications that you really are going
to have to go check out for yourself but
I just had to share with you guys have
never seen anything look this good on a
mobile platform gameplay is that an
average of what you'd expect the
gameplay is nothing exciting it's just
how good the game looks so go ahead and
hit play get the Infinity Blade splash
screen we're going to get a bit of a
story here you can see some of the
graphics in the background I'll just
want to play so he's a bad guy you're
immortal you're challenging this dude to
to fight to end his tyranny and the guy
talk to these graphics are just
absolutely unbelievable let me go in and
show you what gameplay looks like here
so see he'll let me nope no let me pause
we adapted to watch through just a
minute
I'm the voice of freedom hahaha a boldly
flying in worlds in challenging in years
you will do nicely big dude comes in to
try and fight him everybody gets ready
and now we play so here's how you play
the game actually a shield is gonna pop
up you hold it to block this guy's going
to challenge you and see your life the
top you lose one hold the block and when
you want to attack before giving the
option to in just a minute you swipe to
attack it's actually a very intuitive
sort of way to play so I'm attacking
this guy i'm hitting out hitting them
you're gonna hit me he tosses my sword
everybody talks and the sort of game
play it goes on but it just looks
absolutely gorgeous i really could get
Evan same thing look like this and I
felt remiss to not share with you guys
so hope you download Infinity Blade it's
not a cheap game but if you want to look
at some beautiful graphics and sort of
appreciate the development work that
went into it it's definitely one to
check out i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i will see you in the
next video i'm gonna go ahead and get my
infinity blade on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
