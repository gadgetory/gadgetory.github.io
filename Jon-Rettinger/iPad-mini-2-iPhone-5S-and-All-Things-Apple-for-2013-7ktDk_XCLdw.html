to you by carbonite welcome back to
another episode of rumor roundup this
the show we round up all the rumors from
the week and condense them like tech
trash compacter into one tiny little
morsel of tech awesomeness of this week
it is all Apple we're gonna be talking
about iOS 7 next update to Mac's OS 10
all kinds of new iPhones iPads and even
the Apple TV's making a comeback this is
rumor roundup it's going to get started
alright so let's start early 2013
according to Mac rumors the iPad Mini
with Retina display is coming in March
an update to the little tiny Apple TV
box and some sort of iTunes radio
product will also be coming so it looks
like the iPad Mini is not gonna have a
very long shelf life at all from
November to March 6h months which is
kind of disappointing so they would like
to see a longer life cycle of Apple's
products but if it puts a Retina screen
and iPad I would be quite happy and I'm
sure some of you would be happy and
super pissed off you just battle each
other so let's go from March to June to
Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference
usually where we see updates to os's
which we are gonna see WWDC is gonna
bring us previews of iOS 7 and OS 10 as
well as MacBook Airs with Retina
displays you finally start to see Johnny
i's influence over iOS start to show up
iOS 7 who knows what that's gonna be but
certainly it's going to look different
gonna Scott Forstall and now we've got
Johnny I've the brilliant mind who
brought us the industrial design of
pretty much all of Apple's products I'm
inclined to believe it's gonna be the
first real big update we've had to us
not just adding new features but really
a whole new refresh to the operating
system so I'm looking forward to it
Retina displays in MacBook Airs the
cookies gonna blur the lines between
MacBook Air and MacBook Pro alright so
let's jump forward from June to
September you know the brand new iPhone
5 that your rocket and trade-offs all
your friends outdated yesterday's news
iPhone 5s is coming it's gonna be a
modest upgrade from the iPhone 5 the
iPad Mini might also get another spec
bump and a totally redesigned iPad 2
look
or like the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini
iPhone 5s make sense to come in
September to PI look exactly the same a
faster processor and maybe bring some
new Siri features but nothing else
really that exciting
another spec update to the high pad Mini
from March to June that is a crazy
update every six month looks like
something new is coming out from the
folks at app or even a little bit sooner
if we're looking at June and a totally
redesigned iPad just at the iPad 4th
generation looks like the 5th generation
is going to be here looking totally
different I think of it as like a larger
iPad Mini which I guess makes sense so
before we get to what's coming in
November let me take a minute to thank
our friends and sponsors at Carbonite

let's hop forward to November where we
are finally going to see the Mudge
rumored Apple television not just
Endicott Apple TV app or television
Apple a giant thing that goes on your
wall but looks like we are finally going
to see it at the end of 2013 it should
cost between 1,500 and 2,000 dollars and
range anywhere from 40 to 55 inches but
there isn't that much of a price
difference I expected a 55 inch for
supporting two to be more expensive so
we'll see if that price ends up being
new way to control a television perhaps
via Syrian talking to your television
set integration with the remote on your
iPhone iPad iPad Mini or some other
crazy thing we might say an applet
origin
there have been rumors that the TV has
been done and designed for a while Apple
just trying to get content providers on
board so does he folks outside the US
though I would expect this is only given
a US launch at first cuz Apple's gotta
negotiate with content providers from
all the different countries in the world
so I spent the US first then comes
country's gradually later on so that's a
ton of Apple rumors and news condensed
into one video new iPhones new iPad new
laptops everything is coming and new are
you excited about Eman you pissed you
want to jump for joy I'll do what you
guys have to say thank you for watching
another episode of rumor roundup
