TechnoBuffalo and i wanted to bring you
a video showing you both the photo and
the video capabilities of the Galaxy
Nexus mobile phone and I thought what
better way to demonstrate this than to
actually record this opening segment
with the Galaxy Nexus itself so what
you're seeing is the 1080p video footage
captured with this new mobile phone now
I'm going to be pulling this video in
the help and showing you the user
interface and then towards the end of
the video i will show you some more
video capture taken the Galaxy Nexus
okay so i'm going to show you here is
the user interface on the camera
application sets tap on that camera icon
and give you a little bit of a closer
look so this is the camera up and
running and at the moment we are in
camera mode and we switch between modes
by tapping this area down here but i'll
show you that in a short while so we've
got a zoom in and out and we've also got
a little Settings icon just down here so
we can tap on that Settings icon and
this is all the control you've got over
the actual camera side of things this is
for taking photos we can tap here we can
set the flash to auto on or off we can
tap the white balance and set it to
various white balance levels we can also
add some exposure compensation very
handy feature we've also got some scene
modes auto action night sunset and party
and then the very last icon here is for
changing the picture size and setting
the location to the GPS functionality of
this so we'll actually tag your photos
with the location at which you took the
photo so let's tap that again to get rid
of that and then we've got little
downward arrow at the top and that sort
of collapses that particular menu
setting down now if we tap on these
icons we can switch to video mode so we
can tap here and then if we go back into
settings obviously the choices are
different for when you're in video mode
so we're tap at the top here and we can
set the video light on the back to off
or on we've got white balance settings
here as
auto in canderson daylight for wrestling
cloudy this is not a scrollable list
there's no manual white balance setting
then we've got some effects such as
silly faces big nose in space etc we can
even add our own backgrounds which is
rather cool and then we've got here
time-lapse interval very nice feature
and this means it will actually take a
small segment of video every one second
one and a half two seconds to an hour
for three seconds and then we've got the
setting for the video quality 1080p
which is what I was using in the first
segment of this video 720p or 480p and
then the last like on down here again is
for storing the location and then if we
tap here again the very last option is
for taking panoramic photos and with
this you tap the green button pan across
the shot you want to take and it will
stitch those captures together in a
panoramic shot so let's move back to
photo mode i'm going to show you the
camera in action so here you can see
some little key figurines i've actually
positioned at varying distances away
from where I'm standing and i'm going to
show you the camera in use now so this
is the Galaxy Nexus again and what you
can actually do is you can tap to focus
so I'm going to tap the focus on this
front model here and then lets us take
that photo and then we can also
obviously tap in another area so let's
tap perhaps on this back model here and
again tap to take the photo we can also
zoom in so let's zoom in all the way
back to here and we're going to tap and
focus on this one first and take the
photo and then tap the focus in on this
front one and again take the photo you
do have to hold it very steady but I
let's have a look at the results see how
that did that is a pretty good result
there's a lot of detail
in the oh here we go there's a lot of
detail in the hairs but it does seem
like there's a lot of noise and I'm in a
well-lit studio so the photos are not
that well defined I mean it's acceptable
but if you zoom in there is quite a bit
of noise on these photos the detail is
definitely there and what I would say is
you have to light your subject extremely
well to get any sort of quality out
other galaxy nexus camera so that's it
for looking at the user interface on the
camera app I'm going to wrap up this
video by showing you some more HD video
footage captured with the Galaxy Nexus
so I'm sure you'll agree that the user
interface on the Galaxy Nexus is pretty
good and what you'll see now is a little
tour of my studio again captured with
the Galaxy Nexus let's head on over to
my little review corner here this is
some of the products I've previously
reviewed and some that I'm testing now
you'll see that the white balance is
pretty good and this is set to the auto
white balance setting and then let's
move up to this area here and see how it
does on picking up some detail so we ran
about sort of eight centimeters away now
is it going to focus it is not going to
focus eight centimeters so you need to
pull back a little bit on there so ran
about the sort of 10 centimeter mark to
actually focus if you go any nearer oh
there you go it's decided to focus this
time so we're down to about 5
centimeters picking out some nice detail
and then let's have a look at this here
this is going to be quite a challenge
for it is they're going to focus on that
watch face very slow to focus but
eventually it does focus so it does a
nice job on focus albeit a little bit
slow on the focus there and then a
little bit darker in this area here you
might see some noise creeping on this
portion of the video but overall pretty
good experience so this is the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus mobile phone it is pretty
good at video capturing the photos are
very pleasing to the eye to
I think the only negative point is there
is a little bit slow to respond and to
focus on things but overall a very good
job so thank you very much for watching
this video tour of the camera
capabilities of the galaxy nexus i will
see you all in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
