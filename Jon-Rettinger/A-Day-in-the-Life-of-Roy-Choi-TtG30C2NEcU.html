to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back the episode of
rettinger riffs I'm rios jon rettinger
we've had a ton of interest to sort of
here where we came from and how we got
to where at links from electronics world
last week we had our head of mobile in
this chair this week we've got our
managing editor in what we're calling
the ROI Troy chair this is mr. Roy Troy
if you have interested in getting into
online publication or getting into tech
journals and listen to this man story
just got a lot of fun things to say some
of them are a bit irreverent this is
written just wrist let's start ripping
as i mentioned i am sitting here with
our managing editor Roy Troy right and I
have known each other for years we
actually went to graduate school
together which is where we met and I
remember going to class and bringing in
I think that phone i was reviewing
inroads like huh is that the new galaxy
s2 i also enjoy technology i was really
where our friendship started to realize
there's an overlap potentially for
career wise so Roy's got a really
interesting career background so right
where did you come from before here
before coming to techna before I worked
for Disney I worked for Disney for 11
years I helped open properties across
the world I started with the hong kong
disneyland property helping a lot with
the operating procedures and the
training content for that resort and
then from there helping out at the
disney on resort and walt disney world
and all the other disney properties and
then my final big project was a helping
open up a Lonnie hotel that's built in
Hawaii beautiful Hawaii yeah i remember
right after graduation Roy's like peace
out for six weeks I'm going to Hawaii
and later in harrods so just doing Roy
Choi things so there's speaking of that
Roy's famous in the comments whenever he
writes an article or response comments
that Roy Troy doing Roy Choi things so
what would our Roy Choi things well
first of all I had to go back and look
at the videos to figure out what that
was from and it was John just rolling
into my office saying in our office tour
video yeah and our office tour video
John saying Roy Choi doing Roy Choi
things I was like oh that's where that's
from so Roy Choi
things include writing some articles
occasionally not to the level of Brandon
or Todd they just pump out so many a day
i wish i could write as quickly as they
can but occasional reviews but really a
bulk of my day is spent editing looking
through our content to make sure that
its most easily available and most
easily found sometimes we can write as
great content as we do if you can't find
it or search for it it's pretty
pointless so what is so what does that
mean so you guys might be taking about
starting a blog and maybe no one's
reading your content what Roy does is a
really sort of smart and genius way to
get the content out there in fact i
should say when we brought Roy on we
leave realized that we needed this and
really just started sort learning how to
do it and realize that we were seeing a
real big impact on our traffic almost as
soon as he soon as he started so uh we
do a lot of promotion through our
Facebook and Twitter accounts primarily
Ralph does a lot of our work on google+
but really it's an avenue for us to
reach out to our audience lives and
communicates which is twitter facebook
google+ pinterest fury into that thing
tumblr so we're trying to do more and
more in terms of getting our content out
there but at the same time not only does
that content live out there but it's
also a matter of making sure that people
are talking to us and we're talking to
them we really like to be approachable
you know we're we're on the internet or
behind computer displays and screens but
we still want to be like your friend so
if you could give one piece of advice to
people that might want to do exactly
what you're doing in a few years what
advice would you give them well the way
the way i started at disney was as a
writer if you want to become a writer
write a lot and through our friendship
and our relationship became more
entrenched into the technology
journalism world but if you want to
write write a lot read a lot and don't
be afraid of feedback because that's the
only way you can grow i think that's the
best part of my career is that people
gave me advice gave me feedback and
allowed me to make mistakes and i think
that's where people learn the most
especially in my case make mistakes
early on make as many missed
as you possibly can and and you grow
from that we just stop talk to this guy
for one sec cuz talks too much did you
know sir or madam that's by 2015 mobile
app development projects will outnumber
native pc projects by four to one that's
only one year from now or less eight
months if you're counting like january
so if you're interested in this kind of
future technology you want to get on
board you that mobiles where it's at
full sail University's online mobile
developments bachelor's degree program

thing about you that people might not

into walls and drywall and yeah I mean
