TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing for
you of a device that I'm really looking
forward to the Droid X for Verizon
Wireless this is gonna set you back $199
and will be available July 15th
so without further ado let's go ahead
and dig into the package of course you
got the obligatory big ol knife for this
and as I go through the phone I'll cover
the specs as well we got some press
material now I'll take a look at that a
little later very small box here on the
Droid X seed us we got
so it says droid on the front letting
you know what it is Moriah Verizon
Wireless built by Motorola it's an
hearing compatible stuff more about the
phone some specs and that pictures on
the back and that is about it for the
box but the box isn't what you want to
see let's go ahead and take a look at
the phone itself and there she is and
I'll look for a 4.3 inch capacitive
touchscreen glory so we talked about the
specs a little bit first year as I
mentioned 4.3 inch capacitive
touchscreen with an 854 by 480
resolution HDMI out can take 720p video
8 megapixel camera dual LED flash with a
mechanical shutter and image
stabilization 3G mobile hotspot capable
which is pretty nice it's got will have
flash 10.1 coming in the summer it's got
a 1 gigahertz OMAP processor so this
thing should be a screamer eight
gigabytes of internal storage expandable
up to 40 with a 32 gig card and the
battery has about eight hours of
talktime so this is definitely a
powerhouse phone go ahead and pull it
out and I have not seen one of these yet
so we'll take a look at the that in just
a minute and it is wide open inside pull
back the box and we have the battery and
back cover and if we get a tower to talk
to him I'm gonna assume that we're
looking at a 13 to 15 hundred milli amp
hour battery
let's see if we can see what we got here
3.7 volts and we are looking at a 15
hundred milli amp hour battery which
you're going to need to power device
with a screen that big
so what else we gonna get in the box we
are going to get of course your USB
charger which is standard now micro USB
a little wall plug to plug that into I'm
getting started guides getting started
guide in Spanish and some consumer
information this is running sort of an
updated version of motoblur with Android
2.1 although Android 2.2 will be coming
let's go ahead and take a look at the
phone itself I'll pop the battery in
sort of pull off and get that very
satisfying whooshing noise and we will
power this thing on I'll do some size
comparisons and I'll walk you through
the device while it's doing its initial
boot up we gotta pull that alright pull
out so let's go ahead and push that in
take the back off and the back looks
very similar to the original Droid and
sort of that motorola metal pull that
out of the package or at least attempt
to let's see how thin or how thick this
device actually looks peel off the
plastic once you can figure out how this
goes I mean it goes a little something
like this and slide it to place and it
does so let's see what we got here on
the phone itself so we actually have
some physical non capacitive buttons
here on the phone serve your standard
Android array with the mix of motoblur
so you've got a menu button a home
button a back button and a search button
of course that huge 4.3 inch capacitive
touch screen on the left hand side
you've got your charging micro USB port
and HDMI out the back there we see the
HD video and eight megapixel camera with
the dual LED flash we've got a speaker
grill on the side on the right-hand side
of the phone volume toggle up and down
and it looks to be a hard button I
assume is probably going to be for the
camera does have a bit of a funk to it
take a look but doesn't device this feel
to be very thin 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and power and lock button so let's
check out the size of this thing against
some of its competitors and perhaps
friends we've got it's 4.3 inch toting
distant cousin here the Evo
for G and we've got for further
comparison the iPhone 4 and you can see
that the iPhone 4 just dwarfed by these
two let's do a thickness compare since
we can see the phone is relatively thin
save for that little bit of a hump right
there which actually may help when you
try and pull out of your pocket let's
compare it with the iPhone 4 and the
phone does appear to be relatively thin
if you take a look at it you put them
all together you can get a super phone
Sam one can see that they are very thin
devices let's go ahead and kick this
thing on and I'll be doing a full sort
of overview of the software here since
this does have an updated version of
motoblur as you can see what this looks
like let's just power it on very quickly
and certainly stay tuned for a ton more
covered on the Droid X is a phone that
I'm really looking forward to I think
it's great that sort of these super
phones are making their way to multiple
carriers and it's going to be a awesome
addition to Verizon's lineup so I'll go
ahead and let this power on and I'll cut
out sort of the fluff here of it booting
that scary little droid I
and then here we are welcome to Android
so I'll be doing a ton more coverage of
the Droid X in the coming days so be
sure to stay tuned there's going to be a
lot to talk about here with this phone
and be sure to check out TechnoBuffalo
