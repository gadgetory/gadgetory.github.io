to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys as a mark and Sangan from
TechnoBuffalo and on this episode of
rumor roundup we'll be talking about iOS
9 OS 10 point 10 point 11 and the iPad
pro we're also going to be talking a bit
about gaming specifically Shenmue the
best game I've ever played on Dreamcast
this is rumor roundup so let's go ahead
and get started so first up let's talk a
bit about iOS 9 and OS 10 point 10 point
11 the system font Apple made
specifically for the Apple watch dubs
San Francisco will reportedly be
included in the upcoming updates to iOS
and OS 10 according to sources speaking
to 9 to 5 Mac the font will replace
Helvetica new and be used in part to
refresh Apple software while also
providing better legibility following
Apple's complete change to Helvetica new
last year a number of designers voiced
their displeasure with the font stating
that the font was difficult to read
Apple executives supposedly feel the use
of San Francisco will not only please
those who felt Helvetica new was a poor
font choice but completely refresh iOS 9
and OS 10 which some in Apple can't feel
are becoming stale on the other side of
the coin however some developers have
complained that the font San Francisco
may not be the best choice either
especially for non retina displays
because the font just flat-out doesn't
look good with WWDC coming in early June
we'll hear plenty more about the fate of
iOS and OS 10 and whether or not San
Francisco the font will be involved on
to more iOS 9 news a new report from 905
max has Apple Maps will finally get
public transit directions along with a
few other new features in iOS 9
according to Mark Garmin Apple hopes
include subway bus and train directions
with iOS 9 the update may also add a new
trip planning feature a special public
transit View and the company is also
hoping to debut indoor mapping this year
as well Apple Maps has gotten
progressively better over the past few
years but it's still missing a key
feature for anyone who lives in a city
or relies on public transportation of
course that's just a small fraction of
the company's massive user base so it
makes sense that Apple isn't in a rush
to add subway directions if Apple does
announce these improvements to maps will
likely hear more about it during WWDC
the last Apple rumor today goes to the
iPad pro the iPad has been in a slow
decline over the past few years and
Apple is very aware of this fact
according to sources talking to
nine-to-five Mac Apple is looking to
make several
over the next year culminating in two
new 12 inch models looks like we'll see
an iPad pro at some point after all 95
Mac says Apple is working on larger
iPads currently codenamed j98 and je99
essentially a larger version of the
existing iPad air 2 1 will be Wi-Fi only
and the other will be of course Wi-Fi +
cellular larger iPad will run iOS as you
and I know it now though it'll sport a
new feature allowing users to run apps
side by side this is a feature that's
been talked about for a while now and we
actually expected Apple to officially
unveil it last year though the company
apparently needed more time to polish
the software sources now say that Apple
plans to show off the side-by-side
feature for iOS 9 using currently
available iPad models and that the
latest plan suggests that the
split-screen mode will support half 1/3
and 2/3 views depending on the apps
samsung devices of ad multi window
feature for quite some time now while
Microsoft Surface lineup also boasts
multi window support the iPad has always
been a device for consuming media though
the new feature and larger iPad could
put Apple slate into a different plane
entirely so hopefully Apple will share
more details soon let me stop the video

at domain coms check out now last but
certainly not least I personally have
not talked about gaming and rumor
roundup before but I thought this one
deserved a spot in today's episode
because today we're going to be talking
about Shenmue Shenmue is probably the
best open-world game for the Sega
Dreamcast woody 3 coming up next month
Shenmue rumors have returned leaving
myself in the entire world wondering if
the long-lost franchise will be making a
comeback Japanese website game stock has
stumbled across some suspicious murky
images of origins unknown and they're
branded with Square Enix label and a
tentative date of spring 2016 now
whatever it is or whenever it was taken
Square Enix wants it to be a mystery but
the real question here is shouldn't it
say sega instead of Square Enix game
stock jumps to the conclusion that the
three cherry blossom petals are
representing an HD remaster of Shenmue 1
&amp;amp; 2 and that the third one represents
Shenmue 3
it might seem far-fetched but just
remember anything is possible these days
anyways that's it for this episode of
rumor roundup anything that I talked
about in this video will be in a links
