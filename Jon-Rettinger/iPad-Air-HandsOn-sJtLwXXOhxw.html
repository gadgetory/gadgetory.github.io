TechnoBuffalo here earlier today we
invited this guy the brains new iPad air
it's not enough time to do a for review
but it is plenty of time to do a first
impressions it's not any further ado
let's get first impression so it's
called the iPad air for one obvious
reason it feels super light now I can't
really tell you on video or you let you
experience how light it feels but slice
to say it feels really really light
especially when you compare it to the
iPad for any previous generation iPad
you know you can hardly even feel the
weight and certainly it still weighs
something it's not you know lighter than
air but it really feels very nice the
big difference here design wise I mean
you take a previous generation iPad and
you stack them like an iPad sandwich you
can see how much smaller the iPad air
really is it's almost as if you took out
one of the whole side bezels on the iPad
4 it really is astounding another thing
I've noticed with the iPad and we sort
of verified this other folks in the
office when you tap the screen I know if
you can hear that it almost feels like
the device is hollow if you compare that
to what it feels like touch the screen
of last generation iPad it's a very
different sound so I don't know if the
glass is thinner perhaps on the iPad
which certainly might have accounted for
its thinness and loss of weight but you
certainly can notice it only if you
compare it to a previous generation so
speed here is obviously fast I got a
64-bit chip it's very very quick
applications launched really fast that's
kind of silly to show yeah things look
fast look how quick Safari launches hey
it's quick but it's always been quick
it's never been slow scrolling is also
very quick pretty intensive games like
Infinity Blade 3 look gorgeous on this
giant screen it looks absolutely
beautiful and graphics are stunning
the motion is very quick and fluid you
never at any time feel like you are
using an underpowered device other than
that it's pretty much I Oh s7 that we
know you definitely get the sense that
iOS 7 was designed with the iPad air and
the iPhone 5s in mind and perhaps
probably been used as a reference
hardware I just worked very very quickly
any quark you might have noticed with
your iPhone 5 or older generation iPad
or the iOS 7 you are not going to notice
here with the iPad air the bezels here
are
smaller but they're still planning room
to hold your hands when you're using it
so there are stereo speakers here on the
bottom I would have preferred to have
maybe one on the bottom and one on top
so you get sort of true stereo sound
even if you're holding your iPad down
you're gonna get this like this for
example I didn't get that sound a little
bit muffled but the speaker's do sound
very good on the iPad and regardless of
location having stereo speakers is
definitely welcome some folks they
almost have said the home button feels a
little bit different as a little
shallower I haven't noticed that but you
might when you pick up your iPad air or
try it in an Apple Store other than that
this is pretty much I pad through and
through everything we know and love or
loathe about the iPad I do like the new
design it feels more like a larger iPad
Mini and I love the way that looked I'm
gonna kick it up in space greater so
more silver of course you've got the
silver here just looks nice
the reflective Apple logo is there so
you can look at your beautiful face
camera has improved but please don't use
that back camera to get any pictures of
anything only time you should ever use
that is when your FaceTime you want to
show someone something in front of you
don't be that guy holding this thing up
times eight pictures of your kids it's
just not cool like I said it's an iPad
through and through it's a quickest iPad
yet it's the best iPad yet in the market
for a new tablet this would be a great
one to pick up I don't know yet if it's
worth an upgrade from the iPad 4 I'll
use it for a few more days like you guys
know anything else you want to see
