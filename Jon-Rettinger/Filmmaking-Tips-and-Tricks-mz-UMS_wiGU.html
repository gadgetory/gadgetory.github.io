from technobuffalo and we've done a
couple videos in the past sharing our
camera set up for these TechnoBuffalo
videos however I do a little bit of
documentary filmmaking out on the side
and I have a different set up for that
so today I want to walk you guys through
what that setup is and what you guys can
do as many beginning filmmakers or
beginning documentary filmmakers so
first off we have our bag here and the
most important thing is always obviously
going to be your camera I like to use a
panasonic gh4 it's very small it's very
compact you get built in 4k on SD cards
it's all good stuff the SD card that i
use or it's not in there are usually
sandisk cards you can figure out how
fast of cards you need the lens i have
on here right now is a void klandor 40
2.5 millimeters so because the gh4 has a
two-time crop on the sensor this is
actually cloven to about an 85
millimeter or precisely in 85 millimeter
this is one lens than I do carry with me
for portrait work for close-ups and
these lenses actually have such a close
focusing distance they're almost
functions macro lenses and so all manual
manual aperture manual focus great lens
standard manfrotto tripod plate on the
bottom moving onward we oh and one other
note the reason I also like the scan for
doctrine or filmmaking is the batteries
are insane the last forever this is a
sennheiser mic for your iphone so it
uses a lightning port this is more of a
backup solution for me obviously i would
prefer not to get audio with this may be
more higher quality mikes which we'll
get into in a second but if you have
nothing else to record audio and you
need something very quickly and you have
your iphone on you can plug this in and
put this in the pocket of your subject
who you're interviewing or if you need
to do some voiceover yourself you can
use it for that so that's fantastic as
well moving on we have two filters i use
two filters from tiffin there's a
circular polarizer this is a fader ND i
use the fader indie way more than the
polarizer over the polarizer helps when
shooting through windows if you want to
bring the vibrancy of the the sky down
and a sort of wide shot or something you
can play around that and see what you
like but the fader ND is an absolute
necessity when shooting with dslrs next
we have hard drives because we're
filming we have to be able to back up
what we're doing so once or SD cards get
full usually go on a laptop and backup
footage we have two drives here i have
the samsung t3 which you guys have seen
in
of mine before I usually work off of
this drive this is about a 512 I believe
so and this is the drive where I really
back up a lot more stuff this is a
little c4 terabyte hard drive you want
something large obviously depends on
what kind of file type you're working
with as well moving on very important is
headphones doesn't really matter what
headphones you have as long as you have
something to monitor audio coming out of
the camera that is crucial during
interviews or even during regular
filming just to see whether your audio
is popping with your getting clean
dialogue all that good stuff continuing
with audio when you're doing interview
work you want to lav up or that's how I
prefer to do it at least so that you're
getting a clean audio track without
getting too much ambient sound I'm a big
fan of this lab kit we've talked about
the San Hydra laughs gets before but
this is the road filmmaker kit you
basically have sort of two components to
it you'll have a receiver this goes on
top of the camera with the hotshoe plugs
in via 3.5 millimeter and this goes on
the subject they work really well very
simple very straightforward and give a
good consistent signal next we have our
other lens this is the void klandor 17.5
millimeter f 0.95 so this is sort of a
sister lens part of this set there are
other lenses these are my two favorites
because this is a 35-millimeter
equivalent this is an 80 error rather an
85 millimeter equivalent so these to
cover me off pretty good a backup camera
that I like to have is a GoPro this is
the GoPro Hero 5 just came out I don't
use this camera primarily for too much
stuff but it's mainly if we need to
shoot shoot some backup stuff some
underwater stuff and it's really like a
rescue camera where I can't necessarily
put a camera of this size of you know in
small areas and what not even like head
mounting it or chest mounting it so
depending on what you're doing if you
have it planned you want to mount or
rather bring the straps and mounts with
you so next we have the Panasonic gh4
battery charger I do carry extra
batteries with me however I like to have
this in case I do need to charge any of
the batteries if we do run out of juice
which is very very rare as I mentioned
those extra batteries this is 1 i'll
usually carry one with me and if I'm
having extra long shoot
I will have a couple extras then in
addition to that we next have some
double a batteries this is for I carry a
zoom h6 which we'll get into in a second
and if you're Mike packs these mics for
example run on double a batteries so
those are for that continuing and
finishing up our Mike situation we have
the Sennheiser 440 I believe it is it's
a very odd-looking mike i use it for the
first time recently this last week it's
a MK ii 440 and this is probably one of
the most directional Mike's I've ever
used it picks up very very little
ambient sound will be doing tests with
this in the future if you guys would
like we can actually do a review of it
big big fan of this continuing onward
stabilization is super super important
we have this manfrotto tripod as you can
see it is very very tiny it uses the
same manfrotto plates we have on here
which most men photo tripods do that's
why I like it super light super small
super portable fits in one backpack you
can obviously with a lot of this gear go
more complex bigger or smaller you don't
need all of it depending on what your
needs are but these are mine continue
onwards we have the front pocket here in
this backpack and this has been through
absolute war so please bear with me on
this case but this is the zoom h6 n in
here with various attachments of XY Mike
forget what this mike is called and a
shotgun attachment so you can also
attach different XL ours if you want to
run multiple audio setups in interviews
usually I like to run an on camera mic
than a lav mic so I can sort of mix the
two and get the best of both worlds if I
want some ambient sound and a clear
voice track and last but definitely not
least one of the most important things
always is a laptop you always have that
just to back up to these hard drives and
footage and that's really my setup for
documentary filmmaking it's it's pretty
basic I like to keep it light because
usually from shooting by myself or with
one other person we'd only be lugging a
ton of gear around we don't want gear to
run into or rather stop us from
capturing the story we're trying to
capture so documentary film
making is all well and good when you can
get everything you need in camera but of
course that's not always possible and a
lot of commercial filmmaking situations
corporate filmmaking or videos that you
even just want to post on YouTube
sometimes you will run into licensing
issues this is where I adobe stock comes
into play it's a stock library but what
makes it better than other stock
libraries is not only their huge
selection but how integrated adobe stock
is into the other adobe apps so here
TechnoBuffalo we edit on Adobe Premiere
Pro so in my favorite pieces of software
we also use Adobe After Effects we use a
whole suite adobe stock is built into
premier very very intuitively and makes
it very easy to use so by hitting
libraries at the top I have this panel
popup on the right immediately I have a
search bar that has searched OB stock I
can look for any sort of images that I
want or anything that I want if I switch
camera I'll have a bunch of images of
cameras pop up all sorts of stuff once
you find what you're looking for I can
drag it into the timeline and as you can
see is a usable clip just like anything
I would have shot and imported myself in
fact it even comes up in my project
folder off to the left the only issue
being that it has a watermark on it
saying adobe stock all i have to do
however to get rid of that is actually
licensed the clip so once you've edited
in whatever you want you can actually
play around the clip see how it fits
make sure it's exactly what you are
looking for and then to confirm it you
just hit license clip and by licensing
it it doesn't move anywhere in the
timeline adobe simply replaces it with a
non-water marked file you don't have to
mess around with anything in your
timeline anything in your video it's
going to be just the way you wanted it
and if you want to pick it up today you
can download it from soft cat a UK
distributor as well as Adobe go ahead
and check out the links down below in
the description if this is interesting
to you I personally think it's a great
resource that every creative should have
on deck whether you're a graphic
designer a photographer it comes in
handy just when you need it but let me
know what you guys think what would you
guys add to this set up what do you guys
use you know if this helped and leave
his comment down below gives a thumbs up
if you like this video thank you so much
