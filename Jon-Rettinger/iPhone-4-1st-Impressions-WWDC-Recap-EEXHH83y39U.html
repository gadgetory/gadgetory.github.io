technobuffalo here and i want to give
you a recap of apples just concluded
world wide developer conference keynote
where they unsurprisingly announced the
new iphone which is going to be called
iphone 4 so CEO and president of Apple
Steve Jobs took the stage and ran
through eight key features of the new
iphone 4 so I'm going to go ahead and
run through each one of those they see
me look down come check out some notes
the keynote just ended so number one is
the new design and this indeed the
design that we saw from gizmodo and a
few vina me sites with there are some
things that we didn't know about it so
first it's got glass on the front and
glass on the back and stainless steel in
the middle to give it a lot of
durability which is kind of neat it is
actually now twenty four percent thinner
than the iphone 3gs which actually makes
it the thinnest smartphone ever if you
look at the iphone 3gs it was by no
means of fact device but it wasn't that
thin but twenty four percent thinner
than this is actually very very
impressive when we first saw the leaks
of the new iphone 4 there were some
seams along the side and early with some
confusion but what those seams were
going to be some thought is maybe for
removable back oh it is not as it turns
out this seems a part of the design and
how they got the thinness down that's
actually part of the antenna they don't
have the antenna running all the way
around the full diameter of the phone to
give I guess better reception and bring
in 10 out from the inside of the phone
which was right behind here to the
outside so that was one of the features
that we didn't know about kind of neat
24% thinner again it's something that I
definitely gonna have to see to believe
it had the round buttons and a few other
features that we're going to talk about
so the second really big key feature is
something called retina display oh it's
essentially gives you four times the
pixel density the iphone 3gs which is
incredibly impressive there now 326
pixels per inch i believe the retina can
only see 300 pixels per inch so really
what this means is when you read text or
watch video look at pictures they're
going to look amazingly sharp if you're
reading text for example and you zoom
all the way it sometimes you'll see look
jag get around the edge
that is not going to happen anymore
going to get crystal sharp pictures it's
a resolution now of 9 40 x 640 which is
actually double the resolution of the
current iphone 3gs which is 480 x 320
which is pretty cool I just have a 802
one context ratio ratio which is four
times better than the iphone 3gs we're
seeing a lot of improvements here the
incremental updates from the iphone 3g
to 3gs now we're seeing huge improvement
from the 3g x2 iphone 4 as the same 3.5
inch display but because it extra pixel
of pixels we have on there you're now
we're going to get seventy-eight percent
of the pixels that you get on the ipad
which is crazy impressive on such a
small screen so the next thing you
talked about number three for keeping
track at home it's going to be running
the a4 system-on-a-chip which we saw
powering the ipad so extremely powerful
it's clocked at 1 gigahertz but the
clock speed is necessary as important as
how things all work together and because
Apple makes all the hardware and
coincides that with software they make
you're going to get very optimal speeds
this thing is going to be an absolute
screamer I do expect it to be much
faster than current Snapdragon foams
that we see out there were only time
will tell the next thing that I want to
talk about number four again you for
keeping track with all this new fancy
hardware how is a battery going to be
and let's talk about battery it's
actually been improved surprisingly
you're going to get six hours of 3G
browsing time on your phone you're going
to get ten hours of browsing over Wi-Fi
going to get 10 hours of video watching
so if you watch video on a long flight
maybe able to get through the whole
flight most probably you're going to get
40 hours of music and 300 hours of
standby time you're getting improved
numbers all around the phone now is also
will support hsupa hsdpa is
traditionally what's being called 3g
it's a faster end of the 3g it's now i'm
going to support 7.8 megabits per second
down and five point megabits per second
up well that's certainly not a 4g speeds
it's very very fast and much faster than
current 3g speeds that's going to be
aware available some of 18th es networks
won't support that quite yet but the
phone will be capable
that turned on in your area one of the
cool things that does have now is doing
mics for noise cancelling so it's got a
mic at the top and a mic at the bottom
of the phone so what you're talking
it'll sort of pull out where the noises
and reduce it so if you have a
convertible or a loud car going to get
much much much less noise on background
which is quite nice storage size we'll
talk about in a minute but it's going to
go up to 32 gigabytes and actually one
of the really cool things that sort of I
think went unnoticed with this keynote
is the iphone 4 is going to have a
gyroscope built in so the iphone the
every iphone has come out the first one
the 3g 3gs had an accelerometer so you
turn the phone it recognize it but we
went back and forth really didn't do
anything what this is going to do now is
recognized all the three-dimensional
axes so if you move the phone forward
it's been a recognized your back in a
recognize either side or side it's going
to recognize where your phone is at all
time there's you're going to be great
for games you're not limited now to just
going left and right turning or tilt
you're not going to actually move your
phone without actually giving it that
filter turn and the bone is going to
recognize out just kind of cool and
really excited with the developers do at
start implementation so the next thing
and number five we're going to talk
about the new camera system which is
actually a pretty neat it's got a five
megapixel camera on the back which is
Bing up from three megapixels but it's
got something new which is event lee
called back side illuminated sensor i'm
just going to make for a Bentley much
better picture quality you're going to
get a five times optical zoom with the
tap to focus this new iphone 4 has an
LED flash on the back which you can
illuminate to get better pictures in low
light and very coolly it now records HD
video on the video side at 720p at 30
frames per second which is pretty good
for a mobile device and when you're
doing video you're still going to get
the tap to focus and you're still gonna
be able to access that LED flash if you
want to film video and low-light you are
good to go so the next thing and this is
sort of a really cool feature that they
announced is iMovie for the iphone but
the camera that can do that much
obviously you want to build on it but
your content on the creation device so
now you're going to be able to really
grab and move
any video that you want you get a
timeline on the bottom of the phone but
you'll you guys can see when it's
available to talk about another minute
you can add photos and get some of the
effects you're used to on iMovie and
you're going to have access to five
different themes it's pretty cool and
you can choose to export any resolution
it's going to run for any nine when it's
lunch so number six in the six new
feature I Steve jeld-wen to talk about
was iphone OS four point oh which is now
just being dubbed iOS four it's not just
dudes on the iphone anymore it's used on
the ipod touch and the ipad so is I OS
four point oh talk about something
features we already knew so multitasking
and you said if we do it right you don't
have to kill the battery I'll talk about
the folders and exchange support
enterprise support and single in Bach
all stuff we've covered before about
iphone OS 4.0 which will be in
developers hands the gold master
starting today which is pretty neat also
you're going to be getting Bing now on
the iphone OS four point oh or iOS four
that I'm getting rid of Google you just
have being as an option so number seven
is I books I books is being updated and
being put on the iPhone and iOS four
point oh going to get the same book so
if you get on the iPad if you download a
book on your iPhone an automatic wake or
you can download again rather on the
ipad for free so you only have to pay
for a book once automatically synced
automatically pull in bookmarks and
everything else that you have so you're
always are up to date with where you
were on your content also you're now
you're gonna have PDF support both
inside of a book so you can read and
check out pds if you like and you sort
of get that one download thing it's
going to be free of cops to download
another book that you already pay for
the number-8 and the last thing that
really we talked about what I ads I
talked about this a few months back with
the iphone OS 4.0 or again now call the
iOS four announce it it's going to be
launching July first on all iphone OS
four point oh devices it's going Steve
expects it to really account for
forty-eight percent of all mobile
advertising and second after 2010 which
is pretty I guess lofty
numbers and as with the decent amount of
Apple Keynote often times there is one
more thing and there is indeed one more
thing and there was one more thing with
this keynote and that is now a
front-facing camera on the iPhone 4 and
this is something i think the sexting
crowd is further than going to like you
now have full video chat on the iphone 4
which is really cool and it's actually
called facetime is this new video chat
is going to be called so video calling
it's going to be Wi-Fi only in 2010
which sort of leads you to believe that
eventually after 2010 it's not going to
be Wi-Fi only so over 3g and now the new
hsupa network you're going to be ruled
out hopefully eventually over 4g as well
so let's talk about prices Tufts
everybody wants to know the 16 gigabyte
version is going to run you one hundred
ninety nine dollars 32 gigabytes going
to set you back to 99 and Apple still
going to be selling the 3gs and a
gigabyte version for ninety nine dollars
and it's going to be available jun 24th
in the u.s. France Germany UK and Japan
didn't come in two colors white and
black but not like we've seen before so
this is the white version put the front
all looks the same on the new iphone for
the whole front is going to be white
kind of neat and it's got again
launching in u.s. France Germany UK and
japan on the twenty-fourth of pre-orders
going to start a week from tomorrow
which is going to be jun 15 and 18 see i
think generally nice PR move they
actually bumped up upgrade eligibility
six months so if you were six months
away from your upgrade check your
account cuz odds are you not going to be
able to upgrade to the new iphone 4 so
those are the big iphone announcements
which is really cool and actually talk
about a few other things to all sort of
recap very quickly i talked about ibooks
for the ipad and be able to do pdfs
there's going to be a new notes and book
marketing applications going to be built
in also some new applications that are
going to be coming on netflix for the
iphone or work or over 3g or Wi-Fi as
well and you feel sink back and forth
between your iphone and ipad so if
you're watching a movie on the iphone
when you get home anyone watch on the
ipad i'll pick up right where you left
off you're also going to get now and you
farmville applications so everybody can
keep track of your sad
calf or bowl whatever that might be and
it'll sink back to a facebook
application I just kind of neat i guess
and a new guitar gear application with
the new strumming mechanism will be
available actually started today for the
iphone so what do you guys think about
the new iphone forward you like it are
you impressed you excited personally i
think apple had lost a lot of their
bragging rights that they had at the
first generation of the iphone android
really caught up webos really caught up
and now having all these new features
and it's actually in a phone that's
twenty-four percent Finn and the iphone
3gs strikes me is very impressive at the
front facing camera 5 megapixel cam a
camera on the back with this super high
resolution screen pinky I'm going really
well positioned now for the next
generation of wireless devices what do
