technobuffalo here and we've got a first
boot up of a core i7 2.9 three gigahertz
imac this has a two terabyte spinning
hard drive as well as a 256 gigabyte
solid-state drive I thought do I should
be loaded on i'll be doing full boot up
test after you've already turned it on
for the first time i thought you guys
might want to see what the first boot up
looks like so it has never been turned
on before let's go ahead and give it a
shot
alright power button is located in the
back left go ahead and turn this sucker
on it's why I can ask me to set up all
the wireless Bluetooth stuff let's see
what happens alright turned on that's
good screen doesn't look yellow that's
also a positive let's see what we got
and then once they go through the first
set up process and put some information
on it will do again a full boob tabs to
solid state drive and see if it's faster
than my outgoing 24-inch imac that's
about three and a half ish years old so
hopefully we'll see something happen
here in a minute there we go apple logo
that is a good sign again this is a
27-inch it's got eight gigabytes of RAM
Dilton i'll probably update then update
that myself a little while down the road
but figured eight gig should sit me a
nice and pretty for right now there's a
blue screen let me know they want to
connect the magic mouse so i would go
ahead and do that and i'll come right on
alright so got the batteries put in the
magic mouse here interestingly enough if
you order the apple of battery charger
with your new computer they aren't going
to put two batteries in the magic mouse
on those batteries are not going to be
charged interestingly enough so go ahead
and turn this on and we'll see if it
connects spinning looks like it is
working us we'll go ahead and use
english for the main language screen
looks very bright which is quite a nice
i assume in Alaska's next so the
keyboard there's a video
before you begin hook up the keyboard
and expect it so go ahead and hook up
the keyboard as well I assume they
probably put batteries in here not well
go ahead and take a look if you do it on
camera impressive instead unboxing the
keyboard as well sorry if I made you def
with that plastic tearing nice to have a
clean board might as well kinds of dirty
right now alright so go ahead and see if
there are batteries here go ahead and
open this up gotta peel off some plastic
let's see if this will open it up did
indeed got a old sim card here it up a
net so it looks like there are indeed
batteries inside of it although they are
not charged so push goes off to the side
and we'll put into charge and I'll come
back in just a moment all right
batteries are in let's go ahead and turn
this on my car to see the joking there
Jonah turning on his keyboard all right
and it looks like it is connected which
is great go ahead and set United States
us and I'm actually not going to use
this from a backup for two reasons first
I planned all along from doing sort of a
clean install from a older computer and
second my hard drive that had my time
machine backups had I wanted to do it
died on me I do have a secondary hard
drive that I hadn't back anything up on
to do have all my information should
have to do it all manually so do not
transfer any information now go ahead
and continue probably go through the
rest of the setup process there's my
wireless network and I go ahead and type
in the password alright detecting my
password at work and after my apple ID
I'm going to do this off camera as well
alright that's done else can ask for a
picture we'll go ahead and do that I put
my face right in there I'm probably
blocking the lens a little bit too you
guys select the picture all right take a
photo that'll work so that's me looking
creepy go ahead and continue I have I
already have a dot mackin member name go
ahead and type this in again do this
alpha camera all right i am in irvine
california set the time zone
automatically going to continue thank
you and i am now all set up with my
brand-new iMac and again will be a ton
of coverage here on this and how it's
going to work I am jon rettinger from
technobuffalo stay tuned to the YouTube
channel technobuffalo for all that
coverage I'll see in the next video bye
