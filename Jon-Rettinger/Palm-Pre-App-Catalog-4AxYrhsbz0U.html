want to give you a demonstration of the
palm pre's app catalog this is akin to
the iphones App Store or blackberries
app world so let's get started go to
launcher and there it is right there app
catalog you can also see how long it
takes for an application to open on the
pre as well so here we are in the app
kallik you can see very clearly letting
you know that this is still in beta and
it's broken up by feature and popular
although there are not that many apps in
here so the featured and the most
popular are really just the same
applications mostly you can sort by most
recent top-rated lifestyle entertainment
news utilities social networking food
communications productivity games movies
and tag cloud which is really just
viewing all applications so there really
aren't that many in here right now
they're less than 20 and these are all
actually web apps so certainly you need
to be connected to the internet either
via a video or Wi-Fi to really use
almost any of these applications so let
me go ahead and show you and actually
since they are web apps you really can't
tell they seem very close to native
applications so let's go ahead and
download 1 i'll show you how that works
so here's the game connect for right to
love that and i was a kids let's give
that a download so it opens up you can
rate it by stars gives you some brief
download about it you can click try it
or you can go ahead and download it
right away so let's go ahead and
download and I've connected via Wi-Fi
right now so you can see how quick that
is it is actually a very very quick
download and as its downloading there's
an X to the right of that progress bar
letting you know you can cancelled as
you go loading the application and
that's it it is loaded you can tap to
launch but let me show you where they
show up go ahead and throw that away and
they show up really right on that first
launch of screen so here we have connect
four and see what it looks like that for
by Hansbrough
you can try a multiplayer features and
they really they look just like native
applications that you find on the iPhone
of the blackberry it actually is really
impressive what Tom did here so one
really cool app that i downloaded that i
want to show you guys something called
classic you may have had an old palm
device maybe a treo 600 treo 650 maybe
even one of the older Palm Pilots but
what you're going to see here is going
to look very familiar to you it actually
emulates the old palm OS if you have a
centro that you upgraded to the pre to
regardless this is should look very
familiar to you and it is a full
functioning palm classic operating
system you can install applications on
here it'll grow really as big as you
wanted to limited only by the internal
memory on the pre install applications
when you plug your prey into your
computer you set it up as an external
hard drive and you just drag
applications right in and then once all
automatically if you have a license with
an older palm classic device that won't
be a problem you can actually transfer
the licenses right into this application
it's very cool and it works just as well
so here's the calculator go back home
you got tasks and by the way just seeing
this old classic operating system Ruthie
claim appreciate how far the pre has
come from what was palms really only OS
up until yesterday and that's it you've
got a virtual d-pad you can control and
move along you can have your contacts in
here certainly you can't make calls from
this but it is just a emulations so
we'll close out of that and let's go
back to the app catalog
and here we are back in the app catalog
I'm going to run through and show you
everything that's available right now
there aren't that aren't that many it
also has I'm through here you can see
some notifications popping up I just had
an email that came through we'll check
out the tag club you can see sort of all
the different tags that they have which
is very similar to what you would find
on most web pages or a wordpress page
this is kind of one of the ways that you
can see that this really is a web
operating system there's the app catalog
and to go back you just use the gestures
and swipe back so let's take a look at
the most recent application you can see
sort of what's in here and I'll just
scroll through them quickly and you can
take a look and read them yourself but
there's some accuweather there's some
Twitter applications there's Fandango
there's New York there's some games in
here the associated press there's a
couple Twitter clients and of course
there's the classic application which by
the way is free for seven days then you
have to buy it and of course what app
catalog app store would be complete
without a sudoku game that is almost a
requirement so we'll go back check out
to the top rated apps ebaying them are
different really is highlighted by
pandora radio which is very cool and go
through and see all these most of them
are the same there aren't that many apps
are released to the SDK that was given
to developers was give it a little bit
late and for what I understand wasn't as
complete as some developers sort of
light so hopefully down the road this
will open up and they'll be as many apps
as are found on other platforms
certainly Paul may go the route of Apple
when Apple initially only offered SDK
for web apps and then opened it up to
native applications palm may go that
same route with the pre wants to give
you guys a demonstration of the palms
breeze app catalog hope you enjoyed for
exclusive content check me out on
twitter twitter.com / John for lakers if
you have any pre questions you can go
ahead and
Smith owes over there I'll see you in
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
