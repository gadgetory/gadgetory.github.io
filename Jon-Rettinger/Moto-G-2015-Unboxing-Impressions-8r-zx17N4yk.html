technobuffalo here and hidden in this
nondescript purple box I think we've got
a affordable Beast this is the latest
from moto the Moto G this guy is going
to start 180 bucks you can customize it
though with motorola's own moto maker
software let's go ahead and open this
sucker up and see what you're going to
get inside here is the phone it's a
5-inch 720p screen we'll talk about that
a little bit later push that off to the
sides it also going to have inside of
this purple box we've got cardboard I've
been hoping for like a flat piece or
like a little pencil holder there you
have that they just have a wall charger
really just a wall charger is connected
to the wall works though it's no big
you're going to get a separate one in
there or two separate pieces Moto G and
some paperwork which no one's going to
read but let's take a look at the phone
that's why we're here go ahead and pull
off this little classic piece I know
people love the original moto G I did as
well this seems to be a pretty worthy
successor to that no real satisfying
moschino I'll power the sucker on and
let me run you through the specs so
let's chat about specs what you're going
to get for your around two hundred
dollars does i mention you've got a five
inch bring into 720p screen but is
protected by Gorilla Glass 3 powering it
is a Snapdragon 410 case you're
wondering it's clocked at 1.5 gigahertz
and it has this this is this many cores
so two virgin you're going to be
available depending on which one you get
obviously cost there's an 8 gigabyte
version with 1 gig of ram that's ones
could be a hundred bucks or will step up
to a 16 gigabyte version with two gigs
ram and a microSD card slot which we
have right here that can hold a card up
to 32 gigs battery is a pretty
nice-sized 2470 milliamp hours it's
going to get you about 24 hours of mixed
use it does have some water protection
though it's ipx7 so you can notice a
little bit of water pick it up and
you'll be fine assuming you've got the
back pushed in all the way on the back
we have 8 13 megapixel camera it's f 20
in case you're wondering and we've got a
5 megapixel sensor on the front much
like the 1+2 no NFC is found on board
here but it does have LTE so
improvements over the last Moto G you
can now get it with two gigs of RAM
bigger than a keygen turtle storage but
on the last gen micro
he was standard the camera has been
upgraded from the 8 megapixel that it
was on the previous generation if you
look around the phone you're going to
have on screen your typical Android
buttons you've got your power button
your volume up and down of course
lollipop base it's almost stock Android
here with Motorola sort of tiny tiny
little apps on top but the app said
totally separate from the OS you can be
updated very easily the phone feels
really nice in the hand it feels more
significant we've got to back a bit of a
textured almost like scratch pad thai
back you got that little dimple that we
saw with the first gen Moto X i really
like dual LED flash home just feels a
little more premium an upscale than the
last gen Moto G if you were an Android
purus you're going to love the OS here
it is Android being Android I was some
of motorola's really nice additions
sitting on top of course you've got
front firing speakers who get some great
audio out of here and then the camera is
going to be flanked on the right-hand
side of the device I know what do you
guys think we'll put it through its
paces do a full review but anything you
want to see in particular be sure to let
us know until next time John render from
technobuffalo see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
