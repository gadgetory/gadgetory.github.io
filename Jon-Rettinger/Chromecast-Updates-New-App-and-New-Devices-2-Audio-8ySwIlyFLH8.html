protect now Buffalo and the new
chromecast's are here we've got the
chromecast and the chromecast Audio here
in the office and I thought we'd do a
quick little tour around the brand new
chromecast app it's a lot of things have
changed the original app has very little
functionality around it it's really just
focused on getting you hooked up do your
chromecast getting your chromecast
hooked up to your Wi-Fi network and
really not a lot beyond that basically
just the settings page for your
chromecast but the new chromecast app
has an incredible amount of content in
here but it's not actually chromecast
content it's just pulling from the
things that it knows that can chromecast
on your device so the first thing you're
going to see inside of the app is the
what's on page and on what's on you're
going to see a handful of services here
across the side YouTube Netflix Google
Play twitch and then at the bottom of
course TV movies other apps music audio
apps these are all the apps that are on
my device right now that can be used to
cast content to my TV if we want to
start watching something here up at the
top we can just tap on this honest
trailer of Avengers age of Ultron hit
watch takes us over to the YouTube app
and you can see it starts playing right
away because we're not actually
connected to a chromecast so we can go
ahead and do that right now and then we
start playing on the TV no problem so
we'll leave this just in the running of
the back and we'll head back to the app
let that run up at the top here there's
a brand new search bar you can either
use voice and say for example Doctor Who
and it pulls up a search for you now
what's cool about this search is this
isn't just a particular service that
we're searching this is basically
everything both on your device and on
the internet that can be casted to your
TV regardless of what service is coming
from it's aggregating all that stuff to
right here but let's for now just tap
straight through to regular old Doctor
Who you can see it pulls in from Netflix
Google Play and Hulu I can either go and
get the app I don't have that on my
device because I'm not a Hulu user but I
can go and get it because it knows that
it's available there I can grab it from
Google Play for two bucks or since I'm
already on Netflix I can just hit watch
now I'm already connected to my
chromecast via YouTube so what I'll need
to do here is tap
obviously again just to get connected on
Netflix I wish that's something that
we're a little bit easier to do but
right from here now we're right back in
the normal Netflix experience hit play
and now we're watching the first episode
of season 8 of Doctor Who heading back
into the app you'll see two more devices
here the devices panel is where you're
going to get access to all of those
quick settings all that stuff that you
need from your original chromecast app
to be able to manage your new brand-new
chromecast you see here we can go into
the settings we've got a handful of new
things here we've got some new stuff as
it pertains to backdrop we've got Google
Photos Facebook Flickr newsstand all
kinds of great stuff you can change the
speed now even how quickly they're going
to change that's pretty sweet and then
we can head over to get apps and this is
just another discovery portal sort of
like what's on it's just instead of
what's on your device it's things that
you don't have yet that you can go and
grab and download to your device and
start watching on your chromecast of
course you haven't lost the ability to
cast your entire screen if that's
something that you're doing that's in
there as well but for the most part the
really big change here is the what's on
panel and that's what really gets me
excited like I said I'm a really diehard
user of a chromecast at home so being
able to just open up the chromecast app
for my media folder and just search for
what I know that I want to watch and let
it tell me where it's best to watch it
is pretty cool in terms of the rest of
the changes the hardware is kind of the
same for the most part the exception of
the aesthetics you'll see it's a kind of
cool looking round device now and it
does not plug in as a dongle anymore it
plugs in as a dangling dongle it's not
just the straight up plug in situation
they've actually got an HDMI cable right
here for you actually also has a little
magnet on it sit nice and convenient for
travel if that's something that you do
keep in your bag for for you know gonna
hotels whatever uh the chrome logo
obviously red on the outside the reset
button on the side and a micro USB port
which they also provide a power adapter
for on the chromecast Audio side which
we're about to get into you'll see they
did they said this during the announcer
which i think is really cool they made
it look different
and the regular chromecast and gave it a
radial design to kind of allude to it
being a vinyl record which i think is
super cool and super cute but the they
also come with a cable here and they
come with a power adapter as well so
this one will need to be plugged into
power and then you can just plug this
directly into your speaker so why don't
we then take a quick look at chromecast
Audio chromecast Audio is basically the
same thing the pairing process is very
similar the only difference is you're
going to be asked you here for a tone
that comes out of this video that you
plug it into anything that you can
stream via chromecast already if it's
audio chances are very good it's going
to work so whether it's audio google
play music podcasts or now Spotify which
is now finally supported by chromecast
or the other way around now finally
supports chromecast will stream to this
little guy right here later in the year
they are going to be bringing multi room
sync support to the chromecast so to me
this seems like a very very hefty
competitor for one of my favorite
products so nose so that's it that's a
quick look at the brand new chromecast
app and the chromecast devices hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did you can hit
that like button down below on the way
