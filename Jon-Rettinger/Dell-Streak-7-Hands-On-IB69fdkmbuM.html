released Delta 7 I probably a proper
tablet size with quite obviously a
7-inch screen also member something here
in the upper right hand corner is
rocking 4G what you can't see is
underneath the demoted this is one of
the many phones Guinness Book now what
you would call super rocking a dual core
tegra 2 with 2 1 gigahertz processors
other screen resolutions of course 7
inch diagonal with the resolution of 480
x 800 on this delves now state gy we're
having a tegra two projects today we've
been looking at this quite a while and
the thing is not pacificus in the world
it's going to take a look at a website
here and see how things look so go ahead
and pick up a google search and we are
getting full bars of 4g we supposedly so
let's try
see how responsive this thing is trying
to give in Tampa again browsing i'm
available stores closed give that one
more shot and i'm going to keep this
footage in here because in our
experience of playing with the device
has not been overly zippy so let's try
one more time it's going to see an end
to try to get anything here and check
the a multi-touch screen on this looks
like now we're finally loading it is
pulling up the mobile version let's go
to technobuffalo and check out the
keyboard here so you do have swype looks
like it's pre-installed so go ahead and
go to TechnoBuffalo here i am not a
swipe fee so you have to follow me on a
laugh at me it's not very responsive at
all especially for having a Tegra 2
chipset granted it is swype keyboard so
going to launch technobuffalo do quick
search for it and you can see that the
4g speeds are so go and immerse yourself
in technology and take a look at will
check multi-touch browsing now
we'll do some other performance tests to
plug the mobile version a while that is
doing it notice we've got three buttons
on the side they are capacitive buttons
in our home menu and back button don't
have the search button unfortunately
there is a front facing camera on here
which I don't we can get on see it right
there I think from a camera standpoint
we do have one hoon be back as you well
I hope it all the specs down below now
you can see it's on an LED flash well
when I'm in of a textured fuel to the
back they can see TechnoBuffalo is
holding up let's check the multi-touch
here seriously know if there is del not
spooning engine so it zooms it's not
anything that's going to get impress
your friends physics engine which will
off to in your flick it just keeps going
there we go so no yeah it is it is going
i want to give it a fair shake this is
not appear to be the most impressive of
tablets that we've seen it goes of
course have flash 10.1 support because
it is an android 2.2 device dell has
claimed that there will be support for
and during the newest version and grabs
a honeycomb but nothing has been
announced yet we'll see when that comes
so going take a football game to stage
UI and check the zip penis here so SH Y
is actually really nice let's hook up in
different panels or stages you got your
recent apps here
your Social Feeds music the custom
widgets are how that you're going to get
with your streak 7 so stage would it's a
narrow different choices here
hey those are two and take a look at the
settings go fast we can go ahead and see
send out a lot go ahead and about this
device so again android 2.2 dell street
seven unless I'm you guys look to knows
based an oem version that will hopefully
make you happy we do have noticing a
fair sort of LED indicator I've got a
volume control and you've got a power
button I don't take a sort of phone or
pictures so it looks like though is not
kind of brand this as a phone anymore
and you've got horizontal scrolling for
your menus so we have a true tablet from
Dell perhaps it's this demo unit perhaps
the street Devin's gonna be a little bit
laggy I'll be sure to stay tuned
technobuffalo for a full hands on review
when we get it hi I'm John right
technobuffalo and I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
