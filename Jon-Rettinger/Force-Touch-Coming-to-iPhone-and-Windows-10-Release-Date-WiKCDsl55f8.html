to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys the mark and sang it from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's episode of
rumor roundup we have a lot on tap
including talk about Windows 10
releasing in July for such coming to the
iphone 6s and 6s plus and many more
let's go ahead and get started Microsoft
so far has only said that it plans to
release Windows 10 this summer other
versions of the new OS such as windows
10 mobile will launch at a later date
however a more specific target may be in
mind AMD CEO Lisa sue commented recently
suggesting that Microsoft wants to kick
the operating system out the door to
consumers by July reports are saying
that July 29 is one of Windows 10
shipping deadlines which suggests it's
the final release all consumers Windows
10 will be free when it does launch
later this summer and we can't wait to
try it out samsung's galaxy s6 already
offers one of the best smartphone camera
experience on the market and it's about
to get even better according to a new
report Samsung is about to borrow a
camera feature from the iphone 6 and
push it out to users through a new
software update sammobile said it has
been testing an early version of the new
camera software that will reportedly be
included inside the android 5.1 lollipop
update and it users will find more
advanced manual camera controls for
tweaking exposure before taking a photo
apparently samsung's new controls will
allow users to adjust exposure based on
a certain spot inside the frame similar
to how the iphone can lock in on an area
and then manually adjust exposure this
is a tweak I personally have been
waiting for so we can't wait to try it
out the camera tweaks are expected in
samsung's update next month and
sammobile said that shutter speed
controls and raw support will also be
included on to more samsung rumours the
galaxy s6 edge is an impressive device
but Samson could be planning something
even more exciting for next year a new
report from San mobile claims that the
company is testing a dual screen
foldable phone called project V or
project valley the device is still in an
early development and it could be
scrapped but imagine if it does release
Sam Mobile's report is short on details
but it knows that Samsung's working on
new gesture controls to let you quickly
switch between the devices two separate
screens Samson claimed it could launch a
foldable smartphone by 2016 and although
that may have been wishful thinking it
looks like Samsung is racing to keep its
promise for now it's just a rumor but we
wouldn't be surprised to see more
information and even a few images of
this new Samsung device sooner rather
than later much of apple's focus at WWDC
reportedly be strengthening the security
in iOS 9 but 9f imac has a big scoop
that claims that the company is working
on a major new predictive intelligence
feature Apple is allegedly going to
introduce a new initiative currently
codename proactive and it sounds a lot
like Google now the system is being
designed to leverage siri contacts
calendar passbook and third-party apps
to proactively provide information
before users even ask for it that could
mean sports scores weather directions
and more all showing up without the need
to launch different apps and services
925 access proactive will be an entirely
new layer with an iOS and possibly
replace a spotlight pulldown menu for a
screen to the left the home screen the
new service will apparently show users a
dedicated search bar along with
information based around apps contacts
and maps other information expected to
show up in the proactive screen includes
favorite contacts along with meetings
map directions and when to leave for an
event based on traffic so yeah it's
pretty much like Google now but apple's
version let me stop the video real fast

TechnoBuffalo it's all one word in caps
at domain coms check out last but not
least we'll talk about the iphone 6s and
6s plus a rumor last month began
floating around claiming for such was
indeed coming to apple's iphone but that
it would be exclusive to the iphone 6s
plus according to economic daily news
however supply chain sources claim that
for such is coming to both the iphone 6s
and 6s plus bringing the new
technologies to massive audience
technology which is capable determining
how hard or how soft the user is
pressing has already been introduced to
the Apple watch macbook pro and the new
macbook so it stands to assume that the
iphone is next on apple's list Avila
said to be designing a lot of the big
changes in iOS 9 around for such
capabilities but it's unlikely we'll
learn the details at WWDC next month
instead Apple will probably sit on the
news until the iphone 6s and 6s plus or
revealed later this year may be an early
September in addition to force such the
new iPhones are rumors who include an
upgraded 12 megapixel camera a 9
processor 2 gigabytes of RAM and a new
rose gold color option anyway is this if
if this F
