techno
with an installation walkthrough for you
of Mac OS 10 Snow Leopard this is
actually someone quite excited about
I've been looking forward to it than
sample first teased it seems like almost
a year ago that they first sort of
started putting on hints that snow
leopard would be coming nothing
revolutionary but does offer a lot of
very small tweaks that make it a really
solid or west refined from installation
to shut down Apple assange so I'll be
the judge and let's go ahead and see how
the install process goes first I've done
a full backup via time machine I
definitely recommend you do the same
definitely back up your hard drive so
this supposedly frees up a lot of hard
drive space so I'm curious how much
let's take a look at how much hard drive
space actually have available so I'll go
ahead and get info you can see right
here that i currently have 160 1.72 gigs
of space available so see whether not
that goes up or down so go ahead and
take this out of the box and we will put
it in dec lee make sure you have backups
i can't over emphasize that enough i'm
going to do just a simple upgrade like
most people will probably end up doing
no full reformat or anything just a
straight-up upgrade alright so here is
the disk and pop it in and let's see
what happens I should also mention flows
you that are running windows via
bootcamp this offers full on new boot
camp drivers via bootcamp through point
O so you should see increased
performance in windows XP Vista and a
seven-point oh so I'm going to be
cutting away as the installation goes
you have to watch the full process but I
will tell you about how long it takes so
you get the insulation that pops up
right here you get the install OS 10
optional installs of instructions let's
see what these optional installs are
just out of curiosity xcode nothing that
i need to install right now so we'll go
ahead and install a mac OS 10
to set up the insulation of Snow Leopard
click continue so I definitely want to
go ahead and do that the software
license agreement give this a read we'll
go ahead and skip it oh ok hit agree
click where you want to be installed
obviously on your car drive now you've
got an option right here for
customization and this is in the bottom
left hand corner you can see what is
there usually this is where some of your
other options are going to be whether
you want to install your printer support
additional fonts language translations
you may or may not want to install these
are quite a quite a few of them I'm just
going to keep it Rosetta which will help
you emulate emulate some powerpc
programs I don't know that much 24 or
QuickTime 7 if you need it so go ahead
and hit OK some things won't work with
the new quicktime 10 so we'll go ahead
and hit installed are you sure you want
to install mac OS 10 click install and
quit all of their applications will hit
install enter your password so i just
entered my password hit enter and now it
tells you that it's installing and it's
going to take about 45 minutes so i will
leave this and if anything happens i
will turn the camera back on so you guys
can see what's going on so 26 minutes
left nothing's happened but that little
bar at the bottom seems to keep moving
alright it's getting to be go time we've
got less than a minute remaining on the
insulation all in all it's taken let's
say about 45 ish minutes so definitely
under an hour but it's not a short
installation process but it was
relatively easy Kassala just accept of
license agreement and let it go alright
so just change Tommy installation is
complete install succeeded Mac os10 was
installed on your Macintosh hard drive
disk computer must restart let's go
ahead and restart it and see what it
looks like now that we've got snow
leopard fully installed
so it says thank you back up your
computer browse your files coverflow
email a style chat using effects and
backdrops and then organize your work
it's quite nice that video looks almost
the same as a leopard installation video
with a little bit of flare at the end so
let's go ahead and hit continue all
right see what else we got looks like
that is it we are now in Snow Leopard
looks to be exactly the same as leopard
so far i'm going to go ahead and use the
features and see what the difference is
definitely stay tuned for the channel
for all kinds of leopard coverage i'll
be going over all the new features
seeing how the speed works and see if
there really is an advantage to
upgrading first thing i do want to check
those a hard drive let's see if we got
any space back we go to get info and i'm
now at 182 points eight seven gigabytes
did you guys can see actually i did get
a decent amount of hard drive space back
so if you're on a laptop of a smaller
hard drive upgrading your snow leopard
will definitely give you a little bit
space back so for exclusive content
should have checked me on a twitter
twitter.com / John for lakers and to

the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
