video their new power port to with power
delivery is a great compact charging
solution for all your devices it's forty
five and a half watt delivery is April
charge pretty much anything you can
think of even laptops over a USBC stay
tuned to the end of the video for more
in the past few years LG has kind of
gotten a bad rap the g6
NV 30 were solid phones that ended up
never crossing most people's minds
myself included but I think it's time to
give LG a closer look I'm at Gonzales
with TechnoBuffalo and this is the LG G
7th in keel and name aside this is by
far the best phone LG has ever made with
this iteration of the G line LG focused
on their AI platform hence the name but
honestly after using it it's the least
interesting portion of this phone I'll
talk about all that AI in a bit but
first is what's most impressive and
that's the build when you pick up the g7
the word that instantly comes to mind is
quality the version we have comes in
this gray color which is understated but
looks great at first glance the phone
doesn't seem too different than the g6
that came before it but this is the best
feeling phone LG has ever made it feels
similar to the V 30 but just better in
almost every single way it's more solid
and dense which makes it feel higher
quality it's also less rounded and more
narrow which makes it easier to hold has
glass on the front and back with
aluminum right on the sides I'd even go
as far to say that g7 is Samsung and
Apple levels of build quality it's that
good that idea kind of plays through
this whole device it's really not too
much different than the LG phones that
came before it but it's just the best
version of it and I think that's a great
thing now it's not perfect up front is
the 6.1 inch qHD plus LCD display and
yes it has a knotch LG cause it's a
second screen but really it's just where
your time and notification icons live
now you can turn it off or set a
colorful background behind it but this
is one area that feels like LG is just
trying to follow a trend and it doesn't
come across well in day-to-day use
though it doesn't bother me the knotch
disappeared after you get used to it so
that's good luckily the rest of the
screen is also great it's not oh le D
but it gets very bright
mm it's so viewing outdoors isn't a
problem and it has decent color accuracy
and saturation
I enjoyed using the screen quite a bit
it's also a very tall screen 19 and a
half by nine which is great for watching
white screen videos and while watching
videos you can hear what LG calls the
boombox speaker it's not a dual speaker
unfortunately but it has a resonance
chamber to amplify the sound and bass
does it work okay kinda the speaker is
loud and clear but the low-end could
definitely be better than just listening
to it when you place it on a flat
surface that low-end kind of comes to
life because it uses that amplifier to
vibrate the surface it's kind of a cool
feature but most of all I'm just glad
that the speaker is loud and clear
enough to use on its own one interesting
move LG took is to move the power button
back to the side the fingerprint reader
is still in the back but now you have
the volume button and power button on
the sides like you do on most devices
and now there is a new button to
activate Google assistant yes hey
dedicated assistant button you can't
turn off luckily but you can't remap it
I thought at first I would hate it but
actually it didn't bother me I didn't
find myself accidentally hitting it like
I did with some other phones that have
assistant buttons and why I did use it
it was using Google assistance so it
actually works but still LG just let us
roam app it I've always had a love hate
relationship with LG's camera systems
I love the wide-angle lens that lets you
get way more in the shots I love the
quality I can get when I put it into
manual mode I find the auto mode to just
kind of ruin the shot honestly after
using the g7 for about a week it seems
it's more of the same story here there
are two 16 megapixel cameras on the back
the main shooter has an aperture of f/16
while the second is f 1.9 and has a
wide-angle lens optical image
stabilization on both cameras spec wise
the cameras are on par with pretty much
any phone out there and there are new
features like portrait mode and google
lens which do work so that's good the
issue I have though is LG's processing
the photos they just look dead they're
over sharpened there's little saturation
almost no contrast and LG's new AI mode
which looks at the scene and adjusts
based on what it sees while it does
detect correctly most of the time I
didn't see any change to the end-result
image luckily all of
Changez if you switch to manual mode and
shoot raw here the camera is excellent
but most probably won't do that the
camera isn't horrible the hardware is
definitely there
and hopefully some updates will fix the
auto modes but comparing to the
competition
it just doesn't catch your eye quite as
much the rest of the phone though hits
it out of the park Snapdragon a 45
Adreno 634 gives a ram this makes the
phone super snappy Android 8.0 Oreo and
while it does have LG software on top
it's easy to fix that if you don't like
it I'd be 68 water resistance headphone
jack wireless charging expandable
storage fingerprint reader it has
everything you'd hope for in a phone in
2018
the only if you thing is the 3000
milliamp hour battery in my testing it's
not bad definitely got me through the
day of medium to heavy use but I did
find that compared to other devices with
bigger batteries like the s9 plus I'd
have to charge before in the end of the
day luckily if you do have to charge our
sponsor anchor has you covered this is
their dual port power port 2 with power
delivery it's a small charging brick
with a built-in plug to go right into
the wall and it's powerful enough to
charge pretty much anything you have it
has a USB a power IQ 2.0 ports but it
also has a USB type-c power delivery
port this will let you quickly charge
even bigger items like your laptops with
its 31 output anchor claims this is the
fastest charger on the market and if you
have one of these and in LG g7 you'll be
able to charge even faster than normal
using either port thanks to its powerful
output it covers the majority of devices
out there and it's small enough to take
with you pretty much anywhere thanks
thank you for sponsoring this video and
if you want to pick one of these up for
yourself links are down below the LG G
7th in queue isn't perfect there are
issues like the camera and the knotch
but honestly those aren't as bad as the
name which is actually saying a lot for
the most part the g7 is a solid phone
that is feature-rich pricing looks to be
around 750 dollars but if previous
year's tell us anything you'll be able
to get the g7 for a steal in a few
months and that's great for what you're
getting
it's easy to hate on LG especially with
the amount of excellent phones on the
market but I think the g7 brings a
serious reason to give them a second
look I hope you enjoyed this video be
sure to let us know down below in the
comments what you think of the LG G 7
