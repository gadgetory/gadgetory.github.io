technobuffalo here with the release of
the Nexus S it's the second officially
sanctioned Google's smartphone that's
been available the first being the nexus
one so while these might be a bit
outdated hardware on the nexus one
versus a new refreshed Nexus S I know a
lot of you out there Oh nexus ones there
are public curious it's going to be
worth the upgrade so let me go ahead and
show you the different dis between the
two let's go ahead and get started so
let me jump right in with a few
disclaimers we're obviously dealing with
a close to last generation hardware on
the nexus one still relatively moderate
however the Nexus S is using a lot of
newer processors and certainly the newer
operating system on Android which is of
course gingerbread so whether or not
this is going to be a comparison of
froyo versus gingerbread 2.2 versus 2.3
it's probably going to be a lot of
differences that we're going to see here
in addition to a little bit more
efficient processor to talk about in
just a minute on the nexus s so this
isn't going to be a typical head-to-head
battle with different rounds that would
necessarily be fair I just want to show
you differences between the two phones
and you can try and figure out which one
is going to be right for you so let me
preface this was saying that each phone
has just about been completely restored
nexus s just came as a fresh install
about two days ago the nexus one did a
complete fresh install yesterday before
we jumped in tsar talking about
everything let me clear the memory on
each so we're dealing with the fair
comparisons so Android 2.3 as I showed
you my gingerbread walkthrough has a
built-in memory app managers like going
to manage apps that I can go right into
running and I can kill everything that's
running at the exception of Google
services so go ahead and select that
stop running gmail android keyboard not
going to let me stop so mostly
everything is stopped except for google
services which is pretty much always
running but i'll try and stop that
anyway see what happens settings we need
to keep so everything else is fresh and
clean we'll go into a task killer here
and we will kill all selected apps so
now we're dealing with the least clean
memory on both so let me refresh some of
the specs
we have here on the nexus one we have a
1 gigahertz Snapdragon processor the
same processes are still found in a lot
of new phones coming out right now it's
got a microSD card slot for expansion so
you can go up to our blues high of 32
now on the back it's got a 5 megapixel
camera with autofocus and flash 3.7 inch
AMOLED screen resolution of 480 x 800
and that's all being supported by 512
megabytes of RAM and ROM the new just
released Nexus S has a 1 gigahertz
cortex a8 hummingbird processor same
processor that we've seen in the galaxy
s series of devices and very similar in
architecture to what we see power in the
iPad and the otic phone for now not an
all tests by the majority of tests
that's being regrets I've been run
comparing these two the cortex a8 has
been a bit more efficient so it expected
this to be a little bit faster of course
it's running the newest version of
android 2.3 which is only going to help
its speed increases once the nexus one
gets android 2.3 i will have to retest
less and see if there's any sort of
speed differences that we see this has
16 gigabytes of internal storage no
microsd card slot oddly enough has a a
similar 5 megapixel sensor on the back
with autofocus and flash but it also has
a vga camera on the front for video chat
or what else wanted pictures of yourself
on the front it's got a little bit
larger 4 inch screen which is super
analytes you're going to get darker
darks and richer colors we're also going
to get a bit of tint bluish tint to the
screen may be able to see that here on
camera at the same resolution of 480 x
800 also has 512 megabytes of RAM
alright so let's do some speed and
performance sets here and through the
differences are I think one of the best
way is to sort of garner processor and
memory management is to jump right into
a application it doesn't have much
practical use but it's kind of fun to
play with and that's Google Earth so I'm
downloaded that on both these devices
will go ahead and launch them and see
how well they handle alright so
unsurprisingly the nexus s sort of
launched things a little bit quicker and
ready to go we've got a bit of a loading
thing here and a lot of these increases
that we're seeing may very well be from
android 2.3 not necessarily related to
hardware the software but the way these
two phones are now this is the best we
can compare it looks like that switched
on over okay so this is good to go as
well let's see how smooth things are
booth look to be handling things pretty
nicely if i zoom in try to zoom in here
a little bit slower on the nexus one see
as I roll around then pull back just a
little bit enough so you can see it
there we go I roll around on the Nexus S
relatively smooth but I do the same
thing here in the nexus one it's a
little bit jumpy but it's not bad and
certainly usable this is probably one of
those places where you get a minor
increase in graphics efficiency on the
Nexus testing your the nexus one
certainly this reason alone is not going
to be a particular reason why you'd want
to ditch your Nexus we want to go pick
up the nexus s of it is something to
think about and again this may be
related just to Gingerbread and not
going to focus on the differences in
Gingerbread who actually get a
comparison doing android 2.2 or just 2.3
but certainly you can see some
differences right at the top all right
so let's go back home go back home now
and let's try launching the same
applications on each we will launch
angry birds seasons and I'll go ahead
and let it lunch all the way till it's
ready to play so I'll go ahead and try
and hit those at the same time which is
sometimes more difficult than you think
alright that's like I didn't know I did
get it on the looks like it launched a
little bit faster on the nexus one on is
still watching on the Nexus S that's
sort of a surprising alright so the
nexus s actually launched the Angry
Birds application a little bit faster it
might be because it's been optimized for
2.2 might be just because the nexus one
did faster not sure if it was sort of a
interesting result alright so we'll go
ahead and jump back the one thing that I
did install on the nexus one after the
fresh install addition to the
applications that you see right here
it's flash so both do have a flash
support let's go ahead and launch a
website and see the many differences in
speed and both of these are connected to
the same Wi-Fi network go ahead and
launch TechnoBuffalo Oh see if we can do
the same thing here as well I'll go
ahead and type in TechnoBuffalo it
should be right there ready to go so
i'll do a a refresh and both
obviously the sites have been loaded on
each DC advices so be representative of
sites you visit on a on a regular basis
so go ahead and hit that and hit that
and we are off on each all right so it
looks like the Nexus S shows up a little
bit earlier nexus one came back nice and
quick Nexus S is done and the nexus one
is still loading I will tell you almost
a year later since the nexus one came
out it's still a very fast phone it
really holds its own against some of the
newer phones that are being released
today so there you go there's some
differences between the two and
hopefully on a site like this you can
see they're just between the screen as
well that Super AMOLED really doesn't
make colors pop it also has sort of that
curved contour display you might not be
able to see so well does only have much
practical ability it feels nice when
you're scrolling your finger over it
when it's up to your face as well it's
got a bit of a higher quality field
speaking of higher quality let's talk
about build quality of the two devices
the Nexus S is made by samsung and the
nexus one was made by HTC HTC at least
in my opinion hasn't really solid
industrial build quad and that
translates very nicely to the nexus one
the phone feels very solidly built
there's some metals on the back soft
touch plastics the Nexus S build nexus
one or Nexus S rather built by Samsung
has a plastic back and doesn't have that
same high quality fuel I think you get
with the nexus one so when it comes to
build quality I'm definitely going to
give the edge to HTC / samsung here
alright so let's continue it was sort of
talking about some of the other features
of the phone and we'll have to talk a
little bit I suppose about android 2.3
up where i can get into that much detail
with it alright so let's go ahead and
see what's going to come standard with
the apps so these are both sort of
standard Google experiences so you can
see how quickly the application trailer
loads you got some 3d rendering down
there on things do load very quickly one
of the niceties that the Nexus S has
over the nexus one again this is a
preference thing and it's also security
industry and it's also a android 2.3
thing out of the keyboard certainly
there are tons of third-party keyboards
you can use to plug in to make this a
totally moot point but I certainly
prefer the keyboard on Android to
quite three found on the Nexus S so
finally I want to run a benchmark tests
on both of these guys I've got quadrant
here which is a pretty decent
benchmarking application I'm going to go
ahead and run them on each and then I'll
come back and show you the results if
you want to see these tests being run
I'll put them at the end of the video so
you can watch sort of the whole the
whole test and run the whole gamut of it
let's go ahead and get started with that
okay so the results are in the quadrant
test actually crashed the nexus s the
first time had to be run a second time
you can see the results here let's go
ahead and look at the nexus one
hopefully all that will be in focus for
you guys and you can see it its second
right below actually what surprisingly a
nexus one didn't recognize this as a
nexus one see the motorola droid HTC evo
droid x galaxy s there's another nexus
one down there probably with android 2.1
and it can say the score there is a
little over 1250 so very nice score
showing the phone is still very quick
and very fast if we look at the Nexus S
here you see the score is a noticeably
higher go ahead and benign to focus just
over 1,500 it was actually the highest
of any of the phone be tested including
the nexus one these are all sort of
scores that quadrant pulls in from other
devices nexus one droid x HTC evo galaxy
s and a few others the interesting thing
is the galaxy s that might show
differences between the touch with skin
that's on the galaxy s and android 2.3
because specs respect they're very
similar the nexus s and the galaxy s so
i guess in conclusion is it worth
jumping off ship from your nexus one to
run out and pick up a nexus s the answer
is probably not the nexus one is still a
very very very quick phone if you're one
of those people it has to have the
latest and greatest and you want the
Super AMOLED screen you want a bigger
display you want to have that new
operating system right now certainly 2.3
will make its way the nexus one you
haven't go ahead and make it upgrade a
one of the problems that I fail to
mention the nexus one and I've mentioned
this in every nexus one video might be
unique to my video is capacitive buttons
at the bottom of the nexus one I've had
a horrible time right there's where they
are had a horrible time working
them sometimes they don't respond
they're much more responsive on the
Nexus S although you don't have on the
Nexus S any sort of a navigational pad
like you've got that little scroll ball
there on the nexus one and i hope you
enjoyed this comparison of the two
devices if you look right here by the
way you can also see the big differences
between the Super AMOLED screen the
black just look blacker than on the
nexus one anyway I will see you guys
next video be sure to check out
technobuffalo for all your tech news for
exclusive context check me out of
twitter twitter com /strong for lakers
buh-bye
you
alright so go ahead and hit launch on
each of these this isn't a speed test
but i'll quickly application loads it's
just a benchmarking test so hit ok we'll
get a license is there and we'll go
ahead and run full bench marks on each
and even right here you can really see
difference between two black levels on
the quadrant test it look much darker on
the Nexus S and they do on the nexus one
you
we get crashed on the nexus s weird
share that you
