full price are actually locked and what
that's gonna mean is if you pop it
another carrier SIM card like if you're
traveling for example and then gonna
work for you
I've been unlocking phones for years
actually my brother-in-law is travelling
to Europe and he was worried that his
AT&amp;amp;T iPhone was not gonna work and you
want to get hit with the roaming cost so
we asked I'd unlock it for him I've been
doing this for years and I figured I
would just tell you how I unlock phones
I've gotten a lot of questions about
this over the years so first you got to
do is find out your IMEI easiest way is
good your dialer type star pound zero
six pound boom there's your IMEI now
there are a lot of websites you can go
to to get an unlocking code for your
phone and getting an unlock code from a
third party is totally legal so don't
worry about any legality of it I usually
unlock my phones from the unlocking
company mostly because I know the owner
I trust them there are a ton of
companies that do it but they've worked
for me if you want to give them a shot
I'll link to them down below and there's
some information about your phone like
the manufacturer model country purchase
from your locked carrier put all in that
business your phone is unlocked so for
any phone you can get it unlocked any
steps are almost exactly the same
regardless of what phone you're using
but for an iPhone it's a little bit
different and that's pretty much every
iPhone whether you're on an iPhone 5 5 6
6 s 7 or 7 + essentially what you do is
you plug into a computer open up iTunes
and it's gonna recognize there's a new
sim in there and within seconds your
computers gonna say congratulations your
phone has now been unlocked you are free
to switch carriers or travel the world
or go somewhere else with different SIM
card I'll just give a short tutorial
something you guys want to see more of
let me know anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed it so next tutorial I am John
