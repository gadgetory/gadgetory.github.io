release there were a lot of worries
about the battery life but come to find
out battery life was actually one of the
devices strengths allowing us to get
through a full day depending on our
usage that's about on par with other
competitors on the market we've been
using the device for about a month now
and have come up with some of the best
practices on how to extend Apple watch's
battery life even more number one is to
use a darker watch face since the Apple
watch uses OLED as its display
technology black pixels require much
less energy than any other color and the
more black you have on your screen the
more battery you can save so instead of
having a colorful watch face customize
your watch face to be as minimal and as
dark as possible to preserve battery
life number two is to adjust the screen
brightness this one goes without saying
but another way to preserve battery life
is to lower the screen brightness even
though the OLED display provides good
black levels with minimal power draw it
still needs power and the brighter your
screen is the more power it will consume
there are three brightness levels on the
Apple watch
high middle and low I put mine on the
lowest setting and found that it helped
number three is reduced haptic feedback
one of the coolest things about the
Apple watch is a new taptic engine
whenever you receive a notification or
an alert your wrist will buzz almost as
if someone's tapping you lightly while
the function of this tech is really cool
it also contributes to lower battery
life at the end of the day you don't
have to turn it off completely but if
you have the haptic feedback option and
max you have the option to turn it down
a notch or completely turn it off by
going to settings sounds and haptics
number four is to remove glances you
don't use glances pull data from your
iPhone every time you bring them up
which makes the Apple watch work harder
if you have apps to support glances and
you don't really use them just delete
them not only will you save battery life
you'll also avoid seeing stuff you don't
really care much about when browsing
through your glances number five is to
reduce motion in the same way that iOS 7
introduced various animations watch show
s is packed with subtle motions that aim
at improving the visual experience of
the software the problem is all these
animations add up and can take a toll on
the battery life in the long run now you
can turn this off by going into settings
general accessibility and reduce motion
number six is to reduce transparency
just like motions were added in iOS 7
transparency is also a big part of the
overall design language using the Apple
watch and just like motion can decrease
your battery transparency can decrease
your battery life as well you can turn
this feature off by going
into the Apple watch app on your iPhone
go into general accessibility and reduce
transparency now when everything else
fails and you really really need your
Apple watch to last longer than a day
turn on power reserve mode this will
shut down every feature of your Apple
watch but keep the time which I guess
it's basic function anyways that's an
enable power reserve mode you can either
hold the power button down for a few
seconds and enter power reserve mode by
swiping that option and you can also
swipe up from her watch face to reveal
your glances and tap on the power
reserve the Apple watch is more than
capable of lasting for an entire day
maybe even a bit more with minimal use
though these tips should help extend
your Apple watch's battery that extra
bit anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys found this
video helpful make sure to give it a
thumbs up and we will see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
