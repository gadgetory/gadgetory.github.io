tantrum technobuffalo I'm here checking
out the brand new LG g4 was just
announced in a press event in New York
City as you can see I have the mentality
backed version here but the backs are
removable and they're going to have
leather ones a really high quality
vegetable dyed leather they said takes
three months actually make it and if you
look close you can see it sort of has a
small pen to it it's not as obviously
it's curved as the G flex but we do have
a slight curve which LG says will add to
the durability of the device I just want
to go through some of the features you
have a 5.5 inch display right up front
there and it's called quantum HD air
quad HD so quantum quad HD and that
means that the colors are much more
accurate and you'd find on some of LG's
older phones and even in competitors
okay so to show off some of the features
of that quantum HD latest wanted to show
the colors and here's a video of some
raspberries I think or frozen things and
LG it looks like desserts too but LG
said that when you look at the similar
pictures and video taking on a galaxy s6
it looks sort of more orange the Reds
it's more orange than they are so
they're not as accurate that's what LG
was going for here it's much more
accurate colors she gets super smooth
it's powered by a Snapdragon 808
processor from Qualcomm we saw some of
the early benchmarks and they're right
on par with what you'd get with the ex
no ship from Samsung not a Snapdragon
810 a lot of explanation on why they
didn't do that but they didn't say that
they worked with Qualcomm for about two
years on this chip so they really worked
hand-in-hand and speaking of hand in
hand they worked very closely with
Google too they couldn't create a Nexus
device in order to appease carriers but
they did pre load it with things like
chrome and stuff as a deep default
browser so they're just trying to get
rid of some of the extra bloatware on
the device moving around the phone
though you have an eight megapixel
front-facing camera
obviously a nice UI here nothing on the
left-hand side on the back the similar
controls that we saw introduced first on
the g2 and that means the volume control
buttons that can also be used to snap a
picture the power button there we also
have an LED flash and then just below
it's the new IR sensor that's actually
used to make sure that it's grabbing the
right samples of life so that can create
the best white balance possible in your
shooting also the laser autofocus and
we've seen before and then the new 16
megapixel camera LG says is one of the
best out there if not the best up top
not a lot nothing on the right and then
on the bottom you have the time to focus
here the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and the micro USB charging port back
cover comes off and underneath there's a
3000 milliamp hour battery and you can
also expand the storage has 32 gigs of
on-board storage but I be expanded up to
technically two terabytes although
that's unavailable yet so you'll
probably just end up with uh something
like 128 gigabytes right now so just
real quick want to show you the camera
user interface stamp pictures really
quick they say you should get into the
camera mode about 0.6 seconds by tapping
the back button so that's just a hair
faster you would with the galaxy s6
which you can get into the camera about
0.7 seconds LG was really highlighting
the manual mode so right now it's on
auto but if you switch to manual I
should get a lot more controls on what
you can do with the camera whether it's
white balance exposure and stuff like
that so anyway there's a lot of great
camera controls there with the manual
methods so just wanted to give you a
quick look here at the LG g4 they didn't
announce really availability they said
it'll launch launch in south korea
tomorrow and then should be in the
united states is your late-may
early-june it didn't announce pricing or
anything like that just said it should
be on a par with what we saw it with the
g3 which means hopefully around a
hundred ninety dollars with a two-year
contract this is Todd Hazleton with
TechnoBuffalo checking out the LG g4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
