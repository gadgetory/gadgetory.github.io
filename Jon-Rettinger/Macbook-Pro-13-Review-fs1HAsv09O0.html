you of the 2.5 gigahertz 13-inch macbook
pro this is a configuration that's going
to get you four gigabytes of ram a 250
gigabyte hard drive spitting at 5400 RPM
of course 13-inch backlit LED display
and the integrated and vidya 90 400m
video processing card that we've seen
well in previous generation macbook and
current macbook pros unfortunately only
get this sucker for a few days to review
but just those few days i've really
fallen in love with it i think at the
1500 other price point the trinity is a
sweet spot of the macbook pro line you
can go for the lower end model which is
going to run you twelve hundred dollars
or thereabouts and you can upgrade the
RAM and you can upgrade the hard drive
to match the specs of this particular
model and actually come in hundred
dollars less but you're not going to get
the extra process or bump that you are
going to get with this version I think
it really hits a sweet spot for the
prosumer the user that is looking for a
little more power than the standard say
plastic macbook if you do a lot of video
editing for example this is a fantastic
machine for you i'm coming from a
baseline of comparison between an older
2.4 gigahertz unibody macbook and an
older i'm at which about a year old and
the macbook pro is significantly faster
than both video rendering times for
exporting video or about a quarter
faster battery life is stupendous this
generation of macbook pros the battery
is completely sealed inside we saw this
originally with the macbook air so
there's no way to access the battery and
really no easy way to access the hard
drive on the last generation macbooks
you could get access to the battery and
hard drive you can see right there is a
little little lever you push that this
back panel comes off and you can access
and remove your battery and hard drive
but with the convenience of being able
to remove your hard drive and with that
gone how do you think's yield in you
have a much
much more powerful battery it took me
close to seven hours to drain this
battery with normal usage so the
brightness turned down about halfway
Wi-Fi turned on browsing watching for
youtube videos I'd say typical typical
of computer usage and I really got a
very long time I supposed to say the
four and out two five hours that I got
on my macbook so it definitely is a
sacrifice you're gonna have to make you
can't remove the battery for traveling
on an airplane and pop a new one in but
you're getting a few extra hours which
for me is well worth it I've never
bought two batteries to swap them out on
an airplane you can get something like a
Mac hyperdrive for an external battery
if you need the additional power but I
think you're going to be pleasantly
surprised so who is this for I think
it's really for everybody that's looking
to get a powerful Matt I mentioned
before the video editing it's going to
be great for video editing the nvidia
processor is going to be quick for
gamers as well certainly not hardcore
gamers that need high bit rates and the
rest of the gaming business but for the
casual world of warcraft gamer it's
going to perform fantastic or game like
the sims you're not going to really
notice any sort of glitch in your slow
down it's going to run it like a champ
before gigabytes of ram absolutely make
this computer a barn burner i installed
parallels and put windows XP on it via
virtualization i gave two gigabytes of
the windows partition and two gigabytes
the OS 10 and things ran side-by-side
blisteringly fast faster than my current
macbook which only has two gigabytes of
ram for gigs really i think is the sweet
spot to get ultimate performance out of
this portable machine so why would you
want to upgrade to the more powerful
model with the dedicated video card I
think the only reason you'd want to do
that is if you're doing a lot of 3d
rendering or if you are a hardcore gamer
if you don't fall into any of those
categories the 13-inch macbook is going
to be our macbook pro rather is going to
be fantastic for you it's going to be
powerful not only that it's going to
take you into the future I know a lot of
PCs if you buy there's definitely a
little bit of worry that goes on then it
may not be future proof at least for the
common user that
always managed and maintained a computer
properly looking yet sometimes a three
to five year window I think something
like this with the you know I'm rubbing
the computer can't see it them you're
going to get a little longer lifespan or
computer like this you know something
maybe in the five to seven years if you
can keep a computer that long the
unibody construction foods you that
aren't familiar with it's made out of a
single sheet of aluminum it's got the
same feel of really all the aluminum
macbook and macbook pros it feels good
and solid in the hand it's got a nice
weight and you don't feel like it's
going to break if you drop it the
backlit keyboard is the same that we've
seen before it's fantastic and I'm
saying that a lot but it's it's just a
great computer and I'm really
disappointed at to give it back I never
felt like my macbook was underpowered
but having used this for a few days I
can definitely notice a difference
certainly I can recommend this to
anybody looking to buy a mac this is not
a Mac versus PC debate is just a review
of a macbook pro model and if you're in
the market for a macbook pro you're
getting very good value at this $1,500
price point so what do you guys think of
the 13-inch macbook pro you have an
address and buy one did you buy one too
expensive you know what do you think
