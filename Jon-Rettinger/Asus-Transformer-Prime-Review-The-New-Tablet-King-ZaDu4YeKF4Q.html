technobuffalo here with a full review of
one of the most hyped tablets of the
year it is the asus eee pad transformer
prime it is the first Tegra 3 quad-core
tablet on the market let's go ahead and
dig in and see if there's more than
meets the eye of this thin little
package
so we've had this guy kicking around the
TechnoBuffalo office for just about a
week and during that time I've had a lot
of opportunity to run it through a full
gamut of paces including seeing Asus
push out a firmware update which really
increased and improved overall
performance and we'll talk about it so
this review is going to talk about
screen speed battery camera design
browsing some of the Asus add-ons we'll
talk a little bit about the keyboard
dock and then I'll give you a conclusion
so whether or not this is going to be a
good buy for you but before we do that
let me go ahead and remind you what the
specs of this tablet are because there
is a lot of this diminutive package
first what's it going to cost you four
hundred ninety nine dollars for a 32
gigabyte model or five hundred
ninety-nine dollars for a 64 gigabyte
model and it's going to be available in
mid-december so just a few more weeks to
wait it is running Android 3.2 and will
be upgraded to ice cream sandwich in the
very early part of 2012 asus haven't
given us a full hour an exact date
except to say that it will be coming
very soon we have seen though a proof of
concept showing Ice Cream Sandwich
running relatively smoothly on a
transformer prime so expect that to come
again very soon so from a dimension
standpoint 263 by 180 point eight by
eight point three millimeters this makes
that eight extremely thin tablet and
thinner than we probably call its
biggest competitor the ipad 2 and it
weighs 568 grams it's a tablet it's
mostly a display this is a pretty
impressive display it's 10.1 inches of
course that's measured diagonally LED
backlit with the resolution of 1280 by
800 with something asos is calling super
IPS plus we'll talk a lot about the
screen they'll during the review and
it's all augmented with Gorilla Glass
battery asus claims you're going to get
about 12 hours of course got the Tegra 3
quad-core chip in it it's got 1 gig of
ram 32 or 64 gigabyte configurations on
the back of it 8 megapixel camera right
there that can shoot full 1080p video on
the front it's got a one-point
2 megapixel shooter living right there
in the middle no word yet on 3g
availability a specular model is just
going to be Wi-Fi only and that's 802 11
BG and n alright so we ran through all
the specs I'm gonna take a deep breath
let's go ahead and first talk about the
screen that's when the first thing that
I noticed when I started using the
transformer prime the super IPS plus
panel is absolutely beautiful and that I
PS power plus name is just something
that Asus kind of came up with but
whether they made up the name or not it
translates to an absolutely gorgeous
display with incredible viewing angles
actually so you can see the home screen
right here nobody's going to catch on
video and as I go ahead and move it see
it rotate that viewing angles still are
really impressive whether you're viewing
it from the side almost at a full angle
you can still very clearly see the
screen you don't get any sort of wash
out now if I pull up a website and do
that where there is actually content
there you still get that same effect
even while you're viewing text or not
viewing text the viewing angle here I
was absolutely tremendous as it rotates
all around the screen you're also going
to have pretty good outdoor visibility
as well there are some custom a su
settings that improve that all that's
going to do is increase or decrease the
brightness and we'll talk about this ace
to settings doesn't move along but if
you do a lot of your tablet viewing or
movie watching or typing or internet
browsing outside I are going to be able
to get pretty decent viewing on this so
including those that like to read books
as well images and video also look
really nice on here so let me go ahead
and show you some I'll go ahead and jump
into the gallery let's go ahead and take
a look at some of the photos that asus
has so graciously loaded on here I love
the beach let's take a look at some
beach images and obviously there's a
little bit lost in the translation
coming from the tablet to the camera to
YouTube depending on what quality or
watching this in but the screen here
does look absolutely beautiful
pinch-to-zoom is obviously very quick as
you scroll through and see different
images you can hopefully see how bright
and vibrant this is there isn't any sort
of pixilation even as you zoom in that's
probably representative of the image
here but also the quality of the display
so still images look absolutely great
but what about video if you want to
watch decent amount of video on here as
I'm inclined to think that you do video
look great on here so let me show you
some of the default ones that nvidia has
loaded on here let's show this one go
ahead and have it video on here is
absolutely tremendous as well again you
could probably surmise that from how
nice the still let me just looked the
moving images also look very very nice
so this is always a good video to watch
looks like a trailer for something
probably worthwhile so go ahead and eggs
at us still images and video absolutely
tremendous one of the strongest points
of the asus eee pad transformer prime so
no need to worry about watching video or
how it is going to look what about text
though there's probably spend a lot of
your time looking at websites in viewing
text i'm going to say what that looks
like it's go ahead and open up google
books it's going to open up the last
book i was reading with Alice in
Wonderland but it's not so I'll going to
open that up this is sort of the free
books that come with google books then
you can start to see one of these small
problems and glitches that I've had Oh
at the transformer prime there we go
oftentimes taps aren't always a
registered it happened relatively
infrequently probably one out of every
40 tabs I had actually tapped again but
of course you saw that right here on
camera text looks absolutely gorgeous on
the screen Ian as you'd expect and you
can increase or decrease brightness
depending on what's going to be best for
your particular set of eyes but no
problem reading a book here of course
pages will turn quickly that's all
pretty standard tablet stuff as you
would expect I'm not going to go through
any more pages because I don't want to
ruin the story for you so go ahead and
go back there alright so Tegra 3
quad-core how fast is this guy some
explain a little bit about how Tegra 3
works versus how Tiger q works the
initial thing is to think it's got four
cores it's going to be twice as fast as
dual core on something interesting that
asus is done they've actually added a
fifth companion core to this quad core
up so that fifth companion core is going
to do it runs at a low power low power
consumption and a low processor speed
around the 500 megahertz setting and
it's going to do a lot of the background
stuff that ordinarily all cores would
have to be doing so if you've got it
turned off or on standby in your bag and
it's pulling an email companion course
going to do that keeping video playing
you don't need all four cores for that
companion core is going to do it so a
lot of the intensive or the non
intensive stuff is going to be done the
back by that companion core which is
going to mean that only are you going to
get really improved performance about
forty percent better performance you're
also going to get better battery life at
your game something we're going to talk
about but i do want to give a bit of
perspective on how this quad core works
and it's extremely fast things here work
absolutely tremendously whether you are
opening apps or opening games or playing
games the speed and performance here are
absolutely tremendous and i think it's
really nicely illustrated by the shadow
gun game which looks absolutely gorgeous
and almost like a ps2 original xbox type
quality you've got a sort of a Gears of
War type game here shadowgun it looks
absolutely great you can use wireless
controls with this so you can use a su
sent us a logitech wireless gamepad that
we were using the game on our HDTV it's
got hdmi out on the side and go ahead
and plug that into your television but
gaming looks absolutely beautiful you
can see right here this is sort of hard
to parallel from the tablet world so you
can say looks like controls are kind of
standard it's a third-person shooter but
it just looks again absolutely gorgeous
and the performance here is great you
can see some of the tensions of detail
when you look at the background graphics
and if you see some water things here
just look absolutely great and I've said
great many times that's really what I
feel about the processor here things are
just very quick and everything opens up
about as fast as you can expect so
camera you know things are opening up
you know pretty fast go ahead and jump
on it the camera will talk again a bit
more about that as we go if you are all
about the benchmarks oh
did run an article benchmarking this guy
used a variety different benchmarking
tools including quadrant quadrants on 22
CF bench and Nana mark 2 again link will
be down below if you want to check out
the scores were moral being very very
very fast this is the honeycomb
experience that android fans were
expecting this is a tablet experience
that tablet users deserve this is the
this is honeycomb done right it's the
fastest honeycomb experience that I've
seen and that includes the previous
champ which was the Samsung Galaxy Tab
line highlighted by the 10.1 this thing
is faster it feels smoother and it feels
more elegant makes me very excited to
think about what it's going to look like
when it gets ice cream sandwich and we
start getting code and apps that are
optimized for quad core I think we're
only going to get an improved experience
again just really fast so let me go
ahead and show you what some of these
the kernel that we're running here what
the operational version is i'm sure that
asus is going to be updating this as we
get closer to release as we already saw
an update see when those problems with
the screen as we get closer to an update
so you can see what versions were
running here Wi-Fi version camera
version kernel version the build number
is what we saw the update to so when you
saw a lot of other sites that ran
reviews on this very early after only
having the device for you know 24 hours
they did not have the most updated
version of the build so go ahead and
just want to give you a bit of
perspective all right so you're getting
all of this performance how is that
going to affect battery life well asus
is claiming battery life in the
in the 12 ish our range I got an honest
nine and a half hours and that was a
nine and a half hours on about sixty
percent brightness I wasn't trying to do
anything that I wouldn't ordinarily do
with the tablet I have three emails
being pulled down pretty constantly
pretty heavy web browsing obviously
watch a lot of YouTube videos on here
nine and a half hours maybe a little bit
more but almost exactly nine and a half
was really impressive for a quad-core
tablet I don't actually heard that we're
going to be checking out Tegra 3 my
thought was decreased battery life more
cores more power that companion court
really makes all the difference battery
life has been absolutely tremendous if
you're going to use the keyboard dock
you're going to get actually close to 16
hours of battery life so no need to
worry about how long this guy's going to
last in your bag let's talk a little bit
about camera and I generally gloss over
this when it comes to tablets and phones
but there are some interesting things
here so the camera quality and camera
interface relatively standard here stuff
that you would expect from glue and put
something to frame at least from a
modern tablet you get some settings
where you can control expose your aspect
ratio picture size and ISO you can
choose your landscape go ahead and pick
some effects here if you want you want
to choose some flash settings I've got
that set on auto where things really get
interesting though is you switch on over
to the video let me show you what we've
got here now and video that little pie
chart looking thing is actually time
lapse you can take time lapse video
which is kind of neat in different
intervals of one second one and a half
to all up to 60 seconds so let me show
you what that looks like very quickly so
here's the interface yet record that
starts spin around and you can see what
it's going to look like taking a
essentially a shot every second I'm go
and stop that I filmed one earlier let
me show you what it looked like go ahead
and jump on in there's one I filmed just
filmed right now go ahead and hit the
screen see we can find the right Road
video there we go so this one was sped
up at about one second
and that was it so it looks like you
just put it on quick speed but it's nice
the processor can sort of do things like
that I'm encouraged to see what else
developers can do with this improved
processing experience let's go ahead and
jump back into the home screen and let's
take a look at browsing let me go ahead
and load up technobuffalo calm here and
this is going to show you the keyboard
which I am not the biggest fan of from a
design standpoint it's not the prettiest
keyboard but looks or one thing as far
as function goes it's actually a very
functional keyboard I do like having the
full number rose and when you turn it
sir squashes itself making it look
almost like a giant phone keyboard but
it does work very well that's more of a
personal taste let me go ahead and check
out TechnoBuffalo it we're on a pretty
fast Wi-Fi connection here browsing was
an average experience this is the one
thing that I wasn't blown away with by
the transformer prime it works it works
okay it's not overly zippy or fast it's
about average and I'm par with other
honeycomb tablets while everything else
the transformer prime does far as far as
superior browsing a sort of an average
experience could be a bit slow ECM
trying to flick and scroll there and
took a second for it to go one of the
things i do like that asus did not doing
moving my finger here for a reason on
the right-hand side hopefully you can
see that little up and down arrow
that'll let me as i select it scroll
grab it scroll up and down or defend to
be very helpful considering sometimes
the screen wasn't always working with my
finger so something to bear in mind
let's talk now about some of the asus
widgets on aces for the most part left
honey honey comb be honeycomb but really
added some nice widgets that you can
choose to use these are some of my
favorite add-ons here too when I saw
them first with the original transformer
and they've gotten better here at the
transformer prime first of all they're
not in your face they're not giant they
sort of fade into the background you can
see three males with the date the
weather and the location I liked it they
don't have a giant border on them it's
mostly a personal taste and that's that
thing but I really liked how they looked
something additions here you can see the
battery and if you've got the keyboard
dock plugged in I'll tell you what the
battery you have on the keyboard dock is
as well let me show you some of the
other widgets that we've got in here
they've got reminders you can have all
your your images sort of show up here as
well and of course you got the standard
honeycomb widgets that are going to come
here but I'll show you what the other
options are and some of the other issues
choices you can see just a few of them
right there and then you get into the
standard honeycomb widgets which become
more and more useful as the days go by
the more I use them the more I enjoy the
ability to have would it all right so
let's talk just a little bit about the
keyboard dock because without it you
can't really call this guy a transformer
it's not transforming it to anything it
just transforming to a tablet so this is
the keyboard dock this entity is going
to turn this into a full quasi
functional laptop so I'll talk about
this just a little bit and we'll do a
follow up review of the keyboard dock
$150 the keys are a little bit on the
small side you know as you'd expect from
something that sort of tablet size I to
compare it to say the apple wireless
keyboard you can see a little bit of
difference there in the size that being
said the keys have relatively decent
throat to them it's a comfortable
keyboard to type on I did while typing
was writing up a couple articles my
wrist did get to feel a little bit
cramped the angle of typing I was a bit
weird it's sort of smaller here so it
wasn't much room for my wrist I had to
almost prop them up a little bit that
may be unique to me but doing a lot
amount of typing I found it to be a bit
uncomfortable one thing I did like
though and i know this runs counter to
some other things you may have read I
enjoyed the trackpad I found it to work
very well it was pretty smooth and the
buttons here worked very very well
whether or not I was clicking and I was
able to scroll and pinch and zoom it
says have multi touch capabilities here
the best part about this tablet though
at least in my opinion the best thing it
does is it increases battery life to 16
hours and it's going to charge
tablet while you are using it which is
quite nice as well it's going to sort of
kill its own battery to make sure your
tablet can live a little bit longer and
it just goes ahead and drops right in
pull the camera up a little bit so you
can see what things look like here go
ahead and go home and I'm now have a
little bit of a cursor hopefully you can
follow it here it's right in the middle
of the screen there those sixes are then
go ahead and select it over you like so
I want to jump the settings I can go
ahead and jump into settings and I'm
using two fingers to scroll I'll show
you that here and the screen is
scrolling so something to bear in mind
is it worth 150 dollars probably I
wouldn't run out to buy the keyboard
dock doesn't add a giant amount of bulk
I would recommend this though for
students who want to use this as perhaps
a laptop replacement and really need and
improved battery it's not overly ugly
you do get a full-size living on this
side SD card slot and go ahead and pop
in full size SD cards and perhaps even
more importantly in a reason why you may
want to consider this as you're going to
get a full USB port there as well so go
ahead pull this out of the keyboard dock
and we'll continue the review and we
want to eject it just slide this thing
over and pull your tablet right out of
the top and again that did add to about
16 hours of total battery life so if
battery life is important to you or one
of those reasons I mentioned you're
going to want to consider this so I'm
sure you can surmise at this point what
my opinions and feelings are of the
transformer prime it is a tremendous
tablet and if I was in the market for a
tablet right now and if i was looking to
recommend a tablet to my audience which
obviously i am i would be hard-pressed
to say don't look at the transformer
prime it is a absolutely great
experience perhaps one of the best
tablets on the market so whether or not
you were considering an Android tablet
or not as you're doing your cross
shopping give this guy look it's future
is going to be even brighter with ice
cream sandwich but its present it's
pretty darn good it's the fastest
honeycomb experience I've seen I enjoyed
using the tab was able to keep up with
me
pretty demanding on my tablets overall
it has been an absolutely wonderful
experience and I give the Asus
Transformer Prime two very very very big
and enthusiastic thumbs up if this is
what we can expect from Tegra 3 and this
is sort of an example of what we can see
from Nvidia coming soon I am extremely
encouraged by what we're going to get
from the folks at asu's it's a beautiful
design the back is made of a brushed
metal despite my national thought that
might be plastic and actually is metal
it's got a bit of an industrial design
it's thin I love the tapered look and
feel of it screen though is a little bit
of a fingerprint magnet but most tablets
are so don't bring your pizza hands
close this guy or you're never going to
see that screen look the way it should a
few hiccups oh you know the screen
responsiveness was definitely an issue
something that will hopefully be fixed
with an upcoming firmware update we had
some issues initially getting to the doc
there are two rubber pieces that were
really wedged in there nice and tight
with no directions need to be removed
but consider this a heads up it got to
remove them but all in all very small
gripes for an absolutely wonderful
tablet i am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and this has been a full
review of the asus eee pad transformer
prime for all of our asus eee pad
transformer prime coverage of course
check us out at TechnoBuffalo com we
have unboxing reviews hands-on rumors
and a ton of other great content and
I'll see you guys in the next video bye
