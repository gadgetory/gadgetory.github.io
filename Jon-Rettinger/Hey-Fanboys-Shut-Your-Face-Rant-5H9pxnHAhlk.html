to you by domain.com what's up everyone
John rende TechnoBuffalo here with
another episode of retinues riff so this
one might qualify more is a rant so a
few weeks ago we saw Apple unveil its
latest OS 10 dubbed El Capitan and there
are some features that were very heavily
influenced or taken completely from
windows and we see things like that
happen all the time we see google borrow
from Apple Apple bar from Google
Microsoft borrow from both and I read
the comments and I see the debate that
goes on I see a ton of people saying
Apple did this first Google copy iOS
copy this Android copied that I want to
talk to you the folks that write those
kind of things let me put you in a
situation here let's say if ethically
you run a business and you have a
competitor who moved in right down the
street that does pretty similar to what
you do but those are just a little bit
better and does something different that
makes it better chances are you're gonna
adapt your business model to do what
they're doing and perhaps even do it one
better than what they've done and that's
all that's going on here if there's an
opportunity to make your product better
and say somebody else thought of it
first that doesn't mean that you can't
use it it is an absolutely asinine
argument to yell at each other that
Apple did this first iOS Android it blob
of with my mind it makes you quite
frankly sound a little bit like a little
bit like you like a tiny pet a little
bit like a pet things change companies
borrow from one another patents are
viola it's just the way things go in the
world be happy that you OS your choosing
it taking the best feature for another
one it's such an asinine argument to say
oh this was borrowed so if Apple came up
with an idea that maybe Microsoft could
never have anything similar Google could
never have anything similar it just
doesn't make sense from a business
standpoint take yourself out of your fam
bonus take that fanboy hat off for a
minute and think about from a business
standpoint why wouldn't a company want
to take influence from those features if
anything that's more of a compliment to
the company or the OS that they're
borrowing from it just doesn't make
sense and the fact that you like an OS
more than somebody else is doesn't
shouldn't matter engine impact into the
person's buying decision let people like
what they like it doesn't impact you at
all I see this happen all the time in
our comments it just enrages me people
don't think from a business standpoint
think like you're running a business and
and
see how you would run things along the
same lines of like Oh Apple is just
trying to make money I want to say like
no you're trying to make money they're a
for-profit company no Google wants to
make money they're a for-profit company
that's what for-profit companies do they
charge as much as they can do people
will still buy it it's supply and demand
curve they find where those things
intersect and that's a price they charge
if you don't them to charge it much
money stop buying their stuff that will
lower that down demand goes down the
price is gonna go down Apple Microsoft
any other business out there they're a
for-profit business they need to make
money to pay their staff to create giant
golden parachutes for the executives
they got a board director to report to
you so before you start just typing and
I'm sure you're gonna do the comments
anyways but before you start typing just
angry fanboy things think about how
companies are run from a business
standpoint and not from your own
personal perspective that might help you
appreciate this understanding where
companies make decisions that they do we

I'm gonna exhale for a minute we'll read
in the face I feel better now anyway if
you take anything from this rant that I
just went on take two things first
anything a company does to make your
experience better it's good for you
consumer always wins ever this
competition the consumers always been
what never two companies are in similar
space they bring each other up and
that's always wonderful for the end user
which is you it's me it's everybody else
was watching this video and again before
you yell about Apple or Google Microsoft
charging you a lot of money for a phone
you have a voice you don't have to buy
their product and if that's sort of the
way you want to go then you can speak
with your wallet that's a decent way of
trying get the company to make a policy
change anyway thank you guys for
