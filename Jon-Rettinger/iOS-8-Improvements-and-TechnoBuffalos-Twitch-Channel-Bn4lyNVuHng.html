to you by harry's what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of ask the
buffalo and mirrors john renders to show
where you can ask me any question you've
got more technology and sometimes
outside of it we got a couple outside of
it this week out a couple inside of it
this week we've got a nice variety of
questions that's a buffalo gonna get
started first question comes from
twitter at jack hold ass at john for
lakers what do you think of the Moto 360
you think i'll make people want to
invest in a SmartWatch ask the be a very
good question so if you use any of the
current generation android wear watches
the experience it can be exactly the
same safe for different watch faces it's
not going to be like a crazy radical new
approach android wear what it is going
to be is the best-looking approach to
android wear the Moto 360 is friggin
awesome to look at the button on it
looks like a regular dial on a normal
analog watch it just looks really really
good the watch face looks almost like
it's not even digital at all you did an
incredible job with the design so far as
I've concerns like you're wearing a
piece of art it also has some function
to it so yeah I do things like 360 is
gonna help sir push it forward it's less
sort of boxy it's less clunky and it
looks way more elegant I mean that will
help change the perception of sort of
these you know square digital looking
screens people wearing all the risks
that question comes from Peter McGinn
PhD us I really miss John buffalo's
rants riffs are nice but rants are
better what a chances of doing a blood
boiling buffalo's rands episode reten
jerz rants might be coming back it was a
show i did in place of wrist when I get
mad at something every week but the
problem is i'm not that matter person
there wasn't something that got me mad
every week and it didn't feel right to
being that I wasn't gonna fake it to
change the topic to risk but there isn't
me that pisses me off you can damn well
bet I will sit in this chair and I'll be
pissed off about it next question comes
from Cynthia joseph wright who asked if
you had to become a tech review or what
other career choice would you chosen so
before high school I was thought that I
want to go into politics I've always
sort of wanted to try and change the
world for the better but after I
finished college I was pretty set I'm
going to be a lawyer I had taken the
lsat was a test that you need to sort of
apply to law school I already started
applying to law schools and my parent
convince me after school to work in a
law firm for a year before I actually
went to school so I did it worked in a
law firm in downtown LA and I'm very
happy they sort of asked me to do that
because I hated it I was miserable I saw
the life these first year so to see it's
had and it was no life at all it just
wasn't for me so I really realized what
i wanted to do and right after that I
got into marketing and advertising which
sure got me so used to the video work
that I'm doing now I used to do a vent
mail in direct marketing for Honda and
Acura then I moved after their down to
Orange County from LA and I started to
working for the company worked at before
TechnoBuffalo where I was running a
marketing department for software
development firm so that was my sort of
career progression next question comes
from Twitter it's from chase Giles who
asked at John for lakers what phone you
find most aesthetically pleasing to the
eye and the hand so I think two things
so nothing to do with specs telephones
look at how the phones feel I think the
best looking phone right now is the HTC
One m8 i think the best phone to hold in
the hand is got to be the one plus one i
love the way that from fields back for
that device is so nice I've held a lot
of phone I really love the way that one
feels later up to questions for one
quick second ooh I've changed location
to thank our friends at Harry's listen
ticket for me starting a business is not
easy to do especially when you're trying
to disrupt the crazy old ship industry
Harry's is less than one year old and
they are offering better shaving
experience at way better prices than the
giants like and Gillette they also
make pretty awesome amazing german
engineer blades and they care so much
about quality they just purchased their
own 93 old german factory so they've got
the executive pedigree to to be
successful Jeff their co-founder also
co-founded the eyewear brand Warby
Parker which Brendan absolutely loves
and there's so many similarities too
disruptive models they pretty much
emphasized design meticulous
craftsmanship amazing value and highly
personal and dedicated customer service
so go to Harry's calm I got a hairy
forehead use promo code techno and save
five dollars off your first purchase if
you want to spend 15 bucks it gets you a
set that includes a handle three blades
shave cream shipped right to your door
Harry Chapin offers a custom engraving
option to grieve initials on your razor
so your girlfriend's what
together nobody excuses to claim he
thought her razor was yours next
question comes from Josh hey John since
you now have been doing streams on
twitch other than you games you haven't
played that you're willing to try out
are you ready for that ghost pepper
challenge if you get 10,000 followers on
Twitter in six months so we have a new
twitch channel it's twitch TV /
technobuffalo where we play the latest
games old games classic games and I will
play any game out throw their played it

technobuffalo and if we get to 10,000
followers on the channel in the first

challenge but I'll do my own twist on it
so I will eat a ghost pepper which is
supposedly what in the world's hottest
peppers then i will film a video
immediately afterwards a phone unboxing
or something we have to sort of see my
face try and open something up or do a
video i don't do that well with spicy
stuff but i'm going to do it and take
one for the team and the last question
comes from at Danny 3d who asked at John
for lakers with the iOS 8 improvements
with widgets and extendibility along
with bigger screen influence your daily
driver choice hashtag ask the beat I
really when I'm not reviewing phones I
sort of go back worth my daily driver
sort of get on an Android kick where
I'll use android for six months straight
and then I'll sort of the guy us is
easier i'll switch all use iOS i'll go
back and forth so definitely got affect
my daily driver choice and all I will
say though I love bigger screen phones
and I've always sort of liked the larger
size when my eyesight's not that bad
somethings looking Biggers always been
better for me so I'm really excited to
see what other secrets Apple has in
store for iOS 8 in the iphone 6 for the
six now whatever they decide to call it

still excited just as a phone geek thank
