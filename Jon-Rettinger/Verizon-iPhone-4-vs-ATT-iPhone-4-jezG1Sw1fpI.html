TechnoBuffalo here and the smartphone
Smackdown that I've been waiting years
to do perhaps you've been waiting to see
is an iPhone family feud
in the left hand corner we have the
Challenger the Verizon iPhone 4 and on
the right we have the defending champion
the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone 4 dressed up in white
we're gonna put these two cupertino made
handsets to a showdown and see if we can
have a winner or at the very least help
you decide which carrier is going to be
best for you so without further ado
let's fight alright so let's start off
with how the phones look they look very
very very similar although there are a
few subtle differences from the front
you've got that same slab interface
you've got the home buttons front-facing
camera on the left there are some
antenna designs that I've been changed
and whether that knock that's been to
accommodate CDMA radio that's found the
Verizon version are meant to address the
antenna issues we'll see in an upcoming
video so the one on the left here is
AT&amp;amp;T you got the same break on the
bottom left and this is the one that was
causing all those antenna problems you
still have that same location there on
the Verizon device the profile switches
here are a little bit staggered and you
do not have the antenna break right
above it on the AT&amp;amp;T phone on the right
hand side this is where the lawn of the
differences are you don't have a SIM
card same antenna lines and you don't
have the same break on 18 t phone not
overly exciting let's get to the stuff
that I think most people are going to
care about and let's talk about network
speed so right now both of these are
connected to the same wireless network
I'm actually gonna run a speed test here
to show you that so we've got the speed
test app speed test app don't allow you
to current location don't allow and
we'll begin the test on each and we'll
just to show that they are running on
the same Wi-Fi network I am gonna drop
this down however to their 3G services I
just want to give you a baseline for at
least what's
and your wife is going to be so you can
compare your 3G offerings whether it's
AT&amp;amp;T
whether not it's going to be Verizon
we've got almost identical showings here
nine point seven two versus one nine
point nine so very very close figures we
got our up and down
looks like the Verizon iPhone actually
had a little bit of a faster uptick it
was just due to testing times alright so
let's go ahead and turn Wi-Fi off now
and let's get to some of the good stuff
and test actual network speed here then
go ahead and kick Wi-Fi off we'll do it
here on the Verizon iPhone I'm gonna do
the same thing here on the eighteen T
iPhone and this is where a lot of
differences are going to come into play
so go ahead and kick that off all right
so I've got about three bars of Verizon
3G
I've got about five four bars or so of
eighteen t 3G so you got pretty good
service here so let's start with a few
web pages these are web pages that have
been loaded on each device so consider
this a test of pages that you can look
at on a regular basis let's start at the
YouTube channel youtube.com slash John
four Lakers go ahead and open it up and
go ahead and queue it up here and we'll
do a pretty simple refresh just to see
how things would look actually I'll go
ahead and type it in there we go John
for Lakers channel then we'll go ahead
and refresh these and see if there's any
sort of speed test I do want to show you
that both of these pages has of course
been on here before alright so looks
like it's just about ready here on the
AT&amp;amp;T side so we'll go ahead and hit
refresh on both that right there right
there go and go so much easier only
testing two phone sometimes when you run
these with three phones and possibly get
all your fingers in the right spot so
the AT&amp;amp;T phone definitely has a bit of
an edge here when it comes to speed
we've got the Verizon AT&amp;amp;T phone is done
the Verizon is still struggling to pull
in the content the bar is being held up
right at the beginning looks like now
we're starting to see some progress and
this is a little bit slower than I've
seen in tests off camera
but it is representative of AT&amp;amp;T s
network speeds actually have been much
faster than Verizon's so it's continuing
to finish loading here all right and it
is done all right so let's load a site
that has a mobile version for example
maybe one that has less graphics images
let's queue up here espn.com which is
gonna load up the mobile version of each
alright for our next test
let's try espn.com and again this is
going to be the mobile version so go
ahead and hit it on here and hit it on
here and we'll go ahead and let them
both load up and see if we've got any
sort of speed winner looks like the AT&amp;amp;T
clearly shows something earlier talking
about a potential Lakers Nuggets trade
interestingly enough and we're still
seeing it load here on Verizon and this
is deathly representative of real-world
speed you are going to get faster
downloads over 3G on the Verizon iPhone
when you're doing it over Wi-Fi speed
differences are completely negligible
especially around the same Wi-Fi network
not going to be much of a difference
here but you are definitely going to get
faster data speeds with AT&amp;amp;T but how
much faster let's go ahead and go back
to that same speed test app and let's
see what the difference is now again I'm
just in Southern California you may have
different results depending on where you
are but I'm pretty well blanketed and
coverage for each so go ahead and open
up both these speed test apps again
binding closest server there we go and
let's go ahead and begin the test and
this isn't a speed test of the speed
test I just want to show you how quick a
Verizon's network is here and how quick
a TI T's network is going to be so we
are loading I keep in mind you know one
megabit per second the two you know it's
probably gonna be a little down the
faster side but about what you can uh
you know what you can expect for for
average speeds ett claims their 4G HSPA+
network could pull in just about 6
megabits if you want a bit of a
comparison whereas Verizon's LTE can
pull down you know upwards of 22 I'm
actually seeing a real-world test so
we've got a giant difference here
when it comes to speed a tremendous
difference actually when it comes to
speed download and upload three point
seven megabits per second down on ET
point one four megabits per second down
on Verizon one point one one up and
point O two and you don't have to know
what those megabits mean other than
knowing the higher the number the faster
the download and the faster the upload
is gonna be on the upload one and
there's a big difference here between
point one four and three point one seven
something that I thought you guys might
want to see alright so let's go ahead
and close this let's also go ahead and
try opening some applications that are
similar downloaded and was a mega jump
here it's a free game in the App Store
I've never opened it on either device
let's see if there's any sort of
discernible speed difference here well
now I can say I've opened it on both
devices didn't quite work on time let's
try that again there we go so get set
that was clearly not an accurate test
moral being they do open up pretty close
to the same time I don't want to enable
open Fame and things look just about
identical on each performance wise
gaming is gonna be exactly the same
there really is no speed difference here
at all where you will notice a
difference so if you're using an
application that's data heavy
it's where that data is going to come
into play all right so let's talk it's
been a lot of talk actually about
simultaneous voicing data and what that
means to you and whether or not it's
going to matter in your phone usage so
let me show you what that means I'm
gonna go ahead and start loading a web
page here I'll go ahead and back and I'm
gonna pull it off to the side and I'm
gonna load let's say the YouTube channel
again solo youtube.com slash John for
Lakers and as I'm doing that I'm going
to actually call myself wallet pages
loading I'm not on Wi-Fi and we'll see
what happens so that's gonna load it's
loading I'm gonna cover up the business
here hey I don't see any phone number
action you can see that the phone is
going to actually ring while this is
going on so there you go phone is for
the green go
and that there so there is sort of your
calling while you are browsing let's try
the same thing but we'll reverse that
now we'll bring in the iPhone 4 for
Verizon and I'll load up the same
YouTube page and we'll see what happens
here as well so I'm going to go ahead
and make the same phone call let's go
ahead and hit load when I cover up with
this business as well trying dial
someone and they could see the page is
loading and it's still going to ring
there's been a lot of questions of
whether or not the phone's even gonna
ring or not it was concerned that I had
something that certainly you don't need
to worry about however if you are on a
phone call for example and you are
trying to do some internet browsing
you're not going to be able to do so on
the Verizon iPhone 4
something to keep in mind by the phone
will certainly ring if you are using the
web or some sort of other application
was a concern that I had having not been
a Verizon iPhone user before since it's
a new device I thought you guys might
have had that concern as well all
quality wise as far as a call fidelity I
wouldn't say that both Etim Verizon do
sounds equally good to my ear here in
Southern California I've certainly had
dropped call issues with AT&amp;amp;T I have not
had the Verizon iPhone long enough to
determine if those are gonna be the same
problems I can't tell you that I've
driven through areas where I
traditionally get dropped call with AT&amp;amp;T
and I have not had those problems with
the verizon phone but there may be very
fresh new dead drop zone areas with
Verizon that I'm not getting AT&amp;amp;T so
it's too early to really make a call on
that the Verizon iPhone is not really
mass available yet either
so I'm curious of how this is going to
change once there's sort of a bigger
network adoption or more pressure on the
network itself so no guys this has been
ahead Ted comparison of the Verizon
iPhone versus the 18 t iPhone which camp
are you on which is carrier of your
choice I'm very curious to hear what you
guys have to say leave your comments
