TechnoBuffalo got to do something cool
what can I do I know I'll use my time
travel app now what can I make time
travel hmm
mouse that'd be kind of a lame video
iPod that might be cool all right first
gen iPod you guys know what that means
it's time for a TechnoBuffalo flashback
let's do this
so here it is the iPod that started it
all now this is really the product that
made Apple a market leader in terms of
both consumer electronics and multimedia
however when you look at it Apple
actually started forays into both those
sectors much earlier with products such
as the power CD in fact check out this
quote from the mid 90s shortly after the
release of Apple's first portable music
player we don't just want to be a leader
in multimedia for Macintosh we want to
be a leader in multimedia period now
keep in mind this was even before the
return of Steve Jobs
so Apple definitely had its eye on some
kind of music player long before the
iPod came out of course the iPod was
their first real success in this field
it has an iconic design in fact the
design is where it draws its names from
the pod in iPod is actually a reference
to a line heard in the movie 2001 a
Space Odyssey open the pod bay doors and
you can see when you look at the
spaceship from that movie how they made
that connection
the whiting clear plastic is actually
very similar to the g4 iMac that was
released a couple months later and that
really became the standard Apple design
motif for the early part of the decade
looking at the controls the buttons are
actually around the edges of the click
wheel as integrated buttons into the
wheel didn't happen until the fourth
generation another unique feature is
that the wheel actually moves it was
until the second generation that Apple
introduced a touch wheel another thing
that stands out from modern users is how
thick it is for a device it only has a
capacity of five gigs and how are those
five gigs transferred through firewire
Apple didn't use the 30-pin connector
for a couple more generations now why
they go with firewire well even though
USB 2.0 was released at that time most
computer still used USB 1 which Apple
felt just wasn't quick enough to
transfer music
so because of this all the accessories
also use firewire 400 look at the user
interface it's of course in black and
white but it's still overall not that
different from the iPod Classic up today
many people will point to the Bondi iMac
is the beginning of Apple's current
success but it probably has a lot more
to do with the iPod as without the iPod
Apple would not be the quintessential
high-end consumer electronics company it
is today one more thing if you guys ever
need proof the tech pundits are often
wrong
I suggest googling original iPod review
in which many tech writers question
whether the iPod would be a success at
all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
