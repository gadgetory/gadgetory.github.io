from TechnoBuffalo here this is
definitely going to be one of my more
random videos but there are two simple
things that I wanted to show you I
figured instead of just breaking them up
and putting them into separate
minute-and-a-half videos I would just
combine them so let me show you the
first one and it actually is a web app
that comes on every iphone it's just a
bookmark it actually walks you through
all the steps to the iphone it's great
if you don't know how to do something or
if you have a friend or parent or what
have you it doesn't know how to use an
iphone you can just send them this link
and really they'll be able to learn
everything they need to know so you'll
go to Safari hit bookmarks scroll down
to the bottom and they'll be one down
there that says iphone users guide and
go ahead and tap that and the URL I'll
show you guys case you are interested
it's help apple.com / iphone / 3 /
mobile but it'll be on everybody's
iphone just in the bookmark so i'll put
a link to it in the sidebar as well and
you get a pretty nice-looking web app
which actually lets you look at all the
different things you can do arrange my
icon let's say I want to look at mail I
can go ahead and tap mail these
information on setting up an email
account sending an email and it tells
you right there how to do it and it's
got information for everything totally
cool if you're unfamiliar how to do
something kind of go through and give
this a look and you will be learned Ned
in no time now the next thing I want to
show you is an app which was partly i
bought at a curiosity and partly because
it's useful this one is called load
offender locator and just says locator
right there essentially what it does is
find sex offenders in your local area
and you guys might be laughing but it's
important to know where people are if
you have little kids or if you're an
uncle like me or your grandparent
everybody's got a right to live where
they want to live but if you own a bank
and the bank robber moves in next door
you might just want to know so let me go
ahead and show you what this looks like
and you can find out sex offenders
really anywhere so you can use it by
current location contacts address
or enter street address so we'll use my
current location will allow it and I'll
show you what this looks like Andrea
lets you identify people or real quickly
so here's a full list of names that is
public domain of people that are
registered sex offenders right in my
area very close by and you can select it
and it'll give you a picture and a name
of what they did um you know I know this
sounds kind of bad but it's just you
kind of want to see who's around you and
see you know what they've done or what
that one did haven't dipped on everybody
like I said as a right to live but I
kind of just want to know who's living
nearby me so anyway just a real short
video to show you guys these two things
hope you enjoyed for exclusive content
be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter.com / drawn for lakers and to
learn more about the upcoming
TechnoBuffalo check out technobuffalo
calm or twitter com / technobuffalo
and i should mention that this offenders
app costs 99 cents see you guys the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
