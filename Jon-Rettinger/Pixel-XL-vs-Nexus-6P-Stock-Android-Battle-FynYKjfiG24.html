TechnoBuffalo here at the pixel Excel
and the now outdated Nexus 6p a lot of
guys want to see some comparisons how
these two look 5.5 inch screen here and
a 5.7 inch screen found on this 6p a
lots been made about those bezels
they're on the pixel exile you can see
how they compare very comparable it's
what we've got on the pixel XL the
screen though on the pixel X that looks
way better than what we have on the 60
rest the specs even upped a little bit
here for Giza Ram as opposed to three in
the 6p the megapixel just stayed this is
close the same at least twelve point
three on the XL and twelve point three
on the 6p so bear that in mind
fingerprint sensors are both in the back
on the same place the suppose that the
cameras are way better here on the XL we
get that back in the lab of course we
will test it but the big design
difference is no camera humps that we
have really well pronounced on the 60
that is gone on to you guys real quick
overview in comparison for these devices
see how they compare and see what you
think obviously got our skin on this so
tough to tell design in the sixty but at
least looking at how the 6p looks you
really start to see I think it pretty
clear difference here between the two
the leaks on the XL didn't do a justice
for how nice it looks in the hand so
bear that in mind again side whether or
not to buy what do you think are you
guys gonna upgrade from your 6p or
you've been waiting for the pixel XL I
wonder your thoughts in the comments
down below until next time I'm John
