transparent as we start a review of the
BlackBerry key - I was super excited
when this phone came in and usually I
can put my exuberance or lack thereof
depending on which phone I'm reviewing
aside but the Corgi key - got me pumped
but now after almost two weeks of using
the phone did that excitement stay I'm
John render from TechnoBuffalo and this
is our review of the BlackBerry key - I
was a pretty big fan of the key one I
like to stop and reveal of BlackBerry's
UI but the keyboard was just too cramped
for my taste in a display left a lot to
be desired but man that sweep battery
life but I am happy to report the
BlackBerry fixed most the grapes the
physical keyboard which I promised I
will talk way more about is now 20%
larger it's actually taller going to be
more specific
making typing surprisingly easy I still
have like a two to three day learning
curve to readjust my brain and my
fingers get used to a physical keyboard
but once I did it was great and the key
throw is tactile enough to be satisfying
that's a word the same around the keys
are matte as opposed to gloss which
decided from just looking better
drastically improve the typing
experience so a cool thing about having
a physical keyboard
aside from surprisingly being a really
good conversation starter is each key
can essentially be a shortcut it sounds
awesome in theory but in practice it
wasn't fully baked - last gen you got to
be exited out of an app and on the home
screen to call up a shortcut it was
still useful but not as much as it could
be so enter at the speed key that little
nine dots towards the bottom of the
keyboard fixes that issue and lets you
access shortcuts from any app all i got
it was just push it and then the key
you've got assigned and i want to give
blackberries credit here for listening
to feedback the keyboard is also kind of
a trackpad letting you scroll through
websites home screens or anything else
that you'd have to use a touchscreen for
it's a really nice touch I found myself
getting used to the keyboard the
functionality provided granted trying to
type in numbers is sometimes tricky with
the Alt key but it's a very small
compromise and when I was happy to make
blackberry changed a lot about the key -
but one thing they didn't change the key
one is it
which is kind of a bummer size-wise it's
still good it's 4.5 inches it gives you
plenty of real estate
the 433 PPI and 1620 or by 1080 panel
just looks man to me now I get some
compromises had to be made to hit that
650 price tag but I do want to mention
is $100 more than the key one when it
launched but color going in it's not the
strongest part of the phone also note
the three-point you aspect ratio is
going to take some getting used to
what blackberry didn't bring in the
screen Department they certainly did in
the RAM category surprisingly this comes
with 6 gigabytes the key one started to
really bogged down for me after a few
months so I'm gonna assume the extra RAM
here will help during my two weeks the
phone felt fast and fast as any other
phone even those with a faster
Snapdragon chipset but I will be looking
for slowdown as we do our longer tests
and do a three month later video if you
guys want another area that's improved
is just the overall build of the phone
it's pretty awesome a blackberry is able
to increase the keyboard size and keep
the overall size of the phone the same
and there's no getting around the this
feels like a brick design language but
at least no knotch
so blackberry moved all the keys to the
right side of the device this time which
is nice and always the convenience key
can be mapped to anything you want
imagine that me I just mapped it to the
camera and since I set myself up
perfectly for that smooth transition
let's let's talk about the camera it's
got two on the back which blackberry was
super pumped to point out as a first for
them the cameras aren't really
remarkable both are 12 megapixels with
one being telephoto giving a 2 X optical
zoom prick tably it also gives portrait
mode that's the price of entry in 2018
I'm not gonna go too much into it but it
does a pretty solid job at the bouquet
blur the rest of the pictures are
unremarkable not bad just not amazing
color reproduction is good low-light
shows a ton of noise if you zoom in
you're also gonna see a ton of
artifacting a lot of replacing a DSLR
with this you'll be disappointed and
also never do that with the phone if you
want an average shooter the moral is
you're gonna be fine
the front camera is 8 megapixel and
surprised that you do full manual
control for everything except for out of
focus that was a nice surprise a 35
hundred million power battery would be
big for any phone when you factor in
this
sighs with a phone running a less
power-hungry processor and a screen
that's not pushing crazy pixels you've
got something magical professionally us
a holy battery this thing lasted longer
than anything else I can ever remember
testing I could easily get through two
plus days of usage which for me is
unheard of especially with my borderline
phone addiction if you own a phone is
the best battery life to get a key to be
done with it
when you eventually charge it you can do
it via USB see it's compatible with USB
power delivery 2.0 and quick charge 3.0
although I guess I'm nitpicking here but
wireless charging would have been nice
on the software side it's Android 8.1
base and is really close to a stock
Android one experience and I'll admit I
did try to make it a pixel beary with
the launcher during my last days testing
but I do really dig what BlackBerry's
done it didn't owing me a little bit for
the dock has an icon taken up by the app
drawer I just got really used to the
swipe up on other phones the
productivity tab you can swipe into was
also surprisingly useful DTEC adzick of
security but honestly if you like a
stock android feel this phone's going to
be very familiar so the key to is not a
perfect phone and it's clearly not for
everyone but I'd imagine you already
know going in if this phone's going to
be for you but you have an open mind
what you're gonna get is a Productivity
powerhouse a phone that a lot of people
are gonna want to talk to you about
keyboard that offers a ton of shortcuts
and a phone that's overall a pleasure to
use and it's going to last you for days
and days which is really rare in today's
power-hungry smartphones so question I
asked the beginning did the excitement
and wear off on the key - and the answer
is no it didn't I really enjoyed using
the phone I'm wary of that slowdown on
the lack that I had with the key one
again I'll be watching for it but if you
want a phone that's gonna be great for
productivity it's gonna be point for
typing emails it's gonna be different
than what else is out there and do it
all without having a knotch and not
break your bank but break e2 is a really
good choice so reminded me of the old
days reviewing the BlackBerry again what
do you guys think about the key - I'm
generally curious if you would buy it
650 bucks will not flagship price it's
still competing with a lot of phones and
a lot of
are very well SPECT if you're gonna pick
up the key - I'd love to know why if
you're skipping it also let me know in
the comments down below and of course
all the other stuff please that YouTube
makes us do because I don't send
notifications anymore subscribe and if
Cobell to get notified in theory when
new videos are coming out we got a lot
of awesome stuff coming new vs videos
new series launching I don't want you
guys to miss anything
so next time John render from
