retinue and I've been talking about CES
for a long time because I love this show
and if you're like me and you want
experience kind of what it's like to be
here I've got something for you so I am
at the Bosch booth
obviously CES 2019 and I want to show
you a glimpse dramatic hands of the
future so come take a tour of the booth
with me and a big shout out and thank
you to Bosch freshly spawned today's
video so I don't know what's gonna come
it's like a giant lady surprise but like
I might not be the best cook in the
world I do make a mean bowl of cereal
but if you are more like cooking
inclined when you start working with
stuff around your kitchen your hands get
like your hands naturally get gross
so we got pie here they do not have
punch to go with it but pie is a new way
to serve it interact with your tabletop
and you'll necessarily need even need
this screen this can project right onto
your countertop and you can put the
interactive it it's a full touch screen
you can pull up recipes take even pull
up cameras to show you who's at the door
it'll automatically show you how to
slice a piece of pie appropriately
named-- it'll show you how to cook a
steak or how long you should cook it for
it's gonna take that experience of
cooking and stuff you can rarely join
your phone and keep it in your pocket
and let you literally work with your
countertop because future and I guess
because present it's here I'm using it
you know what stinks mowing the lawn
know what you don't have to do anymore
you can probably guess where I'm going
so this is indigo s+ it's a robot that's
gonna mow your lawn and now you have
another excuse to be looking at your
phone because you can control indigo
from just your phone so indigo is gonna
actually make a full map of your entire
grass area it'll go and clean it when
it's got a chart itself it'll go back to
the dock and then it'll go back this
boss didn't mist and the first question
that I asked and it would seem like an
obvious one but never know it's
waterproof you can leave it out in the
rain and also will detect when the grass
is wet and it will wait until the grass
is dry to cut it because you ever tried
to mow like wet grass that's tough ruler
tougher even a robot
so I've rode ridden I've been on a
motorcycle twice in my life and I
promised my wife that I wouldn't do it
again but Bosh is giving me a shot for
that third time on a bike with a brand
new suite of safety and convenience
features things that you kind of expect
from a modern car are making their way
to this gorgeous look in a motorcycle so
here's what we've got we've got full
surround sensing functions with radar in
front you've got adaptive cruise control
to make your ride just a little bit
easier you're also gonna have and
probably most importantly forward
collision warning and you think like
that would be something you would
absolutely want in a motorcycle and it's
all kind of put together at least here
in a really seamless package so I want
to ask you an honest question can I pull
this off please tell me yes all right so
I'm sitting in an Audi a3 e-tron but not
just any howdy a3 e-tron we look at
school this one's at CES and a poof I'm
joining is convenience charging so this
is gonna use algorithms and radios on
top and a bunch of Technology and like a
smidgen of magic to help you determine
how you're gonna drive it'll tell you
where charging stations are to learn
your behavior they give you promotions
if you want to charge it like a
Starbucks and they're also giving away
free coffee you can do that it's gonna
learn what you do and it's gonna adapt
your electric car to do that for you so
two things are happening here at the
Bosch booth we're making dreams and
we're making memes and we are at the
meme generator and I've got I'm just
gonna say it internet celebrity Shaunie
