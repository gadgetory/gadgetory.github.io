to you by Lumosity what's up everyone
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley ask ever any question you
might have for the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo calm
you could leave your question in the
post comments or you can send them to me
at any time of the day or night at
technobuffalo or at actually a scab on
twitter but make sure you use the
hashtag ask the be so i can see it and
usually i answer between three and five
questions every episode let's get
answering this is ask the Buffalo
technobuffalo user merica asks hi Ashley
what is your perceptive point of view
now that apple will most likely join
Samsung in the plastic phone market
obviously a lot of people have you know
gotten on Samsung's back about using
plastic for the backs of their phones
but we have to remember that the iphone
5c is going to be an emerging market
device meaning it's going to be
inexpensive it's meant to be plastic I
don't think that they would want to use
something like glass on the back of a
device or anodized aluminum of course
nobody would get on samsung for making
one of their smaller lesser phones have
a plastic back but of course if it's a
flagship you wanted to have the most
premium quality materials possible don't
you I mean that's the thing with me and
Samsung that's the reason why I'm not a
huge fan of the sgs4 its design but to
each is on some people really love it
and of course it is removable which
means you can switch out the battery
twitter user tech for geeks asks so the
Moto X was unveiled today will this be a
hit to the market considering there are
other Google powered smartphones that
are more up to date with software and
internal hardware the google edition 1
and s 4 for example thanks we are going
to have a moto x that is a google play
edition device so i don't think that we
should be worried or i don't think it'll
be a hit to the market i do think it's
very interesting that motorola is kind
of aiming for a mid-range large market
with the Moto X as opposed to their
droid line which is very high-end
flagship specs I'm really curious to see
how that moto x google play edition does
l twitter user gadget guru HD says what
are your thoughts on the Moto X is it
worth the 199 price tag and do you think
we'll see a lower google play edition
price I don't know about the lower
google play edition price I know some
people had suggested that maybe people
who are buying the stock version of the
Moto X the black or white version
without any customization should get a
break on price however at the end of the
day I don't think that makes sense
because then you're kind of killing the
reason to get it customized so if you're
kind of charging people a premium for
those custom device modifications then
it kind of doesn't make sense and I
don't think anybody would pay the extra
you know let's say 50 bucks or 20 bucks
or whatever to get it customized as for
the Moto X itself I think again like I
said it's it's very much targeted at a
broad audience so this is not a phone
and necessarily necessarily for you and
me we are tech nerds we are hard diehard
gadget people we want to know the specs
we want to know everything about the
device it's got to be the best of the
best of the best and we're willing to
pay for that however this phone is 199
contract this is a little bit brutal for
anybody looking for a device especially
now that we've seen the HTC one down to
ninety nine dollars on contract and the
sgs4 so this is definitely a really
interesting move by motorola and not one
that I'm sure will pay off so it'll be
really interesting to see how this
device actually sells when it comes out
for all five carriers at miu Felix asks
how do you judge Samsung's manipulation
of benchmark tests to get a higher score
this is a kind of scandal that happened
earlier this week where it was revealed
that Samsung was manipulating their
devices to get higher benchmark scores
but I think at the end of the day we put
too much stock and he's ridiculous silly
benchmark tests it's sort of like when
sites do things like run special video
software to loop a video over and over
and over again to kill the battery I
mean for me that's not how people use a
device in real world and the thing is is
regardless of what a benchmark score is
on a device at the end of the day it
really boils down to how the device uses
in your hand during the day while you're
out and about you're not going to say to
somebody yeah man this this phone
benchmark 12,000 564 you're never going
to say that to somebody but you are
going to say
this phone is so fast it is so smooth I
love it I use it every day I've never
had it slow down so I think we put a
little bit too much stock into
benchmarking but for the people who
really do put a lot of stock in it I do
think it's a little bit obviously it's
cheating if it's the case I mean
allegedly samsung is doing this so I
don't think it's very cool so if you're
doing it Samsung you should stop there's
nothing I love more than finding new
ways to make myself a little sharper
upstairs so I'm pretty excited about
Lumosity it's kind of like CrossFit but
for your brain and with fun games based
on neuroscience to help improve its
performance you can build your own
training program to help enhance your
memory and attention and I think we all
know we can use a little more focus in
the world of YouTube videos apps and
Oshea me I'm sorry I'm sorry obviously I
need some more work but it's easy to see
where I stand with luminosities detailed
training summaries I can keep track of
progress and see areas where I need
improvement over 40 million users have
experienced the brain sharpening power
