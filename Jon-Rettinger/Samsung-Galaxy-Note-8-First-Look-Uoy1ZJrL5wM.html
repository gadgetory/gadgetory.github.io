chance to take a look at it today
there's a lot of stuff going into this
device and a couple things that make it
unique from previous and no devices
first notice it's got two cameras it's
got a telephoto and a wide-angle and
both of which actually have optical
image stabilization Ram has been
improved from four to six gigs and of
course since the notes of ice there's an
S Pen living on the bottom right
I see 68 as well so you can get it wet
and be okay or maybe you want to take
notes underwater a couple cool things
Samsung did with software they talking
about how to notice all about
productivity there's nothing called apps
pairing in edge panels you can take two
apps really whichever apps you want
create one icon and when you click it in
the edge panel it'll launch both apps
for you so for me that would be
something like Gmail and Chrome but
maybe it's like a dialer and calendar
for you it just saves the time having to
go through and pick the apps and set it
up yourself run me out to the rest of
the specs Snapdragon 835 Rams gone up
from four gigs to six there's fifty four
gigs of internal storage of course
that's expandable with micro sd in the
US the colors you're getting at least
right now are midnight black and Orchard
gray other parts the rope it doesn't get
this beautiful deep sea blue and there's
a maple gold color as well
and I feel like something I got to
mention now it is headphone jack is
still here and inside the box features
have headphones that are tuned by AKG
you should get a nice sounding earbud
right inside the box of course other
stuff you'd expect to be here USB see
he's got fast charging wireless charging
and ip68 on the entire device the screen
here of course the Samsung screens that
looks incredible if there's Super AMOLED
technology it's 6.3 inch here so point
one inches vary on what you get with the
Galaxy S a plus in the hand the phone
has a bit of difference feel it feels a
little heavier than what you get with
the Galaxy s8 line of phones is a thirty
three hundred million power battery in
here so it's a little bit bigger on the
battery side I like the way this if I
feel a little more blockers and you get
with the s8 or the SI plus but overall
the phone feels nice in the hand and
you're getting a big 6.3 inch screen and
not like what used to be a Galaxy mega
size package so big screen small package
and of course infinity display here as
well this is a Galaxy Note 8 is it can
attempt
to upgrade up from a Galaxy s8 or as a
plus to shy away from picking up the
latest from Apple so relook to be a
really nice phone in a nice package but
of course when we get it back in the
studio we will test it anything you guys
want to know about the device leave
their comments down below be sure to
answer and make sure we focus on that in
the full review pre-orders are going to
start August 24th and devices will be in
stores on September 15 so next time
genre enjoy some TechnoBuffalo
