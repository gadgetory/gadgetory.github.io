and I'm Matt Gonzalez and behind us we
don't have just any ordinary
TechnoBuffalo video we got one that goes
super fast so this is the 2018 ow t TT
RS like john said go super fast it's
taken up to the maximum and I'm gonna be
talking about the performance here I
have an Audi and I drive it every day so
I kind of you know get what they're
about but I'll talk about the
performance I'm gonna talk about all the
technology and this thing is a tech
powerhouse on wheels so walk you through
all the performance I love technology
and hopefully maybe by the end you want
to show out for a TT RS for yourself
daddy's got some of the best tech in the
car industry so for me the TT RS is just
a way to get into that technology but
obviously it looks like a pretty sweet
car
Matt's got opinions on the looks I'm
saying it looks rakish and Sportage but
Matt so I mean I like the TT for the
longest time I wasn't the biggest fan of
just the way it look the styling but I
think with this latest 2018 model
they've kind of hit it out of the park I
think the front end is one of the most
mean that you can find especially in its
segment but I think this is a great
update and especially in this RS Varian
when you have the new bumpers and you
know the exhaust in the back I think it
looks great but one of my favorite parts
for sure is the anterior so let's go
check that out
does any of you sitting any sort of
modern outie to teach ers included
you've got virtual cosplay and it should
be pretty obvious why it's called
virtual cockpit it is a bit strange to
not have a secondary screen which I'll
talk about yeah that's definitely
interesting although I will note that
you know other models of how DS like the
a4 the q7 they do have that center
screen so this is more unique to this
car in particular but you can do a lot
with virtual cockpit the way you
navigate
you've got knobs dials galore so first
thing I'm looking at right now I've got
Google Earth just front and center
because the screen though you can
control what you see there so a lot of
ways to work it hit a View button you
can control you know whether or not
you've got the gauges on the side you've
got power and torque and it's got a lot
of technical thing you've got things
like apple carplay support there's no
touchscreen here so again it's all with
the knobs and then we're gonna use it
the more intuitive I think it becomes to
use some of the cool things I think
about the customization they've done at
the TT RS and you get a lot of you know
racing options and to go through a lot
of granular things about the car do like
a G meter and such on here so if you're
interested in that kind of stuff you
want to take your DVRs to the track but
you definitely definitely should do
you're gonna get a lot of a lot of tech
crammed in here a couple other awesome
things that you've got it's got its own
LTE connection you've got something
called a bee connect it's getting let
you show you things like the news it's
gonna show you whether you're gonna see
even parking spaces that are available
nearby
even's got Twitter integration built in
it is a fully connected car which makes
the technology really awesome that's
here now I'm I don't think you should be
tweeting or anything while you're
driving we've been reading a Twitter
feed but if you're parked and your
phone's not handy it's nice to have it
up it's also kind of cool to see the
weather it's gonna give the other
connectivity like flight information
it's really just a step to shows this is
a very connected car so while there's a
lot of Technology in the virtual cockpit
it is missing
some stuff they would have liked to have
seen I would like to seen cross-traffic
alerts I would like to see adaptive
cruise control you know this obviously
gives a car meant for speed but it's a
cart you're gonna be stuck in traffic at
some point yeah although I will say like
you mentioned this is a performance
oriented car and if you do want those
features you can get them in other cars
at howdy makes and of course has the
backup camera but one of the things I
think we are missing having an secondary
screen up here is the pup thing in
Reverse your cameras gonna show up in
the virtual cockpit but if you're
turning the wheel you got to kind of
look through and that's it's an
interesting thing you definitely have to
get used to and that's probably my
biggest gripe of not having the center
screen not having it as interesting it
perhaps my favorite thing they pretty
much just took the steering wheel from
the r8 the flat-bottom steering with a
big red engine start/stop button on it
is absolutely incredible and there's a
lot of attention to detail in the car it
obviously you've got carbon fiber
everywhere but the way you control the
air-conditioning and the speed of the
air those little screens that are inside
of the vent the small touch makes you
really appreciate it I think all the
technology and craftsmanship that's gone
into the car and familiar with a lot of
Audis now you know MMI it's a like I
said it's a jog wheel and buttons but
it's also a trackpad inside of that jog
wheel so if you're a navigation for
example you can start to just write out
the letters or the numbers of where you
want to go you don't want to do that of
course you can just use voice but it's
pretty cool to able to use that as a
trackpad not having to sort of look
couldn't put your eyes elsewhere
so with a car like this you really you
just have to drive it we've got a 2.5
litre five-cylinder engine under the
hood it's producing 400 horsepower 354
pound-feet of torque so I mean this is a
monster now the engine is connected to a
7-speed dual-clutch transmission no
manual option here although if you are
going to have an automatic tool clutch
it is the one to have and this one is
great when you're driving around
normally smooth you really don't feel
the shifts but once you start going a
little bit fast it's a very snappy
shifts are very quick downshift sound
great and all of that power is then sent
to all four wheels Quattro now this is a
Haldex system it's not your traditional
mantra that you might be used to so what
that means is it's front-wheel baiance
so you're gonna get most of the power to
the front wheels and when it needs to
it'll send it to the back now driven
pile deck system cars before and I don't
really like them that much because they
feel front wheel drive even though they
are all a drive but I think this one's a
little bit different it's tuned a little
bit differently it takes more inputs to
send power to the rear wheels and when
going around corners I feel with this
one you're getting pushed a little bit
more than you're getting pulled so
there's almost no body roll in this car
at all yeah so we have the upgraded
steel springs those are the more
performance oriented but you do get
magnetic ride if you don't opt for these
steel springs and what that means is
you'll be able to change the kind of
comfort level so if you're you know
getting groceries or whatever you can
make it nice and soft but when you want
to go to the track you can make it stiff
we don't have that option we feel every
single bump but you feel very confident
that this car is gonna pretty much be
able to do anything you throw at it the
cars kind of got a bit of a split
personality if you just want to drive it
to the grocery store and you don't want
it you know get to the grocery store in
like four seconds yeah you can still
drive it like a normal car normal car
and if the noise engine though it's
gonna sound awesome but it can still
drive like a normal car it's really
smooth but if you want to have that
the transmission gives you an awesome
way to serve obviously put into sport
mode but also you can shift it over you
can do this shifting yourself either via
the paddles you know or the gear
selector - I love having that but you
don't have a traditional manual yeah you
can at least do it yourself
and what's the drive select options
that's quite an own you tame down the
cars yeah into your comfort mode it's
nice and quiet civilized but in the
dynamic and sport mode and you're off to
the races
also when you're coming to a stop we
have the optional carbon ceramic brakes
so first of all you're going to stop and
second of all when you're stopping a lot
they're not gonna fade which is a great
time yeah big breaks and bad a second
calipers yeah so as an overall
experience driving this car I I've
really enjoyed it
I've taken in the back roads a little
bit and even though it was raining
unfortunately I couldn't push it quite
to its limit
but it's fun and it goes around the
corners really well it has all the power
that you need pretty much especially if
you're just driving on the road if you
don't plan to take this to the track
this is all the power you can ever want
they were really used on the road yeah
it's also a tech powerhouse too and the
technology that's inside of this car is
amazing for obviously the LTE connection
gives it connectivity what you get with
that LTE connectivity you're getting
Google Maps you're getting Google Earth
you're getting the ability to see the
news and the weather the information
about your car it opens up a whole other
realm of possibilities you can do when
you've got that connectivity and then
Marder something like the beautiful
screen you've got a virtual cockpit it's
pretty sweet it's really the whole
package with the pprs you're getting
like most of the way to like full Fast &amp;amp;
Furious and it kind of depends how you
evaluate the car if you look at it it's
75 thousand dollars for a car then yeah
it's definitely expense aside if you
look at it for performance for $75,000
the TT RS is competing against cars that
are having more than double its price
you're getting an incredible value there
so to come down to what you want in your
car if you want crazy fast with launch
control and really cutting-edge tech TT
RS is a pretty awesome choice a lot of
the tech review TechnoBuffalo we buy
ourselves but we're neither scratch to
drop on a TT RS so thank you daddy for
sending us the car and for sponsoring
this video yeah and be sure to let us
know what you think of the car and if
you enjoy videos like this be sure to
