from TechnoBuffalo here it's time to
take back your old iPhone 5 or 5s from
your mom cuz it looks new again today
Apple unveiled the iPhone se II looking
all dolled up in its previous generation
glory this time though it's also
available in rose gold essentially what
Apple's done is taken the innards of the
iPhone 6s and crammed it in a 4-inch
package so a lot of hardware here you've
got the 64 bit a nine chip with the m9
embedded coprocessor you've got similar
battery life as the iPhone 6s the same
12 megapixel camera that's also going to
shoot 4k video way more LTE bands 50
percent faster than it was before in 802
11 AC onboard the new generation touch
ID we also have built-in NFC and secure
element so if you worry about your
element not being secured don't worry
your element of it will be safe also
support for hey Siri and sorry about
that it turned out most people's phones
including my own pricing is gonna start
at 399 for a 16 gig phone 499 for 64 gig
but don't be too sad it's going to be
free on a two-year contract for 16
gigabytes so better figure out which
pictures are important to you
pre-orders are gonna begin Thursday
March 24 or you can't go the store and
buy it if we're watching this video long
after that and then be available in
stores come March 31st so what'd you
guys think about the iPhone se if you
followed the rumors and follow
everything it's been going on there
should be very little surprises here but
if you don't follow the rumors
hey 4-inch iPhone Apple claims they sold
a lot of four inch phones in 2015 thirty
million to be exact so a lot of people
are probably excited about a smaller
package they didn't skip on the hardware
16 gigs not the biggest fan of it but if
you can figure out how to manage your
storage rely a lot on cloud you could
make it work for a pretty reasonable
starting price I guess that's gonna
depend on your wallet go to your
thoughts I don't leave in the comments
down below hope you guys enjoy the video
check us out at snapchat at Buffalo snap
until next time I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo
snap you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
