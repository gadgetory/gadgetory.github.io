technobuffalo here now that the ipad 2
has been out for just about a month i
thought i'd be a great time to set back
we've had some weeks elapsed since the
initial review period and see if one I
thought then is true now and decide if
the ipad 2 has a place in your home as
your tablet of choice let's go ahead and
get started so as i mentioned in my
initial review the ipad 2 fixes
everything that I really never thought
was wrong with the iPad 1 it is
thirty-three percent thinner I never
thought the iPad one was relatively fat
it is noticeably faster I never thought
the iPad one was slow the a5 processor
which offers dual core processing speed
in addition to the extra ram we're now
up to 512 megabytes definitely makes for
an improved experience and where you
notice that isn't really an apple
launched speed if I go ahead and launch
CNN it'll launch relatively same from
what it did with the iPad 1 and if you
want some more comparisons of the ipad 2
vs ipad 1 links going to be down below
if you want to check that out but what
this does do we notice a big difference
in speed is actually in the web browser
so i go ahead and open up safari here
let's go said i want to launch
technobuffalo for example it launches
much faster than i saw on the previous
generation ipad and again when you watch
the comparison video you'll notice that
speed difference really where you notice
it isn't going to be when you have a
fast Wi-Fi connection or i've noticed
this to be difference is actually on the
3g side 18 tease 3g networks again
another video done on this are
noticeably faster at least
hypothetically from the verizon cdma
network however due to the increased
horsepower of the ipad to verizon's 3g
cdma now where tends to load faster for
me than AT&amp;amp;T is on the ipad one bit of a
convoluted way to say the extra
horsepower really translates increase
speed nothing really do with the
network's themselves just they're able
to process information that's coming in
much quicker i didn't have an issue with
the ipad one as far scrolling goes
little boxes that show up when you
scroll but this does sort of fix any
problem that might have been there
pinch-to-zoom really does work nicely
the addition of the cameras is kind of
blah I believe Chris Pirillo was the one
that said you can literally have minutes
of fun with the camera applications and
that is quite true here is photo booth
for example I have honestly never used
photo booth outside of my initial
demonstrations idea for you guys you can
see all the cool little motions here i
have used facetime once I've taken
probably three pictures with the ipad 2
now that might be just unique to me the
facetime feature if you live abroad or
you travel a lot might be a killer
killer killer must have feature for you
at least for me it hasn't really
translated too much use the cameras were
really much ballyhooed you got to have
cameras you got to have cameras you got
up cameras even by me as well I'm
finding myself now that I've got the
cameras I can see them front and back
I'm not really using them something to
keep in mind the next big addition with
the ipad 2 was the smart covers which
have been sort of lamented has been
grossly expensive and they definitely
are grossly expensive you can see it
sort of fall right in there I've got the
red leather one here they do offer a
decent round of protection for the
screen however go ahead and kick this
display off they do leave a bit of a
mark on if you can see that on camera
but where these ridges hit the screen
you do get a bit of a smudge something
to keep in mind they offer a bit of
functionality I like how when you type
if you go ahead and do your little
triangle motion there get that raised
surface I found that to be very useful
and a very welcome addition when I'm
typing do I think it is worth the money
no I most definitely do not if you wanna
have a smart cover just because the
magnetic business is kind of cool and it
is very cool and go ahead and do so know
is going to protect the front of the
device but you are not going to get any
story protection for the back so my
advice is to get a full case for the
ipad 2 and have something that's going
to offer that increased functionality of
the raised surface as well most cases
now have some sort of a little bit of
mechanism the back that'll raise it up
for when you're typing or I'll prop it
up for
you want to watch movies I do think this
is a worthy upgrade to the ipad 1 the
increase in speed alone something again
that I never thought I needed has been
very very welcome to me especially while
travelling abroad using the earner
traveling abroad but traveling out of my
home when I need to use the 3g radio has
really been welcomed it's much faster
than I saw with the ipad 1 do I think
that you should get an ipad 2 if you
already have an ipad 1 the answer is an
astounding no there's really very little
reason to upgrade at least from my
standpoint from the current generation
ipad if you don't have an ipad and
you're saying well should i get the ipad
2 or should I even wait a year for the
ipad 3 go ahead and get the ipad 2 it's
going to work very well you might be not
have some of those features you might
see the next generation but you'll
always find yourself playing the waiting
game ipad 2 just came out if you need a
tablet this is probably the best one
available right now if you're saying
well i can get a cheap ipad one now and
not get the ipad 2 that is also a very
decent way to go however if you don't
have a device right now you may want to
pay the premium to upgrade to the ipad 2
versus the discounted prices of the ipad
1 the increased speed which is not
something that I really thought was
going to be that important when i did my
review but the more i use the device the
more I appreciate that increase in speed
also new in the ipad 2 is colors I've
got a white version right here and I
wish that I got black this is going to
be a personal preference thing whether
or not you like the white of the black I
think the white on the iphone 4 looks
absolutely fantastic I think it looks
classy and I think it looks unique on
the ipad 2 I think the white looks a
little bit cheap and to be quite honest
I'm really worried that my red smart
cover is going to rub off this is going
to turn pink or have some sort of
coloration I haven't had that problem
yet but definitely something that I am
concerned about really in conclusion the
problems I've had with the ipad are the
things i have lamented on many many many
occasions and that is iOS itself it has
not changed really much at all since its
launch in debut in 2007 I think the
notification system is extremely
obtrusive
I think the way that it handles
multitasking is quite archaic really
just an app switching system here and i
think that the lock screen is such a
joke when you lock the ipad you really
have no information that's this way when
you're trying to mock it other than the
time date if you've got a password you
can go ahead and put that in you can
access in pictures but you don't know if
you have any emails in there and seeing
things like Motorola's honeycomb that
offers new lock screen functionality
HTC's flyer coming out then it has
improved lock screen functionality you
actually open applications from your
lock screen really shows where iOS is
deficient something that I love to see
improved anyway guys what do you think
about the ipad 2 did you pick one up how
have your opinions changed or not
changed since since you picked it up and
since the release i just want to hear
what you guys have to say leave your
comments down below all the videos
mentions are going to be down and what
have you be sure to check them out i'm
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
