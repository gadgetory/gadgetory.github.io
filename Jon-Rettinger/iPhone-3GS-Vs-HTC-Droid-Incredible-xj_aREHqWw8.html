free technobuffalo here there are a lot
of fantastic smartphones on a variety of
different platforms on pretty much every
major carrier however to really stand
out I think ahead of the pack that's
sort of leading this rivalry we've got
the iphone 3gs by Apple on AT&amp;amp;T and we
have the HTC built droid incredible on
verizon wireless's network so we're
going to put these two guys head to head
and let you guys make determinations
which one's better for you there's so
much to cover they're gonna have to be a
multi-part video in this part we're
going to cover browser and app speed
tech century UI navigation scrolling
notification and apps that's a lot to
cover but we've already started going
through at the hands on let's go over
some of the geeky geeky specs so you
know about the differences between these
two first the iphone 3gs was actually
announced i believe back in june of 2009
so almost about a year old hardware the
incredible was just announced actually
April fifteenth and is coming to verizon
wireless on the twenty-ninth this one is
a cdma and this one is running on a more
global standard GSM the dimensions here
of the droid incredible it's 4.6 three
inches by two point three five point
four seven ways four point six ounces
the iphone 4.5 x 2.4 x point 48 and
weighs 4.76 so the iphones a bit a bit
heavier the droid incredible has a
resolution of for a by 800 and the
iphone has resolution of 320 x 480
certainly the incredible has a higher
resolution screen iphones got 3.5 inch
diagonal capacitive touchscreen whereas
the incredible has a 3.7 inch capacitive
touchscreen the big difference is 0 or
what you're going to see when you flip
some of these things over looking at a 3
megapixel camera on the back with no
flash as opposed to an 8 megapixel
sensor on the back with dual-led flash
design decide it's going to come down to
personal preference this one is
supposedly race car inspired
more a sleek and smooth it looks like
these little bumps or ridges add some
heft to the device but actually they
don't these may have seen during my
unboxing alright so now that we've
served gone over some of the specs and
the last one that I wanted to talk about
was battery life we're looking at about
a hundred and forty six hours of standby
time on the incredible and about 300
standby time on the iphone total hours
talktime on the iphone and about five
hours of top time on the incredible so
you're probably going to get a bit
better battery life with the iphone so
enough of these specs let's go ahead and
show you some stuff there's a lot to
talk about i use a mobile web quite a
bit i rely on it for work and I rely on
it for really most of my web browser
because I'm sure a lot of you guys to do
as well so I want to show you the web
browser spirit will compare speeds both
of these are connected to the same Wi-Fi
network so will be a fair test we're
going to load up TechnoBuffalo or rather
a refresh it's a site that's been put on
both devices this will be a test of a
site that you visit on a regular basis
so here it is here I'll go to browser on
the incredible thanks we're going to go
ahead and try and refresh both at least
close to the same time which is actually
harder than you think it would be so I
hit the iphone just a little bit later
actually than I did on the incredible
we'll see if that still translates to a
faster speed through credible looks like
it's just finished up or still loading
rather now it's done and the iphone is
just finishing up but since i hit them a
little bit later it probably was pretty
close to being the same let's go ahead
and load up another webpage here that
should give a better sense of speed will
load a site like sabbath engadget com
and we'll see what this feeds are on
these sites and they've been loaded on
both devices as well so we saw the
incredible load it much faster this
pulled up the mobile site whereas the
iphone pulls up the full version and I
will tell you that during browser speeds
I really did get pretty reasonable
speaker persons for each let me go ahead
and stop this we're going to launch the
full version of both at least you can
get a better sense and those are hit a
pretty much the same time and in really
every page in every test that I've
loaded the incredible does seem to come
in at a little bit faster when they're
using the same Wi-Fi network certainly
when you're using verizon VS AT&amp;amp;T it's
going to depend on your location you can
see the green bar on the incredible much
farther ahead now so they finished up at
almost the same time there is a speed
difference with the incredible it's not
incredibly different but there's
definitely one there so let me show you
something else with these phones that I
think is very important let's go to a
site like flash calm I which is of
course run by Adobe so you go to flash
calm or any site that has flash content
on it on the iphone or any of the I
platform so the ipod touch or the ipad
you're going to be greeted with to do
this experience you need flash player
and that's been a big sticking point
with a lot of people with the iphone
however if you go to flash calm on a
device like incredible you're going to
be greeted with a very different
experience because incredible does have
full flash support when you go and you
can play flash games you can access
website with flash based content the
first thing that I thought it was while
i can watch hulu on here you can
actually not watch hulu on your mobile
phone well it does have flash who
doesn't allow it unfortunately you can
see the contents are at the buffer up
and stuff starts moving around it's a
bit choppy but you can see there is
flash contents and all of its glory
playing and loading
a mobile device to difference between
the two here not bad actually let's go
ahead and get out here
go back a web page here we'll go back to
technobuffalo and let me show you how
the navigation works on the browsers up
for each I'm go ahead and go back so one
of the nice things about incredible is
it does shift with complete multi-touch
and pinch to zoom similar to what we
seen on the iphone so you can zoom in
relatively fast as well zoom into it
article you want you can double tap and
you can off to that page same thing here
at the iphone pinch-to-zoom before you
want double tap to zoom in if you want
to do a lot of fast scrolling often
times you see a checkerboard pattern at
the bottom of a page because the
processor hasn't caught up to where you
are so let's see how the scrolling
actually works like to see if we get
that checkerboard pattern will go to the
top and we'll scroll down the FAFSA
weekend I actually saw it right there on
the iphone it shows it very quickly but
you do see a little bit of that
checkerboard let's see if that happens
here on the nexus one and go tog not the
nexus one rather incredible actually you
don't see that I'm incredible at all the
Snapdragon processor can more than keep
up with the fast web scrolling something
to keep in mind there are a few other
sort of cool tweaks that you can get
with the incredible browser if you go
ahead hit menu your tabs for example or
windows is that column you can serve
scroll through and see multiple windows
here you just get a sort of a
rudimentary list so that's browsing it's
a very similar experience however from a
browser standpoint having flash and
having the option to view flash content
one of the biggest deal to me it's
certainly nice to have an art time that
I appreciate it so from a browser
standpoint the edge definitely has to go
to Android and incredible really does a
fantastic job now one thing that I do
need to mention is incredible is running
Android 2.1 of HTC's Sense on top of it
sense sort of a skin on top of Android
and that skin is what's giving you the
flash capabilities not all Android
devices with 2.1 can run flash content
something to keep in mind let's check
the speed of some general apps that you
may use on a regular basis open just
calendar and browser and
you know see how quickly they go so
again open up calendar on each year got
them both ready to go and we'll see how
quickly things open certainly different
applications but just a sense of how
fast things go or slow they go so I
missed there on the iPhone track one
more time so a little bit slower on the
iphone not by much but definitely a
little bit try that one more time so
there you go speeds on each you're
actually very quick they load relatively
fast well go ahead and watch for example
the marketplace on each whole launch the
app store and entering market will talk
about apsa later a little bit later and
now they are different applications they
both sort of load it up relatively
quickly sort of loading more dynamic
content this one was already queued up
that's one of the feature you might be
might want to notice is the androids
actually running the marketplace in the
background since it does support multi
task and it came up right away the
iphone for example does not support
multitasking right now but it will
sometime the next few months when iphone
OS four point out comes out so we're
going to have to do sort of a retest but
for right now multitasking is not
supported on the iphone so next let's go
over to text entry certainly both these
don't have physical keyboards so relying
just on the screens for inputting text
the iphone 3.5 inch screen and the
incredibles 3.7 inch screen is the extra
point two inches is going to matter as
far as keyword real estate well let's
see i'm going to go and open up notes
and open up a new node application and
we can see how typing actually works on
this so like most touchscreen only
phones get two ways to type you get
portrait and if you rotate it you get
landscape i think that the iphone has
probably one of the best auto correction
features and it works very well so let's
test this in portrait and landscape and
in full disclaimer i do want to let you
guys know that i am an iphone user so i
am a bit more familiar with the iphones
keyboard then i will be with androids
but i'll do my sort of usual test of
typing and all right this is a test so
this is a test not a problem try it
landscape
so I misspelled a few words but did see
that it works and I tried to hit
spacebar twice end up hitting the sea
key to get a period so there's a little
bit small keyboard Fatima's accurate
punctuation not so much so let's try
typing here on the incredible will go to
messages I'll type a new message debt to
compose alright so let's try typing the
same thing this is a test and of course
you get the portrait and landscapes as
well so we'll try the same thing this is
a test so misspelled it but the
autocorrect and Android is actually
almost as good as what's found on the
iphone if not as good so the androids
autocorrect is really fantastic and
worked very well now they keep what
you're seeing is not the stock android
keyboard get you get on the nexus one or
any other android 2.1 device this is
actually HTC's own keyboard so i can go
ahead and type it that way if i want to
go ahead and switch over to landscape
let's try this one more time so made a
little bit of mistake there but having
really not use this for very long i can
see myself getting used to it very
quickly however there's one other way to
import text that i can't do on the
iphone that little icon right there let
you go ahead and talk and talk some text
into it let's try this again this is a
test of the keyboard i'll show you how
that works this is a test of the
keyboard so I spoke it and it typed
right in it this is a test of the
keyboard kind of a cool way for
attacking quick tech messages your
emails it actually works really well so
as far as typing keyboard to keep what I
think they're both pretty even auto
correction features I think they're
pretty close to even however have being
able to talk another text come in gives
the incredible a definite edge here so
we will close out of this close out of
this let's go over and move on to user
interface this is a sort of an interface
overview of iphone OS 3-pointers that
that can do and android 2.1 with
sense on the incredible there's not much
you can do with user interface or
customization here I you're limited to
just rows of icons and certainly what
four-point-oh comes out you'd be able to
have folders and then we do a little bit
more customization like changing
backgrounds and multitasking but for
right now this is what you're limited to
you can sort of view other icons you can
see what's there you can move them
around if you want to sort of just hold
them and do a little jiggly dance the
dragon where you want but pretty much
interface is limited to an icon tray
here on the incredible and with HTC
Sense on top of it you get a bit more
options a lot of cool features are
widget based and we'll cover sort of
more of these widgets in part 2 of this
video but let me show you some features
that you get with HTC incredible so I
feature here called bleep which you take
your two fingers and do a little pinch
to zoom like you do on a website or a
picture and you're taken to a jump
screen I'll take it all your home
screens they actually can have seven
home screens here on the incredible each
one of these you can jump to see
whichever one you want and we have four
active here I can jump right to that one
I'll take me right there you can tends
to zoom right out I can jump back to my
main home screen if I want to activate
that screen without doing the pinch to
zoom think you just hit home and it'll
take me there as well there are a ton of
witnessing customized here so you have
got a contacts widget over there I've
got a weather widget over there and
there's a ton of choices if you tap that
down that you can see many many
different widgets that you have
available and again I'll cover these in
upcoming videos so you get a lot more
functionality with the home screens then
you do on the iphone if you want to the
icon array you can sort of still sort of
have those or if you like the way this
is set up on the iPhone you can set up
your icon to just be lined up on any
screen you want I do like the multiple
home screens you can have one screen for
your email one screen for your social
messaging feed one screen for all your
contacts and favorites and having seven
really makes it a nice option so from a
UI standpoint a customization clearly
you have to give it to the incredible
right now notifications are sort of
interesting on android on the iphone
notifications are generally a push-up
settle or
they're push notifications that will
show up and you can choose to ignore
them or go to them you also get mail
notifications down below notifications
here on Android platform done by a task
bar top you can sort of pull down that
window the application could show up
right there you can sort of make that go
away it's about a tie here depends on
your personal preferences and what
notifications you like you know you can
see them on different screens I like
sort of seeing a number of messages i
have show up right there some people
might prefer the android pull down or
the individual notifications on the
applications personal preference I'm not
going to give this one to either because
really it's six or half dozen let's go
ahead and talk very quickly about
applications because both these devices
have pretty robust app stores certainly
the iphones app store has significantly
about more however the android
marketplace has many more that are free
and that's even growing by the day so
you go ahead and download these things
pretty regularly and go ahead and find
what you want hit download and you can
just go ahead and download it you can
view them by ABS game different
categories again this one's going to be
personal preference to the particular
app that you want that's only on one
platform you're going to prefer one over
the other if they're sort of cross
platforms and you know you're going to
be happy with either so when you put
these two things head to head and you
know we're comparing here almost your
old hardware versus hardware that's not
even out yet actually it doesn't come
out for another few days as a filming of
this video it's very clear which one is
moderate and which one offers a bit more
that definitely has to go with the
android and credibly or the droid
incredible you get just much more
options and a lot more customization as
well as navigation options the iphone
i'm stuck with just my finger on this i
can still use my finger or i can use the
optical trackpad here to control things
as well so they're just many more
options more customization options the
including a flash is a huge deal not
personally for me but for a lot of
people flash is a must-have so you get
that on a device like the incredible
back to buy verizon's
network so when you put these two things
at the head at least in this round it's
gotta go with the incredible so do you
agree disagree am I just completely off
base here I'd really like to hear what
you guys have to say about these two
devices are you excited about one of
them are you holding off for iphone OS
four point oh or an iphone 4g before you
make a decision are you ready to jump
into android pick up and incredible I
know you guys for all your tech news be
sure to check out technobuffalo where
you can create your own sub blog and
