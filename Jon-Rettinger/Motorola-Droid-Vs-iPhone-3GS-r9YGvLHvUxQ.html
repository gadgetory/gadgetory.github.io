get closer to the holiday season there
are a ton of hot Wireless handhelds
either out or coming out and probably
two of the hottest of the hot as the
iPhone 3GS and the Motorola Droid the
iPhone 3GS is running on AT&amp;amp;T network
here in the US and the Droid is running
on Verizon's so we're gonna put these
two Ghoulia's head-to-head we're gonna
cover browser and speed text entry
customization scrolling navigation apps
and maps and a few other little things
along the way so let's go ahead and get
started the first thing you're gonna see
when you want to look at your device
it's going to be the unlock screen the
unlock screen on the iPhone is pretty
simple slide to unlock there's no other
functionality there you just slide to
unlock the unlock screen on the droid is
pretty similar but has a few tricks up
its sleeve so if you want to unlock it
it simply slide to unlock just like you
did on the iPhone but if you want to
change the ring style from vibrant to
ring or vice versa you can actually go
the other direction sound is on do it
one more time
sound is off kinda cool this is
something that'll be found on Android
2.0 let's go ahead and unlock it and
let's continue with our tests I think
the first thing that everybody wants to
see is why our browser speed and how the
browser's work on both devices so these
are each running on the same Wi-Fi
network so it'll be a very fair test of
speed
well test 3G speeds of each afterwards
but just know that the running on the
same network so it should be very fair
we're gonna load TechnoBuffalo on each
so it has been bloated on both devices
before so this will be a fair test of
visiting a website that you check out on
a regular basis so first we'll get it
queued up here on the iPhone 3GS
TechnoBuffalo hit the browser here as
well and there it is
in bookmarks so we'll go ahead and try
and launch it at the same time and see
how we do okay
they are both off and again connected
over Wi-Fi you can see the progress bar
across
the top of the Droid so we can already
start viewing the page on the iPhone but
it's not quite complete yet there it is
on the Droid and the Droid is done and
the iPhone is still loading which is
actually very impressive the hardware on
the Droid it is quite nice and the
iPhone now just finished up let's take a
look at how the browsing navigation work
on each so if you want to scroll through
obviously you can use your finger and
both have capacitive touch screens and
one of the things I like about the
iPhone is that you never get that
checkerboard like the screen is
refreshing as you're going down the
content always seems to be there if you
want to zoom it you can do it one of two
ways you can either double tap to zoom
in or it can use take advantage of the
multi-touch capabilities the phone has
and use two fingers to pinch and zoom to
wherever you'd like notice right here
there's a youtube video I'd go ahead and
hit play and they'll open the iPhones
built-in youtube lighter won't play it
on the screen since both phones don't
have flash but when you've done viewing
the video take you right back
certainly the phone's got an
accelerometer so when you turn it into
portrait you can view the page that way
as well let's see how the Droid stacks
up certainly it looks very similar move
that a little bit over scrolling it's
also very smooth no checkerboard pattern
there if you want to zoom in you can do
it one of two ways as well you can
double tap similar what we've just seen
and it zooms in double tap again to zoom
out you don't have multi-touch gestures
here zooming is primarily done via
navigation on the bottom you've got two
of our glasses plus or minus certain
thing I prefer the multi-touch but this
is a very nice implementation and it
really works quite well and the YouTube
videos here will play much the same way
I can hit play it'll take me to the
built-in YouTube player and come back
I'd say really the only difference
between the browsers is the multi-touch
capabilities on the iPhone the browser
on Android 2.0 is fantastic if you like
what you get on the iPhone you're gonna
like it equally I think on Android just
need to get used to the lack of pinch or
zoom if you're coming from an iPhone if
you're not used to it you're never gonna
know the difference
browser for browser I think that these
things really keep up with well with
each other the speed of Android on Wi-Fi
and the speed versus the iPhone 3GS you
saw that is a difference so we're gonna
have to call this one I think a little
bit of a draw because of the multi-touch
capabilities on the iPhone but the speed
of the droid it's really going to come
down to which one you prefer which one
your network of choices so right now I'm
going to go ahead and turn off Wi-Fi on
each and we're going to run the same set
of tests over the 3G networks okay next
we're gonna test 3G browser speeds of
both devices I've got five bars of 18t
3G and I've got five bars of Verizon 3G
so it should be a relatively fair
comparison keep in mind this is gonna
vary depending on your 3G speeds on
where you are but here in Southern
California you can least get a sense
we're gonna load up engadget.com and
again this is a site that has been put
on both devices
so again it'll be a test of a site that
you guys on a regular basis so it hits
load here and we'll hit go here try and
get at the same time all right and both
are off you can see the yellow bar on
the Droid and the blue bar on the iPhone
they already started viewing content on
the iPhone but not yet on the droids
there it loads up on the droid looks
like both are just about at the same
point
alright the iPhone has finished and now
the droid is still loading
and now the droid is done so over 3G to
3G looks like AT&amp;amp;T speeds were just a
little bit faster and the navigation is
going to be exactly the same as I just
showed you
I think browser to browser again it's a
very very very close I think that's the
browser on the droid it's actually
fantastic and much better than the
browser on Android 1.6 that you'd find
on other Android devices so let's go
ahead and move on to the next round and
we'll make this text entry let go to the
home screen of each so we'll start again
here with the IFO and I'm going to go
ahead and open up a new email message so
text entry
is really done only one way on the
iPhone via virtual keyboard either in
portrait or landscape and before I get
into speeds and how easy it is to type I
should say that I am an iPhone owner and
I've been using every iteration of the
iPhone so I'm very familiar with the
keyboard on the iPhone the Droid
certainly just came out so I have not
had a chance to become as accurate with
it as I am with the iPhone I do want to
give a little bit of a caveat there in
all fairness so you can type anything
that you'd like and you can also type as
well in portrait I'll do a real quick
test you guys can see with the keyboards
the on-screen keyboards look like as you
select a letter you can move your finger
around you can see what letter you're
typing I think that's a very handy
feature and Apple's autocorrect is
really quite accurate so just in
landscape I'll do a quick test and I'll
just type but this is a test so that was
pretty quick again I am familiar with
the keyboard we'll try that in landscape
again nice and quick so we'll open up a
new email on the droid and we'll see how
text entry works as well on this okay so
I've got a new entry field here and you
can enter text in one of two ways either
using the on-screen virtual keyboard or
the slide-out QWERTY so I'll go ahead
and open up the virtual keyboard and I
can't say I've used the virtual board on
older Android devices one-point-six
devices and speed and accuracy has
really been improved with 2.0 to get the
same sort of thing as you move your
finger over you can see the letters and
it does have autocorrect and
recomendation here so I will type again
this is a test and we'll see how it
works so you can see as I typed our
letter down below that give me
suggestions for that like so a little
bit of an accuracy and I can double tap
the spacebar for a period but I did get
this is a test now one of the nice
things about the Droid and I think one
of the biggest drawing points is that
you don't have to rely on the virtual
keyboard if you don't want to
because it has a full slide-out QWERTY
keyboard now this is an interesting
chorded keyboard and some questionable
decisions were made by Motorola's design
team you've got a pretty spacious QWERTY
keyboard but there's a lot of space and
real estate that's been taken up by this
d-pad it's a five-way keypad you can
actually select it in the middle but the
keys you can see angle it up they're not
really raised there's no doming to them
so it's hard to feel a difference
between each key I think the more you
use a keyboard in order to get used to
it
let's go ahead and type out this is a
test again on the QWERTY keyboard and
see how it goes this is a text not a
test so a little bit hard to get used to
I think like one of those things the
more you use it the more you are going
to get used to it I am one of the few
that probably one of the many rather
that prefer a physical keyboard to a
QWERTY so I got to give this round
slowly - to the droid I think the best
implementation I've ever seen of a
on-screen virtual keyboard is the iPhone
but there's very little substitute for
having actual tangible keys and you've
got the option for using the on-screen
keyboard for quick text entry it's not
bad on the droid it's not the best
physical keyboard that I've seen I think
that crowds got to go to the tilts - or
the touch pro2 depending on where you
are but it is a very very very good
implementation so the next round is
customization now the iPhone is known
for being very closed and not offering a
lot of customization at least within
Apple's confines you can configure your
homescreen and arrange your icons that's
really the the biggest level of
customization that you get droid and
Android in particular offers a high
level of customization certainly you can
customize the icons any way you want
move them around just as you could on
the iPhone but you can also put on here
these widgets which you can see I've got
a few here this one is YouTube this one
controls my device manager and Wireless
this is one for Facebook and there it's
fun of different options to go ahead and
hit the home screen widgets and there
are more that are being added pretty
regularly and you can pick whichever one
you'd like
one of the things about Android is it's
completely open source so you can
customize this any way that you'd like
so from customization certainly it's not
hard to be Apple since they don't really
offer a high level of customization so
this also has to go to the droid so
means there are a ton of rounds that you
could pick or i could skew it one way or
skew it the other but I'm trying to pick
the rounds that I think most people
would be want to use and most people are
really the most curious about selects
let's talk about scrolling one of the
things that touchscreen phones and one
of the things that I've seen with
Windows Mobile is as you scroll you get
that checkerboard the screen can't
refresh fast enough to get to where you
want to go and I think that you can
illustrate scrolling very easily with
contacts I'm gonna open up contacts on
the iPhone I'm going to show you how the
scrolling works it's very quick and is
kinetic as I let go it keeps scrolling
and I never get a checkerboard pattern
the processor keeps up with everything
that I want let's take a look at
contacts on the droid and see if it does
the same thing camera focusing and it
definitely keeps up just as fast and
it's got the same kinetic scrolling as
well it's got a big bar across the side
we can navigate to the letter as you
like so scrolling equally fast on each
note processor lag and it can certainly
keep up with any of the scrolling that
you'd want to do this one I think is a
draw so next let's move on to maps and I
think that this one is something that
people really want to see on Android 2.0
because as you might know or maybe you
don't know Android 2.0 offers free
turn-by-turn directions which I'm going
to demonstrate in an upcoming video it's
just going to be an overview so we're
going to focus on the native map
applications that come Google Maps on
each so let's go ahead and open it up on
the iPhone so they both have GPS so you
can really zoom in and see where you're
at and sort of get a better sense of you
know what you're looking at you can view
by traffic you can view my map satellite
hybrid or list you can get live traffic
and you can do routes and they'll tell
you where to go it's not you know
certainly turn-by-turn like a Garmin or
a Nuvi but it will
give you driving directions it'll tell
you when to turn and you can follow
yourself along is the little blue dot
and blue pen moves along and it seems
it's web-enabled the maps are always
getting updated the points of interest
and such you're always getting updated
and you can search and call for phone
numbers right from the screen so there
are sort of two map functionalities
found on the droid first we'll take a
look at Google Maps which certainly
compare below what we're looking at
right now so you can zoom in or zoom out
just as you could on the browser with
that plus or minus again you can use
multi-touch with the iPhone to zoom in
or out so one thing that this has is a
thing called layers let me show you what
these layers are open up the menu and
you see there's one right there called
layers now this lets you add 12 layers
over your map so you can add traffic you
can add satellite you can even add
Google Latitude to see where your
friends are or even Wikipedia to learn
about landmarks that you may be walking
by or driving by and there are more
layers so you can view your map driven
transit lines if you want to see where
the subways and stuff go I'll show you
what that looks like we'll go back to
Maine Maine and old Joe a traffic so it
give you a sense of what we're live
traffic is where I'm at right now on a
Sunday afternoon things are pretty clear
Google map for Google Maps functionality
about the same you get a few more
options with the layers that you don't
get with the iPhone but I think that
eventually those options will come over
to the iPhone but what the Droid offers
that the iPhone does not is turn-by-turn
directions similar to what you get on a
Garmin or a Nuvi and I think eventually
this will come to the iPhone but right
now it's only found on Android 2.0 and
the Droid is the only Android 2.0 device
so we'll hit car home and you can use
voice search to pick a location and you
get free well turn-by-turn directions
I'll show you very quickly what this
looks like and again in the limit of
time I can't do the best
so I'll cancel that out search South
Coast Plaza that's a local mall by me
so there's South Coast Plaza I can go
ahead and hit get directions and it'll
start routing me to where I want to go
eat in the browser or
Maps and again it'll be a full
demonstration of this and how it works
but you do get a very robotic lady's
voice telling you to turn left on
actually give you the street name so the
last category we're going to look at is
the App Store and the App Store on the
iPhone you see it everywhere there's an
app for that there's an app for that
because there really is an app for that
the App Store is huge and growing and
there are a ton of free applications I
think this is one of the things that
separate the iPhone from the rest of the
pack
however Android Marketplace has gotten a
redesign and is really becoming almost
as full-featured there are a bit more
applications in the iPhone but to really
make up for that mostly applications in
the marketplace are actually free we're
getting a phone call here we'll ignore
that it's rotate to ignore and as you go
you know you'll see that most these are
free so app for app I think that there
are more in the obviously Apple App
Store but there are more free options in
Android so it's really going to come
down to personal preference so in
conclusion I think both these devices
really are fantastic and offer some
functionality not seen in others if your
get better a teensy reception I think
the iPhone 3GS is better what better way
to go
if you get better price and exceptional
you can pick up the Droid and I feel
like you're losing anything you're gonna
get a fantastic device if you get both
good reception for each device it's
gonna really come down to which one you
like you know I think the iPhone OS
becoming a little bit stale so if you're
getting bored of the iPhone and your
contracts up you know picking up a droid
you're not going to lose anything you're
going to get a increased functionality
with the keyboard turn-by-turn
directions and they're going to get the
openness of the Android platform so guys
hope you enjoyed this comparison
