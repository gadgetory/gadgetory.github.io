to you by carbonite nintendo's possible
new IP a Skyrim otter gets a triple a
gig double fine gets two of its eye peas
back and gran turismo 6 let's get out of
controller hello and welcome to
controller the weekly technobuffalo show
that covers all your gaming news reviews
demos and new releases an easy to digest
capsule form I'm your host Ashley sceva
it's always a big week in gaming so
let's start out with the news an
interesting tweet is generating a lot of
rumors this week after tekken producer
katsu hero Harada responding to a person
inquiring about the status of pikmin
designer masamichi ave parado claims ave
is working at nintendo kyoto on quote
some nintendo original title could it be
a new nintendo IP is in the works obvi
worked on the first two Pikmin games
metroid prime hunters and Mario vs.
Donkey Kong minis March again so it's
entirely possible he's toiling away on a
new 3d SI p for us to enjoy of course
nintendo did not bother commenting on
her oddest tweet and we don't really
expect them to especially surrounding
this potentially huge story afnan Tendo
did have a new IP in the works i wonder
what it could possibly revolve around if
you haven't heard of alexander veliki
he's a 19 year old whiz kid who taught
himself modding over the course of a
year long educational project he built a
massive Skyrim mod as a resume hoping to
land a gig at Bethesda unfortunately he
didn't get a job there but it's not even
close to an unhappy ending because below
he now has an official job as an
associate designer at bungee yes that
bungee but like he didn't even believe
he had a chance at landing a gig at
bungee but apparently they felt
differently and now this guy will
probably be working on highly
anticipated game destiny it's an amazing
story and we just wanted to commend
Alex's dedication to teaching himself
modding and following his dream of
working at a triple a game studio yeah
you Alexander when publisher THQ of
bankrupt indie darling
game studio Double Fine wasn't able to
acquire the distribution rights to their
games costume quest and stacking Nordic
games on the other hand didn't pick up
the two properties at auction and in a
delightfully kind twist has handed them
back to Double Fine all that news would
be pretty great by itself but in
addition to Double Fine getting those
games back the two Studios announced a
distribution partnership that will see
costume quest stacking and one of my
favorite platformers of all time
psychonauts on the same disk seriously
have you guys played psychonauts the
milkman conspiracy level is amazing I'm
on the road crew let's play as a feature
on our gaming channel where a member of
our writing staff plays a game and talks
about it over the footage we're still
