Sangin from technobuffalo and we've been
playing around with iOS 9 for a few days
now testing out features like smarter
search that improve notes and more and
so far everything is working out great
but we've also found some cool features
and additions Apple didn't discuss at
WWDC and we thought we'd share them with
you first up is a new option for the
ring and vibrate switch this is an
entirely new to iOS since the iPad has
added this feature for a while but in
iOS 9 iPhone users will now be able to
switch between lock rotation or mute
when toggling the ring and vibrate
switch above the volume rocker a neat
little addition that I personally enjoy
there's also iCloud Drive which was
introduced back in iOS 8 however in iOS
9 you'll be able to access the app by
enabling you through the iCloud Drive
settings inside the settings app inside
the iCloud Drive you'll be able to check
out all of the files you have stored
like your pages keynotes and numbers
documents as well as your other personal
files you also be able to delete files
directly on your iPhone and those
changes will automatically reflect
recording ly to your other devices the
podcasts app has been redesigned as well
showcasing the same overall design as
the revamped music app with a new now
playing mini player there's also the
addition of the unplayed button which
shows all of the podcasts you haven't
played yet and the my podcast section
now shows a list of your podcast with
information instead of the usual
thumbnail artwork next up is the ability
to toggle the flash on and off while
recording a video previously in iOS a
you were only allowed to toggle the
flash on and off before starting a video
but an iOS 9 you can do so whenever you
want in the Notification Center there's
a new widget for battery which can show
you how much battery is left on your iOS
device and your Apple watch and we
already talked about Siri in our hands
on video but the thing that Apple didn't
mention is that when you activate Siri
by holding down the home button your
iPhone will also vibrate it almost feels
like the same haptic feedback you get
with the Apple watch more of a tap than
a jarring vibration going back to the
Settings app and going into photos in
camera there's a new option in the
camera selection that allow you to
change the settings for video you'll now
be able to choose between 720p HD at 30
frames per second 1080p at 30 frames per
second or 60 frames per second for the
iphone 6 and 6 plus specifically you'll
also be able to change the frames per
second in slo-mo between 120 frames per
second and 240 frames per second going
back apple also added a new search bar
in the Settings app that lets you
quickly locate a specific setting not a
huge feature but
definitely handy when you need to access
a specific setting right away a new
feature specifically for the iphone 6
the messages app now displays photos
with contacts instead of just a name
previously photos for contacts were
limited to the iphone 6 plus and when i
actually switch from the bigger iphone
this was one of the features that i
really miss inside the mail app not much
has changed here but you can now add
email attachments to messages in a mail
app which can source documents from
iCloud Drive a very useful feature that
I'm sure a lot of people will start
using now since Apple changes apps which
are removing quick contacts and
replacing it with card like elements
you'll be able to access your contacts
by going to the proactive menu by
swiping to the most left of your home
screen lastly let's talk about the new
font San Francisco we first saw this
font on the Apple watch and it's now on
iOS 9 in my opinion it looks stellar and
I think it fits well with the other
elements in iOS 9 anyways that's all we
have for this video Iowa sign is still
in its first beta so what you see today
might be different when the software is
available this fall if you guys have any
cool tips and tricks you found on the
first beta that we didn't show today
leave them in the comments section down
below as we'd love to check them out and
if you guys enjoyed this video make sure
to give it a thumbs up and we will see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
