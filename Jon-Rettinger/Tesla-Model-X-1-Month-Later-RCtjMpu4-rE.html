that time I've put about 1100 miles on
it we're nearly I would just call this
video to review but as long as it hasn't
come to the car yet
so I'm on the car that's equipped with
autopilot 2.0 or Hardware 2 and I wasn't
when the first thousand cars that got
some of the autopilot features but it's
not even close to even at parity with
the older generation cars are produced
in 2014
autopilot one so I'm saving the review
corn I get all of that stuff and I can
show you but I have learned a lot about
the car from how the Felker wing doors
performed and held up whether or not my
white seats are already ruined because
of jeans and kids how the car is driven
without I've had any issues so let me
show you what it's like to be in the
Model X I migrates with it one month in
like most cars you can get a ton of
options on the Model X one of the big
ones that I don't have is a premium
upgrade package and that's going to give
you almost like a valet mode for the
driver's door as you walk up to it I
don't know you're there to keep up in
your pocket and I'll open and present
itself to you but the doors are still
pretty cool the passenger and the
driver's one so go and just push the
button it will open up and it'll go as
far as you can it'll sense that there's
another car there and not open up into
it and if I want to close the door I can
close all doors using the touchscreen
and the drivers or I just put my foot on
the brake automatically close I also
like from inside the car to open it up
all I have to do is just pull the handle
I don't have to push the door to
actually open itself up I know it's
that's really get the extreme level of
laziness and doing this is too hard but
it's kind of cool and it closes neatly
too it will retract itself back into the
car but the big doors I think sort of
the big reason lot of people get the
Model X is for the Falcon it's also been
one of the biggest issues people have
had out with the cards earlier pin
numbers about trim right here it's been
misaligned Falcon wing doors that have
detected op schools that aren't there I
fortunately had no issues with the car
at all I've been around 28,000 so looks
like most of the issues I haven't taken
care of one small thing that I do have
is on the passenger Falcon wind or as
you can hear it I'll commute you get a
little bit of a creek in one of the
hinges but open up and I'll show you
so that's it a little bit of a creek but
that's about it and I've had no issues
in surprising I haven't had the Falcon
wing doors hit anything I've got a
really tight garage and it opens up very
easily around it I parked next to a ton
of cars never had anything it's also
been really good at detecting overhead
I was nervous about parking garages when
you have you know big beams up ahead
it's detected all of that well the best
features for me to be able to get kids
in and out so I've got car seats on
either side I get my son in now the car
without really ever having to twist or
turn here tried to get a kid or a dog
into the back of a car you'll know how
hard that can be on your back this has
made it super easy so the very first
Model X video we did when I said I was
getting the white synthetic leather
seats people in the comments were
renowned lately what do you think if
you've got kids it's going to get ruined
the seats in the back for the kids are
look absolutely incredible obviously
we're genes quite a bit and I have had
some transfer of the blue to the white
where the nice things about the white is
I'll be able to pick up some generic
leather wipes from from Amazon and they
got rid of the blue almost completely
whitening so that's not the expected
drone man to say everyday so you can see
right here there's a little bit of the
blue transfer from the pants but nothing
in the seat so you take a little bit of
a wife it's just a generic leather
cleaner and a quick few quick swipes and
it's gone these are made of a vegan
material I don't like to say vegan
leather it sounds like it's made of made
of vegans but Tesla claims it's the most
durable and easiest to clean out of all
their interiors on I can vouch for that
so a few quick little swipes
and that blue transfer is totally gone
and it's been about two weeks since I
last did that so it's getting regular
mating to keep it white but I think if I
sort of remain kind of diligent it
should stay looking almost brand-new for
however long I have the cards
so the cars that are quipped with
hardware - for autopilot the first
thousand then where thousand randomly
got some of the enhanced autopilot
features autopilots made up of two
things
it's made of traffic aware cruise
control and the drive assist so traffic
where cruise control kind of control the
car vertically so as you're driving
it'll detect a car in front of you and
it'll stop and it'll speed up and
control the speed really easily with the
stock down below a hard tap up goes five
miles per hour faster short tap will
make it go up one you can throw that for
really almost any speed that you want
the other one though is sort of the big
secret sauce for Tesla and that I only
have right now four speeds around 35
miles an hour it doesn't always show all
the time you'll know that it's available
right to the left of the speed you're
going you'll see a little grayed out
mile number and that'll be eternal
traffic where cruise control that's
available if you see the steering wheel
on the right side of that thing you know
you have autopilot ready to go so I can
show you traffic for a cruise controller
go ahead and turn that on quick tap of
the stock and that turns it on and out
detect cars in front of me it's been
great for traffic so we're coming up
right now on a car and I could see in
the - it'll show that there's a car in
front of me it'll detect it and right
now the car is slowing down but it's not
controlling where I am in the lane I
have to control all of that and of
course it also will not detect at least
right now red lights or soft signs and I
can see I've got a car in front of me
and I can see again that I've got a car
in front of it some of the cool stuff at
the hardware one cars can do with you
would see cars to your left and your
right in between the lane markings I can
see the lane markings but I can't
see yet cars on my left or right perhaps
when this gets full-featured it'll start
to show those cars what I do see is sort
of sensors that kind of come out a
little glow red and will glow yellow
depending on how close I am to curbs or
cars on either side of me
I'd also to show me the speed limit as
well as graphic where cruise control has
been really good lane the lane keep
assist stuff I've only had a few times
driving back from LA and I had on the
freeway that was really nice and you get
it for about 30 seconds or so depending
on how fast you're going get up to 35
mile an hour threshold it'll tell you to
put your hands on the steering wheel to
detect that you're still paying
attention but for the most part the car
is driving itself certainly ought to
stay aware of your surroundings and
Tesla recommends that you stay very
diligent and keep your hands on the
wheel at all times but you could in
theory take your hands right off and
still be good to go the drive has been
really nice it feels very smooth I've
got the air suspension so it's I don't
notice any bumps I don't have the giant
tires I've got the 20 inch tires on this
car you can get I believe 22s that will
make for a much harsher ride but it's
way way WAY smoother than most or sporty
ish SUVs that I've had so I've got the
75 kilowatt hour battery pack it's a 75
V which means it's got dual motor so
there's one in the front and the back
when I charge up to 80% in the morning
generally my reign is about 211 miles
and that's pretty accurate I was gonna
go drive on the freeway rather ground
the city though it gets depleted about
110 percent of what it says so for every
mile looks like at one point one miles
actually goes away so it's not entirely
accurate yet Tesla does get better the
more you drive a car the more accurate
it will be now but I've had no range
issues at all with the car and I've
driven I believe close the two hundred
miles in one trip and I still came back
it's about 20 left showing a range so
pretty good at least for my usage on the
range of course I need to charge the
supercharger stations everywhere so
right now you can see it looks like is
attaching the kerb to my left I think
it's starting to show those sensors and
for all the tech that's in this car and
for all intensive purposes this is a
driving computer drive like a car drive
with a relatively quick car it's not as
fast as a 90 d the P 100 d with
ludicrous or insane mode but it's a fast
SUV it gets out of its own way pretty
quick I can haul plenty of people this
last weekend for example I had my wife
my parents and my two kids I had the
third row I was able to drive everybody
and that was really nice I feel what it
takes or the whole crew not something I
could do with previous cars that I've
had so you couldn't tell I loved having
the Model X we'll see what happens over
the next few months if you guys want to
know any more about the car any
questions you want to see us address let
us know in the comments you guys are
leaving credible questions and comments
about the car or corporated all of those
into next videos leave a fun comment
make it make it something cool and we'll
pin it to the top and people can see you
and maybe get some more subscribers
shared notifications turned on so you
get notified when new videos are coming
till next time Jon render</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
