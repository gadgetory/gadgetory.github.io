knowing from TechnoBuffalo calm and I'm
here with uh what might be my favorite
tablet I know somebody here can it be
like what are you talking about but the
little nut color the little the little
ereader that could is now all grown up
and it's a it's a baby android tablet
for reals if you've been following in a
color if you played with one if you
watch my videos where my post whatever
you know that this thing has been
android-based from the start and has
been able to run ports of android
various flavors of android too and also
android 30 you know unofficial for ports
not supported by barnes &amp;amp; noble etc etc
but before she could run off with a
micro SD card now barnes and Alma's gone
ahead and started pushing out the
long-awaited release to make this thing
an official froyo tablet to dot to the
tech heads out there the hardcore geeks
might be thinking like cool so what man
to dot to that's yesterday's news i want
i want a honeycomb i want three doubt
one forget 30 but i'll tell you what for
people who want a cheap tablet that's
also an e-reader that's also a tablet
that's an e-reader that has books and
magazines and email and web and apps and
angry birds and uno HD and anza this
thing I already thought it was a really
good value it just got even better the
official update from barnes &amp;amp; noble is
being pushed out over the air over the
next couple of weeks i guess but you can
download it now if you're in a hurry
like i am i installed it i've been
playing with it I played some uno I
played some angry birds i watch some
video online let's take a look
alright so basically what you've got is
a 7-inch tablet tablet computer
android-based and with the new barnes
and noble firmware it's based on android
22 but it's still got a very customized
user interface and what i really like
about this is that you know barnes and
noble they they took the android-based
they made the user interface really
attractive really easy to use and very
purpose driven so it started out as an
ereader a color e-reader major books
made for magazines it had a little bit
of extra functionality they throw in the
web they throw in sodoku stuff like that
now what you've got you still got this
very simple user interface it's all
based off of this little menu at the
bottom you've got the home button that's
really the only button you can check out
it did a full review if you want to know
more specs and all that basically you've
got a home button and then you've got
the rest of touch screen and then you've
got this one little menu here in the
bottom and so it pops up and now you've
got apps so we go to apps and i have
installed two apps in addition to the
ones that came preloaded with the new
update i installed angry birds i
installed you know HD HD and you can see
I don't have no proper icons for those
and I have to find out if that's an
issue with the developers or a bug in
the firmware or what's going on but now
we've also got email we've also got
contacts so if i go to email i go to
email you can see I've got support for
multiple accounts i'm not going to show
you my account there but i can easily
set up an account i set up a gmail
account no problem i set up my company
email no problem you know if you're
trying to do stuff with exchange servers
it's got a little you know little extra
for you but it's very easy to set up
again its android-based and here's
here's some some email i got a kind of a
junk mail advertisement and you can see
it's very you know it's very
android-based for some reason these
images aren't showing in this email not
sure why the pinch and zoom not working
in email but it does support pinch and
zoom in the web browser basically you've
got you know kind of used to android the
reply
move to the delete a customized version
of Android like everything else but very
simple to use you can scroll through you
know go go through your inbox this way
you go back to your inbox that kind of
thing I can add value mags as a contact
if I wanted to which I really do not
want to I can hit reply I can reply an
email I cannot rotate which is too bad
but I can at least reply this way the
on-screen keyboard works pretty well and
there you go I've got contacts set up so
i can add a contact and so ah there's my
boy mild for an errand look at that hair
and so I've got my contacts linked to a
Google account so no problem and you can
see here I go to all contacts nuk
friends is a new thing that barnes noble
introduced where you can invite people
to be your nook friends you can share
books with them that kind of stuff just
set it up I don't have enough friends
yet so i'll update you on that if it's
worth updating i can add contacts
manually i can invite them as nook
friends there you go so we'll get out of
this will go back go back to the home
screen there go back to apps and
discover more nook apps is really the
big thing here the app shop it's Barnes
&amp;amp; Nobles own app shop their android apps
but they are have to be built to run on
the color optimized for enough colors so
they have to meet specific requirements
not just regular Android requirements
but specific ones for this device and
right now I've got 137 apps which is not
that many but again you know this isn't
this isn't a generic android tablet this
is a specific thing that's sold you know
a couple million 3 million units i
believe and as an e-reader and so this
is all just bonus for the people already
have it and it's sort of a play barnes
and noble kind of you know testing the
water seeing two people want apps on
this thing people want email they've
been requesting that they want a better
better web browsing and contacts and
stuff but do they want to know HD do
they want epicurious recipes and
shopping list i would imagine they
probably
about that buying something is easy
I don't have a Google account set up on
here in terms of credit card information
and stuff it's just my my barnes and
noble account the same way that i buy
that i buy books and magazines so if i
wanted to buy flight control I just hit
by there we go there's your overview
customer reviews at poor response slow
I'm slapping because I wasn't expecting
a kind of funny screenshots more like
this i could add to a wish list i could
recommend it the customer reviews have
deterred me so i'm going to click off
and there you go i was searching for El
because there was an interactive book in
the pr email I got Elle magazine's
workout yoga with Brooklyn Decker I
wanted to check it out but uh it's not
there not there yet so anyway let's see
we'll go back so to go back different
ways to get around you can just browse
you can hit the end button to go back go
back to apps here and we'll look at some
of my apps I've got angry birds
installed so let's look at Angry Birds
how it runs on this thing
