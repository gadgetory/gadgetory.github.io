technobuffalo here at the unboxing of
the latest from GoPro this is the hero4
black these guys have been often copied
but there's nothing like the original
this guy brings a ton of new stuff to
the market highlighted by 4k and a lot
of other cool things under the hoods go
ahead and unbox it take a person so here
is the box for the new hero4 black our
camera guy who's working this camera
romp rita is super nerd it out to take a
look at this guy and see what it can do
so here's a box where it looks like
typical GoPro box telling you what it
can do but I'm gonna run you through all
that kind of goodness a little bit of
walkthrough on the camera itself and
some accessories but why re when you can
wash so let me go ahead and not slice my
finger open and use but looks like a
prop from one of halloween movies the
unnecessarily large obligatory unboxing
knife and take a look at this guy so
there are three new gopro hero black
we've got here is just a scent under
five hundred dollars at 499 hero4 silver
you can shave shave 100 bucks off at 399
and the hero is 129 99 good slice that
gotta sharpen this guy let's see we can
get into this box somehow these are
tough to unbox I'm just saying Sears
don't make fun of me in the comments
they're trickier than they look I'll go
ahead and get out all of the accessories
here and there are quite a bit of
accessories in the box put all them out
alright so that's the accessory side
we've got all that done now we got to
get to the camera which I see this
little tab here i'm gonna go ahead and
do that and see if that's gonna allow me
access inside yeah hey where this is
harder than it looks guys so that's how
that works you just go ahead and just
rip the whole box up another one here on
this side so those can be a bit
expensive the hero3 silver is still
available if you'd like it to 9999 hero3
white is still available for 1 99 99 the
major difference here between a hero 4
silver and hero4 black
lead to shoot 4k and 120 frames per
second at 1080 which is pretty sweet the
hero4 silver the 120 frames per second
drops to 720p so obviously you want to
use this guy for video primarily so we
can shoot 4k video at 30 frames per
second 25 frames per second or 24 frames
per second at 2.7 k you get 50 frames
per second and a medium fields of view
as well which is slightly tighter than
the standard ultra wide-angle lens that
usually get at 1440p you can get up to
80 frames per second and a 1080p even
get all the way up to 120 fitness so in
addition to all that awesome frames per
second goodness here you're also getting
improved menu system in a big one is
improved bluetooth and Wi-Fi to use via
phones or tablets you're gonna have this
thing probably mounted in some weird way
something able to sort of use that and
have the frame rate be way better on
your phone or tablet's a big deal and
supposedly GoPro did a big difference
here if you want to use this for still
as you can 12 megapixel still photos and
a 10 megapixel you can get that medium
field of view time-lapse mode is here
with various intervals all the way up to
60 seconds for interval so now one of
the things that rama's was excited about
here is the GoPro 4 flat color mode for
better color grading and post it should
be really helpful for professional use
before for using this in professional
setting you could see when the GoPro
footage was used to hope here now is
that I can be able to see it sort of
blend in with your other cameras that
you're using here they've made huge
improvements with the past Federation's
of cameras but the hero4 might be the
first time gopro might actually be good
enough for consistent pro use let's take
a look at all the accessories that are
here because it comes with quite a bit
of them so first we've got the ton of
accessories here you've got the standard
housing which is waterproof so you want
to take this guy and water you will be
good to go that comes free of charge
you've got of course your rechargeable
battery which is of size 1168 milliamp
hours you've got curb and flat adhesive
mount so you can sort of pick what you
here we go you pick which one is going
to be best for you so you've got your
3-way pivot arm here you've got a quick
release bracket you've got a skeleton
backdoor and USB cables you've got just
a ton of stuff here
this takes where the waterproofness lets
you just access the back case you need
to and it looks like a standard GoPro
but with 4k and a lot of other goodness
built in some of you guys can ask what
else came in the box i served through a
real fast some stickers and safety
information warranty and then a book
about it I've got some really cool ideas
for a test this I know wrong is
practically drooling to try this guy so
we're going to do some cool footage and
give this guy full test and see it was
worth the order of action camera by and
Buck there's a lot of competition here
but GoPros always risen to the surface
and hopefully the gopro hero4 black is
no exception thank you guys for watching
hope you enjoy we are people just like
