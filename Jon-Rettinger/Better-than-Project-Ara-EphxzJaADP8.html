any phone with you impartial modularity
the comments are riddled with project
ara project ara project ara don't hold
Project ara in such high esteem don't
put up on a pedestal right now because
it doesn't exist it's a concept that we
may see come to market dealing with
modularity you have to sort of look with
what's available now and the best
options available now is from Motorola
with the Moto Z and the Moto Z force and
their moto mods so let me show you what
all three can do so let's start with the
Moto share instant projector which cost
a staggering 200 in $99 I would stay far
away from it at that price point but
chances are give it a few months it'll
probably be thrown in with one of the
phones if you do decide to give three
Benjamin to this projector it's gonna
project up to 70 inches and it works
really well I liked how it oriented
itself to look flat no matter which way
you tilted the flow on a really cool
feature it also has a built-in eleven
hundred million power battery I gave you
an extra hour so about your life on your
phone you can charge it up to it its own
built-in USB seaports two relatively
bright to at 50 lumens
it's got aluminum kickstand built into
the back which you can use with it's
manual focus to make sure everything
you're looking at is in focus but what
you're looking at is only gonna be 480p
it's not the bulkiest pico projector
that I've ever seen it's not small by
any means either
it's definitely usable if you want to
show a friend a YouTube video or maybe
watch a movie it's a nice way to do it
don't expect incredible movie theater
quality from something this small for
you audio files alpha a let's move into
the more reasonably priced JBL sound
boost this is $79.99 it's got a built-in
kickstand a thousand milliamp hour
battery it's got two speakers at three
watts each so my keen math tells me six
watts and it's kind of chunky at 135
grams but the audio coming out of it
sounds really good and if you rely
heavily on speakerphone which I know
there's probably a secondary feature of
this thing it sounds really nice it's
not too bass heavy it sounds like a
decent speaker it even more than what
the phone can provide out of the box
it's a nice option and moving to the
third mode on mod you notice I kept
mentioning that the other two have their
own USB C port for charging but the one
that really needs a port for charging is
one of the power pack
there are a few different options here
there's an incipio one if you want to
get fancy there's a to me or Kate Spade
designer edition we've got the to me one
here sexual battery pack that's gonna
add a digital 22 hours of battery life
it's got a twenty two hundred million
power battery in case you keep track of
that stuff not the lightest in the world
about seventy nine ish grams it'll sit
almost flush the camera there's also a
wireless charging version but we haven't
checked it out because this guy will not
charge wirelessly on its own out of the
box and again glaring omission all the
way to charge this thing is through your
phone so the more with the mod as it
exists right now
they all work and they work exactly as
advertised so is this truly modular I
don't know maybe it's case modularity
but it's actually the best version of
the modular dream that we have to date
and I really like the direction that
Motorola is headed but what do you guys
think any three of these something you
would want is there a magical mystery my
iPad in your head that you're dying in
from Motorola to put out let me know
what it is down below in the comments
until next time I'm John Reddington
TechnoBuffalo back to you guys next
