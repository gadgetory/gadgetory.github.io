of iPad we've been promised that this is
gonna be the one that's gonna assure in
the future of mobile computing this is
the one that's the paradigm shift to how
you use and think of a computer and for
the most part it's just been small
updates and processor improvements with
the exception of this current gen iPad
pro and the more I use it the more time
I spend with it
the more I start to think Apple might
just be right so I think even Android
purists would acquiesce a little bit and
say that the iPad pro is the best tablet
on the market and I get that's kind of
like being the best player on the Lakers
maybe nobody cares but what the iPad is
doing is really big in the space so this
generation iPad pro brought a lot of
really new things I've been using on a
daily basis for the past three months
and things I really like it's a new
redesign it's thinner it feels better
and it looks different which is nice to
have my pads and pretty much looked
identical from almost gen one you might
not know it cuz no notch on the iPad pro
but face ID is here it makes sense on a
phone and make this on a tablet I'm not
gonna talk too much about it you know
what it does and it works really well
here perhaps the biggest change for
Apple that I really honestly didn't see
coming was the inclusion of USB C was a
really big deal opens up the iPad
ecosystem to a lot more third-party
accessories it gave the ability to
reverse charge you can charge your phone
or another USB C device from your iPad
that lets you use a lot of cables you
already had probably from your you know
non iPhone phones or any other USB see
things you might have it was a really
big deal the 11 seems a little small for
me so I went for the comically large
12.9 and I've loved the larger size if
you use the old 12.9 this feels much
smaller cuz them bezels are totally
slimmed down the screen is beautiful the
resolution is great anything you can
want to do on it looks good weather
it's movies whether it's TV games
whatever the screen is really good like
historically with iPads they've gotten
like one change that was a big deal the
cherished iPad pro got singling
everything an Apple got the iPads kind
of where they've wanted it to be and
despite it having a lot of awesome
things in it it's still far from perfect
so before we continue on with the iPad
coverage hope you guys have been joining
the videos and coming out on the channel
we're having a blast making it and
hopefully you can notice the difference
if you like the video be sure to
subscribe into that little Bellis to get
notified when new videos are coming your
way and I want to give a huge thank you
to this video sponsor Mac paw so I think
one of the best feelings about getting a
new Mac it's taking off the plastic
turning it on and it being crazy fast
for the first like a few weeks or even a
few months but if you keep your
computers well you know like I do for
years just by the nature of what they're
doing they start to slow down that's
where something like CleanMyMac X comes
in and sort of brings your computer back
to that new phase well I can't rewrap
your computer and plastic they can't
make it as fast as it was on day one if
you're looking at free up hard drive
space this is going to scan your
computer for sort of partial or half
downloads and it'll get rid of those for
you generally freeing up you know gigs
of space it'll also check for malware
things have maybe been slowing your
computer down or maybe things are
running in the background that you
didn't know or don't want running it'll
scan for all of those things if you care
about reclaiming your lost hard drive
space or removing malware from your
computer
one of the first app you should check
out should be clean my Mac X file learn
more about it will link to them down
below obviously I love the hardware on
the iPad pro from a spec standpoint the
thing is a straight up beast in a
beautiful package and as awesome as all
the components that make up the iPad pro
are it almost makes it more glaring kind
of how frustrating and lacking the
software can be so the iPads obviously
running iOS and it's front it's a
purposes a larger version of the phone
OS with some nice tweaks that are custom
for the iPad
and I think that is where the iPad is
really lacking if Apple's vision is
mobile computing mobile computing is not
a phone operating system I'm not a huge
proponent of like forking os's but I
think it's time for Apple to make a
dedicated pad OS where the iPad clearly
stretch its legs and become what Apple
wants it to be the hardware's there the
software just like a few steps behind
let me just look at the home screen on
the iPad look at the space between those
icons Apple could do a lot more for with
that space things like widgets could be
their home screen apps could be an
option the iPads can be the future of
mobile computing I can't go app home
screen app home screen app home screen
gotta be able to get information at a
glance and that's really where iOS is
lacking I think this kind of pad OS
could fill that gap really nicely so one
end it was nice to have a files app
built in iOS but with USBC it's really
apparent how restrictive that is so sort
of a universal file management wherever
I plug in if I could plug it into my
macbook pro I want to be able to see
what those files are on the iPad usually
when Apple releases iPads that kind of
make it for the next version of the OS
in mind so maybe it's gonna be iOS 13
that'll sort of be this kind of pad OS
but Apple click clearly has a broader
vision of what the iPad can do otherwise
I can understand why they would pack
such crazy specs an incredible PC like
performance in a tablet and then it
completely neuter what it's capable of
with software I mean the whole idea
behind the iPad was that you could hold
the Internet in your hand and like that
was the vision with what a tablet should
be and could be an apple hit that out of
the park with the very first generation
so if you look at the first generation 2
now obviously you still have the
Internet in your hand but the Internet's
changed what you can do with the
Internet has changed how you interacted
the Internet has changed and the iPad
for the most part has you know changed
with it but there are few things it's
still really lacking so when I look back
and the wonder of the first iPad and I
kind of look at the new Jenner
big you are awesome and you could bring
that same amount of wonder or just a few
things could be fixed
I still love what the initial mission
was of the iPad I still love holding the
Internet in my hand and obviously you
can do that on your phone or smaller
screen sort of having websites and the
full breadth of the Internet sort of
right in your hands and whenever you're
laying in bed or on an airplane that's
still awesome to me I mean it's how I am
consuming most of my media it's how I'm
I'm watching my Netflix how I'm watching
Hulu I cut the cord so all of my TV is
done on YouTube TV it's all of those
things for me and perhaps the most
important job and don't judge me
it's during football season it's but I
want to watch the Rams and I just need
like a few hours of quiet so I'll put a
movie on let my kids hold the iPad that
alone makes it worth the exorbitant
price as a sports fan and a dad but it
does a lot of things does a lot of
things really well it just doesn't do
everything that it's capable of I'm
gonna kind of feel like the iPads like
one of my kids I got to pull it aside
and be like you can do it you've got it
in you to be awesome if you can just
reach your potential and study hard
maybe get software that's not limiting
you you can do anything I pad son or
daughter just just Papa Tim needs to let
you grow to get your full potential I
also really like that the iPad can be
different things I have friends from
music producers and for them it's how
they do their jobs I friends who are
artists and it's how they edit their
photos sort of I think it's cool that
the iPad can mean different things
different people as the app ecosystem
starts to get better it's not just an
internet device anymore it's kind of
whatever you want it to be device I
think that's kind of the beauty
what the tablet can be the biggest
reason that I don't use the iPad as a
computer is I don't want to adapt what I
want to do to the computer I want the
computer to adapt to me and to use the
iPads of a daily computer I have to
change everything that I do to work
within the confines of iOS but I no
longer have to do that when sort of it
can do everything that I want about me
having to change what I want to do at
that point the iPad can be and probably
will be my only computer one of the
strangest experiences at the iPad is
actually when I let my kids use it you
know when I use it I think about what I
want to do when they're on it they just
kind of do stuff what I'm traveling and
like facetiming with my wife my kids
will grab her iPhone and may
instinctively know how to turn the
camera around or how to use an emoji I
never showed them like how to do any of
that stuff so maybe it served this
generation that sir didn't necessarily
grow up with an iPad or didn't grow up
with iPhones but for the you know the
kids now that always had it it seems
like second nature and maybe for them
but they think of in a computer is very
different than like what we think of as
so right now I can't give up my macbook
for an iPad but if Apple does what I
think they should and what I think they
know they should do the future of
computing very well could be the iPad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
