imacs and peripherals and yeah your
creepy voice searches I'm Marber Steiner
it's Saturday October 17th and this is
the Buffalo break down some fun stuff in
gaming this week so let's start right
there YouTube gaming is getting a lot
more like twitch streamers on YouTube
can now allow viewers to subscribe to
their channel at 399 that's a dollar
less than twitches subscriptions the
update also brings with it the ability
to stream from an Android device which
should be pretty exciting for streamers
who primarily play games like
hearthstone on their tablet you can
check out a whole lot more information
over on the site and you can also go
ahead and check out youtube gaming for
yourself it's pretty fun stuff one of my
absolute favorite franchises of all time
is getting a new multiplayer title for
the 3ds and the trailer is out this week
and it looks fantastic the legend of
zelda triforce heroes kit you and two
friends in the same style of title as
one of my favorite games in the last few
years a link between worlds you'll be
able to stack up on top of your friends
is to reach new heights and solve
puzzles if this really just is a
multiplayer link between worlds I cannot
wait to play it that game was such a
great spiritual successor to a Link to
the Past just looks phenomenal but while
we're on the topic of trailers the new
daredevil trailer gives us a glimpse at
two important new characters in season 2
electra and the punisher if you haven't
watched the first season do yourself a
favor go check it out binge watch it on
Netflix you're absolutely gonna want to
trust me even if you're not into
superheroes it is a gripping series with
phenomenal performances across the board
especially Vincent D'Onofrio kingpin all
right let's get back to phones and tech
for the week 1 plus T is that's this
week with the reveal for the purported 1
plus X a budget device that they're
hoping is gonna pull them out of their
nose dive that was the one plus two
maybe the nose dive is a little bit
harsh but I really don't think the one
plus two is worth anyone's attention
with the options that we have on the
market right now maybe the X is going to
change that of course keep your eye on
the site and right here for more details
also this week Apple updated their imac
line with a fork a model on that 21.5
inch device the internals of all the
models were also stealthily upgraded and
the
ki Mac now supports up to 64 gigabytes
of RAM you can check out the site for
all the details on all the new models
that were released including the
information on the new line of
peripherals including the magic mouse
magic keyboard and magic trackpad not to
mention we happen to have a great
hands-on with those devices so you can
go ahead and check that out for yourself
as well there's a video right here give
bump over there if you want to see a
little bit more information go ahead
I'll wait oh wait oh wait right here
finally this isn't exactly news but in
case you didn't know google stores a lot
of information about us in fact they
store every single okay google voice
search that we initiate from our phones
you can find all your searches over at
history.com and you can get rid of them
there if you want to they're all mostly
benign it's mostly just you talk in your
phone like an idiot but it's important
to know where your data is plus while
you're there you can marvel at the
location history on your google account
and weep about how much Google actually
knows about you that's all the news for
you guys this week thank you guys so
much for tuning in leave us a little bit
of a note in the comments let me know
what stories you think are the coolest
which ones you want to see cover and let
me know what you think about the new
zelda game i'm really excited for maybe
i'll play with some of you on the 3d s
as always thank you again so much for
watching be kind to one another and i'll
catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
