the echo before I jump into the review
let me just preemptively apologize for
setting off everybody's phone throughout
the course of this video this little guy
is a smart speaker we can ask interact
with it interact with a lot of Google
services think about think about it like
Google's assistant but in your home but
not as full-featured looking at the
Google home it's really nice you can
customize it to look however you want as
long as however you want it's different
colors this little felt on the bottom
you unscrew it underneath you're gonna
find three speakers which actually sound
really good and decently fill up a room
I put it on par with what you get from
the echo so the echo sounds good to you
and so should sound equally as good and
behind the speakers you're going to have
a micro USB port and on the very back of
it you're going to have a button in case
you want to mute it maybe it starts
talking you're randomly push beat button
and you're going to be good to go this
innocuous angled flat top of the Google
home I was also a touch pad it's going
to light up with colors when you're
answered questions and it can do a lot
right out of the box but it does have
some limitations it works like Google's
assistant but in your house but not as
full-featured let me show you some
things that it can do okay Google what's
the weather outside right now in Irvine
it's 68 and partly cloudy today it'll be
partly cloudy with a forecasting high of
70 and a low 53 okay Google set a timer
for 98 thousand minutes okay see a page
in one hour and not starting now you can
also get a bit more detailed these are
questions I legitimately asked it while
it was at home during my four and a half
days of testing ok Google is a length of
beam according to the world's healthiest
foods they grow in pods that contain
either one or two lentil feeds that
around over heart shape sticks and are
often times smaller than the tip of a
pencil eraser detailed answer on lentils
you can also ask the translates so for
now I'll translate it in the accent of
the language that it's speaking so for
example ok Google how do I say the
cheese is smelly in Japanese so if you
speak Japanese tell me if it was right
now but of course it's got person
- okay Google tell me a joke there you
go why can't you trust an atom because
they make up literally everything okay
Google sing me a song I like to help you
even if it's strange
so I even play games of it
okay Google let's play a game we can
play lucky trivia mad libs or you can
spin the wheel what do you want to try
turn off another box also integrate with
a lot of other smart things I hooked up
with my nest at home was able to set the
temperature in my bedroom hook it up
with ride-sharing programs it will
integrate with Hugh Liz Elissa stuff
it'll work with out of the box and
presumably more will be coming but it is
a bit limited what it does at least
wanted ships ok Google set a calendar
reminder for tomorrow sorry I can't add
events to your calendar yet ok Google
remind me to buy milk sorry I can't fit
my minder yet ok Google read my emails I
can't read email good so presumably it's
going to get better and are great with
other music services as well out of the
box
hooked up with Google Play Music you can
use YouTube music there's Pandora
Spotify so you can really hook up every
music service you want so you're not
tied to Google Play Music if that's not
the ecosystems that you live in but no
Apple music support and also since the
Google product you can cast stuff to the
TV setting it up is super simple there's
a Google home app that you download for
iOS or Android you get almost the same
features and you can cast off to any of
the TV's you have connected in fact
it'll show you what's connected when you
set it up so I've got a chromecast in my
office ok Google cast Katy Perry music
videos always play YouTube except Katy
Perry and John's office chromecast
anybody needs me I'll be in my office
you can customize it to to suit your own
needs even if your political beliefs are
on one side of the other you can set the
news is that it'll reach if you ask for
news the day you can set either Fox News
or MSNBC or pick something more in the
middle bear in mind that with Google
home it can be tied to whoever set up
the device so for example my wife and I
use it at home and we try to play our
cat video it's always going to be paired
in to my YouTube account it's gonna use
my rating system there's no way to do
multiple users on at least right now oh
there is support for guests on it but no
multiple users at least as of yet so
another limitation for
the Google assistant is it won't
contextual II know what you're talking
about for example okay Google who
directed Django Unchained Django
Unchained was directed by Quentin
Tarantino what else did he direct it
turns off after that query so for 129
bucks not a cheap device it's something
in your kitchen to set timers to control
your thermostat upstairs or control your
hue lights by all means pick it up it's
going to do exactly that and do it very
well
I think the future the platform is just
that to feature the platform Google home
is not there yet in fact it's barely
even caught up to it Amazon's been doing
with the echo now if you live inside of
Google's ecosystem great by in fact I
think I'm probably pick one up to use an
alarm clock in my bedroom but he runs
with me it's gonna do everything and
only gonna buy one at home speaker smart
device you may want to wait a little
while and see how Google evolved is
Google home what do you guys think I
think it's got a ton of potential I
think it's gonna be really awesome just
needs to stay in the oven a little bit
longer and Google is really known for
catching up really quickly let me know
what you guys think leaving the comments
down below like the video thumbs up and
of course subscribe the next time I'm
Jai Ranger from TechnoBuffalo okay
Google play me some lullabies alright
here's a Google Play Music station
called sweet lullaby
I'm a senior sweet lullabies
