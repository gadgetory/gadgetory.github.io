to you by domain.com and wizard magic
welcome back to another episode of ask
the buffalo i'm your host jon rettinger
where you can ask me anything that you
want to know from the wide world of
technology you can ask your questions
one of two ways every tuesday will put
an article up on TechnoBuffalo com
asking for your questions and then if
you're not feeling so tuesday 'ish you
can go ahead and send your questions to
us any day of the week at technobuffalo
and use the hashtag ask the bee this is
asked to Buffalo let's go ahead and get
started this one comes from Twitter and
it's from user Luke JW 93 who asks what
do you think the biggest innovation in
mobile phones will be in the next five
years at some point the processors have
got to sort of slow down a little bit
and become a bit more optimized so we're
coming to quad core right now you know
eight core eight core something crazy to
say eight core 16 cores might be
standard five years from now the power
that smartphones have now are almost
equivalent to the power that computers
had five years ago so you probably don't
have to look much farther than your
desktop to see what your smartphone is
going to have I think we're going to see
a really big push for glasses-free 3d
particularly stereoscopic technology and
hopefully do it in a way it does it make
your brain feel like it wants to fall
out in a pulsing pound of headache I
think we also might see pico projectors
finally become mainstream as they get
smaller and smaller so you can pico
project what you're looking at on to
onto a screen I think we're certainly
going to see phones get larger and
larger and larger then see phones get
smaller and smaller and smaller again so
in five years we'll probably have 40
inch phones to put in our big fat
pockets solely that help answer your
question so the next question is a
little bit to do with the TechnoBuffalo
website itself and how we dictate what
content goes up there this question
comes from I geek TV plus how do you use
analytics to help you develop your
audience we use analytics quiet but
fozia don't know what analytics
are there are tools that sort of show
you what people are looking at how many
people are looking at them what quantity
what times where they are in the
demographics we as Google Analytics
primarily and that's a free option that
most websites take advantage of that
helps us dictate what content you guys
like to read and what videos I need to
make that you guys like to see now there
are examples and times when we go
totally go counter to what analytics
would tell us to do because we think a
topic is really interesting to us or one
of the staff and we'll go ahead and post
those anyways that's the primary way
that we use analytics hopefully that
helped answer your question so Mobile
World Congress is coming up very quickly
in Barcelona you might hear abbreviated
as mwc and it's generally where we see
new smartphones and what we're going to
see over the next year released on a
global stage technobuffalo will be there
in full effect and user PT tech HD asks
what do you think about the samsung
galaxy s3 not being shown at Mobile
World Congress what do you think the
star of the show will be well Samsung
never said they were going to have the
galaxy s3 there and they kind of hinted
at maybe they weren't going to have it
if the galaxy s3 is not shown presumably
the only quad-core phone that will see
will be the HTC edge is what it's been
remember to be called which will be
rocking a quad-core processor HTC's been
in bed with qualcomm for a while and
their snapdragon chips but there have
been rumors that we might see some
NVIDIA Tegra 3 action smacked into an
HTC phone so that will probably steal
the stage socially that helped answer
your question and speaking of question
in seamless transitions I want to go
ahead and thank our friends at

ahead and go back to questions alright
so our next question comes from Twitter
and perhaps one of the best user names
I've ever heard mr. Danielson wants to
know John what do you think the best
smartphone is at the moment so the
smartphone that I've got in my pocket
right now is the samsung galaxy note is
5.3 inch behemoth and you hold it up
your face it is huge and it's strange
and it's big but I love this guy I love
how big the screen as I find myself very
really using my iPad I'm sitting on the
couch from doing fantasy sports or I'm
checking the side or sending an update
this phone has been absolutely awesome
and it's got a ridiculously long lasting
battery now you'd say oh it's a big faux
it's got a big battery generally when i
get home and plug this phone at the end
of the day mound midnight ish i usually
have between forty and fifty percent of
battery left and i've tested pretty much
every mobile phone in the past few years
and generally with other devices i'm
lucky to have twenty percent by end of
the day with them galaxy note is
probably one of my favorite smartphones
on the planet my number two would be the
HTC Titan again big screen sir seems to
be a trend with me I love windows phone
7 I don't care that it's only using a
single core processor the experience is
seamless and that's what matters to me
is the end user experience however that
Titan too it's coming very soon it's
going to get even better bringing LTE
and a whopping 16 megapixel camera to
the market to hopefully that helped
answer your question mr. Danielson now
bow to your sensei Cobra Kai who wants
to be the bad guy in a crowded kid
