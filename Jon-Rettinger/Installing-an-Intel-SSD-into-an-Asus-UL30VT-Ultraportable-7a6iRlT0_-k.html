TechnoBuffalo and in this video we're
going to install a solid-state drive
inside of this asus you all 30 VT I
haven't even turned this on yet and from
the start I want to put in the solid
state drive put windows7 back on and
really start from the beginning
hopefully with not too many issues
programs so i can have a really lean and
light and fast system for this i'm using
the intel x25-m solid-state drive it's
80 gigabytes solid-state drives aren't
quite cheap enough yet to where everyone
can get them in to where they are
included in all the new laptops they're
just not cheap enough yet this solid
state drive cost three hundred dollars
on newegg they go as low as about 250
although you can get other brands other
than intel for about 150 actually right
now but the intel x25-m is revered as
one of the best values for solid-state
drives they're extremely fast I'm
actually running one of these in my
desktop computer and the result of that
is that programs open a lot faster
especially programs that i have in
hibernation like photoshop where my
video editing software the process of
transferring data from your hard drive
to your ram is just so much faster when
you're running a solid-state drive so
let's get started we're going to start
by turning over the laptop taking out
the old drive which is actually easy or
at least it should be easy so let's sort
of position it and i'll point the camera
downward so if you're on the back we
have the slot for the hard drive back
here and over here this is where the ram
goes and so i'm going to take out the
battery just so that this device is no
power going to it see we slide that over
and there we go batteries out there's a
safety precaution and we're going to
take out these little screws i have
never actually done this process i've
installed a laptop hard drive before but
never a solid-state drive so you're
learning along with me here alright and
i'm going to lift this up and in here
somewhere is the hard drive although i
want to be careful not to break anything
looks like there's a tab here let's see
I don't want to snap
anything off yep it just kind of unseats
itself very quickly so this is what the
old hard drive look like seagate 5400
RPM 500 gigabytes let's take a look at
the new solid state drive and kind of
compare the two but hopefully this fits
right in they're the same size hard
drive it's really should just plug right
in so here it is already opened it
before now it's got these brackets on it
I don't know if I need to leave those
brackets on I think I do if you actually
compare the size you need the brackets
to make it the same size as the standard
hard drive so I should be able to just
sort of slide it in looks like it goes
this way be very careful okay I think
that'll do it it looks like there could
be some screws I need to secure let me
pop that out again what I'm going to do
is actually take out the tray here
because I see that it will have some
wiggle room if I don't do that and I
don't want it to to move around so I'm
gonna kind of take this off okay and
then the old hard drive slides right out
and we are going to put the new hard
drive in and the screw holes line up
perfectly so I'll put all these screws
right in okay so we have the solid state
drive seated inside of the little tray
so now it should slide in and fit a lot
better than before sort of move these
wires and push it up there we go there
it goes looks good let's put the the lid
back on for the hard drive okay and we
put the battery back in and then because
the asus UL 30 BTW doesn't have an
optical drive i'm going to attach an
external USB 2.0 derive so that we can
get windows seven on to this okay now
we've got a load on windows 7 and I've
connected an external drive because the
asus doesn't have a an optical drive
built-in
so it's a little bit crude back there
but it works now I'm not going to use at
least right away the windows seven
recovery disk from a sous because this
will install all of the programs from a
sous I want a squeaky clean installation
so I'm going to try using a windows
seven disk that I've used before and I'm
thinking that it probably won't work
because I've already used a license but
perhaps I can get by with using the
license on the bottom of the asus so
this may not be so cut and dry but we're
going to try to see what happens when we
load this version up so let's open up
open up the laptop and it's already
showing something on the screen that I
was trying before so I'm going to ctrl
delete it and try to force it to reboot
so I'll do a press and hold the power
button all right let's see what happens
again I may just have to revert back to
the windows seven recovery disk from
Asus if this doesn't work which would
not be too big of a deal so hopefully it
will boot from the CD which it is that's
good
accept the terms so we're going to go
with custom and this is unallocated
space this is the solid state drive i'm
going to go to drive options i'm going
to format this by ken or actually first
i have to create a new partition i'll
use the entire size windows my create
additional partitions okay and system
reserved of 100 megabytes and we're
going to format this partition here so
we can clean it off and make it ready
for for installation and it looks like
it is ready so i'm going to go to next
and it's doing something so we'll be
back and see if it I if it actually
worked and we're back that was about 30
minutes so pretty fast so i'm going to
type my name here and i think it's going
to ask me for a CD key soon so password
so i'll just type the password and click
on password hint required so hint there
we go product key so I'm going to start
by typing the product key from the
bottom of the asus i don't know if this
is going to work because this is a
32-bit that i just installed and the
demand the laptop comes with 64-bit i
figure that for what i'm going to be
using the laptop for i really don't need
the extra benefits of 64 bit i'm not
going to be doing that much HD video
rendering that much you know
photomanipulation things like that so
let me type in the for the product key
and the key worked which is good news
i'm going to use ask me later for
windows update finalizing your settings
so this may actually have worked so here
we are in windows 7 coming up soon we're
gonna have more videos about the
hardware on the asus UL 30 VT we're also
going to talk about how fast it is how
the performance is with the solid state
drive and some other things relating to
keyboard usage and battery life and
things like that we'll be back soon with
much more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
