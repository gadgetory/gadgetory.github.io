unboxing for you of the I power I pwr
backup battery for the iphone 3g when
you're I phones running out of battery
you plug this thing in and you are
juiced up for another couple hours I
love backup batteries i use the all the
time to really excited to dig into
another one and see how i think let's go
ahead and open this thing up right from
usps priority mail thanks to the folks
at I power for this I'm Celia this is an
apple licensed product so you can't find
these often times at Apple sores we've
got another package here push that off
and i'll put a link to their website up
in the sidebar to meet you guys are
interested in you want to just buy one
online so here is the I power backup
battery for iphone and ipod it is 118
million power batteries it look send
your music up to 40 hours some videos up
to 10 hours Wow extend talk time up to 7
hours this is some serious battery
action we imagine expending your music
capabilities up to 40 hours for a flight
something like this is amazing some else
in here as well there is another one I
power backup battery for iphone and ipod
will put this one aside for a giveaway
coming up that's very nice the folks to
send to let's go ahead and open it up
and see what we got zoom in a little bit
so you're it's saying what it's all
about license for ipod and iphone it's
always nice to see a little picture the
device there's your iphone on the side
here this will actually work with almost
every ipod out that looks like ipod 5th
generation video third generation all
the different nanos and ipod touch and
iphone first generations it's actually
very nice with just a standard apple
proprietary port no it's funny to say
standard port but it's kind of become
pretty standard now
let's go ahead and open this thing up
see how you get into it there we go a
little bit of a seal right there go
ahead and open this up grab the scissors
there we go opens up right on top and
here we have the I power itself let's
see how big it is not that bad show you
guys that in a second and it looks like
it is a mini USB standard port which is
always nice to see and they give you a
little retractable core which is always
nice use these mini USB cord for
everything don't have to use it just for
this I should say this is a really hard
hard hard work here so deftly will
protect it and you actually if you want
to travel with a plug put it right back
in there close this up real nice line
which is a little magnet in there that
just closes right up alright let's take
a look at the device itself then off to
the side and I'll show you next to the
iphone here for a size comparison let's
see it's actually relatively small and
sits right on top of it and for a
thickness comparison that actually looks
almost exactly I stick as the iphone
let's see how it works probably this
thing comes right up all right
there we go all right so we just pulled
off the top here nice to keep it safe
and protected and there appears to be a
on off switch right there the camera
focusing on that okay so just take this
top right off and there as an on off
switch right there so you can turn it on
or off which is nice so it's not always
draining power go ahead and turn it on
and we'll see if it comes with any sort
of charge and there is the charging port
by the way right on top just plug this
in looks like it came without a charge
and unfortunately so I can't show you
guys what this looks like but during the
review I will walk you guys through it
that's how it looks like when it's
connected it is an external dongle but
it is relatively thin any guys hope you
enjoyed this is an unboxing of the I
power backup battery for the iphone and
ipod make sure you stay tuned for the
review for exclusive content sure to
