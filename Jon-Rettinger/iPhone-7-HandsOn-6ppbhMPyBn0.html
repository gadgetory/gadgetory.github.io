if you follow the tech rumors not much
here is going to be a giant surprise but
Apple did put together a few firsts in
their iPhone 7 let's start with what's
powering this guy it is the a10
processor but what's new is they're
calling it the a10 fusion processor
that's going to boil down to it being 40
times fashion the a9 or 50% better
graphics so huge point increases there
as well
new color is something nice that we'd
like to see from Apple they've done this
for the past few years we've got the
classic color still available so rose
gold silver gold got black now no longer
Space Gray it's a true black and a brand
new color called jet black a little bit
a shiny look to it also we've got water
resistance now so if you take your phone
out in the rain you're not gonna have to
worry or maybe accidentally drop it into
toilet which just happened to me more
times and I care to admit
Apple spent a huge amount of time
talking about the cameras it is a 12
megapixel sensor with an f1 point
aperture 6 element lens the even the LED
flash has gotten up the quad LED true
tone the camera I use the most the
selfie camera also got up in the
megapixel department with a 7 megapixel
sensor battery life is going to be
improved here's why our gonna get about
2 hours battery life improvement over
the iPhone 6s and Apple finally dropped
the 16 gig entry-level model and pretty
much doubled the storage options so
starting at 32 gigs 128 gig is 256 gigs
pricings gonna start at 649 but if your
eye on that jet black version that's
gonna be only 128 or 256 hey remember
the home button how you could push it
and do stuff with it
it is gone I mean it's still kind of
there but now it is totally forced touch
do the same things you used to do
without it actually moving and I gotta
say it feels pretty good it works the
same way the track pads have for the
past few years you kind of get used to
it I use it for just a few minutes at
the event and it worked worked pretty
well and if you're big into speakers on
your phone you should be pretty happy
here stereo speakers are onboard are 2
times louder than the 6s speakers so
that was the good stuff not surprisingly
though the 3.5 millimeter headset jack
is gone I'm gonna leave my
editorializing out of this but Apple
said they did it because it took courage
too bravery and took a few proud men to
realize that it was time to go to
something else and love it or hate it
you're stuck with lightning but they are
going to include a pair of lightning
headphones in the box as well as a 3.5
adapter if you
have an older pair of headphones other
than that nothing was a giant surprised
what Apple announced looks like a nice
evolution of kind of the same design
that we see in the past but it is a
solid phone apple certainly going to
sell millions of them
so iPhone 7 what feature most excited
about is the kind of the water-resistant
is it the new color which is probably my
favorite the screens also got a little
bit brighter they've got new color
gamuts in there as well so they should
look a little bit better
additionally the screen size is still
the same at 4.7 inches the resolution is
still the same as well you could pick up
your brand spankin new iPhone 7 on the
16th of September not the far away or
hello from the future if you're watching
this after the phone was released and
pre-orders are going to start on
September 9th so the iPhone 7 this is
this is it let me know what you guys
think about it leave in the comments
