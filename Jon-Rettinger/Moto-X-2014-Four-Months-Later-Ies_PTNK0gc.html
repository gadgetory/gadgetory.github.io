technobuffalo here it's been about four
months for a review of the Moto X 2014
hit mark had the privilege of doing the
full review on it and I never got a
chance to share my thoughts so I figured
four months later and i'll be using this
guy quite a bit i think you get my
thoughts and opinions on it so first
disclaimer i almost exclusively use the
wood backed verizon version whereas mark
tested the leatherback AT&amp;amp;T model the
wood one as you can see looks pretty
much as it did on day one when it was
brand new the other one though looked
like it was four years old like a week
after we used it it did not age well so
most of what was talked about the review
is still pretty accurate if you haven't
seen it though click down right here and
go ahead and watch that hurt the link
down below to go watch the video and
then come back to this one all way for
you I'm not going anywhere so the
original moto x was one of our favorite
phones of 2013 in fact in an informal
study at the end of 2013 about eight
percent of the folks the office picked
the OG Moto X as their favorite phone of
the year it was customizable affordable
was really slick it was running stock
Android and for most part the 2014
update is a worthy successor to that
mantle aside from no longer being built
in the US the new 5.2 inch 1080p screen
looked good but it's hardly a class
leader in fact when held it up against
other flagships those that even aren't
qhg before you yell at me this fall is
definitely towards the bottom whites
have kind of a slight here them colors
just generally seem softer in all
fairness though I look at different
screens every single day this was the
only one that I saw for a year or two
years I probably wouldn't have noticed
that much the moral being though it's
good but it's far from great since I
reviewed the Moto X got android 5.0 side
from breaking just a ton of new features
did wondrous up the battery life that
Marquette issues with the 23 hundred
million power battery lasted me almost
an extra four hours with the new OS
getting through a day now is definitely
the breeze and I can almost go a full
day and a half or as Mark could really
just get through one a workday it's a
giant improvement obviously your battery
life is gonna vary depending on what
your brightness is set at how many
emails you got coming down how much web
browsing you're doing that kind of stuff
the 2.5 gigahertz damn dragon 80
chip is still plenty fast this thing
absolutely screams I had no slowdown
issues no lag nothing the foam breeds
weather was running KitKat or lollipop
two gigs of ram also it's still plenty
to make this thing just hum along with
your playing games watch video
multitasking whatever it might be I
still love the experience at Moto's
putting out here the formula is this
it's entirely stock Android with the
gradable apps to enhance the experience
which means you get Android updates way
quicker because the add-ons are just at
base I can constantly be updated through
the Play Store the 2014 Moto X gets four
front-facing sensors making motor this
boy way way more accurate to hand waves
doing this which is a feature that I
freaking love without I 25 notifications
mute a phone call it just works really
well I appreciate having those four
sensors now mark like the single
front-facing speaker on the Moto X I
think it's okay but it's not like the
most awesome thing out there in terms of
speakers but in all fairness really only
use it when you know I'm playing games
i'm not i'm watching a video or just
waiting to hear ringtone come in so it's
certainly not a giant deal so the camera
on the original moto x was definitely
its Achilles heel it's better this time
around a 12 megapixel sensor but it's
not as big an improvement as you might
think if you're taking pictures an ideal
setting with plenty of light outdoor so
gonna look really nice but dropped a
lighting even a little bit I start to
look washed out and not as great as
you'd expect 4k video is a nice addition
depending on what model you have it's
gonna be limited in storage either 16 32
or 64 gigs so I hardly used a 4k video
feature the ring flash I think isn't on
the coolest looking things on it and
it's definitely neat but it doesn't
really do anything more the standard LED
flash but it does look so pretty I wish
to bezels were a bit thinner the dimple
doesn't feel as good as the original but
the phone still feels and looks pretty
good to me I still generally really like
this phone and I want to use an android
device I almost always pick up the Moto
X it works well small solid device got
good battery life charge that makes and
quick I know it's always gonna have the
latest version of Android out there so
four months later when I still get this
phone if I was looking to sign a
contract yes absolutely I would
customizable options available on pretty
much every carrier latest Android
updates not the best grade in the world
we got the best camera but the phone
experience is wonderful a motorola did a
really nice job augmentin was already a
really great Android experience so if
you want to pick up a phone's going to
last you for the next eighteen two years
or year every contract might be I can
still hold hardly recommend the Moto X
