function we're here today we're taking a
first look at Nvidia shield no longer a
project shield is official coming
sometime in June for about 349 dollars
we've got it right here so we first saw
this guy D Beauty s a few months ago so
there's a lot to take a look at let's
start with this is a 5 inch touch me you
can see it's custom shield UI but it's
got a secret if you hit that Nvidia
button in the middle you are left with
soft Android version 4.2 will be
upgradeable to 4.2.2 we've been told
very very shortly so what does this feel
like a lot of it feels very similar to
an Xbox controller it's got the two
analog sticks that work very well
they're extremely responsive to move
even just around the stock Android UI of
course while you are playing games
the ABXY has been been familiar to Xbox
and even PlayStation games just put
shapes on there into the numbers it's
being flanked here by missus for a
four-way X d-pad I've got a start button
for getting started I've got a volume
control right there as well it pulls up
on-screen buttons if you want to make
the volume higher or lower
you've got your main Android buttons
here so your back and your home and
again that button that's gonna take you
to the custom field why let's take a
quick look around the device you've got
dual speakers here up front that Nvidia
saying is going to sound red a bowl are
they described it to me is jam box
lights take that for the world
you can course close this screen and you
can take this with you and it's sort of
full gaming console encapsulated inside
of a controller go and open it up so
really can't hear supposedly it still
pre-production so some hinges that kind
of stuff will change by the time finally
hits retail so look around the site
we've got two shoulder buttons right
there on each side on the left and on
the right I've got an array of four
tiers HDMI out charging and headphones
and the crazy thing is this supports 4k
output so to a 4k television i do worke
content which is really incredible team
users move around in fact it's going to
take a look at some of these specs and
we'll see what we got continue to scroll
you can see the apps they're gonna be
here and it's mostly here let's try
Sonic everybody
go ahead think that guy was not
available to play it downloaded see what
else we got on here this one is there we
go they don't I will try to you can see
the quality the first machine so what do
you guys think about Nvidia shield this
is for you with an on for you while
you're gaming to this not a medium size
5 inch android tablet you can least get
a sense here of what it looks like he
wants the quick size comparison here so
they got with me here it is next to HTC
one you can sort of see the screen on
top you can see so I'm very excited
about Nvidia shield and they've got a
really incredible potential for it can
do and merge the gaming handheld world
phone and tablets serve all that kind of
things so I love team your guys thoughts
on it leave your comments down below
give this video thumbs up we must
definitely appreciate it
I am John Richardson TechnoBuffalo and I
will see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
