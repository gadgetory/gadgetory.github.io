technobuffalo here there are many things
in this world that I love candy and
technology among them but there are also
equally as many things that I don't like
and one of those very high on the list
is cleaning as my wife will attest to I
might not be the cleanest and most neat
person in the world but I think what I
have in front of me might help solve my
problem and if you can read chances are
you already know what it is it is the
new irobot scooba and i'm not talking SC
uva like scuba diving self-contained
underwater breathing apparatus I am
talking scuba SC 00 ba this is the
mopping robot it is going to mop your
hardwood floors in your apartment in
your house in your mom's apartment house
wherever you might be that you need some
mopping and you don't want to bust out
the mop and the bucket this is going to
take care of it for you it's going to
set you back just about $300 to 9999
it's available now it uses am reading
this right from the iRobot side here and
allegedly having tested it yet uses a
rigorous three-stage cleaning system to
wash scrub then squeegee vacuum up the
dirty water and a sequence that
neutralizes 90s at verse ninety-seven
percent of common household bacteria now
you might have seen a scuba on the
channel before I actually unboxed me
viewed the scuba 350 go ahead and take a
look at that links gonna be down below
scuba 350 was giant this is actually
much smaller cleaned up to 150 square
feet in a single session 6.5 inches in
diameter can clean where dirt and grime
hide because it's small now enough of me
talking about a mop let's go ahead and
take a look at this vacuum or mopping
scuba thing the scuba 350 that i have it
i love i have affectionately nicknamed
Scoob this one I think I might call
shaggy
so let's go ahead and unbox shaggy now
this guy is much smaller than the 350 in
fact it's so small that I didn't think
the scuba was in here when the box
showed up so I actually opened the tape
to make sure I thought this was just
going to be the accessory box turns out
the scuba is actually in here so we're
going to sort of do an unboxing rien
boxing a type thing so for sake of
history I am going to use the big ol
knife to cut non-existent tape I'll make
a joke about not cutting my finger Hey
look at that it's cut I didn't cut my
finger awesome ok so let's go ahead and
take a look at the i robot 2 30 I've
been a big fan of irobot for a while
they're doing some awesome things in the
robotics world they do a lot with the
military and they also make some awesome
house cleaning robots which if your nerd
and you don't like to clean it's a
pretty awesome combo we also have the
scuba series which will vacuum so we'll
go ahead and open this up stop don't
stop let's keep going alright so what
are we going to have in the box we are
going to have something that I believe
is going to cover guessing the bottom of
the scuba we are going to have one of
these brushes take a look now what's up
I'll go ahead and read through it all
this business is there is a charging
brick which is really small actually it
almost looks like a cell phone charging
brick from a few years ago it's got a
proprietary cord on here I'm guessing is
the battery and in my cell phone battery
unboxing let's check the size seven
point two volts nickel metal hydride
battery pack so this is going to power
your scuba don't dispose your batteries
by the way by throwing the trash take
them to a recycling place if you're
anywhere near best buy costco or
wherever you might be chances are
they're going to have a battery
recycling place we've got your scuba
fluid since it is a mop you can use sort
of a vinegar type fluid as well you can
also use their natural enzyme formula I
actually use this with the scuba 350
works really
so they give you a little sample of that
and underneath here which I thought
didn't have anything is our tiny little
vacuum cleaning friend and this guy is
much much smaller than I expected so
here is shaggy let's go ahead and take a
look at I can pull them out of the box
plastic so much smaller it's amazing
what they do from a size standpoint this
thing is I mean look at it on my hand
and it really doesn't weigh much
certainly the batteries on that it's not
filled with water but it is really small
and I've never seen and irobot scooba or
rumba go around your floor it's kind of
neat to see it almost sounds a little
personality as it rolls around it's got
some we're souls and brushes and wheels
and somehow manages them up so push that
off the side for just a moment I think
we've got two virtual walls what these
can do is you can set barriers where you
want it to mop and not mop if you want
stay out of our room or only sing in a
room these guys can set that wall for
you if you perhaps have hardwood floors
upstairs didn't have to worry your scuba
is not going to scuba itself down your
stairs in a fit of terrible electronic
robot death I actually knows that there
are stairs there I will stop and go
around them but also sort of trying to
work around the corners as well all
right so let's recap what you're going
to get in the Box you're going to get
one I robot scuba 230 you're going to
get one rechargeable battery pack this
is the rechargeable battery pack you are
going to get one storage map which was
guessing this thing that I didn't know
what it was storage Matt you are going
to get to virtual walls which each
requires two D batteries not included
then with these guys you're going to get
packets of scuba hard floor cleaner that
was
this you're going to get three extra
removable bottom pipes which is this
stuff those little bristles that are
showing yet on the bottom of the scoob's
right there you can replace those kind
of handy you're also going to get which
I can't show you the one-year
manufacturer's limited warranty so I
will go ahead and put the scuba through
the tests see how it does show you how
its fruits out my cat and how to
probably freak out your dog maybe we can
even get a fun video of this guy doing
it's scuba thing I'll show you guys what
it can do what can't do and all that
scuba business leave your comments down
below anything that you want to see i'm
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i
hate cleaning
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
