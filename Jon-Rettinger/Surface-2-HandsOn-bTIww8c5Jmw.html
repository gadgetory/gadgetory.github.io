TechnoBuffalo here at the first look for
you at the brand the new Microsoft
Surface two gone is the arty name what's
here that was a brand new magnesium
color improve specs some improvements to
the kickstand and all kinds of other
goodness under the hood and on the
screen let's go ahead take a first look
at the surface to so here we've got the
surface to you got to fight the urge to
say the surface RT two gone is the RT
name but what lives on is the operating
system it is Windows 8.1 RT be able to
get this guy in two configurations
either 449 it's for a 32 like we've got
here or 549 for 64 I should say that
this is pre-production hardware than
Microsoft sent us always said the
hardware is exactly the same as a retail
but the operating system will get an
upgrade once the final RT 8.1 comes out
yet again just that little disclaimer so
there's a lot of things different here
in the surface to I think much more
externally than there's a disservice Pro
to the big difference look at it on the
back it looks great which is what
Microsoft is just calling magnesium it's
that same vapor mag material which feels
like aluminum but has better
anticipation I suppose leaf but it comes
in gray also like the black you've got
that option to you now I have the
surface logo there instead of the
windows flag but I kind of like seeing
another big difference here is the
kickstand so I've always liked at the
kickstand extended all the way across
that was great for putting it on your
lap but it was sort of hard to use at
that angle so Microsoft said we will
listen to you consumer and they gave it
boom another angle which is much easier
not only to use on your lap but also
when you are at a desk it's a little bit
thinner as well then the outgoing
Surface RT this one's 0.35 to 0.37 on
the outgoing version it weighs a little
less twenty three point four ounces
versus the 24 ounces but it feels much
lighter and it feels you know very
different to use also being powered this
is now a Tegra 4 process opposed to
Tegra 3 and is a huge speed difference
here whether you're playing video 1080p
content back you don't have to worry at
all about me
Lag that we saw before it's at 1.7
gigahertz Tegra 4 chip with 2 gigs of
ram so there's plenty of storage here
yeah we have an upgraded 5 megapixel
camera living there on the back we've
got a 3.5 megapixel sensor that lives
right there on the front a Bluetooth 4.0
supposedly way better battery life to it
set up to 10 hours of video playback or
7 to 15 days of idle life which is
really nice
I do get expendable storage here via
micro sd overall the experience has been
very positive I'm going to need to use
it I'm put it through its paces what
you're not gonna have though is a full
desktop operating system so your legacy
apps won't work you still have a desktop
but all that's really gonna run here is
Microsoft Office which will come
pre-installed including Outlook now
which is quite nice one of the big
updates that we saw a Microsoft
announced the surface 2 and the surface
pro 2 are things like this these
brand-new accessories what you're
looking at here is the type cover which
is gonna be $129 it's got actual
physical tees it's thinner than the
outgoing type cover it now has a felt
key and track pad here and backlit and
like all accessories for the surface
most of them it snaps into very
satisfactory noise I'll go ahead and
restart that one later other accessories
that are gonna be available there's
batteries there's a type cover which
does not have the physical buttons it's
all touch with improved sensors and also
backlight cost you $80 there's some DJ
accessories
there's wireless accessories fun to use
this wirelessly in all kinds of other
stuff not much reason to do that though
it's got a USB 3.0 port so you can plug
in really whatever you like go ahead and
pull that out we'll continue our tour
you've got that one windows button which
is gonna take you right to the desktop
you now got that Windows Start button in
the bottom left which will take you
right to the new Start menu here on the
left hand side you've got a speaker 3.5
millimeter headset jack volume up and
down on the right hand side and that's
where your power connection is going to
be a little bit of revised power
connector there as well make it easier
to snap in
there's our USB 3.0 port there is mini
display and underneath here is where
your expandable storage is going to live
it's going to throw in
a microSD card you can go ahead and do
so right there it's kind of hidden if
you don't know where to look overall the
build quality is outstanding I was ever
the issue of Microsoft Surface devices
how about is gonna sort of fit in the
pantheon of tablets of course versus the
iPad the onslaught of Android tablets
Nexus 7 Nexus 10 is yet to be seen but I
will use it put into its paces and let
you guys know what I think any questions
or things you want to see be sure to let
me know until then I am John Britton
