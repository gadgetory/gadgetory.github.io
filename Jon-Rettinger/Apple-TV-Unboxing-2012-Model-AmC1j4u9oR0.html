technobuffalo here taking a look at the
brand new just announced and now
released 2012 iteration of the Apple TV
let's go ahead and see if there's any
sort of surprises that might be hiding
behind this very similar looking package
alright so by just looking at the Box
you're not going to notice much
differences between this and the 2011
version save for that stuff right there
1080p most importantly this guy can now
stream 1080p content from Apple servers
previous one was only 720 all right
let's go ahead and bring out the
unboxing scissors go ahead and cut open
the plastic and take a look at this guy
and see we can expect when you pick one
up for ninety nine dollars go ahead and
open this we did cover the new user
interface that accompanied the apple TV
announcement it is available for the
2011 Apple TV model so you don't have to
pick up the new version if you want that
new interface only pick up the new
version if you want to 1080p content so
here's what we're going to have in a box
we've got a very familiar-looking remote
does not appear change from the previous
model you've got your five way
navigation so up down left right into
the middle menu and play and pause and
all clad in aluminum or aluminium ending
on to where in the world you are so
there's that digging into the rest of
the box we've got eight power cord for
power cording and we've got an apple TV
booklets for much telling you how to set
it up but it's pretty easy to set up you
just plug it in all right so here is the
Apple TV go ahead and peel off the
plastic all right so we've got a little
bit of a pull tab here and we're always
went to follow directions so we will
pull the tab revealing all the ports
it's like an apple TV striptease here
we'd like some sexy music John I've done
done Donna Anna chuck it push that off
to the side and things here look
relatively similar to the outgoing model
there's your power hdmi you've got a
mini
USB or micro USB rather optical audio
and then you've got a wire internet port
if that's how you choose connected of
course says 802 11 n built-in all right
let's go ahead and talk about the specs
to this guy and what else it has what's
running a custom version of iOS from
dimension standpoint it's point nine
inches by three point nine inches by
three point two nine inches making it
sort of a square on that side and
rectangle depending on how you want to
look at it and it weighs point six
pounds it's being powered by an 85
single core variation so I know dual
cores here single core variation in the
a5 chip we don't know the RAM in it yet
the 2011 model at 256 so presumably this
has been upped i would probably guess
512 internal storage we also don't know
what is streaming only but the outgoing
model had eight gigs inside for
operating system of that kind of stuff
of course no camera and flash important
in that kind of business because it is
just a streaming product but does do
1080p as sort of the big difference here
alright and just for comparison let's go
ahead and bring in the outgoing 2011
model push all that stuff off to the
side and they're not much difference
here they look almost identical in fact
it'd be hard to tell which one was which
so with the 2012 model you're getting
almost blu-ray quality not quite because
of some compression issues with Apple
servers of the 1080p supposedly look
very nice but of course I will connect
this to a television I will take a look
at 1080p to see how it really looks so
what'd you guys think Apple TV is it
worth it still no hulu plus support but
you do have netflix and of course Apple
streaming services that you get through
through itunes so i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo this has been an unboxing
of the 2012 Apple TV see you guys next
video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
