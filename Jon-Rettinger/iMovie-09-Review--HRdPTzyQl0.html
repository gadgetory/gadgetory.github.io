review for you of iMovie 09 one of the
key applications in the new ilife suite
so i unboxed and purchase I life just
about a week ago and I've had a real
nice chance to use mostly applications
but this video I want to just talk about
the one that's really most important to
me that I use every day iMovie 09 I use
iMovie for editing all my videos
creating all my videos post-production
all the videos really anything that's
how to do with the YouTube has gone
through I movie whether it's been odd
movie HD I movie 08 or now I will be on
I am abusing up for quite a while I
think I've got and I said the
perspective about how the product has
evolved to where it is now when Apple
first announced iMovie 09 and the whole
high life 09 suite at macworld I was
really excited but cautiously optimistic
so let me share with you guys some of my
initial impressions first off the key
feature for me the reason I ran out to
go get this was image stabilization if
you guys are not using a tripod of doing
a lot of handheld action or your
grandmother's recording your video if
you got the shakes image stabilization
is really going to be for you and I got
to say it works as advertised the only
caveat that I have of it is that it
takes a ridiculously long time to render
to stabilize a five-minute clip could
take you a good 25 minutes to a half
hour to be prepared for that I did a
little bit of research on it and it
appears that the program actually
renders the video pixel by pixel which
guess it makes sense that it take so
long it's a very impressive technology I
consider to be a pro feature that Apple
included in a consumer application so
really kudos to them for that it really
again worked as advertised and came away
extremely impressed if shaky camera is
something that you experience ilife 09
is the readings go out and get it just
just for that BTW alone absolutely
fantastic and I could be happier with it
so the other features that Apple's
touting is the Indiana Jones style maps
which I'll probably never use
you guys may be used once or twice not
that helpful they also included some
green screening action which i think is
really cool so if you take a wall behind
you or any sort of green surface you can
buy a green screen sheet for the 30
bucks on amazon anything it looked like
you're anywhere i would play round of it
it really does work quite well I'm not
so comfortable with it yet that I want
to use it in my videos so as you guys
can see still plain old white behind me
but another professional level feature
of the Apple included in a consumer
product so very happy about that one of
the features in imovie HD which is
actually kind of imovie 06 that i really
liked was a timeline it made editing and
creating your clips really easy able to
visually see I don't where you stood in
your editing process Apple totally
eliminate out I movie away much the
chagrin of a lot of editors but they
sort of brought it back and made amends
with imovie 09 what they did was add is
precision editor which isn't a timeline
but it makes editing and cutting clips
much easier and still gives you a visual
representation of where you guys are at
in your editing process so i was very
happy to see that sort of rock back it
makes it so much simpler to cut add some
sound do voiceover work never you want
to do in imovie so i was very happy
that's kind of apple fixed what I can
send to be there big big big mistake
that they made the first go-around so
that's something to keep in mind one of
the features that I really like in
addition to image stabilization with
iMovie 09 in rendering times when I used
to use iMovie awaits import videos and
import quickly but then it would have to
create thumbnails it would take forever
to create the thumbnails a five-minute
clip that could take sometimes 10
minutes to create the thumbnails a plus
half then so now five minute clip 5
minutes it's almost an exact correlation
for how long your video is so that is
really nice to see not that I'm at
inpatient that I can't wait after a few
minutes but it's nice to have your time
back you can span editing your video so
then overall if I had a rape iMovie 09
on a 10 scale I
definitely give it a solid eight if I
had to compare it with iMovie 08 it
would be a 10 off the charts I'm the VOA
i think was just not the best product
but that being said if you're happy with
your current I live sweet if you're
happy with HD you're happy with oh wait
I don't see a compelling reason to go
out in the run and get iMovie oh man I
and the whole ilife suite if image
stabilization is important to you if you
want a full round green screens or if
the rendering times or tedious to you
those are the few reasons I would say go
out and upgrade just for my life now I
just for iMovie rather a lot of other
applications in the ilife suite Naomi
iWeb garageband iphoto and i'll talk
about all those individually but this
one was just about I life so guys one of
the questions I've been getting quite a
bit with my whole new setup that I got
here is it the back of my imac is below
it's not blue straight black it just
with the Sun coming in it gives a little
bit of a blue tint and thank you to
everybody who said suggestions for the
wall behind me here um toying around
with a lot of different ideas while
different pictures so you may see thing
is cycling in and out so give me your
impressions are ready not you guys just
like the straight up white get on up to
you so it's up to you what you like
actually these videos are just for you
