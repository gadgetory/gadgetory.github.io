in the YouTube tech community but when
it came to the Moto G 4 plus I thought I
would wave goodbye to dignity strap a
GoPro on my head actually show you guys
how I reviewed the device you wouldn't
believe the dirty looks you get when you
got a camera on your forehead but we're
in the GoPro did me the opportunity to
play some real-life doom now fair
warning gonna come with me on my about 4
days of testing you'll see my family and
see my house and you cannot make fun a
little bit of a mess I got going on I
got two kids at home cue the intro
comodo full disclosure
usually when I review a device I'll pop
a SIM card in use it as my daily driver
and I did that with the Moto G for plus
but the caveat here is Pokemon go came
out about a day or so before I started
actually testing this phone so like I
would have done with any phone I was
using I mostly was chasing down Pokemon
through the streets of Irvine California
so that said let's jump into the Moto G
plus there is a regular non plus version
as well that has a little bit of a spec
downgrade in the camera and lack a
fingerprint sensor well for more
information on that and a link down
below if you want to check it out for
the 4th gen Moto G Lenovo's brought moto
maker here to the board I'm saying
Lenovo because they purchased Motorola a
lot of questions asked about that in the
comments available two different
versions either two gigs and RAM and 16
gigs of storage or 4 gigs of ram at 64
gigs of storage for either 249 or 399
respectively we've got the 399 version
right here with 4 gigs of ram and the
snapdragon 16 I expected performance to
be pretty decent after all the 617 the
same processor the HTC One a9 he really
liked to that phone when it came to just
speed and seeing things move smoothly a
little disappointed but because I know
you guys want benchmark sure just didn't
happen on into 26.1 4 I got 47,000 186
and I'm quadrant I got twenty five
thousand eight hundred and ninety one
the 5.5 inch IPS LCD screen is 1080
peanuts a fine display assuming you are
indoors soon you take this thing outside
you can almost barely see the screen
especially in direct
the plus version here gives you a better
camera the rear-facing sensor is 60
megapixel with laser autofocus and an F
2.0 aperture images were a little bit
overexposed there were some artifacting
it's a run in the mil average camera but
it's by no means bad it also shoots
pretty decent 1080p video I should say
perfect for leg maybe stocking fire
trucks with your three year old also on
board is a 5 megapixel camera with a
wide-angle lens I really appreciate that
for those selfies and videos that we
just got to take here fire truck Wow is
that pretty cool you got a hat and
everything got to meet the firemen the
plus versions also going to give you a
fingerprint sensor that looks like an
oppressor pal home button it is not a
depressive home button but it does work
pretty well
vandal storage is also here certainly a
nice addition to have but one auto
mission for me is NFC
Lenovo's Turbo Power charging is onboard
this you're gonna get about six hours of
battery life in 15 minutes that seems to
be pretty accurate seem charged up
extremely fast and speaking about
charging it's got a three thousand
milliamp hour battery which lasts for
days and days and days by the end of my
day usually is around 11:30 I had about
35 percent battery life left and as I
mentioned there was a lot of Pokemon go
happening with this phone so battery
life will not be a problem other
additions from previous versions of Moto
G LTE is also here onboard I really
liked the build quality on the Moto G
plus actually it feels really nice not
to say premium but it feels like a nice
phone I didn't mind the soft texture
back it is removable that's where your
SIM card and microSD card are going to
live there's still that little indent
the Motorola logo a little dimple we
seen from previous moto phone so I like
that there your finger naturally rests
there a lot of questions about the
speakers on the phone lenovo tweaked the
software on the speakers and they sound
fine they don't sound great again the
theme of the phone they sound pretty
average software is where the company
formerly known as Motorola really used
to shine they offered an almost stock
Android experience with some really nice
additions and that's pretty much true
here as well
moto actions is here so do a little
twist gesture you can access the camera
do a chop gesture you can get the
flashlight so you can get it just right
deadly took some practice get that
working I really like the EOC
notifications at a glance on the
lockscreen really nice addition that
Motorola Nova
decided to keep on the phone other than
those few small tweaks in some new
widgets it's pretty much stock
marshmallow which is really nice to have
the original moto G had a mission it
offered a really nice Android experience
at a very entry-level price
computing now on the 249 to 309 waters
Lenovo is entering an extremely crowded
field for that price point you can often
find last gen flagships that's a price
point the one plus three is currently in
there's a lot of competition the value
that was once there for the Moto G I
just don't see anymore
so what'd you guys think thank you for
coming along with me to my house through
my drives and kind of what I do to test
phones hope you guys enjoyed the
experience if you like to style a video
let us know down below we'll look to do
more until next time I'm John Ranger
from TechnoBuffalo
tathe you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
