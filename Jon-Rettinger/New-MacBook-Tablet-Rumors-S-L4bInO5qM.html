yesterday during the first day of
Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference
also known as WWDC Apple did something
that surprised a lot of people me
included they rebranded their line of
laptops in case you didn't see my recap
or happen to watch the conference what
they did was they took the 13 inch
aluminum macbook model up to the specs
and are now calling it macbook pro so
really anything that was aluminum before
that wasn't a macbook air it's now under
the macbook pro family the only
remaining macbook now is the plastic
model there still is the macbook air
line as i mentioned this doesn't affect
any of the desktops line it was only
with the laptops and i found this to be
a very interesting rebrand apple
generally is a very protective other
brand name and the brand image they
spend so much time cultivating and
growing that macbook name that it seems
very suspicious that they would
essentially abandon it and put the
macbook pro moniker on all devices while
the new 13-inch macbook pros certainly
are pro ready with the addition of SD
card firewire and really fantastic specs
the remaining macbook is the outdated
design of the plastic model and it seems
to me that Apple is opening the door for
something new to slot in under the
macbook name I think that product that's
coming that's going to slot in to that
macbook it's going to be this new tablet
that's going to run for quite a while
possibly a 10 inch touchscreen Apple
spent too much time building that
macbook name to really do some band in
it and I think there's some big product
coming it's going to fill that niche and
I definitely think it's going to be a
non physical keyboard device maybe a 13
inch tablet maybe a 10-inch lakes been
reported some sort of netbook esque
device we're going to see a completely
brand of the former macbook line the
plastic model i think is certainly going
to be short for this world there have
been rumors swirling that Steve Jobs was
waiting for a comeback at the end of
June and wanted to do it
a grand product announcement I think
this really could be the ideal way
between now I mandame gingers a couple
weeks there's not that much time for the
macbook name to be tarnished or
forgotten and in the June would be
perfect timing to really resurrect I
suppose now that macbook a name so what
do you guys think do you think that
Apple is segmenting the products to open
the door to a new generation sort of
lower end macbook coming in at maybe to
six seven hundred dollar price point you
think I'm way off they think that
they're just going to keep the plastic
model it's going to say the plastic
model I'm just going to be the aluminum
macbook pros and the MacBook Airs you
know and while we're talking about the
macbook macbook pro specs I want to talk
for a minute about the macbook air it
did get a spec bump and a significant
price drop on the SSD model actually
dropped seven hundred dollars but what
apple didn't do was replace the black
bezel to match their other laptops they
didn't give it the full glass
multi-touch clicky trackpad it so has a
button so what do you guys think about
that does it look like apples phasing
out the macbook air was it just
incremental upgrade before a big you
know big overhaul come soon you know I
tend to think that this is sort of a
minor facelift before a big update comes
you gotta put too much rd into the
macbook air to abandon it right now
certainly the lower price point makes it
much more appealing and i think it will
gain market share so guys what do you
think about all these points so wanted
your opinion leave your comments down
below and i will see you guys in the
next video for exclusive content be sure
to check me out on twitter twitter com /
John for lakers see you guys the next 10
