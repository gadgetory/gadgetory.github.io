video game voice actors are a little bit
up in arms and LG is keeping it classy
I'm my first ever technobuffalo and this
is the Buffalo breakdown thanks for
tuning in this week guys let's break it
down together as a team first up popular
custom ROM cyanogen has added support
for a slew of budget devices including
but not limited to the Moto e from this
year the Moto G from this year the Oppo
r7 r 7 + r 5 + LG g3 HTC One m8 with
dual sims all kinds of great budget
devices cyanogen says they're also
working on adding other more modern
devices including the HTC m9 galaxy s6
and LG g4 pretty exciting stuff if you
are into the custom rom community you
can check to see if your phone is
supported at their official wiki which
you can find a link to in the comments
and on the site at the video game
industry continues to explode video game
voice actors are looking for an
adjustment in their compensation
sag-aftra and their members are
considering a strike to force publishers
and studios to pay up the union is
voting on whether or not to strike until
October fifth of this year so whether or
not their demands are going to be met is
still up in the air you can find more
information about the possible strike
and the effect it might have on your
favorite games on the site and you can
of course keep your finger on the pulse
with the hashtag performance matters the
amazing pro 5 is now official and it is
shipping with some interesting silicon
instead of a MediaTek or qualcomm
processor which is kind of what you
might expect from a zoo they have
partnered with Samsung this time around
the pro 5 is sporting the X you know
7420 which if that sounds familiar
that's because that's the same processor
you can find in the galaxy s6 and s6
edge so we know that we can expect some
pretty excellent performance the lower
end model of the pro 5 is sporting 32
gigs of storage and three gigs of ram
for approximately four hundred forty
bucks USD the high-end model tops out at
four gigs of ram 64 gigs of storage a
5.7 inch 1080p display fingerprint
reader 21 megapixel camera dual
support and of course the port everyone
loves to hate these days USBC that one's
going to run you approximately four
hundred eighty five dollars but
unfortunately you're going to have to
import them if you want them here in the
US as the pro/5 is currently only slated
for release in China the LG class is
also official this week the company's
rare dive into an all-metal body comes
in at three hundred forty dollars USD
it's not exactly flagship material but
it does seem to do a pretty great job of
slotting into that budget market we've
been talking so much about these days
the class is packing a 5-inch 720p
display which is a little bit of a
bummer a Snapdragon 410 a 2500 million
power battery a 13 megapixel camera 2
gigs of ram and 16 gigs a microSD
expandable storage plus it does run
android 5.1 lollipop it is currently
only available in Korea but it should
hit the US and Canada very soon for
those of you who sided with Microsoft
for this console generation you'll be
very excited to hear that the preview
program is on the way for the Xbox one's
new dashboard that was one of my
favorite things about owning and xbox
360 microsoft posted a great thorough
tour of the new interface this week so
you can feast your eyes on all the
features that you'll be getting access
to very soon there is no release date
just yet but you can find all the
details on how to join the preview
program on the site finally this week
Google announced their event for next
week on September 29th and that's a
tuesday so by the time i see you next we
will have our new nexus devices the 5x
and 6p granted there is not a whole lot
left to the imagination after all the
leaks but I'm still really thrilled to
see what my next phone is very likely to
be so make sure you tune in next week
we'll have all the details on those new
devices for you alright herders that's
it for the show this week if you enjoyed
