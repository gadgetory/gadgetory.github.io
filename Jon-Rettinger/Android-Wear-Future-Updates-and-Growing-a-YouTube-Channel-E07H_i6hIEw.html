to you by domain.com what's up everyone
look like the episode of ask the Buffalo
I as they sit in this couch and jon
rettinger show you can ask me any
question you've got from all the
technology don't know what tablet to get
not sure if you get a SmartWatch don't
know why it burns when you pee is this
is a place that you can ask to go ahead
and jump right in first question comes
from I rod aroni who asks at John for
lakers but do you think the future of
Android wear smart watches in general I
think to future them they have to find a
more utility than just being
notification accessories on your wrist I
think once we get past that point and
ankle director see smartwatches really
start to take off we're really just at
the very early stages of what smart
watches are going to be I've got a moto
360 on my wrist at these full I can ask
it ok Google apply to set all your
phones off and I can ask it whatever I
want and they'll tell me that's handy to
have about the limited screen size
limited powers also limited
functionality I'm not sure what that
killer feature is going to be but that's
to be a reason why people want a
SmartWatch other than just get
notifications what can it do differently
than the phone in your pocket I think
once that question gets answered we'll
start to see the next evolution I do
think though it's going to help usher
that in is the next gen SmartWatch it's
gonna have faster processors more RAM
higher res screens next comes from etsy
underscore foster 5 at John for lakers
how do you go a YouTube channel about
spending money on expensive tech to
cover it's so hard to build an audience
hashtag has to be yes it is ridiculously
hard to build an audience I had the
benefit of just starting early well
there weren't that many people out there
doing technology reviews I'm not sure
that I would be able to build an
audience today at all or even get some
sort of notice out there i will say
we've got a whole playlist of advice
videos that i've done over the past
years if you want to take a look at that
link that down below otherwise go to the
YouTube channel there's a whole advice
playlist there the short version is you
don't have to spend a lot of money
b.tech reviewer I know you see some of
the big Tekkit viewers out there that go
out and buy 30 different versions of the
Apple watch and every single band in
every single color that's ever been what
we're about we don't really do that you
don't have to do that either now you can
talk about rumors you can talk about
trends in the industry you can give your
impressions on keynotes you can give
recaps of keynotes make sure you're
properly tagging your
things like that are nice way to sort of
start talking about into a product I
haven't go out and spend them you don't
have to have a crazy camera equipment
that you can use whatever's on your
phone you can use a built-in microphone
you don't have to have sort of a 4k
production studio to put out videos you
know a view council's of you no matter
you would he did with a 4k camera or did
with you 1080p front-facing camera on
your phone whatever it might be so put
that helps to get you started we stop
real fast thank our peeps at domain.com
it's a place to go when the next great
idea hits you like in the middle of the
night so one-stop shopping for all your
domain name and web hosting email needs
domain.com wants to hook you up with a
pretty sick off or save twenty percent
on domain names and web hosting would
use coupon code TechnoBuffalo it's all
one word in caps at domain comms check
out when you think domains think domain
com and that's definitely not least our
friend Red Sox 2009 asked at John for
lakers with change the Samsung devices
not have a movable batteries and
expandable memory hurts them or help
them I think initially it's going to
hurt the perception I think they are
going to sell between an ass ton and a
butt ton of galaxy s sick and galilea
six edges when you look at the people
that are going to be annoyed there give
me into it initially but once next phone
comes out that's going to be people are
going to be used to so I don't think
it's going to hurt them really very much
moving forward then a lot of things that
make up for it you've got larger
built-in storage size you've got to
wireless charging standards so I don't
think it's gonna hurt them which people
think but the sales number two certainly
tell a story but i do think samsung has
got two gigantic hits on their hands
thank you guys for watching hope you
enjoyed it a thumbs up questions because
i like talking it's excuse to sit here
and just talk tech with some friends you
want to see more techno Buffalo videos
the big subscribe button we got a ton of
new videos coming up seemingly every day
