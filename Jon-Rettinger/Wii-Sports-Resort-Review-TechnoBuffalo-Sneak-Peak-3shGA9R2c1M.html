enger' here I've been talking about
TechnoBuffalo for over a month and
you're working on it for much longer
when I introduced you guys to the site
and the concepts I mentioned that we're
going to be bringing on some of the best
writers and some of the best video
producers I think in the world and it's
my distinct pleasure to introduce one of
those video producers to you and give
you a sampling of a type of content that
you'll be able to expect from
TechnoBuffalo
so it is with great pleasure that I
introduce you to LP formerly of techno
review calm with a full review of the
Wii MotionPlus and demonstrating how it
works on the Wii Sports Resort so I hope
you enjoy and this is just a taste of
some of the great things to come in from
TechnoBuffalo
as we work up to our September lunch I
hope you guys enjoy okay Christmas 1989
I remembered vividly ripping open a huge
box and there was the Nintendo
Entertainment System
I remember hooking it up and being
amazed by the impressive 8-bit graphics
how could they get any better and the
gameplay was awesome precisely 18 years
later in 2007 I got the Nintendo Wii for
Christmas it was the first console that
I could actually get my girlfriend to
play unfortunately since then it has
been collecting dust I did finish zelda
and dabbed around with Metroid Prime and
Super Mario Galaxy but the lack of solid
game releases on the Wii is quite
apparent and it's really no secret that
the Wii success is hugely relying on the
novelty factor in this video I'll be
taking a look at Nintendo's new Wii
MotionPlus accessory and we'll find out
if and how it can reboot the novelty
that once was
today we'll be looking at Nintendo's new
Wii MotionPlus accessory but before we
go any further I have an announcement to
make
there's going to be some major changes
to come with techno review.com because
I'll be joining forces with random
minimun from pocketnow.com and jon rut
injure aka John for Lakers who have
worked for 10 months to create an
excellent new website concept for tech
enthusiasts and it's called
TechnoBuffalo so from here on and I'll
be making all kinds of tech related
reviews and videos for TechnoBuffalo
comm and there's gonna be a lot more
info to come on TechnoBuffalo in the
coming weeks leading to its September
launch so stay tuned but let's get back
to the review will be using Wii Sports
Resort which came bundled with the
device we'll be focusing mainly on the
motion plusses accuracy and how it
translates into gameplay when you boot
up the Wii Sports Resort the game shows
a very detailed and long tutorial of
attaching the accessory itself you can
watch the five-minute tutorial or you
can use your MacGyver skills and hook it
up in about 15 seconds anyways the
skydiving game gives a very good sense
of how accurate the motion sensor truly
is you can twist and turn on X Y and
z-axis and the motion sensing keeps up
without a hitch
it's almost translating the motion in
real-time there may be a delay of a few
milliseconds but that's about it the new
accessory picks up on the subtlest of
twists and turns but it can also keep up
with very fast jerks and rattles
probably not the way you want to plummet
in freefall but it makes for good gaming
the island flyover event uses similar
control mechanics as the skydiving game
you hold the remote as if holding the
plane itself maneuvering the plane
really shows off the motion plus is
precision plane reacts to every pivot
and tilt and it's quite easy to maneuver
death-defying stunts maybe they'll make
a new Top Gun game I definitely bite no
ghouls let's check out a few of the more
interesting games the Wii Sports Resort
has to offer the sword fighting events
are a very good example of how the more
accurate motion sensing technology can
be implemented
play leading the sword around is
surprisingly accurate
and taking down these annoying Me's can
be quite fulfilling the speech lesson
game shows how responsive the remote can
be in terms of speed and it's really
nice to see that the Wiimote is now
registering full motion movements and
not just triggering button presses with
different gestures which pretty much was
how the plain old Wii Remote worked a
flick of the controller basically
triggered a button press now the remote
seems to recognize full range of motion
setting aside the innovative motion
controls he games have definitely been a
step or two backwards motion controls
have been slapped on on most games with
very little innovation
truth be told for an old-school hardcore
gamer like me Louie has been somewhat of
a letdown I'm pretty sure game
developers were quite surprised by wee
success as well I mean who knew that
being this would appeal to basically
everyone from 8 to 80 years old
apparently Nintendo and I've learned
over the past few years that Nintendo
still knows when I saw the Wii Balance
Board I thought it was a bathroom scale
well it turned out to be a motion
controlled bathroom scale but this
particular bathroom scale sold millions
but time will tell if the Motion Plus
accessory will in fact widen the
possibilities for game developers to
create more complex and innovative games
I think it will take a while for
third-party developers to release their
Wii MotionPlus games because rumor has
it that last year when Nintendo
announced the Wii MotionPlus
most third-party developers were only
hearing about it for the first time but
business-wise this was a very smart
decision giving plenty of time for
Nintendo to rack up enormous amounts of
cash with Wii Sports Resort and upcoming
first party releases before starting
events you will often be asked to
calibrate the controller by placing it
on a level surface
it can get annoying sometimes because
the calibration reoccurs quite often and
you must have a flat surface handy to do
this luckily it only takes a few seconds
and gives you time for a short breather
before hacking up some more Me's the
game often cautions about hitting nearby
people and objects I've heard this all
before skip skip let's get to the game
already the table tennis is also a fun
game that shows off both speed and
accuracy of the motion plus technology
you can curve your shots by adjusting
the angle of your paddle as you hit and
you can for example set the ball and
backspin to achieve a bounce that is
harder for your opponent to hit on
occasion when changing the paddle
position from back hand to front hand
the game will register the switch as it
fits which can be very annoying when
you're on the brink of breaking a new
record
I had to calibrate the Wii mode a couple
of times mid game which kind of took
away from the gaming experience but most
of the time the Wii mode works without
any issues and table tennis can be a lot
of fun and it can also be quite a
workout I had to change my shirt three
times while making this video the water
sports games in Wii Sports Resort are a
bit sketchy in terms of motion plus
gaming mechanics I have a feeling that
the events really aren't taking too much
advantage of the new technology and
could be played without the accessory
itself
at first I thought the controls were a
bit off on the jet ski but it turns out
the controls were affected by the water
physics which basically means that I
suck
now bowling is a sport that I can really
relate to I was a big fan of the bowling
in the original Wii Sports but I
definitely noticed that the old Wii mode
could recognize only a few angles of
curve and a few variations of thrust now
the new version of the bowling is a
definite improvement with the Wii
MotionPlus
you can achieve pinpoint precision and
you can definitely have more control
over the ball spin
too bad there isn't any online
multiplayer League because I would kick
ass and chew bubblegum the archery
events are very good application to show
off just how intricate the motion
sensing capabilities really are I have
actually practiced real archery several
years back and archery on the Wii is
exactly the same as real archery well
it's actually nothing like real archery
but it demands a steady hand and nerves
of steel
in most games the differences are subtle
and I would imagine the average week
gamer the eight-year-old annoying kid or
the 80 year old grandma won't even
notice the improvements but they will
definitely enjoy the new sporting events
we sports resort has to offer all in all
the Wii MotionPlus accessory is definite
improvement to the Wii experience but
you will be having to buy the accessory
for each remote you own so if you're
like me who has four remotes he'll end
up paying a couple of days salary for
some dude at Nintendo even though the
Wii MotionPlus isn't anything truly
groundbreaking I can't deny that it's
still good fun that is at least until
the novelty starts to wear off hi just
to make the novelty factor is good for
say 25 million units sold what the heck
let's make it 40 million the Wii
MotionPlus accessory actually exceeded
my expectations is not a perfect device
but it really gives the Wii mode
much-needed accuracy unfortunately the
technology is not backwards compatible
so you're gonna have to wait for feature
releases to reap the benefits Nintendo
is in for some stiff competition later
next year Microsoft is coming out with
their motion control tech project at all
and Sony is coming out with their new
motion controller as early as spring
2010 but I'm pretty sure that Nintendo
is keenly aware of what Sony and
Microsoft are doing and I have a feeling
that Nintendo will possibly always be a
step ahead 51 million consoles sold is
definite proof of this to conclude the
Wii MotionPlus gets TechnoBuffalo
approval well that about wraps it up
catch you later with more exciting
videos on tech gadgets and gaming this
is LP signing out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
