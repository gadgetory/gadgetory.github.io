from TechnoBuffalo and today I'm gonna
be taking you guys on the Google
experience this week was Google i/o and
I want to show you guys the before is
the apt is the behind the scenes of the
in-betweens of what it's like covering a
Google event
now given the war based in Southern
California and Google is up north you
have to wake up at a disgustingly early
time if you're going to be making it the
day of so I found myself up and aware at
4:00 a.m. as did John both driving from
our houses to the airport everything
that happened in between was really a
sleepy blur but once we got to Google
campus it was such a cool experience
because you hear so many things about
the Google campus and it's huge now
given how edgy TechnoBuffalo is as I'm
sure you guys have noticed we decided to
show up at the event and sit down
literally two minutes before the event
started and my oh my what a venue they
chose it was at the shoreline
amphitheater which is not really a
traditional venue for a tech keynote but
I really loved it it felt like you were
almost at a ballgame or like a rock
concert this is my first Google i/o but
John mentioned that as every year goes
by Google seems to be upping their keno
game so good for them quick couple
things announced during the keynote that
I am super excited about our Google's
new assistant which is getting kind of
really creepy but amazing which is
essentially a very weird spot were in
with AI combined with Google home which
is their Amazon echo competitor in the
bigger scheme of things I found myself
thinking during the event for the first
time that everybody keeps calling Siri
and Google assistant these personal
assistants but obviously they could
never do the things that human beings
can do as a personal assistant if you
have an intern or something but it's
getting so contextual and getting so
personalized that I think we're on the
cusp of almost having it be a personal
assistant replacement at least for those
of us who can't afford to hire actual
human being
moving on there was a good amount of
conversation around Android and with
productivity multitasking multi windows
notifications all that good stuff but
what stood out to me was the
conversation they had about VR now if
you guys been following my videos you
know that I won't shut up about VR from
apps like vrsc to the HTC vive what
Google has done here could potentially
be another
huge step in the direction of making VR
mainstream which is create a whole OS
which is what Android n is that is
completely compatible top to bottom with
VR in addition they're also releasing a
headset and a universal remote which is
based off of what seems to be a hybrid
of the Apple remote and the HTC vive
needless to say I love the design of
both and I'm really looking forward to
getting my hands on it and last but not
least we have Android instant ABS when
you click on a website or a function
something that has an app version it'll
automatically instantly open up that app
from the app store and you can use the
app without ever having to download it
it seems to be extremely practical and
is just gonna make the Android
experience smoother moving forward so
very excited for that and I'll leave it
at that let me know what else you guys
want deeper dives into and we'll make
videos covering those things giving you
guys our thoughts and having a
conversation about them but the rest of
the Google experience was pretty awesome
after the keynote itself Google had
opened up this huge area they were
calling the sandbox where they had these
product demos everything from project
tango all the way to Android web 2.0
they had a ton of art sculptures and
these installations that looked amazing
it was such a pleasure to just walk
around and see everything that they had
set up the only thing they could have
done to make the event better would have
been to cool it down by a couple degrees
and control the weather which at this
point wouldn't really surprise me if
Google did that either so that's it for
this video guys let me know what you
guys think in the comments down below of
this format this will experience if you
guys feel like you came on this journey
with us that's the real goal here let me
know if you guys have any questions down
below I will answer all of them give us
a thumbs up if you like this video it's
the best way to show your love and we
love love hit subscribe for more unique
tech coverage I'll see you guys in the
next one thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
