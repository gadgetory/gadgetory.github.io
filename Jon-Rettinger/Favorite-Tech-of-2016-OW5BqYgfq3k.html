come out but I want to share with you
guys some of my favorite of the year
does that certainly make them the best
these are just things that kind of had a
nice soft place in my my tech lovin hug
on the computer side that should come as
no surprise the latest iteration of the
Microsoft Surface book with performance
base is my BAE I absolutely love that
thing from a performance standpoint to a
portability battery life fact that I can
just take off the whole screen and go
with me that is definitely my favorite
laptop of the year don't sigh diet you
macbook pro for phones I've got to
network my favorite first is the Moto z
line the phone so that's the Z's is a
force and the Z play I picked them
because the Moto mods proved to be
really interesting and an awesome way to
add real world modularity but it came
out everybody's screaming project are a
product are other than Google wet and
just poof dropped project RS this is
really the only modularity option we
have save for the LG g5 but putting out
a hot swap things on the back and not
have to worry about rebooting a phone or
taking things out it's an absolutely
awesome choice whether you want a
battery with you want a projector when
you want a freaking hasselblad camera
adapter on the back it's a ton of
awesome things I think it's got a really
good potential the second one a little
more controversial and had it not gone
up in flames spoiler alert we've been my
favorite piece of tech of the year the
note the note 7 just a real quick moment
of silence for the note 7
screen was incredible retina scanning
quick charge everything about that phone
I loved it was my favorite piece of tech
of the year and then Samsung ripped out
of my hands cuz it was a fire hazard the
middle of my life take my take my
chances next on the list is something
that I love so much I went and bought
twice because my idiot self lost them
after the first week of using him the
bose QC 35 bluetooth headphones these
things are incredible first micro USB
rechargeable bluetooth noise cancelling
will love the way these things felt
where they perform battery life is
outstanding if you want a pair of
wireless headphones they're going to
block out the noise on an airplane or
your co-workers q35 are incredible way
to go just don't leave them in an
airport like like somebody and last but
absolutely not least is the gift that
I'm just like just to give an out like
candy to family this year the echo dot I
absolutely love the big Amazon echo my
son yells at it to play upside down by
jack johnson from curious george more
times than a human being should but the
echo does everything i love about the
big tall film they're just smaller and
squatty ur built-in speaker does not
sound as bad as i expected actually
sounds pretty decent specially for
something that size and the price
depending on when you buy it around 50
bucks is absolutely killer deal if you
want to get sensors smart speakers
connected speaker if a lot of things use
it as a hub for smart homing up your
your dumb home go back school home so
this on my favorite tech of the year
what is your favorite tech of your bed
before you guys start screaming at me
that include an iphone or pixel miss is
my favorite tech you can't tell me what
I gotta love and don't love you can't
tell me that is mine maybe you love
something different Mike hold it against
you much big cares for watching hope you

favorite tech of the year was one thing
