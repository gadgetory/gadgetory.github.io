TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the larger of the new phones from Apple
this is the iPhone 6s plus so we've got
the gold version here it's also
available in silver space grey or the
new rose gold color if you want to see
what rose gold looks like check out our
iPhone 6s unboxing that guy is rose gold
available in 16 64 or 128 but pretty
much assume it's available in 64 128
stay away from 16 pricing is gonna be
749 to 949 it's a fun fact if you pay
for it full price your device will come
unlocked and it'll work on any carrier
including band 12:14 mobile so bear that
in mind I've got the 128 gigabyte here
cuz I got a kid at home I take a lot of
videos I'm probably gonna take him in 4k
cuz why not try not to slice a finger
open here is I cut this plastic it's
always a struggle not slice off an
appendage and we'll see what this guy is
going to look like now I was at the
event a few weeks ago when Apple
announced these phone so I had a chance
take a really quick first look I have
two phones but didn't get a chance to
play with them at length so this will be
our first chance to take a look at the
phones together slide the top off and
there is the gold version of the iPhone
6s plus including its new and improved
and supposedly faster touch ID or touch
ID to push it off to the side it does
feel a little bit heavier this guy
weighs six point seven seven ounces or
192 grams inside of the box the usual
affair Wallwork lightning cable ear pod
nothing else exciting inside of this
little pouch we're going to have iPhone
6s plus thing where everything is phone
info and two stickers doesn't say
fingertips though anywhere on here push
all the stuff off to the side that's not
why you guys are here so here is the
iPhone 6s plus go ahead and peel off a
plastic but do it fast and you'll get my
enjoyable whooshing noise it was like a
quasi it was like a 5 out of 10 on the
enjoyable scale let me go ahead and turn
it on and let's talk about the specs
this guy cuz despite the way it looks
such a decent amount that's new
here so let's start with what hasn't
changed it's a 5.5 inch display with
1920 by 1080 resolution at a 401 PPI
what's new though that you can't see is
inside
it's the a9 chip that's 64 bit with the
m9 motion coprocessor on the front we
now have a 5 megapixel sensor that's got
a flash the flash is this whole Retina
screen it'll light up and take a cell
for you to get you better low-light
image selfies so now you and your
friends can can just look better when
you hold out your phone the back we now
have 50% more megapixels here at the 12
megapixel sensor and it can take 4k
video up to 30 frames per second battery
is a little bit smaller than before it's
27 50 million powers but apple says the
a 9 ship is more battery efficient so
she get the same battery life 2 gigs are
amp onboard here now as opposed to one
other improvements 7000 series aluminum
to make it a bit more durable and Apple
Workers Corning on a glass display I'll
go ahead set this guy up real quickly
and walk through the rest of the specs
all right this guy is restoring from
back up let me take you around the phone
I think should look pretty familiar here
if you were an iPhone user or have seen
one you've got your profile switch on
the left hand side your volume buttons
up and down on the side of those
chamfered edges we've got you or power
lock button you've got your nano SIM
tray moving right there on the bottom
rear firing speakers or your lightning
port and they're just 3.5 millimeter
headset jack on the back that is where
typical camera is gonna live and the
microphone it's got a little S right
there to let you know that it's the S
version because you put these
side-by-side with the previous gent kind
of hard to tell and the same antenna
bands on the top and bottom I love it or
hate it the UFC can look pretty familiar
if you used iOS 9 under the iOS 8 except
now forced touch is here but Apple is
dubbing a 3d touch lets you do a harder
press on the screen to get new menu
options right now it's working with
Apple's core apps
presumably it'll work with third-party
apps ones at L upper start pushing out
updates also touch ID as I mentioned is
newer faster and quicker but a lot to
test it to be the judge of that
anything else you guys want to see be
sure to let us know we'll have image
samples up and a lot of other posts on
these two devices so let us know in the
comments anything else you guys want to
check out I'll be sure to do it for you
until next time I'm John Ritter from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video
