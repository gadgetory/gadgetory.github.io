straight a weird phone not like weird
bad it's actually pretty great in most
areas just weird for Apple it's a
completely new area for them of like
almost flagship and it's also strange to
review this phone in a vacuum which what
I usually like to do because it kinda
needs to be held up against the 10s and
the 10s Mac so like if you're buying one
of these
you know what the trade-offs are on what
you left on the table by going for the
10 hour and obviously deciding if those
are worth it for you so like all our
reviews hopefully this will help you
decide if you should buy one so if you
decide that the 10r is something that
like maybe want to consider putting in
your pocket the deciding factors would
probably be screen and camera at least
that's what I thought until I ran into a
host of other issues that we will get to
so with the 6.1 inch liquid Retina
display so size-wise it's kind of right
in between the tennis the tennis max and
two largest blade that in the old Plus
models of phones
it's an LCD screen like we're used to
but crazy over developed and implemented
in a way that's it's kind of new it's
also I think easy for a lot of reviewers
to just say and discount and say it's a
crappy LCD or that it looks fine but
apples actually done with the display is
really impressive even if the results
it's kind of underwhelming a time I
couldn't think of a better term to say
this but Apple went like full Apple on
the LCD panel look at phones that have
used LCD panels in the past driven
recently istic like the g7 or anything I
phone that's on an iPhone 10 notice they
almost always have chins and almost
practically never have rounded corners
due to light blades so LCDs need a
backlight to work unlike OLED like the
iPhone 10s and 10's max reach pixel is
its own light source it can be turned on
and off on their own so that's why I
feel like look at the 10r and you see
those big bezels around the side so
obviously it's not as good as a task but
it was never supposed to be color
reproduction is actually really good and
they look bright and pretty vibrant
black levels are typically where LCD
panels but do not necessarily shine
through but I put did a nice job making
black levels actually look black and not
just like a dark grey reading text
though is
I really started as a screen text good
look chunky at times
and I'm saying like I could see pixels
my eyes are not that good it just didn't
look crisp
I think stop noticing it as much it's
not really an excuse but I figure it's
worth mentioning so there's also some
weird color shift happening when you
sort of move the phone off its axis it's
not a big deal it's definitely a deal
breaker but something worth noting so
all the engineering that Apple had to do
to like make that display also meant
they add a ditch 3d touch for something
that they're just made up called haptic
touch it was really just long press plus
a vibrate and I didn't think that was
gonna be a big deal I didn't realize how
often that I used 3d touch and I started
really miss it I used it for things like
accessing my most called contacts on the
phone icon interacting with
notifications was a huge one for me and
Apple initially claimed that haptic
touch could replace 2d touch and someday
maybe it will but as it stands right now
it is crazy inconsistent I can use it to
like open the flashlight from the launch
screen and for the most part that seems
like it I hope they'll fix it with
software updates but right now it was a
big bummer so I'm at camera side this is
essentially the same setup as a-10s just
put the telephoto lens taken out and
that's some like interesting
complexities and they're not all bad
so the 10r uses a lens with an F 128
aperture which is going to mean it is
ridiculously awesome in low-light and
it's not relying on the other sensor for
depth you can also shoot portrait shots
way closer than you can with the 10s but
unfortunately it only works with faces
right now which which kind of sucked
hopefully they'll improve that use it
with other things get to look at how you
use a camera if you're gonna use that to
time zoom and you are not going to be
happier if you're gonna do a digital
zoom like any digital zoom it's gonna
look too noisy it took it to a football
game you can see what the zoom looks
like alright so all that stuff aside if
you just want to like use it to take
pictures they come out looking a little
warm I think they do a really good job
like capturing the setting when taking a
picture of so I think if you're gonna
just like boil down it comes to this I
think Apple did a really smart job
ditching the telephoto lens a name of
cost what they give you isn't like a to
Jen's old sensor you're getting exactly
what their current flagship has I think
that's kind of a smart move
all right so let's talk about deaf body
the phone itself is kind of another
departure from the norm of Apple they're
really bright color options something
that we have not seen since the plastic
5c I've personally been itching for a
product red phone but yellow coral blue
and even black and white all look pretty
nice the glass on the back though you
should know is not the same super-strong
glass and the 10's actually the same as
what's found on the 10 and judging by
how many scratches my 10 had and my
pictures I've seen of broken backs
you're gonna want a bit of extra
protection there even if it means
covering up that gorgeous color there's
a ton of similarities between the iPhone
10 and the 10 are not just the glass
back and I feel like I didn't still
mention this but no headphone jack on
the iPhone 10 are Apple super excited
and eager to sell you a pair of air pods
for 160 bucks
I bought him I liked him and then I
quickly lost them so I tweeted out a
picture of the absolutely useless find
my ear pods feature and a company called
funcle' reached out see if I wanted to
try their twenty dollar wireless
headphones so I gave it a shot these are
the W ones they were much better than I
expected so all this is a sponsored
segment this was like definitely a
product that I wanted to try cuz again I
really did want to spend another 100 60
bucks for headphones and I'd never heard
of funcle' I thought that was just like
me at my nephew's birthday party but
battery life was pretty awesome
got 18 hours of battery life it had
touch control the sound quality was
pretty good engineer to support AC the
bass was pretty decent as well and I
could make phone calls with it and for
20 bucks it really wasn't much to
complain about so 20 bucks for wireless
headphones that worked well sounds like
your jam will link to them down below if
you want a few more features there's
another one they offer called a funcle'
AI it starts about 55 bucks
they used a Qualcomm chip so there apdex
headphones and they're gonna give you 24
hours of battery life and they're also
water sweat resistant if you want to
take it to the gym if you want those
features fifty five bucks a pretty good
price to pay I also kind of crushing on
the $20 W ones I could literally lose
eight of these before it cost me what
a pair of earbuds would Zappa was
claiming huge improvements in battery
life for my experience was like 7%
better than what I got on my tennis it's
still a day phone but if you decided to
push it and tweak settings you could
probably get to like maybe seven hours
of screen on time so there are also
other sacrifices being made here
compared to the 10s as well it's ip67
not ip68 it's not a huge deal
most likely no gigabit LTE but I will
say I had almost exactly the same
reception with the tenor is it at the
10s but if we're relying to give it all
to your live in an area where it is you
should know that also is only three
gigabytes of RAM versus four so the RAM
didn't seem to matter anything the
software experience was just as fast as
any other iPhone I tested and here's
where the burn on the 10-hour started to
come in I had way more bugs on this
phone but I have ever had with any
iPhone I have ever used things is small
and benign is through not responding I
had phone resets I had scree not
rotating properly it was just a mess of
stuff and things that I don't expect
from Apple and in interest of honesty I
really wanted to like the 10r I was
prepared to make the spec sacrifice and
use as my daily driver because I really
like the way the phone felt in the hand
but I'm spending this much money in my
case eight hundred bucks for a hut and
28 gigabyte variant I have certain like
expectations and constant bugs that I
came into and continue to run into even
on 12.1 has made this a really tough
phone for me to love so it's really
holding me back all those bugs aside was
also having to relearn how I use iOS
without 3d touch and really wonky all
over the place support for haptic touch
I thought that I could live with them
like any issues on any phone this is
obviously a very atypical for an Apple
device so I just thought maybe I had a
bad unit when I ordered the phone
actually I ordered two so I switched to
the second one and I set it up from
scratch so not restoring from backup and
I still had the same issues using the
10r was so degraded with the software
experience I cannot recommend the
10-hour despite it's something like the
perfect compromise of features and price
I think probably the better off
here if you want to save some money is
pick up a used iPhone 10 you'll get a
slightly slower processor but you're
gonna get an OLED screen dual cameras
that are still really good and if you
absolutely need like a brand spanking
new iPhone you're the only option here
spend an extra 250 bucks at minimum for
the 10s so am I alone with software
issues is here on the 10 I did you pick
one up and has it been fine for you
again I am running the latest version of
iOS as of this filming 12.1 and it's
still not good leave in the comments
down below and let me know if you got a
10 hour i really do want to hear your
thoughts maybe this is just isolated to
me and i'm super unlucky anyway let me
know what you guys think until next time
I'm John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo doc
you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
