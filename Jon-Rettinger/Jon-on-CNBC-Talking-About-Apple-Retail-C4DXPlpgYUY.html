brands need to do to compete in the
retail space joining us now is Jason
Nolan senior IT analyst with RW Baird
and jon rettinger president of techno
Buffalo I mean it listen we can go back
in hindsight and I was quoted saying
some pretty crazy things myself I would
regret but I guess I'll start with you
John I mean does a Microsoft or an HP
have any chance to make inroads here in
your opinion sure so the bottom of the
line is that their slim to none chance
of making these inroads Apple has these
halo flagship products that John
mentioned you walk into an apple store
wanting to get some hands-on time with
the new iphone you want to see what the
ipad looks like and while you're there
you happen to take a look at the new
macbook pro they also offer something
that the other companies do not that's a
vertical integration Apple controls
everything from the software to the
hardware so they have an ecosystem that
works in tune companies like HP and
companies like Dell offer fantastic
desktop offerings but don't offer that
vertical integration and that ecosystem
that Apple can offer their consumers
Jason are you as negative as he is when
it comes to competitors like HP trying
to do stores I mean is there any market
out there that Apple hasn't dominated
where they may be conveyed some inroads
III agree I think HP and Dell should
continue to use channel the channel for
their their their consumer presence HP's
25% consumer Intel's twenty percent
consumer they're not sure and the novice
is out there that's the best buys of the
world that's the typical retail front
that's right that's where they should
stay I don't think they have the the
portfolio's to justify opening up
standalone brick-and-mortar locations
there are parts of the market that Apple
doesn't address well the price sensitive
buyers there's not a good hybrid device
on the market right for both content
consumption and productivity that's
another area of opportunity for HP and
Dell but I wouldn't say it justifies
opening up retail branches to try to
move those products what about Microsoft
strategy here because it seems like they
wanted to and then they're so tepid and
their roll out here are these stores and
we know what the zune did are they going
to fall through with this are they going
to bail so if you've ever been to a
microsoft retail store they look like
Apple stores of multicolored t-shirts it
is
almost an identical experience with the
products being a bit different so you
get a very similar experience but you
get the feeling that they are following
suit and the consumers mind they're
following suit with what Apple's done
they need something unique and they need
to carve out their own niche a company
like HP that just bought the palm brand
has something like the touch pad coming
out the pre three they might have these
halo products to potentially make some
inroads in the retail market but I do
agree their best sticking with the
channels that they're in right now my
mother was so copying is the sincerest
form of flattery great way to grow your
business stuff Jason final thoughts here
about what anything they could do or is
Apple just going to dominate in the
retail space is there any risk for Apple
to fail in the retail space Apple is
going to continue to dominate for buyers
that watch this show right people that
it can afford to buy those types of
products but in a price-sensitive buyer
in the States buyers and emerging
markets people that want productivity
via Microsoft Office synchronization
adobe flash a file three USB ports
there's an opportunity for other players
to enter this market but i think apple
continues to dominate the categories
they already are dominating although it
does need to be pointed out that a lot
of people laughed at Apple when they
started out so you really don't know
what my prayer on the corner but thanks
to Jason John for the conversation thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
