from technobuffalo here do you view for
you of what I think is going to be one
of the most popular accessories for the
galaxy s4 this is the S view cover
similar to the flip cover on the galaxy
s3 in the galaxy note this guy brings a
few neat tricks highlighted by this
little screen here which actually have
some functionality go ahead take a look
and see if it's for you alright so here
is the S view cover for the samsung
galaxy s4 available in a ton of
different colors so it connects from the
back plate all you gotta do is pull this
off and that's how this sucker will
connect same NFC radio that we have in
the back of the regular galaxy s4 and
just snaps back on or relatively easily
so the idea here is that you can protect
your screen but still have quick
information to what you need to see
notifications time and date the material
is relatively nice it's f it's like a
softer plastic ish on the front and it's
got a soft touch material inside to help
protect the screen so a few things about
it does work as advertised and you close
it you do get the notifications if the
screen is turned off if you hit it again
it'll light it up and show you exactly
what is there you can't hit the home
button which is nice one other thing
that you can't do is I system volume
buttons when it's closed so just like
the flip cover before it you have to
close it and then you can access the
volume buttons on the side but one of
the neat things this sort of clear
material you can still touch the screen
when you're doing it so if someone's
calling you for example and you've got
this in your pocket you pull it out you
can still answer the phone and you can
still make phone calls it's not blocking
the microphones at all so that was
actually pretty handy feature if you're
not always open it up to sort of do what
it is that you want to do so I give them
credit so we got a phone call coming in
I could swipe to answer that and now I
am making myself a phone call so kind of
neat you can hang up the same way I
never have to actually open your phone
same thing also with text messages if
someone sends you a text you can see it
right there you can't respond to it I
believe you get serve a quick view of
what it looks like and nothing really
else happens to the screen and just
brings up that area so we close it turns
black some sort of sensor in Psych you
cover that up it's not going to happen
so something is happening in here not
magnetic though if I go and try and
close it still stays open a little bit
which is kind of annoying but presumably
as you use this more keep in your pocket
it'll stay close so it's really nice
accessory I can see why people would
want this I'm not so big into covers and
screen protectors but if that is your
thing that's a really nice option you
get some extra visibility that you
wouldn't have with the normal flip cover
so I give Samsung credit these guys are
available now you can pick them up and
time different colors blues pinks whites
blacks and a ton of other so whatever
you'd like they are available right now
something you guys are interested in
would you want to see other phone
manufacturers do something like this be
very curious about what you guys think
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo be
sure to check us out for latest and
greatest tech news and I will see you in
the next video bye bye just keep
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
