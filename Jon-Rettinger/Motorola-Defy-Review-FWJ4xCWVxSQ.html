technobuffalo here at a full review for
you of the Motorola Defy it's a mid to
high range Android handset let's go
ahead and see if it's worth your
hard-earned money and if it deserves a
place in your pocket let me run through
the specs very quickly here on the defy
it's got a 3.7 inch and of course that's
diagonal capacitive screen with a
resolution of 480 x 854 it's being
powered by a texas instruments omap 3610
processor which we've seen in many
different phones with a speed of 800
megahertz scott 512 megabytes of ram on
its back side and some little music in
the background I turn it over it's got a
5 megapixel camera with flash it's being
powered by android 2.1 which is now a
bit of an antiquated operating system
and of course it's got motoblur sitting
on top of it which we will most
definitely talk about it's got a microSD
expansion card slots pretty much what
you'd expect from an Android handset
it's got two gigs built in but the big
sort of white elephant in the room when
you look at the defy is this looks is an
ugly ugly ugly phone they can say that
it defies what a phone should look like
I was cheesy but this is a classic case
of function over form because it looks
actually given some additional
functionality this phone is
water-resistant actually so if you look
at the places where water might seep in
so there's a top 3.5 millimeter headset
jack you see there's a plug there on the
back where the battery door is I
actually make a full sealed seam and on
the side you can see these visible
screws are there three on each which
makes the phone actually water resistant
I've seen some of the views where people
have actually thrown this phone in a cup
of water and it does actually work so
why would you want that if you live in
an area where you get a lot of rain or
snow in or outside a lot and you're
worried about possibly water logging
your phone you may want to
look at the Motorola Defy but before you
go out and buy one watch the rest of
this video because a lot of things about
the phone that you might like and not
like alright so now that we got that out
of the way let's talk about call quality
I did a 20 call test and this is an
unlocked model you can pick this phone
up on a two-year contract before in the
US on carrier from t-mobile otherwise
the folks at clove co uk hooked us up
with a review unit this model can be
used on any carrier so because it can be
used on any carrier I tried it on AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile and I make 10 calls from
each I had many more dropped calls on
both carriers and I have on any other
phone that I've tested recently i have
three drop calls on 18t out of 10 and I
to drop calls on tmobile out of 10 which
is really unacceptable if you can get
through the drop call issues which maybe
you need to just this review unit you're
going to have a pretty decent call
quality was relatively clear no white
noise on my end no white noise and the
colors other end because of all of the
ceiling that we have here the speaker
phone and the grill lesser of underneath
the speaker phone there's a big cupboard
so you're gonna get a muted speaker
phone experience so if you're someone at
least like me who relies very heavily on
speakerphone i like to use it you know
i'm sitting at my desk or even if I'm I
of course in the passenger seat of a car
it's not going to be the best experience
for do something to keep in mind alright
so let's talk about one of the other
sort of things about the phone that
you're going to use quite a bit and
that's the keyboard and let's go ahead
and jump into text message I'll show you
what this looks like it does come
pre-loaded with swype so for you android
folks that like that you're going to
have the option so here is the motoblur
keyboard yes it's a 3.7 inch screen
which is a relatively standard screen
size for phones and we've seen it on a
ton of different devices and typing has
been very good but the motoblur keyboard
does not make the best use of screen
real estate certainly there are a ton of
third-party options but I have not
enjoyed typing on this phone at all I
have relatively normal sized thumbs I'd
like to put my finger over you can see
it's covering up a huge portion of the
phone so I've had a really
hard time typing anything on it this is
typing it just hasn't worked out quite
well fortunately because it is an
Android device you've got an awesome
speech to text functionality so if
you've got big thumbs you're going to
want to look at either a third-party
keyboard option even if that's just the
stock android keyboard or you're going
to want to learn how to use swype
something to keep in mind all right so
let's talk about the browser and turn
the performance of the browser here
let's go ahead and launch technobuffalo
since this is running android 2.1 you're
not going to have full flash 10.1
support but you will have what's called
flashlight not like you want to light up
a dark room I got a flashlight the flash
li te which is going to give you a flash
functionality but not as smooth as you
get on a flash 10.1 device so we've seen
this processor use quite a bit this ti
omap 3610 800 megahertz but oftentimes
the processor has been much better
optimized for the software that it's
running I'm not so here including
results another unfortunate sort of
sluggy experience as you can see here on
the browser pinch-to-zoom still works
and it works ok scrolling is smooth but
not as buttery smooth as we've seen
another Android devices but it certainly
passable will get the job done you can
do a little pitch to zoom action or
double tap to zoom and it will work for
you colors on it you can see right here
there's some sort of bright blue colors
down here and the Facebook look very
muted the screen is kind of blah
pictures don't look terribly bright the
colors don't really pop it's got an okay
resolution the 480 x 854 but the screen
doesn't do the best job with the images
and colors alright so the operating
system itself is again running android
2.1 with motoblur and i talked about
motoblur quite a bit ad nauseam I
suppose on a lot of other phones I am
not the biggest fan of it and I'm not
the biggest fan of but not because of
its functionality which aggregates all
of your social media contacts but mostly
because
have the user experiences and how it
looks I do not like this colored
interface with the phone and your menu
button and then your contacts I just
don't think it worked very well and sort
of the default icons that you get with
motoblur I don't think are very user
intuitive so you can see the moto
widgets that you get you can use now if
you are a big social media fanatic you
know you may like some of these widgets
and plugins I've just never been the
biggest fan of I think there are a lot
of third-party widgets out there that do
similar functionality that look a lot
nicer the motoblur doesn't really take
away any functionality but I find myself
getting rid of all the motoblur widgets
and functionality or not functionality
we get to icons that are associated with
it sort of get it back to his closest
stock Android experience as I can so
something to keep in mind if you've used
another Motorola device in the past you
may want to check out motoblur if you
have access to another Motorola device
you might want to try motoblur and see
if it's going to be for you there are
different versions some that have these
colored icons at the bottom and some
that do not so I'm going to run a
quadrant benchmark test and what this
does is it runs it through a ton of
different benchmarks I guess and give
today score for performance though
certainly the score is not always the
most accurate way to gauge the
performance of a phone but do you run it
on all of my reviews if you get a
baseline an idea for a performance so I
also have a cast killer here can't
recommend using in general Android usage
but you want to make sure that all the
memory itself is cleared out before I go
ahead and run the quadrant test so if
you want to see this whole test being
run I'll put at the end of the video
otherwise I'm going to jump right into
the tech all right so here are the
results of the quadrant benchmark new
test and I'll move it up here so you
guys can see it a little bit better so
the nexus one came out on top followed
by the motorola droid x which is running
the newest version arrow was a newest
version of android 2.2 we've got the evo
and you've got the droid x run in the
older version of android 2.1 then you've
got our device followed by the galaxy s
older version nexus one desire
Sonja area can explore XP rather moto
droid and HTC magic so these results the
more you run them sort of the various
results you're going to going to get but
generally this has come out right in the
middle actually ran this test before I
film this and it was right in the middle
as well so you're not going to get
outstanding performance you're not going
to get the worst performance in the
world you're going to get kind of blah
performance if i was looking to get
serve a mid to high range even a
motorola android advice I think you
might be better served looking at
something like the motorola Bravo for
example very similar specs but I found
that to have much much much better
performance and screen for that matter
so while there's nothing wrong here with
this phone there's nothing great about
it either it's sort of a average android
phone that's gonna ring when you needed
to to make phone calls it's gonna let
you get online but it's not going to do
anything that's going to amaze you I'm a
lot of people that might be exactly what
you're looking for just a phone that's
going to function you're going to get
relatively decent battery life out of it
and it will work and i'm sure that
motorola will upgrade it to a newer
version of android well that's 2.2 or
2.3 yet to be seen but it's a very
forgettable phone on a one-to-five scale
I give it a 3 losing out huge points for
the drop ecologies which again might be
unique to just my review unit and I
guess I am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo this is a full review for
you of the Motorola Defy I will see you
in the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
