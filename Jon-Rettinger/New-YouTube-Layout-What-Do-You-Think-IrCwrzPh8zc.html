technobuffalo here you may have noticed
it over the past few days YouTube has
rolled out a completely redesigned video
view layout I want to give you an
overview of what those changes are
they've been in Vedas since early
January some of you may participate in
the beta program but it's been launched
live to everybody it's being met with
some mixed reviews so let's go ahead and
get started on your channel page now
you're going to notice probably a very
minimal differences if you have a bit of
more flexibility with what you can do as
a non partner proposed do that do log in
now you'll notice that up at the very
top here you get some new options when
you click your name you get a nice grid
layout of what you have opposed to sort
of the list that was there before you go
ahead and jump right to your channel but
the big changes are really in the video
view itself let's go ahead and click on
this video for the console wars there's
the trailer for it it's being quite the
bottle we're going to minimize that lead
is complete and here's where the big
changes start to be noticed it looks
completely redesigned first on the right
hand side where you used to be able to
have an image on top and your subscribe
button is right here that is all gone
the subscribe button has moved to the
top of the video you get a bit of more
information about the video producer so
here it says I've got 615 videos you can
click down you actually get a list of
all the videos subscribe button is much
smaller and on the right hand side you
now have a much longer list of related
videos you can see right here that some
of these are mine some of these down
here are not this extends all the way
down to the bottom so the purpose here
is to get people to look at more videos
I assume by giving them more options for
related content some of the other big
differences you'll notice right here in
the info box it's gone from serve up in
the right-hand corner to right here if
you want to view more it's actually now
click this arrow doesn't save you more
go ahead and do it you can get all that
information hit the arrow to make it go
away video views are still right here
you can click it and get some more
information
on it I mean there's been some other
tweets and nuances here so the like and
not like is now featured more
prominently so you've got your thumbs up
and thumbs down you can save this too if
you're logged in you can save it to your
favorites or add it to one of your
playlist if you have one or they've made
it much easier to create a new playlist
this is one of the features that
actually like about the new layout
creating editing playlist was quite a
pain in the butt before but it's a bit
easier right now if you want to share
video you get many more options now you
can see email facebook twitter myspace
i'm just a ton of other ways to share
videos i even can connect accounts right
here too so you can control when
messages are posted and have it
integrated with google reader facebook
and twitter go I hit the X the embed
code is again no long in the upper right
hand corner if you want the embed code
you click it and you get a bit more
options for how the embed shows up as
far as size and colors a bit more
flexibility show border enable privacy
enhanced mode or have its default to
play in HD which is pretty nice and then
you've got your flag if you want a flag
it is inappropriate now the comments are
where things get a bit weird if you want
to just leave a comment in general it's
time to respond to this video 500 q
limit is still there you go ahead and
just type whatever you like hi you've
got the option right here to attach a
video made it a bit easier to do that if
you want to make a video response it's
now broken up into highest rated comment
so it's rated by those plus or a thumbs
up and thumbs down you can go ahead and
put your mouse right over one of the
comments and you get a bit more options
here so you can reply directly to it and
it pulls out the reply button and it
sort of takes a Twitter approach with
the at and then the username so you know
what they're saying and who you're
replying to get the same options you
have before as far as the thumbs up
thumbs down the flag if you want to
delete it so go ahead and cancel that
you gets the highest rated post right
here and now here are the most recent
posts so again the same option if you
just take your mouse and pull it over it
turn it becomes dark grey and you can go
ahead and leave your comments I used to
like to be able to see when the
were left how many minutes ago it sort
of helped me keep track of views and
people are looking at it um not really
here so much anymore fortunately which
is a bit annoying the layout is going to
take some getting used to it is
certainly certainly very very very
different than what we've seen in the
past for producers of video I assume
that you're going to see a bit of an
uptick as far as video views people are
claiming that they're seeing upwards of
almost ten percent increase video views
because of this list down here on the
right-hand side people have options to
see more related content so in that way
it's nice you're getting a bit more
exposure but I think it's coming at the
expense of perhaps a bit of a clutter
layout when YouTube did their other
updates to the channel and we got sir
that new channel layout it must have
been about a year ago that was met with
the bit of resistance as well by me
personally I wasn't a big fan of it but
I've become used to it and serve just
become the standard way of doing
business and sort of looking at videos
on YouTube and I assume that we're going
to see the same thing here with this new
layout there's bound to be a bit of a
backlash initially and eventually it'll
just become the way you tube looks it's
part of the eventual and gradual sort of
evolution of the site as they work to
improve it if you're unhappy with it and
you can certainly let YouTube know and
perhaps your feedback can be used for
the next updates if you are happy with
it you can let them know as well there
are plenty of ways to do that ok guys
I'm curious what you think about the new
layout whether you love it hate it you
don't care they like to be able to see
more videos you like the less
information up here or what do you think
it's a little bit weird down here it's
definitely interesting so curious what
you guys have to say text or video
response i am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i will see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
