Zeno as well from S&amp;amp;P global market
intelligence guys John what you know
again apples still talking about revenue
declines and and that sort of thing on
the year but what do you make of the
results you know I can talk about apples
product line and where they're at and
Apple right now is very reminiscent of
blackberry formerly rim from eight years
ago a company resting on their laurels
that seems to have stopped innovating
several years ago if you look at Apple's
flagship 15-inch MacBook Pro that's
using a processor that is three
generations old even current gen iPhones
barely can keep up with what Samsung and
LG are offering I'm not overly
optimistic on Apple's next-gen product
offerings John this job that job I'll
take it for a moment
I got a pushback against the idea that
Apple's not innovating and is like
blackberry of yesterday here the problem
with blackberry wasn't that it didn't
pick up the latest chip fast enough off
the shelf you just have to pick it up
off the shelf from Intel in order to
slap it into a laptop that's easy the
problems that they misjudged the entire
direction of what consumers wanted they
didn't prepare themselves to deliver
apps they didn't prepare themselves to
deliver touchscreens and it's not clear
at this point you can make it argument
about virtual reality or something like
that it's not clear at this point that
Apple is fundamentally misjudging what
people want from mobile technology I
think it's too soon to say that are they
behind perhaps in artificial
intelligence in BOTS and that sort of
thing perhaps but at WWDC they announced
a lot of technology a lot of software
hinted at a lot of services that could
very well be in line with what's been
talked about by the likes of Google and
Facebook and Amazon so I don't think
we're quite there yet so John Breton so
allow me allow me to counter that for a
moment I was at WWDC as well and apples
certainly not going anywhere they're the
culmination of the reputation that's
where a lot of their intrinsic value is
but quarter-over-quarter that refuge
reputation is diminishing taking things
that they're not in like 360 and virtual
reality completely out of the equation
the highest resolution Apple phone right
now is 1080p you've got 2 k 4k phones
out Apple is even touching that things
like fast charge and wireless charging
Apple doesn't offer that consumers are
seeing competitors offer those things
for generations and generations and
till apple offers cutting-edge specs to
match their pretty solid operating
system I think they're gonna see
customers start so Matt we just heard
from Qualcomm that the premium end of
the smartphone market is languishing wow
it's the lower end that's doing well
Apple clearly made a good call in coming
out with the iPhone se when they did
it's not just a matter of throwing
whatever feature out there you've got to
get the right features because yeah
wireless charging might be exciting to
folks in North America but that's not
where people are buying phones right now
and they're not buying them on that
particular spec so to make sure I follow
you're suggesting that Apple focuses on
the lower end of the spectrum completely
going the opposite direction they've
done since their inception of their
history based on one iPhone se model
which they had one good quarter of let's
see how that does for another year when
you have other ninety nine any cost
coming out with features doesn't make
you a success you have to come out with
the right features at the right price
point at the right time and I think part
of the challenge with Apple is they're
so big we think about all these things
that they could be doing and wouldn't it
be great but if you do a bunch of stuff
and it's the wrong stuff there's a cost
to dismantling that and then going ahead
and doing the right thing so I've been
it's been okay anybody but you can't
just throw the stuff at the wall yeah
and there's also a cost of not adding
these features that consumers are
hearing about certainly the low end of
the spectrum I get emerging markets I
can understand but the people that are
buying that five to come to other iPhone
which I believe is what most people were
buying there's an expectation of
features at that price point and if you
want to take apples entire product line
with iPhones and based it on just one of
the iPhone se I think that's a bit
short-sighted Apple's bread and butter
is still that iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
