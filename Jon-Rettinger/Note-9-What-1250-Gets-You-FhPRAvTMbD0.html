TechnoBuffalo and every single year
around August or September Samsung will
invite several publications tech
bloggers or YouTube channels to announce
their new Galaxy Note smartphone and
this year is no exception
today Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 9
and I'm here to tell you the truth about
it and everything you need to know about
it but before we continue make sure to
go hit that subscribe button and turn on
that notification bell so you won't miss
any of our upcoming Galaxy Note 9
coverage cool alright let's get started
the first thing you need to know about
the Galaxy Note 9 that it has an updated
s-pen which now has bluetooth capability
in a battery that'll take around 40
seconds or so to charge now what this
means for you is that you'll be able to
use the s-pen as the shutter button for
the camera which is great if you love
taking selfies you can also use it as a
clicker if you're doing a presentation
now the latency between the screen and
the pen is also improve I didn't really
notice any input lag which is a big deal
if you're using the s-pen for drawing or
jotting down notes the note 9 also comes
in two colors that will launch in the US
ocean blue and lavender purple the
lavender purple version has the same
color matching s-pen as the phone the
ocean blue color on the other hand is
the only variant with that unique yellow
S Pen there were also reports of a third
color and this gold copper variant
unfortunately Samsung didn't tell us
anything about it although it could be
an international model that just hasn't
been announced yet the dual 12 megapixel
cameras in the back is similar to last
year's Note 8 spec wise it's all very
similar both sensors are still optically
stabilized it has a wide angle and
portrait lens with live focus but what's
new this year is intelligent camera
which uses artificial intelligence and
algorithms that live inside the device
that can automatically detect 20
different types of scenes ranging from
food to landscape to flowers just to
name a few
now this new feature will apparently
give you sharper and more color precise
photos out of the camera now upfront the
screen hasn't changed much it's slightly
I mean slightly bigger it's now six
point four inches compared to six point
three inches it's still qhd+ and it has
that very vibrant Super AMOLED look to
it
now what hasn't changed though is that
chin at the bottom it's not going
we bezel this yet and in typical Samsung
fashion they refuse to add a notch which
is totally fine by me
but it does end up making the phone feel
ginormous when holding it one hand
around back you'll notice that the
fingerprint reader has now been moved
under the camera which is where it
should have been in the first place so
thank you Samsung the Galaxy Note 9 also
features some beefy specs it has
qualcomm snapdragon 845
it also has 6 gigabytes of RAM for the
hundred twenty eight gigabyte variant
and eight gigabytes of RAM for the 512
gigabyte variant it also includes a cat
18 LTE modem which apparently will give
you blazing download and upload speeds
up to 1.2 gigabytes per second Samsung
is also packin a huge 4000 milliamp hour
battery which I'm really excited about
because that just shows how confident
Samsung is after the whole note 7 Fiasco
same thing didn't say how long the
battery will last but we're really
excited to put it through its paces once
we have it in the studio Samsung Dex is
also a big push for the Galaxy Note 9
thanks to this USBC adapter it's
essentially a USBC on one end and HDMI
on the other I played with it for a few
minutes and was super impressed with its
performance and how seamless the
experience was now I'll probably never
use this just because I have a laptop
and a desktop PC but if you're the kind
of person who works from their phone
you'll really love this fortnight's also
a big selling point for Samsung this
year because they'll have fortnight as
an exclusive game for a few days
and will also include special skins if
you download it from their game launcher
app so what's it gonna cost you well the
hundred when tu gigabyte version with
six here bytes of RAM will retail for
$1,000 and the 512 gigabyte variant
would eat gigabytes of RAM will be
available for 1250 you can start
pre-ordering the note 9 starting August
10 and will hit stores on August 24th
now that you are all caught up you know
the truth about the Galaxy Note 9
I think the Samsung built an amazing
powerhouse smartphone having a hundred
twenty eight gigabyte as a base storage
is awesome and the fact that you can
spec it up to 512 gigabytes and get a
gigabytes of RAM is truly amazing
I wish the design was a little bit
different I think it still looks too
similar to last year's no-date but what
do you guys think of the note 9 let us
know in the comments down below start a
conversation we're definitely going to
do a lot more coverage
on the note nine so be sure to hit that
subscribe button and turn on that
notification bell so you know when we
upload those videos anyways a Marklin
sang it from TechnoBuffalo
and yeah i'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
