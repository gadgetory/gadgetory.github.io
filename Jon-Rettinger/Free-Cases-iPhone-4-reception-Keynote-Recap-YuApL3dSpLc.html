technobuffalo here the apple keynote
address the iphone four reception issue
just ended let me go ahead and tell you
what happened so first the conference
began with youtube videos showing that
the iphone 4 was dropping calls they had
video showing people holding the phone
they had a guy talking about fanboys and
really overall just saying apple doesn't
care about the user then Steve Jobs came
on say just sort of try and change that
perception we just sort of been sweeping
the internet over the past 22 days it
seemed to look down they got some notes
in front of me the keynote just and then
started with some facts they've sold
over three million iphone which is an
amazing number on they went into some
more details so the percentage of people
calling apple care about in 10 issues is
point five five percent so a little bit
over half a percent the rate of returns
for back to AT&amp;amp;T or apple stores in
general is less than one-third of the
3gs OS people are actually returning the
devices and the drop calls prepared to
the 3gs is actually less than 14 100 but
that doesn't mean the are more dropped
calls on the iphone 4 in the word on the
outgoing 3gs model so Apple didn't MIT
there was a problem so they've been
trying really hard to make all their
users happy there was a bit of Apple
hubris there as well which is definitely
noticeable but let me tell you what the
solution is Apple is going to be
offering a free case to everyone a case
does fix a problem they said they can't
make enough of these bumpers to give
away to everybody they will be giving
away a free case no good choice a free
case and you can do it all online
starting next week if you already bought
a bumper you will have the opportunity
to get a full refund for your 30 bucks
for this very little piece of plastic
now if you're like me i also bought an
iphone dock i use the dock to charge my
phone at night which isn't going to fit
with the case which is quite annoying
less to keep bonaparte slides off
whatever they'd rather not do so i don't
know if you guys are going to be annoyed
if you also use a dump with something to
sort of keep in mind a few other bits of
pieces if you want to return the phone
you have the option within three days
return the phone
that will waive the restocking fees if
you're not happy to drop calls you can
just take your phone right back to apple
hand it to them take your cash get your
upgrade back and go merrily on your way
on another note the white iphone 4 will
be shipping at the end of july in 17
more countries will be getting the
iphone 4 at the same time july 30 so
those solution here is a free case i
have knowledge that there was an
algorithm problems as well and they fix
that with the update the release
yesterday for the software but overall
there should be a better experience to
get a free case which is great i guess
how the case manufacturers right now
probably aren't going to be so happy
Apple probably isolated a lot of their
manufacturing partners like giving away
cases but such is such a due process so
how do you guys feel about this I'm a
bit ambivalent a sort of much the most
expected I expected free bumpers we give
it away but evidently it's hard to
manufacture these little plastic guys so
sort of very interesting to see what
happened I really want to hear what you
guys have to say so sound off in the
comments I'm John right under the
TechnoBuffalo see you the next video
