TechnoBuffalo here the LGG watch isn't
the only Android wear device in town
I've got Samsung's offering this is the
Samsung gear live no Tizen no Android OS
to be found here it is running Android
and Google's own Android wear OS which
is Google now on your wrist go ahead
open up see what it's all about
all right so here is the box for the
Samsung gear live looking like the rest
of the modern generation Samsung boxes
what's where that fake wood finish
sitting over cardboard so Samsung gear
all over it some specs on the back that
I know it's Super AMOLED the rest of
that stuff but I will run through all
the specs with you let me take my
unboxing scissors
they cut the seal and let's dig in and
see what the Samsung gear live is all
about so I saw this unveiled at Google
i/o about two weeks ago and I can't wait
impressed so there it is sitting plastic
right on top almost identical boxing to
what we saw with the gear 2 what else
are we going to have inside we've got
looks to be just a painfully annoying a
little charging guy this is what we saw
a very similar again with gear 2 a
little piece of plastic the watch just
sits in it and you plug in the microUSB
right there and it kind of doesn't
really sit firmly on the table so that
is familiar we've got also a wall warts
connected to a micro USB but if you have
a 9 micro another micro USB port you'll
be good to go presumably in this
modern-day you have ones SP pair with an
Android device 4.3 or higher so that
device probably has a micro USB cord
laying around
so here the specs on the Samsung gear
live it's got a 1.6 3 Super AMOLED
display that's 320 by 320 being powered
by Android wear it's got a 1.2 here it's
processor under the hood alright so
Google services you'd expect we will now
voice Maps Navigation clouds and
hangouts this one does have a heart rate
monitor and go ahead and show you that
built in but it's gonna only work when
you have the app open and supposed to
only work when you're resting so see how
effective that actually is going to be
ip67 dust and water ease
which is nice so you're not gonna worry
about getting it from damaged it does
have changeable straps to standard a
millimeter size so if you don't like the
strap on here you go ahead and customize
that any way you choose available in
black and wine red stop bluetooth 4.0
accelerometer gyroscope compass in the
heart rate monitor 512 megabytes of RAM
four gigs of internal storage and
powering it is a 300 million power
battery which is 100 milliamp hours less
don't we see with the LG G watch I
thought that's gonna matter has yet to
be seen again available from Google Play
Store and Samsung and other retail
outlets for 199 dollars this guy though
has a button which should make powering
it on marketable easier so let me go and
get this guy all set up and paired to my
Nexus 5 and we'll take a quick look and
to the UI as we got this guy all paired
up and ready to go and I am already
thankful that it's got a button on the
side so here is the gear live and what
it looks like it looked just like a
regular watch it's all ready for me to
talk but I'm not ready to talk to it
quite yet
let's hit that home button looks like a
regular analog watch if you tap it
though you get sort of those gears that
show up if you want to see the rest of
Samsung's watch faces if you long press
you can see you've got dark analog pick
up your photos in there it's sort of the
rests or the I think look typical
SmartWatch style but they have some neat
ones in here every manufacturer has
their own you can sort of just walk
through and find one that works of
course you can download way more but the
dark analog I think at least for me is
my favorite so alright it tells time
what else does it do does a lot of other
stuff so for example if I double tap you
can go ahead and see what you can do
take a note to drink water remind me to
do stuff you can show my steps my heart
rate monitor send a text email you free
on Friday agenda for today navigation
you can set the timer if you want set
stopwatch and the rest of that stuff go
ahead and see other stuff there you've
got a little keep in the apps that
you've got installed go ahead and go
home alright let's go ahead and try one
and set it with double tap okay Google
set timer for 30 minutes please
and I don't want that to go off but it
would if I wanted it to and essentially
it's just google not write on your phone
so if you get emails if you get text for
example bills show up right can you can
sort of swept through the cards to see
how they work so I should get a text
here in just a second as an example I'll
show you what that's gonna look like so
there it is from Ron Prieta so you've
got different actions here I could flip
it to the right to get rid of it or you
get action if you swipe to the left so I
can reply like you swiping I can mark it
as read I can call Ron if I go ahead and
go to reply we'll go ahead and do that
it'll open up the app on my phone and
then I can reply directly to Ron from
the device so you can't at least as of
now type stuff out on here before
responses supposedly though you can use
voice to send responses but really we
haven't seen anything yet there are a
ton of app server they all - a ton I
mean like 25 but more will supposedly be
coming very soon that's for the big ones
here like lift so you can call a car
answer the Google stalwarts like maps
and hangouts and of course Android wear
and some other airline stuff are their
design way so it looks very similar to
the other Samsung Smart Watch let me
bring in the gear - here for example
you're sort of close your eyes real fast
hard to tell the difference between the
two of them then sort of the physical
home button will they tell they are from
the same family of course the gear cues
got the camera and the actual home
button the back so look pretty identical
you can see the heart rate monitors
built-in if I can get that for you can
see they look almost exactly the same
there we go
I look almost identical already been
infuriating though as the band here on
the gear live got those two things you
got to sort of put on your wrist and
with one hand to try and make them
buckle to find one that works for chily
though the bands are removable you can
put on whatever the heck you want for
just for a fun comparison let's bring in
the LG do you watch you can see sort of
these two next to each other side by
side you sort of see that so a more
curved approach here to the Samsung LG
took more of a slate approach you know
different strokes different folks of
course we'll do a full review of both of
these devices and of course they for
review as well of the new operating
system and see what it's got to do and
how it works and rest of stuff Android
wear can possibly do for it
together you want to see bleep in the
comments down below so next time I'm
John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo see you
guys next video
thank you guys for watching if you like
what you saw please subscribe they'll be
the first ones to know when new videos
come up we have a ton of stuff we do
unboxing to do hands-on reviews cars and
everything in between the Ness to
consumer electronics we'd love to have
you stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
