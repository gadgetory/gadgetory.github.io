TechnoBuffalo here Fitness accessories
are all the rage I'm using them as I try
and slim down and get back in shape this
is so nice for a we saw it announced
back at CES this is the Sony smartband
let's go ahead take a look at it see
you're smart this sucker really is so
here is the box for the Sony smart band
we've got the black version and if I can
count very quickly it's available in
nine different colors from white to
black and all kinds of other stuff in
between so the I did hear that it's
gonna track your life so it does typical
sort of smart band type stuffs gonna
track your steps and all that rest of
that goodness but it's also gonna
vibrate when you get phone calls and use
it as a media controller and a few other
cool features Sony very smartly did not
make this only compatible to experience
am sung but you do need Android 4.4 and
Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy the ton of
phones this will work with but the
highlights are probably the Nexus 5 with
Nexus 4 HTC One the galaxy line of
devices least a newer one so you should
be able to use this with a ton of
Android phone you picked up an Android
device in the past probably eight months
you shouldn't have any issues and it's
definitely checkup edibility before you
pick one up gonna pick one up price is
sort of range online but the cheapest
I've seen it was about ninety bucks
so go ahead and take this out and this
is nothing more than a holder just piece
of rubber push up the side for a quick
second this is where all the action
happens I'll try and pop that sucker out
this is you know the the guts behind the
sony smartband push that off for one
second seed also going to have in case
you want sort of a more typical watch
esque experience i've got this guy I
think it's probably a little bit smaller
so if you've got a smaller wrist nice
and sewn you included that and here's
just a tiny little micro USB charging
cable and then some books so make sure
you how this goes in it should be pretty
obvious though take this take this
do a little bit of this action
and you laugh at the bass slap it on
your wrist and that's pretty much it and
you can control it via buttons on the
side take it out here for a quick sec
I'm you can see what you've got so
you've got one button they will give you
sir l IDI indication spending on how
much battery is in there that's we're
gonna charge it and that's pretty much
it super tiny when I use this at CES my
concern was that this could kind of come
out but thing is it's it's sort of on
your wrist with your wrists were pushing
up on it not much danger they're coming
out in fact to get it to come out even
without it takes a little bit of effort
so those fears are pushed aside it's
very competitively priced with other
options out there
I like the fuel band sort of Samsung's
offerings but Sony's first real foray
into this I'm kind of excited to take a
look at it any questions you guys have
for things you want to know about the
device please let me know and I'll do a
full hands-on if you are interested
until then I'm John render from

please subscribe right here to be the
first ones to know whenever new videos
get uploaded we got a ton of stuff we do
