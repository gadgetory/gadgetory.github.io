typically think of Android iOS maybe
even Blackberry but back in 2009 there
was another player on the block that
brought some brand new features and
things that we take for granted right
now let's take some member berries and
take a retrospective look at the prom
pretty 2009 was the Wild West for
smartphones Apple is really just
starting to establish its dominance the
App Store had really just come into its
own Android was starting to really
establish itself as a dominant player
but there was still room in the
marketplace for a third operating system
the folks at Palm the makers of the trio
and the pilots thought they had the
answer entered the Palm Pre the main
selling feature of the Palm Pre was
operating system webOS maybe not
familiar with it or you think it's just
what powers LG TVs today but it was one
of the best os's I have ever seen and I
think it had the best way to handle
multitasking even to this day rely on a
system of cards you can move cards
around rearrange cards you can swipe
them right off the screen to close apps
it was really elegant and relied solely
on multi-touch for pretty much
everything except for typing which we
will definitely talk about one of the
killer features at webOS in the pre had
is has been called synergy and integrate
information from a ton of sources it
allows you to sign into accounts like
Gmail Yahoo Facebook LinkedIn and
Outlook and took all those contacts
integrate them into a single contact
list which sounds kind of simple today
back in 2009 it was totally
revolutionary on the software front I
think palm did an absolutely incredible
job in retrospect it ended up being
really underpowered and weak hardware
that I think doomed the OS Egypt with
256 megabytes of RAM eight gigs of
storage and a tiny miniscule three point
one inch 320 by 480 screen and it was
riddled with problems from day one the
hardware of the original Prix was really
underpowered and it held back the OS
from being as smooth so people were used
to with iOS at the time that wasn't
ultimately what did the Prien they made
a few mistakes first they launched
exclusively was sprint and they had a
creepy ad campaign that went with it it
was a strange-looking lady that didn't
resonate with anyone I remember camping
out at the Sprint store to get a Palm
Pre first one I got together box set it
up it was broken went back to the store
second one set it up broken again wasn't
until my third Palm Pre they found it
got one that worked that was again when
the issues with the Palm Pre was quality
issues
mechanisms that loosen could often
wiggle all about and the issue became
known as I still think it's a best name
for a problem today Oreo twist the phone
would slide out in reveal a keyboard and
for an OS that relied solely on touch
having a physical keyboard just didn't
seem bright let alone a physical
keyboard that was in portrait mode so
it's really small keys they weren't very
tactile it often gets stuck down and it
was a horrible typing experience even
from launch day pawn was still in a
little bit of legal trouble if you
remember back in 2009 palm actually got
a little bit legally creative and when
the pre initially shipped you could sync
it with iTunes which imagine Apple was
not overly halfway out and it started a
cat and mouse game Apple would fix
iTunes it would break the sync palm
release an update and then fix it again
went back and forth for a while even
when as far as Tim Cook stating we will
not stand for people ripping off our IP
and pom responded they've quote have the
tools necessary to defend themselves so
setting up for a really cool legal
battle that never end up coming to
fruition now the Palm Pre did live long
enough to see a few updates we saw the
Palm Pre Plus we saw the pre - even the
pre three started chipping for 18 t then
was pulled from the shelves palm was
ultimately bought by HP thought they
were gonna be the savior of the
operating system ended up just kind of
burying it ultimately selling it off in
piecemeal this is kind of the end of a
sad story for the pre I love the
software I think they launched a little
better hardware and better carrier
partners we'd still be using webOS
devices today it was extremely elegant
look how it worked back in 2009 we
didn't seen anything like this before
and I think palm deserve credit for
paving the way for a lot of things that
we take for granted today but
unfortunately the Palm Pre the palm line
is no more you've got an old pre pre
plus pre - or pre 3 kicking around dust
it off plug it in turn it on remember
how awesome things used to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
