TechnoBuffalo here at a full review for
you of the Nokia Lumia 2520 there is a
lot of power patch into a very thin body
but is it worth your tablet buying
dollar in a very crowded market I put it
through its paces let me help you decide
so as I do with all my reviews I begin
with a disclaimer I used this as my only
tablet for 10 days and then another week
in conjunction with a surface pro 2 and
an iPad Mini with Retina display I'm not
going to get too much into Windows RT
I've covered it in depth but I will talk
about how it works in conjunction with
the hardware that Nokia has provided us
let's make it at the design because it's
the tab when you're gonna spend a lot of
your time holding it and perhaps
admiring at it staring at it wistfully
whispering sweet nothings into it's 8.9
millimeters thin display and it feels
absolutely incredible
it is light while still feeling
significant which is a really hard thing
to do it looks and feels like a gigantic
Lumia I really like the plastic back to
it's kind of the exact opposite of what
Microsoft did with their surface pro and
surface pro 2 no vapor mag here just
really well-constructed plastic one
thing I don't really talk about that
much in the videos for tablets or
speakers but I got to mention here the
speakers are absolutely incredible
probably the best that I've ever heard
on a tablet also the viewing angles on
this guy are ridiculous but I'll get to
that a little bit later
I do wish though after using the surface
pro 2 for a while that did have a
kickstand nothing right there at all
from a display standpoint the bezel on
the front is pretty significant so that
might be an issue for you but it's a
nice to get some out of space put your
fingers but would have liked it make my
fingers out a little bit more had a
thinner bezel still with this screen
orientation it's very weird to hold in
portrait just nothing looks right it
almost looks like Windows wasn't made
for it but it will rotate to portrait if
that is your cup of tea or you want to
use it like an e-reader or something
one giant issue of God with the tablet
is the look at that one of those ports
is a 3.5 millimeter headset jack the
other one is where you plug it in for
power which one is which so I got no
problem them using a proprietary
connector it's fine the microUSB can
provide enough power or if the USB 3.0
here
provide enough power I get it that's
fine but why make it look exactly the
same as a headset jack and then beyond
that put it on the exact same side of
the tower the headset jack is located I
honestly cannot tell which is which I
kind of have to guess when I plug it in
to see if it works or not really really
annoying in a huge design flaw from a
company that really nailed this tablet
so the 10.1 inch 1920 by 1080 screen is
really really good
if you watch by the tablet reviews you
know I like bright screen the center my
brightness all the way up but this one I
had turn the brightness down it was just
that bright and my - better-looking
screen than the surface to text look
absolutely awesome as well videos as
you'd expect were pretty gorgeous and
just looked overall very true to their
HD farm they are HD videos I would feel
very comfortable saying this is probably
one of the best screens around on a
tablet if you want to get a tablet based
on screen alone you really have to look
at this guy what you're gonna use your
tablet you might want to wear latex
gloves because every screen touch will
leave fingerprints or just carry one of
these things at the end keep doing a
scrub so I usually gloss over cameras on
tablets because I'm on it to camera on a
tablet shouldn't be using it for much
really other than some Skype video calls
but this is a Nokia device I felt like I
should talk about it six point seven
megapixel zeiss lens with f1 point on
aperture takes surprisingly good
pictures I'm pretty solid in low-light
as well which just it expects from Nokia
that said though don't use it for that
don't take it out your kids soccer game
take low-light pictures whatever it
might be use your phone for that or
maybe even a real camera so for a tablet
this thin it's impressive that they
crammed in 8,000 milliamp hour battery
and it's teeny tiny little frame and I
gotta tell you it's been absolutely
awesome it easily lasted me five full
days of brightness turned about eighty
percent up I pulled that down I could
have definitely gotten through seven to
eight days so battery life probably some
of the best I've tested on any tablet
the Snapdragon 800 and three gigs of ram
make this thing scream it's almost like
Windows RT was designed for those specs
though I would have liked either 211 AC
but it's not a giant eel 802 11 ABG and
are here I do like that they include an
NFC on here as well a lot of tablets out
days are coming with the
style stylist this one does not come
with that that's an issue for you if
you're an artist you may want to look
elsewhere I know Keith did a nice job to
it the colors have kind of become known
at their Lumia line obviously red white
black and cyan all look really really
good a Nokia does offer a keyboard
accessory sort of similar to what we saw
with Microsoft Surface but I couldn't
test it out so I don't know if that
helps or detract from it or how thick
and does but just protect the screen as
well so if we the market for tablet
aren't already set in iOS or Android you
really should look at this it's
available for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon and
pricing is gonna depend on where you go
and when you watch this video but assume
around 200 bucks ish with their LTE
support onboard so the few caveats here
with Windows RT can only use apps that
are available from the Windows Store and
that is growing there's a fair amount of
apps there now things I use the most are
all their Twitter and Facebook are all
present you cannot use legacy apps so
absolute you might have used on Windows
7 Vista or even XP won't work but it
does come with a full desktop version of
Microsoft Office and that's the full
version it's not paired down at all and
oddly enough those do launch on a
desktop really all you can do is access
those applications and Windows Explorer
but they are there it's nice to have
those options overall though I really
like this tablet now we don't usually
give quarter reviews usually it's you
know point five increments I kept going
back and forth on I want to give this an
eight point five or nine so I'm gonna
break the mold string give it an eight
point seven five it's a really well-done
tablet tablet I enjoyed using on a daily
basis and I might put my surface pro two
down for a while and between you using
this something I don't need anything on
the desktop side nokia did an incredible
job with this first foray into Windows
tablet I look forward to what comes from
them next and that you might gloss over
this looking at tablets but you really
really should give it a look it's one of
the best tablets out on the market thank
