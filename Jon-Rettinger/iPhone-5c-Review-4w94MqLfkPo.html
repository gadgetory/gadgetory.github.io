are reviewing this guy the iPhone 5c
it's a really interesting little
mid-range kind of device so let's check
it out so I know John tends to do
reviews in a very specific way I kind of
tend to go a little bit different with
mine in real-world use cases so I'm
going to tell you guys a little bit
about this phone and why I think it's an
interesting addition to the Apple lineup
so let's start off with the design
because obviously this is the big deal
on the iPhone 5c they've added
polycarbonate backs polycarbonate casing
to the phone honestly I was expecting
these to be a little bit more poppy like
I was expecting needs to be almost neon
ish I'm kind of disappointed that it
ended up not going that way these are a
little bit more muted than I had
originally thought I'm not a huge fan
oddly enough before I saw the cases with
the holes in them the Kinect for cases I
know and now that I've seen them on the
devices again they're a little bit more
muted than I would have liked so I don't
know if I like that combination but
generally speaking as to the
polycarbonate itself they really made a
great choice because obviously the
iPhone 5 is prone to scuffs that is no
longer an issue with this you don't feel
worried about scratching up your device
you don't feel concerned about you know
dropping it and getting a big dent this
is definitely a really nice design by
Apple and it's certainly not the first
time we've seen a beautiful colorful
polycarbonate phone Koff Nokia Lumia is
but again those are great devices and
their build quality is really lovely so
at the end of the day I think that this
was a really good choice by Apple
especially in offering a lower priced
iPhone or less expensive iPhone but I
certainly wouldn't by any stretch of the
word call it cheap because it doesn't
feel cheap in the hand
it absolutely feels like a nice phone it
feels like a good solid device it
doesn't feel flimsy at all so I have to
give Apple credit for designing the
phone
again I would have liked maybe even
brighter colors hardware wise the iPhone
5c is rockin the exact same a6 processor
that the iPhone 5 had so if you want to
check that out you can check out our
review of the iPhone 5 but generally
speaking using the iPhone 5c was it
really pleasurable experience there
wasn't a lot of slowdown it handles iOS
7 really well even though some of the
animations were just the hair slower
than on the 5s
there was no real noticeable breakdown
in speed especially when compared to a
device like the iPhone 4s which
certainly has had its fair share of
issues handling some of the stuff
happening in iOS 7 on to camera so the
camera again the same thing that is
happening in the iPhone 5 so nothing
totally different I do like the new
camera app I think it's a really
well-designed app it's clean much better
design than some of the other first
party apps that Apple has added in iOS 7
I'm looking at you calendar but the
camera app does very well the shutter is
very quick I haven't had any issues
taking pictures again it does every now
and again does suffer in low-light it
depends on the setting you do tend to
get that washed outlook because it
doesn't have the true tone flash like
the iPhone 5s does if you're shooting in
low light but generally speaking I would
say on par with any phone in its class
so an HTC One mini or anything that's
around $99 on contract here in the
States in terms of battery life you're
looking at a days use I tend to be a
relatively I'd say moderate user I'm not
a power user by any means I use the
phone to listen to podcasts on my way
into work and home I also use a check
email and do other things throughout the
day but I'm not a power user by any
means I'm not you know jamming through
Infinity Blade 3 for 4 hours on my phone
during the day I will say that with iOS
7 this particular setup has suffered
slightly in terms of battery life I know
that the iPhone 5 has kind of seen the
same battery life hit that we've seen
here on the 5c so you're probably
looking at maybe 10% less using iOS 7
than you would see before but generally
speaking it's not that much time
especially if you're a light to moderate
user overall the iPhone 5c is a great
device for anybody looking to pick up an
iPhone that isn't the most current
generation of iPhone if you don't want a
flagship or you don't feel it's
necessary or if you don't have the money
the iPhone 5c is a great choice if you
like iOS and you've been in the Apple
ecosystem for a while with that being
said we gave it a solid 8 and I think
it's a really respectable score for a
phone that would be considered sort of a
mini variant of its flagship counterpart
so an HTC One is a great great great
phone the HTC One mini is great in its
own right as well and I think we can say
the same thing about the iPhone 5c ah
