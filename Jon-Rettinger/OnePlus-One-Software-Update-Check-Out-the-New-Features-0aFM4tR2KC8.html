from TechnoBuffalo and today we're here
to show you what's included in a recent
1+1 update this update is slowly rolling
out to 1+1 users as we speak but we have
it right here for you guys right now so
let's get on with the video so the first
thing you'll notice once you update your
1+1 is that the screen is cooler than
before 1 plus listened to its customers
and even though we weren't bothered by
the previous screen color on the 1+1
they made some tweaks to get the display
of software look whites are definitely
whiter and overall I'm really starting
to like the cooler look one plus since
anagen mod also upgraded the software to
Android 4.4.4 meaning users will be able
to use the very latest version of
Google's apps also changed is that
infamous 4G icon up at the top which was
finally replaced with an LTE icon now
this update also includes the addition
of clear image in a camera app according
to 1 plus it's basically your camera on
clarity steroids it'll take ten
individual shots in a matter of seconds
and stitch them together first super
high-res photo it's very similar to what
you'll find on the Oppo find 7 and 7 a's
50 megapixel shots but oneplus is
keeping the images at 13 megapixels to
keep the file size down and when we
tested clear image we found it works
surprisingly well
we thought it would just be a gimmick
but the result speaks for themselves it
works fairly quick and with the help of
software algorithms it'll make the photo
much cleaner and sharper oneplus one
also made a few changes to the trebuchet
launcher where you can now customize and
change settings within their home screen
so if you hold down anywhere in the
screen and swipe up you get all the
options in one place and if you enable
search panel swipe to the right you know
have access to Google now whereas before
that wasn't available and finally ok
Google inside the Google now page
finally works which is always a great
addition to have oneplus also increase
the capacitive button illumination
though the backlight is still very faint
so the buttons are still difficult to
see during the day but they're
noticeably brighter in lower light
condition unfortunately there's no
options and tweak the brightness of the
buttons just yet so hopefully that's
added in future build and then within
the Settings app there's also a new
search button up at the top making it
super easy to find what you're looking
for now if you've seen our full review
of the oneplus one which will link down
below this video
we mentioned that the call quality and
speakerphone were both horrible and we
could barely hear the person we were
talking to and this update we noticed
quality and volume is improved
tremendously and the speakerphone is
much louder than before obviously we
can't show you that in video but just
know that they fix that problem which is
great I also noticed that in this build
the lockscreen gestures aren't as
sensitive as they were before
Torche no longer randomly activates in
my pocket and launching the camera app
using two circle gesture has gotten a
bit faster now overall we love this
update it included some very welcoming
features while also improving overall
experience with some welcoming bug fixes
of course experience still isn't perfect
but the Santa John mod team is making
some wonderful progress so we can't wait
to see what features hit the oneplus one
next and that's it for this video guys
if you guys have any questions let us
know in the comments down below I'm mark
Lin Sangin from TechnoBuffalo I'll see
you guys in the next video thank you
