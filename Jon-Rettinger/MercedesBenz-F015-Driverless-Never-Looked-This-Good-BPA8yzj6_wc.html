to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's up everyone John
render from TechnoBuffalo here we are at
CES 2015 CES is all about the tech of
today but it's also about the tech of
tomorrow and behind me Mercedes has what
they think you're gonna be driving in 15
years so think about where you're going
to be in 15 years what are you gonna be
doing what are you be wearing and most
importantly for Mercedes what are you
gonna be driving if their plan comes
fruition it's gonna be some version of
this guy this is their f15 quite
obviously concept car which part of
their vision 2030 this thing packs a ton
a technology first of all completely
autonomous and this not type of
autonomous that you have to sit behind
the wheel in focus this is like go to
sleep take a nap wake up refreshed at
work so it's built out of carbon fiber
aluminum and high-strength steel which
convenes forty percent lighter than
traditional car this thing is all about
the future and is blanketed by display
six displays to be exact creating what
they call a digital arena ever you look
you were just surrounded by screens and
while you're sitting in your f15 you'll
be sitting in one of four bucket seats
which you can completely swivel any
direction to you can face each other
talk to your bass and your talk people
behind you whatever you want to do we
stop real fast and tell you about the LG
G flex to sing expect to the gills
highlighted by a 5.5 inch full HD p oled
screen and what better way to take
advantage of that P OLED screen then
with images captured by its 13 megapixel
rear camera because autonomous you want
to make sure that's going to be safe as
well so it's got pedestrian awareness
the pedestrians double you're coming the
gorgeous looking grill also has an array
of LED lights on it that illuminates the
pedestrians know you are going to be
there however not some version of this
car comes to mark in 15 years right this
is a reference design for future cars
mercedes might come up with we don't
know but certainly it's a clear
departure from their current design
language it's a really good-looking one
so what you guys think something you'd
want to see are you ready
autonomous car which are coming way
quicker originally expected this thing
looks absolutely gorgeous inside the
cabin looks nicer than any first-class
cabin on any major airline I mean you
are traveling in complete style with the
f-15 and I think you guys for watching
hope you enjoyed till next time I'm
drown render from TechnoBuffalo see guys
