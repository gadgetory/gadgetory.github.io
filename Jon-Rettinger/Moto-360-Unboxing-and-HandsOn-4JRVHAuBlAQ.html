TechnoBuffalo girth and unboxing what I
think is the most anticipated Android
wear watch going
this is Motorola's round piece of
goodness the Moto 360 let's go ahead and
take a first look this guy is available
right now you can find one for a pretty
competitive price of $249 if I was a
betting man I would have guessed is
probably going to come in around 300 350
so I give Motorola credit for really
making an affordable price and
competitive price compared to the
competition the G watch is 229 in the
gear live is 199 bucks there's a lot of
things that goes into this including the
box kind of round and fancy talk about
quality craftsmanship making it more of
a timepiece and just super piece
electronics but we will be the judge of
let's go ahead and take off at the top I
can do that boom and they're inside the
box kind of cool it's a little Moto 360
and some cushioning for the watch face
there is the Moto 360 go ahead and pull
it out I know when you look at pictures
of this I thought the same thing until I
saw it at Google i/o it looks really
heavy it's surprisingly light actually
really not heavy at all the band here is
kind of a leathery plastic BAM they'll
be a metal version coming soon but I
believe that these are removable
standard watch backs can pick up really
whatever watch band you want your set
off to the side for a real quick second
to else you're going to get inside of
the box it got sort of a mangled mess
here it's back for Motorola's event in
Chicago so this is really cool this is
how you charge your device it uses
inductive charging I believe it's too
pretty why the available Qi standard you
put it up on here is sort of a cool
interface and it will start to charge
and charge very quickly evidently the
rest of the stuff you just got service
standard while work not removable with
micro USB to power your Qi charger but
this should work with any Qi charger at
all go ahead and pull off that wasn't a
satisfying for whooshing noise that
usually like I will go ahead and get the
sucker powered on here I will take a
look at the Moto 360 so specs you're
looking at a round and it is really sort
of pixel to the edge
display its 320 by 2 90 105 PPI
performing why it's not serving even
pixel resolution the bottom right there
as where all the senses are going to
live it's probably why you can see it's
not sort of full circle all the way
around it's got a backlit LCD IPS screen
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top 320
million power battery which stinks sound
like that much we used to sort of way
way way more in the thousands what's a
polies going to get you all day use
which is really nice for Android wear
and get from the issues that I had with
the existing Android wear devices it's
being powered by a TI OMAP 3 processor
it's got four teams of internal storage
and 512 megabytes of RAM which is crazy
that watches have that now it's like my
computer from a few years ago it is ip67
so through water and dust resistant but
definitely do not take this sucker
underwater it's got dual microphones and
vibration motor and sort of a really
cool sort of button that looks like a
traditional watch speaking of what it
looks like take a look to the device
itself it's got aluminum all the way
around the side you can see one two
microphones there
I just looks really really nice really
looks like a watch it looks like a watch
let me show you why I think so go ahead
and give it a tap with your finger over
it turn it on on the reason I think this
looks like a real watch as the watch
faces actually just look like a regular
watch and got a ton of options here go
ahead and hold this down I'm serious you
get all the watch face options there we
go you can see sort of minimal designs
dials classic rotate digital and the
rest will really look very neat motor
was taking it one step further after you
pair this to your smart phone I'll go
ahead and bring out my phone here I've
got a pair to a one plus one if we go
ahead and open up Motorola connect you
can serve customize the watch faces even
further I can see your watch faces your
wellness profile in the last location
you're at I've got a pair to my oneplus
one we go into watch races here let's
say you like the minimal design but you
don't like that second hand being read
you can customize that you can really
make it look any way you want they've
done just a really really cool job with
them do that with really all the watch
choices here until sir the EPI for watch
Isis become public this is really the
best implementation for customization
I've seen Motorola did a really cool job
with it you also go through and set your
own wellness profile your height your
weight gender and birth
it's got sensors on the bottom of a gear
it's got heart rate sensor pedometer and
be it light sensor and stuff so it'll
sort help you stay fit as well let's go
back to the watch the rest of it here
though is a very standard Android wear
that we've seen before
got the okay Google didn't ask it a
question go ahead and push that one
button on the side if you want to mute
it and go ahead and pull down you go see
your battery a percentage and a date
now it's muted no it's unmuted other sis
stuff is really standard Android wear
you get all of your google notifications
that show up right here and nothing else
that unique aside from how the watch
looks and the watch faces and it looks
really awesome so I'll go ahead and do a
bit more in-depth tour will show you a
bit more about what Android wear can do
enter the rest of the stuff that we've
come to see from Android wear googles
promising an update coming in a month or
so that should add a ton more features
here as well

wear we got the Moto 360 I want to hear
it thoughts on it until next time I'm
