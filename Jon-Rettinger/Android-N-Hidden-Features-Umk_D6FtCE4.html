can technobuffalo here by a time Android
n starts arriving on new Nexus devices
sometime in the next few months it'll
bring with it hundreds of improvement
some we've already shown the big
flagship ones things like multitasking
and new notification shade but there
have been a lot of other improvements
we're seeing in the first beta that
Google hasn't talked about let me tell
you what some of those surprises are
first the built-in file manager is a lot
more powerful you might not even know
that stock marshmallow actually had a
built-in file explorer already in it but
it got way more powerful of Android n
it's a bit hidden though if you want to
find it go to setting storage and
explore the file manager now I've got a
proper name called Explorer perhaps and
knowledge everyone's favorite browser
but allows you to move files reading
files and folders create new folders and
kind of everything you'd expect from a
file explorer to do can also open
multiple instances of explorer to help
you hop between separate folders kind of
handy we still want more robust options
you're still better off downloading a
third party one if you don't like third
party apps least you got one here now
next is one that's becomes second nature
to me as I started testing Android n
double tapping the recents button lets
you switch between your last apps that's
it it does and to keep tapping it'll
take it to the previous one and previous
one in previous one tained and really
useful and you just keep tapping you can
cycle through all of your apps this next
one's going to be very handy if you get
a lot of spamming and you get a lot of
telemarketing calls like I do you can
block phone numbers at the system level
we get calls all the time people that
want us to download more ram on our
computers or tell us our windows
computers are putting out airs which is
the article you should really link to it
down below android and now is a system
level call blocking feature that's going
to apply across the entire phone and
best of all the setting is going to
persist across resets if you get a new
phone or wipe your current one you are
not starting from Ground Zero hooray
next one's pretty handy foes you guys
that use your phone as an alarm do not
disturb can set to end on a mattifying
the alarm goes off do not disturb mode
allows you to set quiet hours of block
moves around notifications and android
end though kind of get supercharged it
can be set to override your quiet hours
when your alarm first goes off in the
morning so maybe you said do not deserve
to go off at eight a.m. every morning
need to get up at 6am one day we'll
start getting notifications as soon as
that first alarm goes off without
changing your normal rules so let's
benefit phones are becoming more
important to us there are credit cards
also a way to let people know how to
reach our loved
one should something bad happen to you
you can now add emergency contact
medical information right to your home
screen so at Android n you could have
custom urgency information to your
dialer so anyone can pick up your phone
and be at least see who they should
contact should something bad happen to
you looking Bad's going to happen to you
but should something happen David II can
now see who to call but don't worry
you're gonna be you're gonna be all
right put your helmet both ways you'll
be okay so what do you guys think what
are you most excited about with Android
and is it the flagship features like
multitasking or the notification shade
are you more excited about being able to
block spammers at a system level which
probably most excited feature I'll to
your thoughts on it so just may I don't
even have marshmallow on your phone the
comments down below and let us know mash
your thumbs up button you always
appreciate it until next time John
rendered TechnoBuffalo so you guys next
