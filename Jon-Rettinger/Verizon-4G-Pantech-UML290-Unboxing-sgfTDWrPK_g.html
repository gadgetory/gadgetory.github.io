from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of one of the first Verizon Wireless LTE
4G modems this is e pantech uml 290 to
go ahead and dig in I'm really excited
to see if we get the speeds that we're
supposed to so a real quick overview
about the f/4g services Verizon is
offering it's gonna be available in 38
metropolitan cities and 60 airports from
a cost standpoint for 50 bucks you're
gonna get five gigs of data and that is
up and down you're gonna get 10 gigs of
data for $80 and if you go over it's $10
per gig there's gonna be no strata link
you can go as much as you want I'll be
where you have to pay that $10 over its
charge so 4G let's talk about speeds
you're going to get 5 to 12 megabits per
second down and 2 to 5 megabits per
second up and if you're wondering how
fast that is go to speedtest.net on your
current home connection and run a quick
test and see how fast your network is
gonna be cuz chances are your home
network it's probably gonna fall on the
same speeds that does Verizon Wireless
4G modem is supposed to get and these
are real-world speeds I've seen tests of
us getting upwards of 20 megabits per
second down so enough of the geek talk
let's go ahead and dig in there are two
modems that are available at launch
one is the pantech uml 290 that's got a
few tricks up its sleeve and the other I
believe is the LG v out 600 let's go
ahead and open this up you can get these
budgeting both modems available
off-contract so you don't have to pay
and you serve early termination fee you
don't have to worry about signing a
two-year deal for 249 dollars each
otherwise if you want to sign a contract
they're going to be 99 dollars each so
here's a Verizon Wireless access manager
stuff you are going to only be able to
use this lease for right now on PCs
there's not Mac support so I'll be
trying parallels with my MacBook Air and
see if this works so consumer
information tips and tricks and
shortcuts we're set up to the side we've
got some sort of cable I'm not sure what
this is
I imagine probably since our USB
extension cable or a dock or some sort
it looks like it is a USB extension
cable so we'll take a look at why this
might be important in just a minute here
is the modem itself stop
software installation required all right
so this modem is not what you would call
thin but it does have some sort of cool
features up its sleeve
so you can go ahead and rotate the cover
here left to right to reveal there's a
little USB port you can go ahead and
plug in this is not going to take up two
USB ports worth of space hopefully
because this port is quite small the LG
that's a little bit fatter that's going
to take up least amount of room so you
can turn this back and you can push that
in and in theory be able to use your 4G
speeds this does have a micro SD card
slot I believe for some expanded storage
or that might just be the SIM card slot
which is probably a bit more realistic
so yeah that is just assume card slot
let me correct myself that does not have
a microSD expansion card slot you're
probably wondering why this has a sim
card slot never seen in real sim cards
on and the other Verizon Wireless
devices in the past well it's because
the 4G technology is using is called LTE
which is actually a GSM based technology
which uses SIM cards so to go ahead and
take a look at this thing so in case you
are at a premium for USB ports you don't
have room to plug this in you can use
this plug it into your USB port this guy
is going to plug in right into the end
of it so keep your so when the computers
it has ports next to each other and
you're not gonna be able to access
whatever you need go and plug this in
and this little clip here actually you
can put that right on top of your laptop
and user to use this antenna to get a
bit better reception
so push it down there's off your
computer and you are off so as by no
means a small looking device certainly a
little bit larger but you sort of expect
that with the first generation of 4G
modems so let's take a look at that SIM
card slot because it is indeed going to
need a SIM card which is kind of weird
to see on a Verizon device so go ahead
and push that out usually in the past
when we've seen SIM cards it's for
Verizon's global phones usually it's
co-branded with Verizon
but this one is just Verizon 4G
interestingly enough to when they set up
the SIM card you go to the store they
are going to set up a phone number with
it even though LTE right now is not
supporting voice at least Verizon is not
supporting it let's go ahead and pop in
the SIM card on the next video I'll show
you what the setup process was like and
more importantly I will show you these
speeds go ahead and push that right in
and the SIM card is installed so I'm
gonna go ahead and get this guy set up
and come back another video and show you
what this means are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
