Noah Kravitz from TechnoBuffalo home at
last happy to be back in the East Bay
California after a week out in the
desert in Las Vegas I'll tell you what
being a tech journalists covering these
shows and everything a lot of fun not
the healthiest thing in the world and I
didn't even go near the gambling tables
didn't spend much time the casinos are
the bars or anything at CES you saw the
video John and I did from the casino
maybe you did do a hello video from the
casino in the Paris hotel but at any
rate it's a great job i'm happy to have
it here a little round up a little CES
pro cs round up my picks for some of the
most interesting some of the best things
at the show first of all again you know
this is my first official day on the job
even though we said hello before but I
here I am my name is Noah I'm the new
editor-at-large at TechnoBuffalo and
thank you for having me for those of you
who know me from my previous job thanks
for following me over here for those of
you don't you know I hope you'll give me
a shot on techna Buffalo I'm thrilled to
be working with everybody John and Sean
Winston Jack the other job everybody
TechnoBuffalo great people I'm psyched
to be here was not expecting it glad it
happened ready to get going so enough of
all that I was actually blogging CES for
NVIDIA it was a job that I took before I
took the job with TechnoBuffalo so a
little bit of strange thing for me
different experience because i was there
primarily to cover and video stuff that
being said nvidia had a ton of stuff at
the show their ticker two chips powering
a lot of stuff at the show a lot of them
more high profile stuff especially in
the mobile space and so I say that full
disclosure so you'll know I'm not on
invidious paycheck anymore but my pick
for Best in Show is a product powered by
Nvidia it's the Motorola Xoom tablet the
first google android 3.0 honeycomb
product to be shown the LG slate tablet
for tmobile was also announced but we
didn't actually see that in running form
the zoom we did see and very interesting
very impressive from what i saw a 10
inch
ablett it'll be on verizon's network
coming very soon 3g and Wi-Fi version
quarter one upgradable to the 4g LTE and
Wi-Fi version and quarter to it's got an
HD screen it does 1080p video out via
hdmi video capture on the back camera
with video capture and then on the front
you've got front facing camera for
google talk with video all the video
conferencing options but the big deal
here i think two things one the Tegra 2
chipset dual-core powered very
responsive in all the devices we saw it
in that the motorola atrix smartphone
the LG revolution the motorola droid
bionic all kinds of stuff and then also
a honeycomb and and my doors were
frankly blown off by the little bit of
honeycomb that I saw I was not expecting
such a radical remake of Android no
hands on time for it the folks from
Motorola we're not letting people
actually touch the thing and it's an
early version of software not final but
very very intrigued by what I saw a
full-on tablet interface and experience
from google so very psyched to see that
coming out the motorola xoom with google
android 30 honeycomb on verizon that's
my pick for Best in Show some other
things I saw that were very interesting
the motorola atrix a smart phone for
AT&amp;amp;T a 4g smartphone also android also
nvidia tegra 2 power not honeycomb but
android 22 that was very interesting
because it's this whole docking concept
with this web top application that lets
you use the phone like a phone computer
and the idea is that you'll have
everything you need on your phone and
then when your mobile you've got your
phone it's got a laptop dock you can
dock it into 11 inch screen with a full
keyboard and trackpad and then a desktop
dock you can hook it up to your big
screen TV for watching movies and
entertainment or you can hook it up to a
full-on system with a monitor or
keyboard and mouse for your continued
desktop computing experience very
interesting the software was very
impressive the webtop application that
fires up mozilla firefox browser with
full flash 10.1 html5 support all that
stuff i don't know if it's really going
to succeed i don't know if people really
want to use that i don't know why I
would carry you know a laptop a smart
phone and a laptop even if it's just a
dock when you know and then have to dock
it as opposed to just carrying a laptop
that's a full-on laptop with more power
native applications you know more
refined I get that the idea is you'll
have everything on your phone no matter
what I don't know how people are going
to use it very good to see you come out
that being said from just a geek tastic
point of view is very impressive you
know we've seen stuff like this before
palm folio a few other things that
didn't succeed this is the most mature
implementation of the combination of the
the computing power of the phone itself
dual core all that ram or the storage
space and then obviously the maturation
of Android and the webtop app looks very
slick so I interested to see that it
might actually be more useful as a
set-top box pumping out 1080p video if
you can do you know the full you I
mirroring and if you can do you know
Netflix and Hulu and all those apps on
your phone but but output to full HD
wherever you go that might be more
interesting of a use case than the
desktop laptop replacement even still
very interesting product the casio
tricks very interesting because it's a
consumer digital camera with full HD
video that has its really interesting
fully articulating rotating display for
me you know i need a camcorder that the
display terms all the way around so i
can frame myself for doing these kinds
of videos but i would love to have a
point and shoot that did better photos
than my camcorder but also did HD video
but was small enough like super small to
keep in my pocket so so the tricks looks
very interesting interesting to see it
come out i also think the lady gaga line
is stuff for Polaroid is interesting i'm
not saying that I'm into it or not in a
not not anything about Lady Gaga or so
but she's interesting and she's very
creative whether your lover or hater I
don't care and the whole thing with you
know reinventing the Polaroid digital
camera and there the Polaroid camera as
digital and then the glasses little
screens on the bottom interesting stuff
you know whatever you say speaking of
glasses there's also a pair of glasses
that have an active LCD screen in them
so they're like like autofocus digitally
enhanced bifocals I didn't get
chance to try them on for myself but I
heard from a few people that they're
they're really slick and possibly the
most innovative thing and I where you
know in actual corrective lenses sends
contact lenses so I'm interested to
check those out monsoons volcano line of
kind of slingbox / tivo replacements
kind of a place shifter and a DVR very
very interesting won some awards lots of
3d tech I think 3d glasses free TV or
glasses-free 3d rather will be a very
very important thing if anybody can get
a radar decent price point so far with
3d people don't want to have to wear
glasses in their living room at the
movie theater it's one thing in their
living room nobody wants to wear glasses
to watch 3d glasses free free 3d content
say that ten times fast very interesting
stuff seeing a little bit of development
you know on smaller screens and some
bigger screens interesting to see where
that goes and then of course you know
every year at CES the story that tends
to dominate headlines not from the show
are these guys now i'm showing my
11-inch macbook air because this is not
our new product but i just got one the
corporate laptop took it with me use it
to blog the show i'm in love with it
it's so lightweight that when you're
carrying around your gear bag for four
days straight you're working 14-hour day
is not sleeping enough breathing in
recycled air get a yachtie the last
thing you want to do is come home with a
tweaked back from carrying all your
stuff and you wouldn't think the
difference between a four-pound laptop
at a two-pound laptop or five and three
whatever matters that much unless you
know you're a blogger or even worse
somebody who travels for a living and it
really does the 11-inch air i'm in love
with it even though it's a lower power
processor than the macbook pros the
speed of the sse dry SSD drive makes
this thing fly and with my Elgato stick
for offloading the video encoding tasks
for exporting to youtube and stuff this
thing is to dream come true that being
said though the news out of it from
apple at a CES the verizon press
conference announced you know towards
the end of the show on friday the buzz
all around was what's going on Verizon
Verizon there's a razem press conference
in New York on Tuesday January 11th at
11am so it's 1 1111
I am you know whatever but all bets are
on the verizon iphone being announced at
long long last probably won't be you
know anything new other than just an
iphone that works on cdma on verizon's
web network probably won't even do LTE
it'll probably be cdma only but we're
going to have coverage of the event on
the site TechnoBuffalo and also here on
the YouTube channel you know 11 a.m.
tuesday morning levin a.m. eastern time
and then as soon as the events over i'll
be doing a live cast on the ustream
channel they took a buffalo channel
talking about what went down my thoughts
on to answer your questions you're
saying hi you know you know i hold off
on the name calling for now getting at
least a week to settle in but i'll be
there so anyway there you go little CES
recap also i got to see the tesla model
s in person that is a sexy car on in
love with that car you can check out my
coverage it's actually on the nvidia
blog if you go to blogs at nvidia com
that's not a plug for them although they
were great to work with you know
whatever their products that that's your
you know I'm not gonna saying about them
so I've reviewed the products but they
were great to work with so thank you a
video for that opportunity now I'm
full-time Buffalo but all that content i
did for a video you can check out there
if you're interested otherwise you know
here we go stay tuned I'm psyched to be
here so much common tablets for the big
story obviously lots going on a mobile
3d and connected TV I've got a vizio can
I lift this up have any strength left
after being in the desert I got to use
both hands this isn't even a big TV it's
a little one little bedroom size TV
vizio 22 inch LED TV with the connected
apps can you see here it's got the
Rhapsody in the Netflix and the Facebook
and all that stuff and this is actually
something I picked up over the holidays
haven't had a chance to set up but I'm
going to get to unboxing this and say
get up and reviewing it on techna
Buffalo very interested in connected TV
you know streaming media from netflix
and hulu and all those companies apps
all that stuff what's the deal is it any
good well i've been reading the stuff
that Sean did about cutting the cable
and now I'm going to dive into on video
