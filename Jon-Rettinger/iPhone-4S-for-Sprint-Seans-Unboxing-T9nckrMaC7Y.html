TechnoBuffalo comm with an unboxing of
the iPhone 4s for Sprint this is the 64
gigabyte black version let's just do a
quick tour of the box here got your
picture of iPhone on the front an iCloud
sticker on the bottom just a - on the 4s
and either Apple logo iPhone 4s simple
back on first glance I am not seeing
anything on here that actually says
sprint so I find that rather intriguing
but that's keeping with Apple's
simplistic packaging anyway I'm not John
Rhett injure so I use an actual box and
I have to open things as opposed to the
big knife so let's cut in here and see
what's going on inside
ooh nice plastic ripping sounds alright
let's take a look there it is folks the
iPhone 4s for Sprint we'll just set that
off to the side for the moment and let's
take a look at what else is in the box
let's see we have a little folder with
finger tips
yay and the guide you know books I'll
never read and yes there are two Apple
stickers there was much rejoicing in the
land over here we have well a much
smaller power cube without the folding
prongs I'm so used to the folding prongs
we have a charging cable and we have
earbuds I am not seeing oh there it is
there's the controls and nothing else in
the box so we'll set all this off to
side and let's get to the star of the
show now I know that you all hate it
when John leaves the plastic on so join
me as we there was no ripping sound I'm
so depressed anyway well maybe on the
back now just quiet so here it is folks
the iPhone 4s let's take a quick tour
here we have on the side we have the
mute button we have volume up and volume
down on the top we've got a headphone
jack power switch not a whole lot going
on on this side on the bottom we have
the 30-pin connector and the speakers
and on the back
no Sprint logo interesting and there you
can see my camera and me just your usual
FCC information there's the new 8
megapixel camera so let's go ahead and
power this on I'm not expecting you get
too far while it's powering on let's do
a size comparison bring in the Galaxy
Nexus S do a thickness comparison as
we've been telling you there's
absolutely no difference between the
iPhone 4s and the iPhone 4 so if you
know the size of that iPhone 4 you know
the size of the iPhone 4s it's still
powering on and also bring in a Samsung
Captivate this was one of the original
Galaxy S phones and you definitely are
seeing the difference in the screen size
stand with that same screen size on the
hi foam is definitely starting to show
up okay so we've got power on here and
course I'm not going to get very far in
this because I still have to activate it
and everything else but you get a good
look here at the iPhone 4s it is now
arriving my UPS man just brought this to
me so you should be seeing it at any
moment showing up on your door steps be
sure to leave a comment on TechnoBuffalo
about when you finally get yours and
we'll have more videos throughout the
day until then thanks for joining us see
you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
