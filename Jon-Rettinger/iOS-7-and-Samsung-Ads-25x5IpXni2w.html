to you by jack threats welcome back to
other episode of ask the Buffaloes to
show you could ask me any question you
got from the wide wide world of
technology don't know what smartphone to
get can't make sense of all the opera
systems out there don't know if you
should wait to pick up your new tablet
this is a place you can ask up this week
on ask the Buffalo we're gonna talk
about what phone I'm carrying with me a
little bit of personal stuff but what I
want to be when I grew up we're talking
about Samsung's advertising campaign and
how they are attacking iOS and
blackberry and some tech in between this
is asked to Buffalo let's go and get
started Ethan sidon brooke says hey John
what phone are you currently carrying
with you and what counting all curtain
rumors of things like the m7 s 4 and
iPhone 5s do you want to carry next and
are most excited for thanks well the
phone I'm carrying with me right now
that I'm just starting to test is the
new blackberry z10 I'm really excited to
use this phone to test it to see what
it's like I don't get opportunity to use
a brand new operating system all that
often to learn the nuances to learn the
shortcuts it's a lot of fun for me so
I'm really looking forward to serve
digging into this phone and seeing
everything it can do as far as the next
generation phones that are coming all
the things I'm hearing about the galaxy
s4 sounds super awesome i love wireless
charging an eight-core processor and
whatever it's gonna fart unicorn
rainbows I'm very excited to see you at
the galaxy s4 it can bring so Steve asks
hey John recently Samsung has shared ads
that have a tendency to attack competing
platforms like blackberry and the iphone
what are your thoughts on this type of
marketing some say it's okay while
others say it's unethical where do you
stand in this debate one of the whole
pantheon of things Samsung is done that
advertising I certainly wouldn't say is
unethical whole point of advertising is
to get you to buy a particular product
and not by a competitor's product so
Samsung is certainly just doing that
they've done an incredible job chipping
away piece by piece at sort of the Apple
mystique and sort of the cultish
following that goes along with them
their campaigns are made
waiting on line seem uncool by showing
people's parents waiting there was
absolutely brilliant all the speculation
about the next features coming out you
know they've been knocking that down
i've done an incredible job was
something that happened overnight it
took you know almost a year and a half
since that campaign launched to now and
now they set their sights on blackberry
saying hey you don't want to have to use
a blackberry device IT department all of
our galaxy s stuff is gonna do exactly
the same thing in here the same
standards don't you worry about it i
would say though it's been extremely
effective for samsung they've been
selling phones left and right in the
process have become the world's largest
handset manufacturers so if it ain't
broke don't fix it I think Samsung is
actually doing an incredible job in
advertising front so over the past few
years you had a chance to get to know me
a little bit chris wood wants to know a
little bit more hey John when you were a
kid what did you or even some of the
other TechnoBuffalo staff want to be
when you grew up well for me it was a
few things first I always wanted to be a
sports broadcaster I always wanted to
broadcast the Laker games that was
always my dream I used to record
remember putting in big VHS tapes
recording Laker games and trying to do
the commentary over it before my voice
changed with super high pitched that was
something I always wanted to do after
college long before technobuffalo is
even just a dream I actually lived
behind the Fox Sports building so I made
a tape and I kept bringing it by every
day every day hoping someone take a look
at it eventually receptionist took it by
don't think anybody ever looked at it
that was always my dream was to be a
sports broadcaster but certainly that's
not the most realistic of dreams the
other thing that I always wanted to be
in a sound sort of strange as always
want to go into politics I know this is
probably a little bit idealistic of that
kind of stuff but I think there are a
lot of people out there that are in
politics for the wrong reasons I would
love to get a chance to help and get a
chance to sort of have my generations
voice be heard I don't think there's
that many folks out there they have a
chance to speak and have a platform to
share what they want to do in the world
I'm sort of always kept politics that
text doesn't always work and I'm sort of
right in the middle when it comes to
political affiliation I would always
want to try and do some good in this
world and I thought that was a way to
try and do it Sophie that helps answer
your question twitter user at red shark
TV asks at john for lakers even though
it's point 9 updates away what are you
hoping for and
iOS 7 android widgets perhaps so all
hoping for an iOS 7 is a complete
redesign it's not too much to ask for
right iOS has not changed that much
since the initial version 2072 now and
I've said this over and over again I'm
not gonna go through the same spiel that
I have in the past things need to change
need to be new shortcuts and to be new
ways to view information need to be
quicker ways to access notifications and
the pull down to do more customization
options need to be a little bit of
different screen sizes I know that's not
I OS 7 but something I'm hoping for is
really i'm hoping for something new
something fresh i think apples really
has to bring the heat with Johnny I've
now running the iOS team and I'm think I
think that we might actually get it with
iOS 7 so I take a minute from answering
