to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's up everyone John
render from TechnoBuffalo here we're at
CES 2015 take a look at the Toyota Mirai
by thinking yourself what's up with that
fancy looking Corolla and two I say
there's much more literally under this
hood but you get in a conventional car
so we get started I'd wager you're
probably familiar with battery electric
cars are powered by batteries similar
cells of how are your laptop they're
quiet they make your card go there are a
lot of alternative fuel options out
there including a hydrogen and that's
what Toyota's mariah is being powered by
I think of hydrogen a lot of people
think that it's like gasps it's a fuel
but a hydrogen cars actually an electric
car let me get a little scientific with
you for a minute again a battery car
it's got cells in it and as I get to
play that you plug it in and you charge
again this you put hydrogen into the car
through fueling stations which are being
built all over primarily the west coast
but they're coming to the rest of the
country and hydrogen will be free for
this by the way because Toyota and other
hydrogen manufacturers are being
generous but also because there's no way
to charge for it much like gas there's
fuel in the car which is hydrogen that
Hydrans gonna pass through fuel cells
which are arranged in a stack company
you might have heard and as it goes
through the electrons are stripped out
of the hydrogen leaving the byproduct
only as water and those electrons
obviously electricity and those are
going to go through and power the car
none like attrition electric car you
don't plug this guy in you go to
hydrogen station and you can refuel this
guy is available now you can buy it of
course or lease it for about 500 bucks a
month with thirty six hundred dollars
down it's in a coma three years of free
maintenance 24 hour concierge service
and other kind of niceties it also a lot
of cool car tech and it aside from the
powertrain which is you know super novel
it's got all those radios take your
features you'd expect from a modern car
may stop real fast and tell you about
the LG G flex to sing expect to the
gills highlighted by a 5.5 inch full HD
p oled screen and what better way to
take advantage of
that p oled screen then with images
captured by its 13 megapixel rear camera
one of the big worries people have on
hydrogen is that like people think
you're driving around in a bomb the
tanks that are under here have been
ballistically tested to withstand any
type of impact from direct gunshots
shotgun shots to very easily withstand
any sort of car accident that you could
be in a lot of people forget is
attritional gasoline-powered cars are
powered by explosions so you're always
already explosions going on in every
single car hydrogen is no more dangerous
than carrying around a full tank of
gasoline when I first saw them are I
might not have been blown over by how it
looked one of those things it looks much
better in person I think that it does a
picture so if you get a chance to see
one go to your Toyota dealership try and
look it up online of course watch watch
our videos on judge for yourself one
hear what you guys think about hydrogen
do you think it's a future would you get
if you have the option in the electric
car a hydrogen car or just a regular
gasoline powered car let's hear your
thoughts on it until next time i'm john
wren checkin TechnoBuffalo see you guys
next video bye bye this episode of
technobuffalo is brought to you by the
all new G flex 2 from LG life's good
thank you guys for checking out our CES
