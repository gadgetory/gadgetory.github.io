technobuffalo here today i got my brand
new AT&amp;amp;T iphone 4s in the mail is really
excited to dig in start showing you all
the cool new features that it has seeing
if they're cool least checking out Cirie
checking the camera and doing all the
regular iphone tests that we do and get
a new device in so I took it out of the
box turned it on presented with this
gotta activate the phone you can do it
all over the era that a computer and got
the same results by the way when I did
try plugging in and using iTunes so I
will slide it to unlock there we go to
ask me what language I speak it in
English sometimes not so well go ahead
and select them in the United States
enable location services sure hit next
ask what Wi-Fi network I want to connect
to I want to connect to the
TechnoBuffalo one it's going to pull out
my phone number so make sure that's what
I want to activate it is next step it
asks for your billing information social
security number I'm obviously not going
to show that one on camera alright so
I've got that information in its going
to try and activate and ask me if I want
to confirm and this whole thing is a
waiting game there it is well go ahead
and hit agree and hit agree again and
now we wait we wait we wait we wait I'm
going to speed this up to make things a
bit more exciting citroen up to sit here
and be as bored as i am so going fast
now
and we get this same air I've been
seeing for the past several hours could
not activate iphone your activation is
still pending or receive an email
notification once activation is complete
we're sorry there was a problem
connecting to the server please try
again later so I've been doing this over
and over and over again i called AT&amp;amp;T i
was on the phone with them for 45
minutes and they couldn't do anything
other recommendation was try going to an
apple store so today is the 14th the day
the iphone 4s launched going to an apple
store probably wouldn't be the most
enjoyable experience right now so this
has now been two hours plus going
whether or not i try connecting the
cable to itunes and activating through
itunes still wouldn't work now it's just
a matter of waiting i haven't had any
email comment telling I'd activate the
phone I have now a completely useless
piece of hardware that I cannot activate
have you guys had these same problems as
it exclusive to 18c I've heard things
are going smooth around other carriers
love to hear what you guys have to say
I'm extremely frustrated and obviously
very very very annoyed and maybe I'm not
the only one jon rettinger for technical
Buffalo and I'll see you the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
