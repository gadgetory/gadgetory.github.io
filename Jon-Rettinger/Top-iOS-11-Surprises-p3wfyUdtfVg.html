the wraps off iOS 11 and predictably
they made the spinal tap joke they
trekked it up to 11 but not predictably
I think there's a lot of new features
crammed into iOS Levin it certainly the
flagship ones they mentioned on stage
things like a new dock for the iPad a
files app which certainly makes the iPad
now a little bit more PC like quicktype
keyboard and a ton more as we went
through and installed iOS Levin we
learned there's a lot of stuff in there
that Apple didn't talk about there are
some surprises that we found in iOS 11
and some bugs as well and the caveat
here is the very first data something
you can change and disappear so you
could get better things to get worse
just our experiences with the very first
version of iOS 11 so first and probably
super welcome screen recording they made
it really easy to swipe up to Control
Center there's a little circle tap it
and your screen starts to record it's
going to give you a blue bar up top it
absolutely to do with tethering that's
still going to be there in screen
recording if you want to stop recording
to tap that little blue bar and you can
stop it and your video will show up in
photos nice to have it there I wish that
blue bar wasn't part of it
and Apple users I think I've been
clamoring for dark mode since we finally
got it in Mac OS and you sort of have a
dark mode but not like an official dark
mode in iOS 11 if you go to Settings
General accessibility accessibility
shortcuts and hits smart invert colors
you're going to get kind of a dark mode
and you'll see it in settings but I did
sort of go through to use the phone
you'll notice that it kind of gets a
little warped things it always worked
out well the dock looks all kinds of
messed up but at least in first party
apps did you kind of get a cute version
of the darkroom I don't know why Apple
won't just do it but you're clamoring
for them dark colors at least right now
close you're going to get so instead of
talking to Siri you can now type her I
know it all you you Android fans are
going to stay but if you want to turn
that on go to general
accessibility Siri turn that switch now
you can type this here instead of
talking towards you want to find out
what the weather is like in Hawaii on
Wednesday spoilered it's probably much
nicer than many of us live go ahead and
type it
have it after Apple friends a long time
talking about control center but they
didn't talk about what's back you can
actually customize a ton of option so if
you go to settings and control center
you can turn all those things on
actually can scroll through your control
center now there's some obvious things
they talked about you can force touch on
the platter to get more options but if
you want all of the settings of control
center you can out do that al it's kind
of gangly and ugly and scrolling but
house if you want it apples giving you a
little bit of nitrous customize you take
me you can get Apple specs a lot of time
talking about the quicktype keyboard you
can sort of swipe up to get numbers they
didn't talk about was there's a lot of
one handy keyboard action that's
happening so if you don't have multiple
languages on your keyboard just long
press on the emoji and you'll see
options on the left or right you can
pick the keyboard with not you want to
go to either side whether your left or
right hand if you have multiple
languages to the globe you can select
those options if you type of one hands
while you're walking there make things a
little bit easier if you're stuck with a
smaller storage size iPhone is running
out of space Apple now look you offload
unused apps and they're using this
machine learning determine what apps you
don't use the most so go into settings
go into storage and go ahead and flip
that switch then you can actually save a
ton of space if you've got unused apps
but also the side note any 32-bit apps
we no longer work on iOS 11 and if you
want to redownload the apps that Apple
got rid of for you when you read
download them all your settings are
going to be there nothing's going to
change just read up some space so QR
scanner you can al do from the camera
app which is really welcome you don't
have to open a third-party app to scan a
QR code you just put the camera in front
of a QR code automatically do it saying
add your friends and snapchat find out
what things cause the grocery store
whatever QR code thing you want if you
don't do it correctly from the default
camera this last one is kind of fun you
can take live photos during a FaceTime
call an hour test it had to be an iOS 11
device based having with another iOS 7
device maybe that will change as release
nears but when you're faced having
somebody who's on iOS 11 will be a
little circle icon in the bottom left
hand corner is cat that you'll take a
live photo so you can I mean I'm not
even gonna
not even getting guess it you're going
to use that for you know what you're
going to use it up for take life loads
your kids it's a time when you're on
vacation dirty mind
and if you ever snickered wanting to
know how many balls of service you have
the balls are gone Apple got rid of the
balls bars you're back there's a ton
more stuff in iOS love and I've kind of
fun to go through and play and see new
stuff start to appear in the betas but
if you saw something in your version of
iOS love and perhaps your developer and
tried it leave my comments down below
and let us know if you want to stuff
like this video we will do that if you
like these sort of beta videos the video
a thumbs up to let us know we always
like playing with new stuff till next
time I'm John Wright enjoy some second
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
