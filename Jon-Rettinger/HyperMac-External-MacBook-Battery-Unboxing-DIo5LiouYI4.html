here and I've got a very cool unboxing
for you this is the hyper Mac external
battery for your MacBook MacBook Pro or
MacBook Air that's right external
battery not many of these are around so
I'm really excited to give this a whirl
and see how well it works what we have
right here you'll see in a minute is the
150 watt milliamp hour external battery
it'll run you 399 s just about 400 bucks
and here are some stats on if you're
using a MacBook Air with a full MacBook
Air charge and a full hyper map you'll
get 22 hours if you're using a unibody
MacBook you're gonna get 21 hours if
you're using a MacBook Pro you're gonna
get 20 hours and really you're gonna get
any 20s to high 20 with your MacBook or
MacBook Pro or MacBook Air really is
unbelievable I haven't seen one of these
yet in person I have no idea how big it
is but let's go ahead and take a look at
it so go ahead and open this up I just
cut the tape alright I like to thank the
hyper Mac folks for sending this over so
we just got your standard EPS pad pack
looks like it sealed up we will dig in
obligatory big knife I'm gonna see what
this is you know I can't tell you
there's been ton of times when I've
either been on on a train or on an
airplane on my Mac but just runs out of
battery so having an external pack you
know soothing is portable enough really
would have been fantastic especially one
that will get me in xx of hours looks
like there's another UPS pack inside
here and I think what I have here is not
the final retail packaging so if you
decide to order one and I'll put a link
in the sidebar
to get some more information and some
ordering information as well you will
get another another box let's go ahead
and cut the tape on this one
there we go it looks like we are finally
at the product are almost at the product
ok so here we are now the UPS business
aside move the knife and here is the
hyper Mack 150 watt our external battery
pack now I'm not sure how they got
licensed to use the MagSafe adapter but
the fact that they did is very cool so
let's see what we have in here I think
we have some sort of instructions look
at that eh well that's kind of neat a
car or airplane charger for it that's
quite handy so you can charge on your
way during the plane or whether you're
in a car there's the MagSafe or the
standard MacBook or MacBook Pro and that
must be the port that plugs into the
external pack so that's good to have I
think it's got a charging power brick
not that big but it is decent-sized it
takes about the same size as a netbook
power brick power cable let's see how
big the actual devices so what dinner
then I thought it was gonna be but it's
definitely little bit on the long side
so let me go ahead and this down so you
can see it and we'll do some size
comparisons the first let's take a look
at it so 150 watt hour hyper Mac it is
made out of aluminium if you sort of the
same grade as what you'd find on your
MacBook or MacBook Pro on the side here
there's your charge board looks like
there's a power button right there and
I'll tell you how much charge you have
left if this cool it's got a USB port on
it so you can charge something else via
USB so your iPhone or whatever it is you
have you can charge low as suppose you
can use a USB port on your computer as
well there's your DC out nothing there
nothing on the back and nothing on
the side let's take a look here for size
comparison and see how it stacks up next
to an iPhone 3G asks you guys can get a
sense of how big it really is so almost
the same there and thickness wise you
can see if there's a little bit thick
but nothing drastic and it is definitely
long but the fact that it is so thin
doesn't mean you could probably just
throw it in a backpack and you'd be good
to go it doesn't weigh all that much but
definitely has a nice feel to it so
let's see how all this power business
works so we got a plug here power brick
looks like it simply just plugs in
charge cord goes right in there where
does the MagSafe go is a very good
question that must be where that DC out
goes the TV power to come out of it
and just need to actually see a MagSafe
on something other than the MacBook
power adapter so that goes right in
there and this would plug right into
your computer so if you were traveling
and this was fully charged up all you
would need to bring is really just this
definitely something to keep in mind I'm
really looking forward to using this and
doing some serious benchmarking and
battery result test so that's like stick
around to the channel for that see if we
really do get the 20 something hours
that are advertised anyway I hope you
enjoyed for exclusive content we should
have followed me on Twitter twitter.com
slash drawn 4-leggers and if you're
interested in more information on the
hyper Mac again I'll put a link up in
the sidebar see you guys in the next
video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
