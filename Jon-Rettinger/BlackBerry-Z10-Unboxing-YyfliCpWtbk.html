from TechnoBuffalo you might not
recognize my name but I am the head of
mobile for the company and I usually am
on the home page writing stories but
let's just dive right into what we're
doing today this is BlackBerry 10 big
news I just got back from the press
events and I have the z10 unit I
honestly I haven't opened this yet so
here you go black box inside of that I
think it's unlocked because I don't see
any carrier branding and didn't come
with a sim so here's the device itself
really sleek and smooth exactly what
we've seen in the leaks if you've got
the volume buttons on the right nice
silver accent 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack up top with the power button looks
like a microphone on the left hand side
you have wow it's already sort of the
back covers popping off if you see that
I just took it out of the box in the
case microUSB charging and HDMI out
nothing on the bottom that's an 8
megapixel on the back and I'll get this
booted up but in the meantime you've got
a 4.2 inch display on the front here
that's a 1280 by 768 resolution 356 PPI
under the hood that's a 2 megapixel
camera right there - under the hood you
are rocking a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor let's actually lift up the
hood here it's plastic okay so it's not
you know what you're gonna get from an
iPhone the glass back but here you can
see the connectors there for NFC a spot
for a SIM card spot for microSD it has
16 gigs of storage onboard you can add
additional 32 I believe with the q10 you
can actually pack up to 64 batteries not
yet inserted so I assume it's in the box
so let's quickly put this aside and go
through the Box got this velvet look
here and I'm guessing this is a what the
unlock devices will come with but I
don't think carriers will I don't know
what we have here stickers you know
these are business cards I guess for the
PR EPS if we need them blackberry
smartphones safety guide you know the
Yatta Yatta Yatta start here okay well
you know we all know how to use phones
right what's this it looks like it comes
with a case okay so typical BlackBerry
fashion I was gonna say rim but they
changed your name today it's a
BlackBerry officially
so that makes sense that skeletal
sticker on it take that off and it's got
a nice little carbon-fiber ish design
but it's it's plastic or you know
pleather what else does it come with
charging cable a screen wipe the wall
wart some headphones yeah these are
those like cheapo plastic ones that you
can pick up for two bucks at Walgreens
and then of course the charger or the
battery rather what do we have for
milliamp hours and 1800 milliamp hour
battery okay they're promising up to ten
hours of battery life over 3G the phone
does support LTE and HSPA+ I don't know
what model we have yet like I said I'm
just opening this for this for the first
time here with you guys so let me put
this cover back on I'm gonna pop my sim
in real quick so you can actually get an
experience and see what's going on and
I'll show you the whole boot up sequence
alright I'm back it's booting there's a
little red light that came on the
typical indication light that we've seen
before
now I popped it an 18 t sim card that I
usually use with an LTE device so you
know we might get HSPA+ I'm not sure bit
of a slow boot it looks like you can
kind of sleep that there's a an
indicator bar moving along I'm guessing
and hoping that this is just a one-time
thing because again the first time I've
ever powered on the device okay we're
back it looks like it is 18 T alright B
device Blackberry English welcome to
blackberry now we swipe down according
to the swipe left to continue gonna
connect us to AT&amp;amp;T um yeah let's skip
that we're gonna skip the actual Wi-Fi
network part right now swipe left okay
that was right I guess English United
States
I don't know what it's doing right now
okay an agreement you know I don't have
a blackberry ID right now so give me two
seconds I'll create one and then we'll
get back to the video okay
I signed in with my ID now we're just
going through a software update I have I
have the latest version I guess okay
great essential gestures what are we
gonna learn here tutorial on how to
navigate swipe left while in an app
touch the edge of the glass and slide
your finger down to see more options
there you go we have an option to start
an emergency call to leave this set up
at touch the bottom and slide your
finger up yeah hey we're finally out of
the tutorial set up email and BlackBerry
hub that's over here I'll do that real
quick actually you know what I don't
have a fake email address let me try to
sign in and we'll try to let's see well
skip ok so you get your alerts in the
hub ok so you get you can see your
emails and this is anytime notifications
and this comes from bbm as well as I'm
not sure what that says or why as well
as Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Foursquare
calls everything is always over there
you just you swipe and you're there so
that little slide up there leaves us you
know takes us right back to the home
screen here we have apps what can we see
here BlackBerry World that's where all
of the does a weird animation all the
movies music and apps are Angry Birds is
there LinkedIn is there top albums Bruno
Mars is up in there top movies you've
got Ted that's a good one and then some
TV episodes and of course you can search
so again swipe up and you're out and
swipe right and you're over here it's
your apps again let's see if you guys
know me on Twitter I'll quickly sign in
and we'll show you that app one sec and
we're back here's Twitter pretty basic
at connect
discover me everything that you usually
see on an Android or an iOS application
again swipe up and you're out swipe left
and you're automatically getting in
there you can see I was already showed
my Twitter notifications for privacy
reasons let's just try to leave that off
the screen for now in any case so say
we're in Twitter though if I swipe left
we get nothing swipe up and we exit
swipe down and you get the additional
menu so you get settings and that's it
okay
so we're out now we can go to blackberry
world swipe left we get to Notification
Center I wonder why or it's called
blackberry hub I wonder why they didn't
show up during Twitter swipe down we've
got the other options there so that's
sort of like hitting the menu button on
Android you've got zero download scan
barcode for finding in an app and you're
out again so let's check out the browser
real quick again we're doing this
together here so I hope that I'm
covering as much as I can looks like you
got your bookmarks right there here's
the keyboard for the first time
TechnoBuffalo comm first time I didn't
want to load exactly okay so here we go
we're on TechnoBuffalo the page is
really quick and snappy let's quick an
article real fast again I'm not even on
Wi-Fi right now what was that
it seemed to have gone black a little
bit so I guess we can't kind of go back
and get that menu but it looks like
it'll play videos right inside the
browser swipe down we just see the top
bar there and swipe out and it's always
sort of live so if we come back it's
always live according to them Media
error it's loading very slowly sweet so
we'll go back again to the home page we
can see that looks like this is ported
nope our top bar is bar is not supported
but again it looks like it was loading
articles pretty quickly before
everything is always in action see if
they have any preloaded videos for us
none I'm guessing the same goes for
music nothing there okay so you can
always buy videos and music now let's
show it I want to show you a camera
really quick because that's one of the
cool thing
that RIM did here or blackberry now as I
should say taking pictures is really
quick now if we want we could change the
mode
we're on normal right now we can go to
burst and I presume it took a bunch of
pictures and I want back to normal now
here's the one where rims been talking
about you can go back in time so say you
take a picture you hear that there's a
couple clicks and go back in time and
see the actual progression of the film
so let's do this again where we have
some movement and for example this would
be great if somebody doesn't smile in
your picture whoa okay so that's a good
one see my finger got in the way but if
we jump back in time it's not in the way
anymore and there it comes in so we
would want to save this image instead we
would just hit the check box there now
we can exit again by doing that and
again here we go back to our
notifications in our hub at all times
now from the lock screen you can see
notifications here it looks like I have
an alarm you can slowly pull up on the
screen and it kind of just reveals the
contacts that rather all the
applications so here well as with most
phones you might have to hit the power
button first just to get here with the
power button off you can actually unlock
the device just by swiping up so that's
pretty neat and before I forget let me
show you text messages and I don't know
why it's in another language right now
but we'll hit compose I want to show you
the keyboard so I could start with hey
now you can see words start to complete
hey what's it already knows that so I
just toss it up you see that and I could
toss up up and then I could toss up man
hey what's up man or I could what's up
man add a little smiley face or a little
crying guy what else we have in here a
little airplane so pretty cool you know
it's a great keyboard so far I've just
played with it for 10 seconds on camera
with you guys I'll use it more
this will be shipped out to John he's
gonna do a full review so thanks
everybody for checking this out real
quick with me again this is a blackberry
z10 from rim or blackberry now and my
name is Todd Hazleton with TechnoBuffalo
