TechnoBuffalo here when the iPhone 4 was
announced it was met with the collective
sigh from the geek community
it wasn't what many of us were expecting
but much like Beauty all the changes are
definitely more than skin-deep we've got
a dual-core process here we've got a
better camera we've got some software
enhancements in the virtual voice of
Siri but is that gonna be worth while
operating from an iPhone 4 let's put
these two head-to-head and see if the S
+ 4 S stands for speed or suck
alright so let's make sure we're doing
in apples to apples comparison let's
make sure that all the applications are
closed I know it doesn't affect how
Apple Apple's the iOS uses memory or not
but just for the sake of commenters to
keep things simple everything here has
been closed we've got an iPhone 4s and
an iPhone 4 both are connected to the
same Wi-Fi network this guy's got 3G
coursing through his veins and my SIM
cards in there and this one my old
iPhone 4 does not alright so let's try
some first party applications if my bat
fingers can let me hit them at the same
time let's go ahead and try something
like weather which is so much harder to
do than you'd expect here at the same
time so learn a little bit faster here
on the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 4 let's
try Calendar same thing a little bit
faster nothing major let's try some
third-party applications how about
Twitter if ik fast you're on the iPhone
4s then the iPhone 4 I'm actually gonna
stop there on third-party tests
applications that are existing right now
were coded and developed for iPhone 4 or
earlier hard we're not taking advantage
of the additional speed that the iPhone
4s offers so presumably we'll see a
difference a few months from now as
developers are able to take full
advantage of the extra horsepower in the
iPhone 4s something to keep in mind
so web browsing is extremely important
to me it's one of my best features of a
phone and iOS has arguably one of the
best web browsers out there let's go
ahead and see if the s and gives it any
extra speed unfortunately the s doesn't
stand for Adobe Flash there's an S in
there somewhere I decided to throw that
little jab and there would jump into
settings well go ahead and clear history
clear your cookies
I do love cookies I also love punching
pie let's go ahead and open up Safari it
should open up my bookmarks let's go
ahead and try my favorite tech side on
the planet TechnoBuffalo I'll get that
cute up there get that cute up there and
we'll let them load again same Wi-Fi
network a little bit faster on the
iPhone 4s I was definitely a bigger
improvement than we saw an application
load time let's try a few other websites
let's try YouTube it should load the
mobile version of the TechnoBuffalo
youtube channel a little bit faster on
the iPhone 4s versus the iPhone 4 let's
try the Godfather of tech sites let's
try and gadget see if there's any sort
of difference there same thing a little
bit faster on the 4s versus before what
about sites we've already looked at so
we already saw a TechnoBuffalo so it's
stored in cache or there's caching
involved see there's any difference here
so load it again faster on the iPhone 4
and I gotta tell you in all candor this
is probably be like 14th time I've
filmed this video I kept nothing I
wouldn't hit buttons at the same time it
was just a disaster these are the same
results that I saw each time that I
tested the iPhone 4 was faster than the
iPhone 4s was faster than the iPhone 4
I'm glad I caught that before I uploaded
this video otherwise it would have been
just a billion comments all right so
we'll go ahead and hit home here and
we'll hit home out of there so I have
the AT&amp;amp;T version of the iPhone 4s which
is supposedly capable of running on
there well what they're calling a 4G
network that is HSPA+ it's capable of
14.4 maximum megabits per second down as
opposed to the seven or so that the
iPhone 4 can get well I'm in Southern
California and I am blanketed by HSPA+
so I was really curious what the speed
cast was gonna be using this B test net
occasion so again this is gonna be
totally subjective depending on what
location you are or where you are what
network traffic is at the time this is
only accurate for me right now at this
exact minute at about 4:30 p.m. on the
14th of October but I'm just kind of
curious that you guys might be as well
but unfortunately this guy doesn't have
any 3G radio so we're going to bring in
a guest iPhone 4 that does have a SIM
card and is running on of course 3G so
Wi-Fi has been turned off here I'm gonna
go ahead and turn Wi-Fi off on this guy
so we're getting at accurate tests to
Wi-Fi and lick it off all right so let's
open up the speed test application in
there open up the speed test application
here it's gonna find and close the
server hopefully they'll find the same
server begin tests and begin test so
they are both pink San Diego server will
try the LA server afterwards and see if
they get any sort of difference so
theoretically this is capable of a
maximum with the camera there a maximum
double the data speeds so the iPhone 4s
is pulling in just about 3 megabits per
second 2.7 something 2.75 and the iPhone
4 pulled in 1.3 so pretty close
definitely an increase in speed are
pretty close to that double average
that's there are double potential rather
that the iPhone 4s can do versus the
iPhone 4 and we got 1.11 on the up as
opposed to the point 6-1 on the iPhone 4
and again iPhone 4 iPhone 4s 1.3 down
2.7 5 down so definitely a big
difference let's try changing servers
and see if there's any sort of
difference there as well make sure we're
getting some sort of weird anomaly so
we'll change servers let's go ahead and
jump to Los Angeles there we go speed
test speed test and let's restart the
tests here on both of these and again
totally subjective this is mostly just
for my curiosity so I was dying to know
there's going to be any sort of speed
increase so we're looking at about 1
point seven five ish on the iPhone 4s on
the right-hand side and about point
eight one or so on the iPhone 4 so now
we're seeing double more than double the
speeds on the iPhone 4s but it looks to
be a bit slower on the upload no they're
almost the same this is gonna be a
neck-and-neck race to see who gets
faster on the upload speed 0.5 and point
4 2 so the iPhone 4s was indeed faster
so the S at least in my case did stand
for speed
so is this worth while upgrading people
ask me that all the time I say if you
have a four there's probably not a giant
compelling reason to up create it Siri
is neat but it's in beta and in my
opinion is still a bit of a novelty if
you are a camera junkie and you really
need to have 1080p well that's gonna be
a reason for you to want to upgrade or
you want better cameras then it's got
that extra lens in there so we'll take
much better pictures 8 megapixel versus
a 5 but nothing giant overall if one of
those reasons is enough for you then the
4s is gonna be a worthwhile upgrade if
you just like to use a phone for a phone
and you want to have the latest and
greatest might not be worth signing your
name to a two-year contract now we're
gonna see some again some the biggest
improvements once developers can start
getting their coding on for the iPhone
4s on take advantage of the improved
software and hardware that lives beneath
the hood I guess the software is kind of
the same of both so if you've got an
iPhone 3GS probably worth the upgrade to
the iPhone 4 or an iPhone 3G and
regional iPhone you know definitely make
the jump to the 4s if you're on the
iPhone 4 you gonna want to think about
it to make sure it's right for you so
leave your comments down below do you
think the S stands for speed or suck I'm
very very curious we'll judge by thumbs
up on each to see what you guys think
I'm very curious for all your tech news
be sure to check out TechnoBuffalo com
I'm John Rhett endure and I'll see you
the next video
