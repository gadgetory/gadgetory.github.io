to you by carbonite welcome back to
another episode of a rumor roundup this
to show we round up all the tech rumors
from the week and condense them trash
compactor style into one video that you
can watch know everything that you
missed so of this week on rumor roundup
we got rumors of a Samsung made galaxy
note 7 iphone 5s rear panels of starting
to surface and a secretive firm is
preparing a return to the moon and HTC
is supposedly working on a new flagship
call to the m7 kind of cool let's go
ahead round them up so you know that
brand new droid DNA that HTC One X plus
he just got you marveling at its hotness
ends newness well it is already almost
at a date supposedly HTC is working on a
new flagship phone called the m7 the new
flash of device that will outdo anything
in everything currently available so all
the awesomeness is coming into one
little phone companies currently
wrapping up semiconductor and casing
gills with plans to manufacture for 25
million handsets so if we that'll means
it'll come across in multiple carriers
we don't know much else about it but I'm
hoping that whatever big it is whatever
its specs it's got and it's rocking that
same awesome 1080p screen the droid DNA
and I think this is a sticker on the
phones they look like the screen is on
so fingers crossed for that speaking of
your new phone maybe not being so hot
anymore you know that iphone 5 yup
iPhone 5s is coming not so surprising
iphone 5s rear panels are allegedly
starting to surface we saw the original
pictures from iphone 5 parts net not a
surprise that the iPhone 5s is coming
Apple's always put an s really after
their phones going from the 3gs the
forest I now will possibly got the 5s I
don't think we're gonna see this phone
though until the second part of next
year so don't be too disappointed don't
worry about picking up an iphone 5 and
I'm hoping they'll be a trick or two me
be like iOS 7 maybe NFC but something
new will definitely be in the phone but
it will look exactly the same
you're wondering what generation phone
to skip skip the 5s get the five now
pick up the six in a year or so so
Samsung's current galaxy note 2
smartphone has a 5.5 inch screen its
Galaxy Note 10.1 as it could probably
guess the 10.1 inch screen and there's
room in between looks like Samsung's
trying to fill that gap the South
korea-based company has already
introduced several tablets and 7 inch
range but it doesn't get have one that's
got the note name meaning it doesn't
work with the S Pen has got cool wake up
support for sketching and taking notes
and just looking like an old-school
stylist but if you believe benchmarks a
new one has come from Nina mark
suggesting that a new model dubbed GT
n5100 is already in testing the GTN part
of the model name has been previously
used in other note bredda devices giving
credence to the rumor the Galaxy Note
10.1 for example it uses the GTN 8013
model number new benchmark suggests the
tablet will sport a pretty nice but not
awesome 1280 by 720 pixel display a 1.6
two guards quad core processor that's
awesome android 4.1 jelly bean not too
and in our mail 400 GPU our mail kind of
sounds like a chain mail so do you like
spy stories do you like espionage and
conspiracies well it looks like a
secretive firm is planning a return to
the moon actually by the time you watch
this video will already know what
happens supposedly soon the Golden Spike
company a mysterious private firm
supposedly backed by playboy
billionaires and of course they got to
be Playboy milliliters because regular
billionaires just boring our plotting a
return to the moon by 2020 the highly
secretive firm a motley crew of
high-profile individuals from aerospace
industry will supposedly enlist existing
or soon to be existing a US lunch
vehicles spacecraft upper stages
technologies to achieve a lunar landing
and maybe we could finally put all those
man didn't go to the moon rumors to rest
when I go up there and they've got a
cool Cameron they see the flag and Neil
Armstrong footprints or they don't and
then we know they were true they never
went so launch details we found on I 09
are supposedly as follows launch us
vehicles into low-earth orbit or elio
that are capable of collectively
assembling stage a lunar
and ER and transport to commercial
astronauts the surface of the Moon
Golden Spikes reported plan is actually
derived from an earlier proposal by a
private company of the same name also
backed by respected scientific and
aeronautical entities fittingly though
the enigmatic firm had also reserved a
launch at spacex falcon heavy for a tidy
120 million dollars the rumor
announcement where all the details be
laid out is being pegged as a
game-changer for the future of
commercial human space travel to the
moon so which one would you rather be on
a trip to Mars with thousands of people
or a short jaunt to the moon I would
like to be on the moon they give you
super cool to be on the moon and just
look around and be like yo so I'm on the
moon and then jump super high I'll make
a crater let me take a break from
