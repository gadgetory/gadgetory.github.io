Apple is making a play for the world's
wallet CBC's Jon Fortt has the story hey
John Hey most Apple is positioning
itself to jump into the mobile payments
arena in a big way the company is
investing a technology called near field
communication or NFC which would allow a
hovering phone to replace a credit card
swipe now mobile commerce of all kinds
is all the rage and there's lots of
evidence that Apple is very interested
in this area researcher richard doherty
says his sources confirm apple buying
NFC related equipment this summer Apple
hide an NFC expert is a product manager
for mobile commerce and the company has
logged several recent patents around
letting consumers use their phones to
pull payments from their bank or iTunes
account the Apple wouldn't be the first
to the NFC party nokia and samsung have
released several NFC capable phones and
at google's nexus s android phone
manufactured by samsung supports this
too but Apple is poised to drive
adoption of the technology and benefit
from it like few of its peers now the
reason why is because Apple is itself a
major retailer in its last fiscal year
Apple's retail operation turned in nine
point eight billion dollars in net sales
up forty-seven percent on top of that
iTunes Store and accessories sales for
nearly five billion dollars if Apple
implements its own payment system it can
not only save money by cutting out
credit card companies on some
transactions but also drive sales and
emerging markets where credit cards
aren't comment now when will we know
more Apple's Worldwide Developer
Conference this summer is a likely time
that's when it will have software
developers attention and when it's
expected to unveil the iphone 5 back to
you alright John fourth thanks so much
for that report will Apple stock is down
nearly two percent along with the Nasdaq
index so how will this move into ibanks
affect the company and will they face
any competition joining us now is jon
rettinger editor and chief of
TechnoBuffalo John thanks so much for
joining us how is this different or
better than what already exists so it is
a very different technology NFC as John
mentioned has been around for quite a
while but where Apple has the edge is in
their market penetration I phones are
everywhere not to mention iTunes is
access to 160 million credit card
already in the system Apple is in the
really unique position to
actually subsidize the manufacturers
equipment the vendors equipment that's
going to be necessary to implement this
new NFC rage which supposedly will be in
the iphone 5 what do you think if you
had to bet how likely is it that this is
going to happen and is going to dominate
you know I'm not one to bet against
Apple the iphone revolutionized how we
browse the internet the app smartphones
in general really killed the personal
organisers people use them as their
cameras I would say it's almost a sure
thing that the smartphone's going to
change the way we use our wallets in the
very near future well I mean one of the
things you say is that Apple likes to
find something that's difficult simplify
the hell out of it and then make a lot
of money doing that sounds like a great
plan it can they apply that to this
because this is a little bit outside
their core competency they absolutely
can so to sort of simplify what Apple is
looking to do is to turn every
smartphone essentially into a debit card
so when you go to your grocery store
instead of swiping your credit card
you'll wave your iPhone just a few
inches from a panel and a transaction is
issued what Apple can do and where they
have the edge over other manufacturers
again isn't that market penetration
people are going to buy iphones
regardless the problem and other
manufacturers have had implementing NFC
technologies is getting that in the
hands of the vendors the people that are
actually selling the goods Apple has
long head of history especially with the
iphone of subsidizing devices so I
wouldn't put the past Apple to use their
vast cash reserves and actually give
this equipment free of charge to the
manufacturers to really help achieve the
market penetration yeah a new NFC system
it sounds like a terrifying tool in the
hand of a tween what's to stop you know
other companies from doing the exact
same thing after they go out and
simplify the hell out of it make a lot
of money will everybody else fall on
their heels you know as Apple tends to
go so go the rest of the tech industry
right make apple clearly redefined the
mobile market space with the iphone they
define the tablet market space as well
with the ipad so when companies are
competing certainly the consumers win I
wouldn't put it past someone like Google
to get into this arena as well as John
mentioned NFC technology is already
implemented in Google's Nexus S foam
ones all right John thanks so much for
joining else we appreciate me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
