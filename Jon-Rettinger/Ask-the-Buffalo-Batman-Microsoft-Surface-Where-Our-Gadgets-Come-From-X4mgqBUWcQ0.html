to you by carbonite welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalos to
show you could ask me jon rettinger any
question you've got from the wide wide
world of technology don't know what
phone to get dunno what tablet to get of
a question about our TechnoBuffalo runs
if it a question about me personally you
go ahead and ask it every tuesday on
technobuffalo com will put up an article
asking for questions you get to leave
them down in the comments otherwise send
it to us on Twitter send it to either me
at john for lakers or at TechnoBuffalo
ask the question use hashtag ask the
beep up this week we're to talk about
where we get all our products from talk
about maybe some cheap tablets coming in
in your future some phones and all kinds
information in between is asked the
Buffalo it's gonna get shirt it's about
every six months or so I will answer
this question I want to know about where
our gadgets come from this one comes
from Twitter and user / alien 12 hey
John had his TV get their devices is a
company out to pay for them or the
companies send them like a trade-off for
free advertising first and foremost
never trade off for free advertising
that is not only illegal it's unethical
and not awesome so know that
misconception that sites do that is
absolutely ludicrous respectable sites
absolutely not most of the vices we get
as review units and we always disclose
when they were sent to us about a
company if you watch our videos i'll say
this phone was sent to us courtesy of
AT&amp;amp;T some phones will actually go out
and buy if we can you get them or if you
feel like maybe I review might be
compromised by getting them if you ever
feel and you ever want to get detect
reviewing you feel like you're compelled
to give a good review because someone
sent your device stop it stop it
immediately you were in the wrong
industry you can't be afraid to give an
honest opinion otherwise you never going
to get credibility in this industry so
if that helps answer your question so
next question comes from Jesse Gabriel
who asks can you do ask the Buffalo for
the entire time with a Batman voice no
no I can't do that I can do you one
better
alright so our next question comes from
at d1 who gains act john for lakers what
will see us cover CS is gonna cover
gotham it's gonna cover the extent of
consumer electronics its dance for
consumer electronics show that's been at
stands for senate covered tvs cellphones
laptops accessories everything in
between lots of touch screens lots of
three technology and everything that
goes along with that dead now i've got a
sore throat I don't know how Christian
Bale did that for three movies what are
you doing get out of frame since keen
amateur hour what are you doing man
alright so the microsoft surface is just
a few months old but already there's
talk or at least hope that maybe we'll
see a lower-priced version of presumably
the RT version so this question comes
from one of our most prolific commenters
love them are a temp it's fat man XXL
who asks John any chance of a budget
surface tablet in the ballpark of 250 to
350 ish I would say no until we see an
update to the current RT version you
know Apple does with their tablets when
a new version comes out this count the
outgoing model so probably six to eight
months when we see a new spect RT
version probably will see a price
reduction on the existing RT models
Microsoft and a double you'll have stock
to burn so we should see a lower price
we've been waiting for that Windows 8
tablet I really want to pick up a
surface then maybe you want to wait
probably about six more months so we

questions all right so let's go from
Microsoft over to blackberry user at
Domingo nose says at john for lakers do
you think bb10 will get enough dev
support to compete with the least
Windows Phone 8 I hope so the answer is
still yet to be written Microsoft paid
developers a ton of money bribed them
with cash your free phones to start
coding for him I certainly rim does not
have the deep deep deep pockets that
Microsoft does but I'm hopeful that
developers will come back to blackberry
it'll be excited to develop for a new
platform blackberry 10 based on QX looks
pretty awesome and I am fingers crossed
hoping hot developers will flock to it
but only times going to town of course
