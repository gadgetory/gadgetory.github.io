in a doctor evil chair I couldn't do a
dr. evil intro what's going on everybody
I am John fret injure from TechnoBuffalo
and this is the Microsoft Surface book
and off camera is another Microsoft
Surface book specifically both are the
$2,100 I 7 model 256 gigabytes of
storage 8 gigs of RAM and the dedicated
GPU built right in
we've been doing a lot of our testing
for our products in the real world you
don't want to do it in a vacuum CES just
ended so we figured what better way to
test the prowess that supposed service
book has and by using it in probably the
most strenuous situations in our
industry the reason we got - I took one
to use I use a computer for emailing
running the business for
videoconferencing and chatting where I'm
free - got one for the opposite reasons
for video editing to be a video
powerhouse as its positioned to be so we
tag-teamed this review we figured most
people are going to fall somewhere in
between either me or Ron so maybe you're
a John or Ron or a Rachel or Monica but
somewhere in between them we figure is
where you're going to be so let's talk
about the design of the surface books
Microsoft did a lot of things right here
first it looks awesome I felt there's a
weird thing to say but I felt kind of
kind of cool walk around with this thing
I want many people had it at CSI only
one other them there but it looks really
nice and Microsoft did a lot of things
well here build quality certainly being
among among them when you go and open
this thing up there's a lot of little
things though that don't make much sense
like no grip on the bottom they try and
open it up things slides all over the
place but once you do get it open you
are greeted with probably the best
keyboard I have ever typed on at all
including anything in the app a lion or
any other PC the keyboard here is
incredible also incredible is this
trackpad it's arguably the best trackpad
that I've used certainly on par though
with the new force touch trackpad found
on the latest gen and MacBook Pros and
MacBooks the hinge is another store in
the service book it's probably one of
these stores Microsoft is positioning it
as so first the normal laptop open and
closed like normal but you can go ahead
and push aleejack button and take the
whole
screen off and treat it like a tablet
you're not getting a dedicated GPU which
is in the keyboard base but does have
its own battery and use integrated
graphic and it worked really well I did
a video on top 5 things to expect from
Faraday future I use it as a prompter
I'm meeting with advertisers I was able
to take the screen off turn it around
and use it as a presentation mode for
what we were planning for 2016 and
beyond it was really handy to have of
course no big Windows 10 is a
touchscreen and bigging this futuristic
hinge I expect something better than
this
look at that it's floppy that my friends
is a flaccid hinge and a flaccid hinge
is no fun something you are constant
trying to touch whether using your
finger or the included service pen which
I've used quite a bit on my surface pro
4 at home which is my dedicated computer
at home I didn't find myself using this
really at all from ICS experience but if
you do want to use it it's got some cool
shortcuts to access one notes experience
and doesn't work well and it will stick
magnetically right to the side like that
no more like hmmm there are a few
windows quirks I found in knowing while
I was at CES using the mail app for
example I couldn't just drag an
attachment into it I was trying to send
an email somebody's already emailed me
before their email address would
automatically populate in a message just
little small annoyances so that's just
my side of the surface book coin there's
a whole other perspective on it so romp
reader out to you in the field so right
off the bat I was disappointed now this
is why I was disappointed not because
the surface book is not a great computer
or it can't get the job done the truth
is is that it was advertised as the
ultimate editing machine we saw this on
sites like no film school not throw them
under the bus Microsoft's press
conference itself they were showcasing
Adobe Premiere and saying how good it
would be with premiere and it really
wasn't I was using this at CES the whole
time as John mention and I was just
really disappointed with the overall
performance now the export times really
weren't that bad what really threw me
off was just like working with in
Premiere so like scrubbing over
unrendered video when getting forest
playback or even hackers playback or
getting playback over multiple layers it
just really wasn't as smooth as I
thought it was going to be it was like
stuttering all over the
place and under heavy processing whether
it be using a warp stabilizer or
rendering the whole file out the mouse
the cursor would just freak out so it
could be a software issue but honestly
just the experience as a whole wasn't
that smooth given the advertising and
all the hype behind it on the bright
side though screen looked incredible it
was just really sharp and really
enjoyable to edit on and also from just
consuming videos and content and sending
emails and stuff text looks super super
sharp and I know John enjoyed it as I
did as well so something I was really
pumped about was just the idea of
getting to just go to tablet mode and
just be editing on the go with just a
screen or exporting while I'm walking or
something like that those were instantly
put to rest because the screen battery
alone is not good at all for regular
tasks especially for exporting which if
any of you know is extremely power
intensive and processing intensive
you're going to be a regular user
checking out your email browsing the web
watching YouTube videos making document
it doesn't make sense about the surface
book
over the surface pro 4 which is already
a great device it feels as though
Microsoft's product lines a little bit
confused right now it would have made
more sense if they just made a display
and then made swappable basis some with
dedicated GPUs some has just type covers
and everything else in between so that's
it for this video guys what do you think
of the surface book I know I wasn't a
huge fan I know John was a little bit
disappointed as well it's still a great
laptop it just doesn't make sense of
where it falls in with Microsoft's
product line versus the surface pro 4
and in competition with things like the
MacBook Pro and razors new ultrabook
with the external GPU and all those kind
of products let us know what you think
in the comments below would you pick one
up give us a thumbs up if you liked this
video hit that subscribe button and I'll
see you guys in the next one thanks for
watching
