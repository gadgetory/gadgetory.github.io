this week it's from Peter Thiel one of
the cofounders of PayPal and it is the
age of Apple is over
I've got circulated by the New York
Times in fact to move the market
specifically Apple in the downward trend
and I've been pretty negative towards
Apple and I think we rightfully so
especially the past year but I do think
the age of Apple is far from over
many people don't have the full picture
of Apple and so look at the company as a
Mac only business that also makes phones
and that's not the case their business
model has evolved incredibly since then
a huge revenue driver for Apple in fact
two bleep about 10 to 12 percent of
total revenue for calendar year 2016
didn't come from any physical product it
came from the App Store it generated
eight point eight billion dollars in
revenue which in fact is almost a 50%
increase from 2015 were generated six
billion dollars in revenue it's easy to
look at Apple and say well they're not
shipping a lot of Max and Max sales are
down and Apple is going to be doing
that's the stance that a lot of
journalists tend to take and PC sales as
a whole or down but in fact Apple sales
are actually up from the previous year
and I've been bucking the trend of
downward sales for overall computers in
the fourth quarter of 2016 Apple
actually shipped 5.4 million Mac's
worldwide which is up from 5.3 million
in the year ago quarter for a growth of
about 2.4 percent but Apple is not
making money from mac easy to find the
down ticks and say this is where the
problem is
Apple's really making money from two
places software and their iPhone
business the iPhone used to stand head
and shoulders above the competition that
is no longer the case whether you love
apple or Hatem android has caught up to
depending on what stance you take at
least feature parity and in a lot of
cases far above what Apple is doing but
their model is evolving App Store
purchases again huge for Apple we're
gonna have new category that was
supposedly going to be entering as we
head into 2017 and 2018 Apple's made
history of evolving their business other
that they evolved into autonomous cars
whether or not they leave businesses
behind you can't look at PC sales even
iPad
now both of which are down as a sign of
the doom and gloom at Apple I think
where you can say the age of Apple is
over is going to be in about two to
three years if you see if things like
smartwatches have evolved as Apple moved
into new categories if we don't see new
categories from Apple in the next 48
months I could say the argument that
Peter Thiel made perhaps had a lot of
foresight behind it but right now I
still have faith that Apple is going
into new categories it's very clear it's
not the same Apple it was when Steve
Jobs was there I know that's a cliche
thing to say but it seems to be very
apparent I think we're going to see
changes in the iPhone and if we don't
see change in the iPhone then there's
another way at the age of Apple perhaps
is over there as it exists right now
Apple's model has changed and not taking
that into account I don't think it's
fair so they can boils down to this the
age of Apple isn't over they've got a
few years to prove that it's not do you
guys agree with anything I'm saying here
certainly Apple as it existed if you
judge it based on innovation
they've stagnated they're not where
they're at I think it's easy to look at
things now and say that's it stick a
fork in them Apple is going to be an
iPhone company and a software company
and they're going to have a huge
valuation a company's going to be fine
but they're not gonna be what they once
were or if you take perhaps we're
optimistic approach and say I believe
Apple sells a lot of innovation left in
them they're going to evolve the
platform it evolved what Apple can do
what Apple is known for to do categories
not in right now and that's a camp that
I'm in just like being very critical I
think rightfully so of Apple the past
few years but there's obviously a topic
a lot of people have a lot of passion
about so take out your feelings on your
phone whenever that might be and look at
Apple just as a business do you feel
that the market moving quote from Peter
Thiel was correct I really wanna have a
conversation about it we can keep it
civil that's always ideal even the
comments down below and let's talk to
that I'll be replying to these for as
long as I can let me know you guys think
I'm John Redinger from TechnoBuffalo
