this video is probably about 10 months
in the making those you that follow me
on twitter or watch my youtube videos
you may have heard me mention
TechnoBuffalo but i've been very
secretive about details on it that's
because it was under development but now
i am so happy and thrilled to finally
share with you guys what TechnoBuffalo
is what it's going to be and more
importantly what it's going to do so
it's a website technobuffalo calm before
I really get into the nitty-gritty and
kind of go through feature by feature
about the site it's very important that
I introduced my business partner in
TechnoBuffalo this is a guy who kind of
been with me from day one that's helped
me develop the ideas you know he's had a
lot of the ideas himself and we've been
able to work together to kind of forage
of vision and create the site that we
both always imagined and that's Brandon
minimun you may have seen him do a
couple of videos on my channel he's
currently the editor-in-chief at
pocketnow.com really the premier windows
mobile resource but more than just
windows mobile he is a tech head like me
he was very educated in the world of
technology he's very educated personally
he's a fantastic writer he's going to be
a really solid addition to TechnoBuffalo
the site in the launch really couldn't
have been done without him so really
without further ado I'm going to turn
this over to Brandon who's going to talk
a little bit about the first feature of
technobuffalo hey everyone and thanks
John technobuffalo first feature is all
about the content you know there's a lot
of fantastic tech websites out there but
they're mostly characterized by text and
pictures if you've ever watched a video
review of anything tech related you know
that a video provides another dimension
that you just don't get with pictures
and text alone so TechnoBuffalo is going
to have a lot of video content whether
it's an unboxing or a review or a
comparison or how-to on how to do
something technology related in addition
we're going to have weekly video shows
so we may have a show for digital
photography enthusiasts or we may have a
show for the top 5 iPhone applications
released in the last week things like
that of course we will also have text
content written by professional writers
for example we may have art
goes on the best netbooks under three
hundred dollars for how to know when to
buy new technology people are always
wondering that should i buy now should I
wait three months we're gonna address
those things at TechnoBuffalo so now to
talk a little bit more about the other
features that technobuffalo brings is
jump thanks Brandon we're really excited
about the original content on
TechnoBuffalo I think it's going to be
one of the differentiating factors it's
going to separate it from the rest of
the technology sites out there the next
feature that I want to talk to you about
TechnoBuffalo swear some of the original
idea to start to come about you'll have
the ability to create your own sub blogs
so when you log into the site and create
your own username and password you'd be
able to make your own web page right off
of the main site so for me for example
it could be technobuffalo com John for
lakers and i will have full wordpress
customization a full wordpress content
management based on that site so i can
add writers i can put up my own videos i
can put up my own content and since we
recognize that you're doing the work
you're putting up your own content
you're putting up your own ideas you
should be rewarded for that so we're
going to give you the ability to
monetize your own technobuffalo com sub
Long's you can use Adsense or any other
supported monetization tool that you
choose that way the money goes right
into your account we thought it was only
fair since you're doing all the hard
work you should reap the benefits of it
that's something we're really excited
about at technobuffalo com sibility temp
users create their own sub blogs and be
able to monetize them and also as I'm
occasion some of the content from these
sub logs to be featured on the main page
will have featured blogs in our blogroll
section so you also get some exposure so
if you were to create your own website
elsewhere you have to pay for hosting
and really learn how to create a site
here it's already done for you and we're
going to help you get exposure assuming
the cons kind of solid so the next thing
that I want to talk about really the
next determining factor of technobuffalo
is social network we actually built it
from the ground up social network into
technobuffalo it's not a free-standing
social network it is meant just to work
hand-in-hand
with TechnoBuffalo we have the ability
to add friends great menja profile
create and manage your own groups have
discussions talk to each other via your
your wall posts updates via to Twitter
everything that you could do on social
network site till the ability to do on
technobuffalo including take advantage
of our built-in instant messaging client
where you can chat live with your
TechnoBuffalo friends to fit your really
excited about I think it's going to help
augment the site so if you go to
technobuffalo and your read a post on
the new iphone 3gs let's see you have a
question on the new iphone you can log
on into the social network with a single
log in and you can create a new group
iphone 3gs questions and go ahead and
ask and everybody that is looking at the
side or looking at articles see that
there's been a new group forum and can
join the discussion help you answer your
question you can use it for gadgets you
can use it for trend interviews it for
anything technology-based that you want
I'm really excited to show this to you
and give you a little bit more details
on with a social network is going to do
and show you the full capabilities of it
so I want to turn the camera over to
Brandon to give you a little bit of
history behind TechnoBuffalo here since
you guys have been hearing us talk about
it for so long let him take you through
the kind of the timeline and how he and
I came to meet and how we came to this
idea of technobuffalo thanks John yeah
so John and I pretty much met on youtube
I know that sounds kind of funny um he
was watching some of the videos that I
was making for pocket now and i was
watching the videos that he was making
for his video channel and we started
talking on a regular basis we we became
pretty good friends and most of our
talking had to do with technology so we
were talking about tech websites and the
new technology coming out new gadgets
coming down the line and we thought
about it we realized that there was
something missing from the whole tech
website landscape like I said earlier
there's a lot of fantastic tech tech
websites out there but there's something
missing there's nowhere to go if you
want to immerse yourself in technology
if you want to be a tech reviewer if you
want to read about technology on a very
in-depth level with tons of video
content and really know where to go if
you wanted to connect with other people
that had similar technology interests of
your own just kind of like John and I
did
back many months ago so we came up with
this idea of TechnoBuffalo that would
take a multi-pronged approach to an
immersive environment and technology and
that's what we've been talking about in
this short video so that is how the
whole idea came about for TechnoBuffalo
and now I'm going to turn it over to
John for some final remarks thanks Brett
in for that so I guess the next big
question is when can you get on
technobuffalo one is our launch going to
be well we're going to be opening it up
to a closed beta in the coming weeks so
look for information on that how you can
get involved in the closed beta system
and our launch will be shortly after
that we certainly can't give hard dates
quite yet we can't say that we're
looking at launching in the very near
future so I hope you guys are excited
about TechnoBuffalo as we are I think
it's going to change the landscape of
the tech blogging world out there we saw
things getting a little bit stale simple
text and picture interface isn't doesn't
really show much about a product if you
want to read about something new or a
new tech trends reading a paragraph and
seeing a picture is fine but there's an
immersion in the product that's why
video is going to be so important to
TechnoBuffalo so hope you guys enjoyed
be sure to stick around for some new
techno Buffalo News and tidbits as it
comes out I hope you guys are excited
about it as we are I'll see you in the
next one bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
