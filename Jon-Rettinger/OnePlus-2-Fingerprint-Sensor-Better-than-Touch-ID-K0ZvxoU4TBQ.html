TechnoBuffalo here when oneplus
announced the oneplus 2 they said they
had a best-in-class fingerprint reader
what not to say they felt it was better
than Apple's own touch ID so I figured
let's put that claim to the test that's
exactly what we did we tried through the
people in the office each set up a brand
new fresh fingerprint so there's nothing
on the device before destined to 10
times turn the screen on and then
actually unlock the device I tested it
Niven tested it and Mark be tested both
of them at the end of the video we'll
show you the full test so you can verify
what we did so I found it with the
oneplus at least on my test
I got 80% accuracy so that's 8 out of 10
and even got 90% so 9 out of 10 and Mark
be at different results he only had 5
out of 10 at 50% now when we went to the
iPhone 6
I had hundred-percent they haven't had
hundred-percent and marks be at
hundred-percent
so if you can do math quickly that means
the oneplus had about 73 percent
accuracy where the iPhone 6 had a
hundred percent accuracy it's really not
get under percent every time but nerve
dirty trial test it unlocked and worked
every single time
that's us to do with how Apple sets up
their fingers but we do have to actually
adjust your finger I don't know but in
real-world tests what Apple offers room
they worked better than what 1 + add to
offer or not say that one plus is a bad
offering but certainly wasn't as good as
touch ID as 1 plus claimed anyway what
do you guys think you anything else you
want to see a test with you want to see
us do this test with the galaxy s6
either comments down below and again if
you want to see the full test you can
check how we did it I will be after this
video so you can go through and see
every single fingerprint read that all
three of us did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
