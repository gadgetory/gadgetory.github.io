TechnoBuffalo i'm here at Mobile World
Congress we have a bell here one of Yoda
phones marketing folks to walk us
through some of the features of the new
Yoda phone so here we're looking at the
back and that's an 8 megapixel camera
right I said megapixel camera but this
is not the most interesting teeny on
this and this device we have always on
display which is now sensor you can
touch it now until react on your touches
for example now I'm rose in my my
facebook tweet I'm making likes open in
different tweets and rose in between
them and cetera and coming back easily
to my wallpapers as I like motorcycling
so and you can do really a lot of things
with the always-on display because for
example this is just prototype but in
the final commercial product which will
be available end of this year will be a
available such kind of initial analogy
as a for example ability to disable the
color display which consume a lot of
power and use the always-on display for
making calls sending the receiving SMS
and emails and actually use an almost
full functional team in communication
functionality of the smartphone but use
it much longer because we will disable
highly power consuming
high-resolution color display is one of
the features where you can use it and of
course you can read on the on the
display your hooks RSS feeds any
documents they would say so reading is
very really very nice alright everyone
