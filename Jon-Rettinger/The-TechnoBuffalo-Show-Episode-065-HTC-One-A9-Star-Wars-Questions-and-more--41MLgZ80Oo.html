TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site and i'm joined by managing
deputy editor Todd Hazleton hey guys you
cause for a second there I thought maybe
your time machine was going again
well my fair today is back to the future
day year I already went back to the
future and came back but still no flying
cars yeah so how are you doing this week
i'm good busy week i just sent out the
newsletter which sort of talks about
it's funny it's nice the newsletter we
send it out usually on Wednesdays and I
either write it on Tuesday night or
Wednesday morning and it covers like
what went on during the week for people
who aren't subscriber to you and it's
always crazy how much happened in the
past seven days like I don't know I go
back and I'm always like what I was a
pretty busy week and this week it was we
had the Nexus unboxings on monday i
think the embargo was today we had a
surface pro 4 and we'll be bringing your
other review of that we also had the a9
you can talk about for a little bit from
HTC the 189 gaming had four reviews with
two peripherals which are fun one was a
steering wheel and stuff so is it
there's a lot of stuff I guess hold up
morning I am again yeah I phone oh man
haha I've only seen it in still photos
ya in person that's the thing I feel
like a lot of the time actually one
commenter said like something nasty me
today I like that I don't know that I
don't make any sense or something but
come on like look at it in person I saw
somebody yesterday with an iphone 6 I
was at an HTC event and I know review
units had been seated and I was like oh
they have the 92 and then I realized oh
never mind i should she have phone sex I
ain't I like HTC don't get me wrong I've
had HTC phones my mother it's big fan of
the HTC One m8 yeah the
that looks a little too much like an
iPhone yeah um so what they're saying
and I was sure brought the phones out
before the review but what HTC's
argument is and I can understand it for
for some perspectives but is that the
Lions okay the antenna lines you expose
that was done before on the m7 h GC give
that ok and then happy Apple Abby apple
took that that makes sense and then they
also said that the rounded kind of
flatter design was from the desire
series specifically to desire 8 16 and I
can see that but those when you merge
the two together when you yeah right so
then Apple released a phone that doesn't
look like either of those but has the
antenna lines okay okay they copied the
antenna lines but now app HTC comes in
merges them it looks like the iPhone and
says we didn't copy the iphone no come
on so I think it's very similar-looking
that said who cares right into the day
at the end of the day and I think that's
what some commenters and people on the
internet aren't understanding when when
journalists and pundits are saying like
what looks like an iphone but it doesn't
really matter rants running Android it's
a great device so far and at three
hundred ninety nine dollars with
marshmallow and all that I mean I think
it's very excited so okay let's
backtrack for just a second here almost
all forms all phones now are the slab
form factor mhm that gives you X amount
of space to work with them right that
means that yes there are going to be
points where you look like somebody else
because there's only so many things you
can do with that form factor right
exactly so yeah I i agree with you if it
if it's a good phone it's a good phone I
don't care what it looks like yeah and I
mean I think apples proven that it has a
popular design on its hands right and
sure you know Apple has been using
aluminum but HTC has to and solid bricks
of aluminum which are beautiful but HTC
previously would sort of have that bump
on the back so it figure palm and I
think they actually worked with the
battery so that filled that space
specifically on the
on the m7 the first one m7 and then they
didn't do that here he's got a smaller
battery but what they're saying is that
features like dough is in marshmallow
and which is the the power management
will help and the new Snapdragon 617
processor will help you get good battery
life with this and right now I'm at
ninety-two percent it's been off the
charger since like 7am so they haven't
been using it crazy this morning what
isn't it here you have a visitor behind
you for those watching them yeah sure I
puppy is awake today well overall as we
always state in situations like this
this is not the official review of
TechnoBuffalo how is the phone so far so
far it's great and I really like I was
talking to people yesterday HTC and I
was saying I'm one of those people i
know we've moved on a cloud storage and
you can get hard 28 gigs of storage us
up but i'm one of the people that really
likes micro SD card slot still this has
one and it with marshmallow now you can
actually format it so that it's used as
local storage so this has 32 gigs of
on-board storage you have the micro SD
card formatted properly then you're just
adding on it's like local sort so the
apps actually sit fully on that as
opposed to where you can only move parts
of the apps over the micro SD card which
is really convenient but I noticed when
I was going through it that once you
format it it says like this micro SD
card can only be used in this phone so I
don't which seems crazy like does that
mean it's dumb for can you reformat it I
don't know I would assume you could
reformat that's what I would assume too
but I haven't done it yet so but I love
the fact that i'll do up to a two
terabyte micro SD card yeah which we
don't have yet I I know we don't be poor
right so let's say there was a two
terabyte SD micro SD card out there
right now right the idea that something
that small can hold more than my desktop
I know yeah that's crazy to think about
nice to have 128 gigs in my macbook here
and I mean I can I could see that easily
with this phone which actually so now I
have a reason to buy that 128 gigabyte
microSD card I've been sitting on
forever
yeah the you every time there's a spell
oh yeah I'm on the site we published the
sales whenever they hit amazon and I've
been waiting to click buy on it but I
haven't yet but anyway so I'm really
liking it great phone so far at first my
first hands-on I played with the camera
and I thought it was really really
atrocious so far since I've had it since
last night a little bit more it'sit's
better and I believe when I first check
it I checked the camera module it's the
same module in the oneplus one and the
Nexus 6 but of course software makes a
big difference so whatever its gc's done
on on that side cool I look forward to
reading all of your thoughts on it and
it's I'm not in the market for another
phone right now but neither but I'm so I
saw the garnet red one which is like a
deep red like a cranberry and it does
look pretty and he can't mistake that
for an iphone eyes I hate it when
companies you know just call it red yeah
yeah all the crazy names there yeah cuz
I was doing the product page yesterday
morning I was just like no I'm not
calling you garnet red I'm just crying
red right yeah get over it right not
happening but whatever that that's
samsung is notorious you know arctic
white yeah for these crazy names see
Harbin black oh well when I was out in
irvine i win but um I trade in my bose
qc15 s4 qc25 s and they had different
color options now so I got the qc25
triple black oh wow they're really black
really like shiny or something like it's
everything the trim everything is black
is that big of a deal but I was just
like I just like having something this
troop of black black because it's on the
case triple black nice sounds fancy it
sounds fancier exactly so now the
interesting thing about the a9 is that
it feels looking at the proud
age you know that the specs like it's a
mid-range phone but they're calling this
a flagship yeah okay so that was one
thing too that had to be clarified
there's and actually it takes a lot of
clarification in the United States it is
a flagship phone and it will replace the
one m9 as such in other markets like the
UK it is a hero phone and will be sold
alongside the one m9 but get this in the
United States it costs 399 dollars with
32 gigs of storage and three gigs in
braham in Europe it will ship with two
gigs of ram and 16 gigs of storage and
it costs more so that's it's very
confusing I know I have I had heard the
story on on how this happened off the
record so I can't really talk about it
but it's interesting but I think HTC
made the right move in the united states
where it has to go up against you know
them it has two against these phones in
other markets too but you know they're
separate divisions of the company in the
united states warehouse go up against
the Moto X pure has to go up against
folks who are looking at the 1+2 you
know one plus one in some cases you know
send phone to you all these other
low-cost phones so i think that was
smart bc has the brand name that can
certainly ship units which we've seen
one plus hasn't has a problem viewing
and i think for that price you get a
good phone one thing though and i need
to play with it more as the moto x pure
that also starts at 399 but as a quad HD
display a larger display it's also
water-resistant in some regards you can
customize with all kinds of colors so
that's going to be sort of the hard
battle for me is like well this is a
nice phone at 399 you get the
fingerprint reader you get marshmallow
right now but 399 a moto x pure has
higher end specs got a better processor
that's can be tough but one of the other
things you said it's a mid-range phone
so the way HTC looks at is yes
snapdragon 617 is a mid-range processor
it's not the 800 series but it's the
newest processor it supports though it's
unavailable now quick charge three point
0 and HTC looked at it like we could put
you know 810 or something
probably more expensive it was already
in the m9 it didn't do very well as
overeating issues or we could try the
latest from Qualcomm that's available
and so they did that and obviously I
think it helps to keep costs because the
Snapdragon 820 is not available yet
neither are some of the other so well
we've got a couple questions coming in
specific to the a9 so I'm going to
change things a little bit this week and
we're going to jump into a couple
questions real quickly from brazen
Franco do you think HTC will manage to
keep their 15 days update promise then
they already make such a promise or was
it Motorola it wasn't HTC the one saying
that releasing every security update
every month was unfeasible yeah okay so
from what I understand is the promise
was only made for the unlocked version
so it she doesn't have the restraints
that carriers put on the software
updates which is the biggest problem
which I think was one of the issues it
ran into with its 90 day guarantee on
software updates that frequently seemed
to miss right especially for some
carriers Verizon's notoriously really
hard on updates that's why you saw
phones like the droid turbo this year
that didn't get lollipop until what like
two months ago and now here we are with
marshmallows so it takes a long time now
the promise is again on the unlocked
model I'm not sure if it's just the US
or global the US president made that
promise yesterday so it seems like it
might be just the US but that wouldn't
make sense given that there's a global
skew as well so you have to consider
there's that European version with two
gigs and 16 gigs there's this version in
the US there's also another version in
Asia that has three gigs and 32 gigs of
storage so there are so I don't know
it's one but Motorola also has made
those promises and wasn't HTC the one
saying that releasing security update
every month unfeasible yes that's true
that it did say that but one of the
reasons is unfeasible is because of the
carrier Straits at least that's HTC's
for you so in this regard if it's not
sold through carriers you're not buying
it on AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile or sprint which will
also sell this phone then you should be
good we got to play the full price
makes sense um okay let's see here but I
still agreeing 15 days is pretty big
promise yeah one of those wait and see
things from such humble all do you think
HTC made the one a nine looks so similar
to the iphone on purpose to help
increase their sales no yeah i can tell
you um actually i have on the record
quotes if you guys will just bear with
me for a second while he's looking that
up i'll dance like a monkey for those of
you go the reason that I I bring this up
is because we talk to the designers and
it looks like here you go it looks like
that the phone sort of is the iphone but
what we were told i should i get to
bring it up one side was that the
rounded corners and stuff like that the
radiuses that help make it look like the
iphone and when you look at the camera
specifically the flash module is
circular just like the iphone here and
you can see the two side by side in case
they said that these these concessions
were made as the as the design process
went on so like they couldn't fit I
can't bring up the quotes but basically
they couldn't fit the the longer
elongated flash it sort of looks like i
have a g4 here that looks like you know
more of an oval shape they couldn't fit
that on there the edges were ended up
being rounded like the iphone because
that's what they did is they continued
you know molding the device I don't know
about the bottom looks very similar
issue she's really well known for their
boomsound speakers and those aren't here
anymore and they said they couldn't fit
them but if you've seen other desire
devices I'm holding us up the people on
the screen they don't always have these
huge boomsound speakers on the top and
bottom they just have this tiny gap
between the top of the phone and the
bottom and the display where the
speakers usually sit that's not here on
this phone and so it's just on the
bottom which looks very much like an
iPhone so you know can I answer will it
help increase sales well it seems too
important for samsung but Samsung's
doesn't look as close to the HTC One so
I don't know well we'll see now my
question how many phones are on your
desk right now
yeah lot well I'm in the process of
reviewing this so I'm like okay well I
want to see how identical a lot of these
look especially from the bottom and
stuff like that but no I don't the story
I was told from HTC is that this isn't
something they did on purpose now
whether you want to believe that or not
whether I want to believe that or not I
don't know but I don't think HTC has
always been praised for their hardware
design so I don't think they were like
oh people didn't like the way our other
phone slopes we have to make it look
like an iPhone because that doesn't make
sense to me you know they're the
shortcomings to their other phones were
issues with you know the camera for
example on the m9 the m7 didn't have
expandable storage so like people were
going to other phones for other reasons
I thought but you know maybe someone
secretly said let's build a my phone
call I have no idea we're getting this
goes back to a point that you brought up
earlier uh from I'm i know i'm going to
mispronounce this first name and I
apologize cacique Shah well marshmallow
allow you to utilize the external SD
card exactly as the internal memory to
install apps etc to it I'm gonna say
yeah that's why I thought yeah that's
what it is here i'll bring it up for
people that can see you go into storage
and USB so if you're looking at oh it's
not going to come into focus so I have
12 gigs used on my phone's internal
storage and then I have an SD card with
fifty eight gigs available now if I
click it samsung SD card I get an option
to go into a settings get an option to
format as internal when you top that
says this requires the Samsung SD card
now that's just the brand of the SD card
Evelyn to be formatted to make it secure
after formatting the Samsung SD card
will only work in this device so that's
what i was saying really deposit
refunded formatting erases all data
currently stored on the samsung SD card
to avoid losing the data consider
backing up all over so then it is used
as local storage which is something that
we haven't seen i enjoyed before
marshmallow where you're installing tons
of games and maybe you move some of the
local files over your SD card but those
games still eat up say the 16 gigs at 32
storage on your on your drive you kind
of run out you can't move them over to
micro SD card which might have plenty of
space now that sort of alleviate so I
think it's very cool but I haven't
obviously turned it on you cool no I I
think that's something that's needed to
be done for a long time yeah from Justin
streuben we touched on this a little bit
he's asking how's the camera yeah so I
looked at I brought up the camera specky
tales last week when we first received a
device and I just that one went to
irvine for our unboxing so i just got
this one for the review it has the same
module as far as i could tell as the
nexus 6 and the oneplus one I think
certainly the oneplus one but Samsung
HTC software tweaks seem to have
improved and it doesn't look like shots
taken with either of those phones so
it's a sony module there's a toshiba one
in the m9 that 20.7 megapixel camera
that was not very good it seems to be
pretty good so far it's not the best
type you certainly I think you'd be
better off with an S six or an iPhone or
whatever but g4 but um you know those
funds cost a lot more than 3 99 very
cool I'm going to take one more a 9
question before you change topics and
then we will get to the rest of the
questions during the Q&amp;amp;A session and
thank you all you are asking some great
questions but this one made me chuckle
from brazen Franco did you ask the
desires why the HTC logo above the home
button I didn't and I'm not sure there's
people here you can see HTC sore right
above the home button now the
interesting thing about that home button
though is it's the fingerprint reader
but then there's also the on-screen
buttons there you can see but if you if
you say I'm in chrome or something like
that if you tap just the fingerprint
reader it still acts as a home button
which is kind of neat but it's not
physical it doesn't have any move to it
interesting yeah well the scientific we
wanted to touch on was trailer for some
little movie that's coming out that yeah
what I I don't know it's a looked
interesting it caught my attention I'm
not sure many people have seen the
trailer yet yeah it's only had 28
million views
uh you know and it only did 6.5 million
dollars in imax sales on the first night
which the old record was 1,000,000 prob
apparently people are still into this
whole Star Wars thing yeah who would
have thought I don't know but so what we
thought we would do folks is as people
know from reading the site and listening
to the show I'm a little bit of a star
wars geek just a tiny bit todd has seen
all the films but I've seen them all I
like to my love growing up with them but
I'm sort of like you know not a geek at
all I don't know exact you don't know
the backstory you enjoyed them as movies
right and I enjoyed the video game right
that we were just playing I'd like you
didn't feed it into a lifestyle yes true
except I'm still the guy who says that
big walking thing like let's attack that
instead of athe oh god no my friends I
was plenty with my friends they play
Todd turning red so now you know how
separate we are on the topic I remember
when my parents bought me the back in
1980-81 they bought me the the big 80 AD
app you know toy yeah and my parents
decide it was big enough to be called
dog spot haha it's they told me that was
our second dog but uh that's awesome so
a force awakens trailer of course is
what we're discussing it came out this
week the the first thing I'm going to
say is from the opening moment I was
struck by just how visually gorgeous
this movie is yeah I mean it looks
unlike any other Star Wars movie hmm and
as as my mother stood wow this almost
looks like it was done by a professional
of like Oh sick because buried yeah I
think one of the things to I was super
excited to see the dog fight going on
and I was like oh man like i wanted to
jump up in place I gotta see this movie
so I thought that was
there's a lot going on in that trailer
is seeing an x-wing TIE fighter dogfight
especially in an atmosphere is it looks
like it happens on two separate plants
so looks like I get multiple dogfights
not to mention the TIE fighter Tie
Fighters chasing the Falcon through the
wreckage aku that was awesome yeah I'm
everything about this movie just screams
although I was surprised we didn't get
the the emotional impact of the second
trailer you know with Han and Chewie and
Johann going we're home right right
right yeah there was no hey folks I'm
gonna admit it I choked up a little bit
when that happened to the secretary
there was no choke up moment for me this
was much more about the new characters
and a little bit of Han a little bit of
layout right so but as a and let me be
very clear folks I know more than i'm
going to say because i don't want to
spoil anyone and i've read far far too
much of leaks so god i know you have a
couple questions and what we'll just
start from there yeah so one of my
questions was it seemed to me like they
weren't aware that Jedi's existed before
and it I was asked you before the show
sort of is this like when obi-wan comes
back and talks to young Skywalker and it
sort of brings him into into what Jedi's
are the culture you know and that's the
Internet I'm getting that asked that
question more by people than any other
question of why would they not know
about the Jedi and the Sith right well
the Jedi purge happened at the end of
revenge of the sith which was 20 years
prior to a new hope this is now 30 years
after Return of the Jedi there's about
three years in the original trilogy so
you're looking at about fifty three
years since the Jedi perfect the what is
known is that the Emperor did ordered
that anything related to the Jedi
throughout the guy oxy was destroyed so
there really is no evidence of the Jedi
even owning a lightsaber was considered
illegal so it's not totally out of
reason to me that younger people would
not have any clue who the Jedi were
now the interesting thing is the mobile
game that you played for a couple days
with you Star Wars uprising there on one
of the planets there is a hologram of an
imperial officer this is post Return of
the Jedi is when this game happens
there's a post there's a planet where a
hologram of an imperial officer is
saying these rumors of the destruction
of the Death Star and the death of the
Emperor or hearsay and they're illegal
to discuss and this game is considered
canon so there is a chance so we know
the first order is an offshoot of the
Empire there's a chance that if you're
within first order controlled space that
this is illegal to even discuss Wow yeah
so how much they'll go into that in the
movie I don't know I think a lot of that
though is hey we got a whole bunch of
kids coming into the film that have no
clue what's going on ah oh but it was
very interesting to hear hon half to
confirm that information yeah very yeah
I'm super intrigued by that little plot
point that I know you had another
question about who the guy in black goes
yeah who's the new bad guy so the new
bad guy what we know about him so far as
his name is kylo Ren right he not a sip
that took everyone by surprise he is
force sensitive he is in touch with the
dark side of the force but he is not a
Sith per se and for those that aren't
aware Sith our Darth Vader was as if the
Emperor was a sip kylo Ren is a member
of a group called the Knights of Ren
which I believe we see there's a shot of
kylo Ren in the rain with some guys
surrounding him I believe they're the
Knights of Ren mmm what the Knights of
Ren are we have no idea yet but so he
aspires to be a separately and that's
why he's got Darth Vader's melted funky
helmet which a the helmet is really you
know so Luke burned his father you know
on the funeral pyre at the end of Return
of the Jedi right he didn't clean it up
no he left the Ewoks with a big pile of
ashes and what I'm out of here haha one
of the Ewok sold it on Star Wars ebay
we're in the money yet nope yeah I just
I'm a little puzzled by the helmet just
being out there yeah I think I'll even
explain that or we just goes accepted I
think it's just gonna be a thing like a
backstory 20 kylo Ren obtained Vader's
helmet the comment though that kylo says
to the helmet of I will finish what you
started I feel you know must apply to
purging the entire galaxy of Jedi right
knows that Luke is still out there
somewhere you know which and this is
where I won't go into spoilers there's a
reason we aren't seeing Luke in the
trailer oh and that he's not on the
poster he is in the movie I can confirm
he is in the movie but I there's a I
think there's a very specific reason why
they're not showing them no I don't you
didn't know the answer yeah he's not
kylo Ren I've heard many people are you
Oh is he kylo Ren oh he's not kylo Ren
oh wow okay no none he but there's not
going to be a remove the helmet and it's
Luke under their moment moment okay yeah
thank goodness no it's it's actually
been made very clear that kylo Ren is
being played by an actor named Adam
driver who's best known for being on the
series girls oh yeah there is one shot
in the trailer where you see Kyla with
his helmet off but it's from the back
and it's very definitely Adam drivers
hair how much are the old characters han
Solo for example gonna have a role in
this movie okay so hon I don't know yet
where he's been or why he doesn't have
the Falcon that that part of the
spoilers have been kind of iffy he's in
it significantly and he does as you can
see in the trailer he does go on a quest
with Rey and Finn
leah is now leading the resistance which
you've seen their the resistance based
in the trailer you know why it's called
the resistance as opposed to the
rebellion I'm not positive apparently
the the galaxy is very fragmented and so
unlike under the Old Republic which was
one rule or under the Empire which was
run one rule it's kind of like fiefdom
now okay galaxy because there was such a
power vacuum after the death of the
Emperor so yeah and there's I I won't
say what the red flash is the red flash
is important that wants you to the
awesome scene of kylo Ren on the Star
Destroyer bridge and you see that red
flash that's important as for Finn
holding the lightsaber that's the other
question I'm getting a lot we there's
somebody who is force-sensitive in the
movie but it kind of bounces back and
forth who it is so I'm not going to say
a whole lot on that but a lot of it has
to the movie has to do with getting
Luke's original lightsaber which was
Anakin's lightsaber which once again one
of those weird things that fell down the
shaft of Bespin Cloud City so all I can
figure is a janitor named Bob picked it
up at the bottom shaft he went on Star
Wars eBay yeah and had an account like
the Ewoks and sold it yeah the relics
from the original trilogy showing up or
kya got me going wait what what how's
that possible that's actually pretty
weird you should write these back
stories and put them online for when
people google them yah lightsaber I mean
it fell down several miles and it looks
like it's fine apparently lightsabers
are tough and don't get scratches I can
look pretty tough yeah but uh from Davis
tap
it's probably people getting said while
waiting for the return of Jar Jar Binks
nah shut up Jar Jar as far as I'm
concerned is dead yes that's not canon
but I'm assuming he's dead uh uh you
know what's the backstory on Jar Jar
Binks like who thought that was a good
idea Lucas he thought kids needed a
character to connect to really and the
thing is this is what i love about Jar
Jar is that people are so blinded by
their hatred of charger that they don't
realize that in the third film he
essentially creates the Empire really he
wants the motion in front of the Senate
to give the Supreme Chancellor all these
powers which makes the makes Palpatine
the Emperor and if you sit there use if
you connect the dots for two seconds
you're like Jar Jar Binks just created
the entire skirt the entire galaxy
hahahaha that's pretty funny i'll have
to go back and watch day it's really you
have to think about for a few seconds
but then you're just like that's really
kind of funny that Lucas was like yeah
y'all hate Jar Jar wait to see this I
get really hate him okay you're really
gonna hate him and realize oh he wasn't
such a bad guy till now from such humble
all will star wars the force awakens
have lots of lens flares that JJ Abrams
is known for so far I've only seen one
lens flare so I a the thing is if you
talk to JJ Abrams about it he didn't
realize how many he was pretty good Star
Trek totally watched it really yeah yeah
even he after the first Star Trek film
it was brought up and goes asli goes I
didn't realize until I watched the
completed film um at that point it was
too late to take him out and so he is
aware of his lens flare problem um dich
he's peace he sought help uh I believe
he went to lens flare rehab
and so I'm ho it lends flares while they
fit the star trek universe they really
don't fit the star wars universe the
star wars universe is much more gritty
and grimy and dirty and all that so I
don't think we're going to have the lens
flare problem but uh okay so we'll jump
it back into the questions here and
thank you all for indulging my Star Wars
fanaticism uh from jeff k have they
mentioned any future details for the m10
know they had they won't even recognize
that name or anything at this point so
we don't know when that'll be the m9
came last year mobile world congress at
the end of February's Marshall I forget
what it was but that's probably time
frame will see the next one if i had to
guess yeah I i we haven't even started
hearing rumors about the m10 yet yeah
the thing is yesterday was their big
global announcement for this so I mean
you know all efforts all sites
everything is behind a nine right now
like yes somebody about the m10 alleline
there's the door yeah we just put
everything into this so yeah nothing
went from brazen Franco what did you
return this week Todd nothing that I
know um yeah but I was I was so close
yesterday to to buying the red version
of this um I just don't know when it's
gonna ship they said the V I know it's
crazy and then you know Nexus 5x Moto X
pure those are all sort of on my radar
now but I don't know I finally played
with the 6p yesterday for the first time
new Nexus 6p I thought that was really
nice too but that's a little more than i
want to spend i mean i did i just bought
the 6s plus so that's sort of that was
my big purchase now anything else can
yeah Oh phones yeah remember when all we
cared about was if they made calls yeah
and now I mean you know I was talking to
another journalist yesterday to you
about the success plus and how in our
review we said like
you know it's if you have a six or the
six plus it's not worth the upgrade and
you know this journalist agreed it
doesn't add that much so I'm still kind
of in that recurrent boat but I'm not
gonna return it yeah you say that now
well cuz i passed my six bucks from
Jonas kamael how do you feel about HTC
removing boomsound I'm bummed so
actually it technically has boomsound
and that's the feature that they do to
amplify the microphone jack so when you
put headphones in you get the upgraded
audio I'm not an audio file I can rarely
hear the differences in this kind of
thing so I don't use them that much but
it's the same upgrades that the s6 does
we're very similar in any case
upsampling boom sound so that's what
boom sound is now on this phone the
boomsound speakers are gone there's
nothing and I think that's a bummer i
really like having phones when possible
that have front facing speakers just cuz
it's nice when you're watching youtube
video the audio is coming right at you
this has the speaker on the bottom like
the iphone yes 6 and stuff and it's
actually pretty loud though so it's not
bad it's just that the odd it's not
coming at you it's not as engrossing as
boomsound speakers have been that seems
so odd they dropped that when they're so
well known for it I know they said they
look with the fingerprint reader and the
front facing camera and the screen that
we wanted you know we couldn't fit it I
don't know if i buy that because like I
said the the desire series has had that
small R which works really well so from
Brisbane Franco is it better is it a
better value than the moto style um you
know I haven't used a lot of the Moto X
pure in the moto style especially the
moto style because that's not available
in United States so I don't know but I
think so FAR's and this is you know less
than 24 hours and if I this phone right
now I think it's a good value for fans
of HTC that want marshmallow on a
fingerprint reader an expandable storage
the moto phones look really nice and i
think i'm talking to irvine about
grabbing the Moto X pier for this review
because it's so close
in price to this but has higher specs I
know that the style is not as high as
seen in the pure but so it's one
question I can't answer to say but I
think they're both really good deals
cool uh interesting from sahaja what's
the point of the HTC a nine if I had to
guess and that's a good question because
especially as a flagship in the United
States with the m9 should be you know
they didn't come out with they didn't
have the MA and then come out with an a
if i had to guess it's because the m9
probably wasn't selling well and i think
that's you know whether consumers
worried about the snapdragon 810 I feel
like most consumers don't know about
that they'll probably do you know about
the camera because they care about that
if that was the issue then they probably
wanted to have a phone that just quickly
came out or placed that and that's my
guess but i also think they're trying to
drive direct sales to their website
where you buy this unlocks Mona through
99 sort of the way Motorola's doing
things and this is a price point that is
attractive to do that versus say the m9
you can buy it unlocked at each you see
but it's more than 600 bucks so this
safety one or bucks from Jonas Khmer oh
are you guys watching Star Wars rebels
well I am I caught up on the season two
premiere yet but yes I did watch season
one and loved it I also loved Clone Wars
it was great uh from Justin Struve does
the 617 keep up yeah I was worried about
that Snapdragon 670 as opposed to
something like an 808 or an 8 10 so far
so good I downloaded some games last
night and I haven't played them yet
today but multitasking everything has
been really good it's fluid I did notice
some stuttering at times but it was
quick and I think it's because the phone
was still setting up again I've had it
for less than 24 hours so after a few
days might human out of you I'll have
the final opinion but so far I'm not
seeing any huge difference between this
and 600 700 our flagship
which is pretty impressive 3d graphics
I've heard reports that it struggles a
bit in some of the high-end games like a
new need for speed so I'll have to test
that good uh from it starts with Aziz
zahara I'm thinking HTC made a nine and
called it hero foam because HGC can't do
well at holiday season with boring m 9
a-9 will do better maybe save the
company so they announced the m10 later
a 9 is not for geeks I would agree I I
think and that's something I think a lot
of people have to remember look we make
our living from talking about phones but
we are still the minority in the world
you know every time I go in a carrier
store I see people that have no
knowledge of the phones on the shelves
well not a bit this at this price point
could be a very attractive phone yeah I
think so too it and yeah geeks well I
think there's two sides to that story I
don't know that it's necessarily not for
use because right now you have geeks
that are going to buy the nexus devices
or this because these are the first
marshmallow device is now a couple
months is for geeks no it's not because
there's going to be several marshmallows
but yeah I think geeks mostly go for
these high specs you know quad HD they
want the best you know your Galaxy s6
edge+ galaxy s6 G for those kind of
phones Nexus 6p um that said I think I
think things are changing i think a lot
of geeks in a lot of ways they're like
you know as carriers aren't are moving
away from to your contracts and if you
don't want to pay this monthly fee you
buy the out right device and now you
either go out there and spend a grand or
slightly less than that by the 128
gigabyte model or something like that or
you're like I'm gonna go buy this for
all our phones pretty good and whether
you're spending that four dollars on the
a9 or the Moto X pure you know I don't
know but I think those are becoming that
price point especially is becoming a
more attractive point and even for geeks
even for people just because simply you
don't want to spend that much money on
phones and you know geeks like myself
I'm not a mutt I mean I do but I don't
want to continue buying these several
times a year you know or or maybe I am
buying these several times a year in
which case that's why the 400 ollar
price point is more compelling and say
you know one eight hundred dollar phone
every year you can buy two of these and
you're upgrading in some regards yeah
that's very true that's I'm having long
answers because these devices are very
new for like when you're you come in for
a review like we used to for most of my
career eight years now in journalism you
come in and you'd be like okay it's two
hundred dollars on a new contract how do
I rate this phone against other two
hundred dollar phones on a contract but
now you're looking at well this is 400
hours off contract but you could get two
hundred dollars on contract on some
carriers for this device or maybe you're
going to spend a thousand dollars and
you're going to get a lot of hardware
and now you got to figure out like okay
so what's this worth really and what
should people buy and that's becoming a
really tricky question answer which is
why you're starting to see on our site
we've gone to buy weight and don't buy
for a lot of our phone reviews because
you can't it's so much harder now to say
like well this is a seven and this is a
ten and why you know because the price
points are just totally different and
what can I want need or how they're
buying their phone is so different well
the other problem we were running into
is people didn't understand that the
scale worked in we were judging the
phone against itself yeah judging the
phone against itself in the promises
made by the manufacturer exactly so just
because you know this phone was a nine
and we put this one at a ten doesn't
necessarily mean that this phone was
better than the nine in bed everything
all the criteria so that's the hardest
thing because you have phones like the
brand new Moto G that costs you know 200
bucks and then you have the galaxy s6
that costs 800 bucks right and you're
like well that's a really great phone
for 800 bucks it's very high-end it's
awesome then you're like the Moto G is
incredible for 200 bucks would an
awesome phone people would be proud to
carry that and you can give them both
the same score because they both meet
those promises that their offer
consumer but they're totally different
devices like of course the galaxy s6
isn't better phone the Moto G but for
for who and for how much and that's why
this is all becoming these questions are
harder yeah there's so many different
verticals now phones that it's
impossible to judge them against one
another yeah yeah I know I quality it's
never been like this at least in the
United States now uh from Brisbane
Franco are you playing Star Wars
uprising Sean yes i am you can find me
as nace sean backwards anula ani
backwards and there is actually a
detective yeah it's NASA NOAA is just
Sean honey backwards dot nah slit ah
yeah and Buffalo cartel so if you're
looking for a cartel rising join us so
you're still playing that I just kept
playing dude I'm a star wars geek I
should have come playing it was like one
of it was i think i was playing on a
saturday yeah ouch and i played for
several hours this is in like how you
felt on your cartel and then yeah you
played a bunch for one day yeah uh okay
we're going to go out here on a question
from such a baja because it is october
21st 2015 off topic which Back to the
Future movie is your favorite and why
and what is your favorite moment from oh
man i might oh so long that's my problem
with that i I like one and two for a and
say I don't hate three like a lot of
people do I loved one and two for very
different reasons one was a great story
to was a mind bender and one of the few
films I feel has ever gotten time-travel
correct I guess not some time machine
game pretty good job i've not watched i
want to be there so stupid funny but uh
picking between the two
oh that's tough i would say probably too
and i would say my favorite moment just
because it's so bizarre is the delivery
of the Western Union telegram at the
exact moment the exact time at this
exact place because doc had sent the
Western Union telegram back in the 1880s
yeah I thought that was so cool I yeah
the fact that the the western union
office had sat on this this telegram for
70 years it just cracked me up I don't
know why but uh I don't know what mine
would be I love all three movies yeah
they're gonna have to watch them all
again I still can't believe that we've
actually reached this date yeah I know
girls are in that post today about Syria
I was like that's kind of crazy because
there were so many times where it was
just a hoax and online hoax like this is
the date in fact I mean how many years
did that happen it seemed like it
haven't launched oh yeah yeah I know it
did happen here no but i was referring
to Pozos like you know they didn't have
Siri back then but they had hoverboards
it's like well which one we'd rather
have obviously hoverboards but now we
have like these Segway things yeah well
riding not segways but like the
skateboard you know they're leaning back
and forward I thought I told you Sora
when I was flying home from Aoife I saw
Justin Bieber was on my tram in Detroit
riding on one of these things just like
back and forth us I look definitely
waited that's just weird so bizarre yeah
so close it'll I feel like we are in the
future well folks we apologize we can't
get to all the questions there are a ton
of them and I always hate leaving
