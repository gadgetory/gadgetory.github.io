to you by netflix go to netflix.com
slash buffalo for your free trial
membership today what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here and i
got a bit of a funny story for you about
the video you are about to see yesterday
which was the third of march i was
fortunate enough to go on to CNBC and
talk about the ipad 2 now you might have
known that you might have seen on the
channel or up on the website but here's
sort of the stuff you don't know which
is gonna make this video a little bit
funny I suffer from what I refer to as
pale face syndrome when I go on camera
raining my face just looks super washed
out I have like zero I am like
translucent Lee white most the time so I
mentioned it's the CM vc folks and they
put makeup on me before the segment
which I've never done before um which is
fine you couldn't see on camera I looked
a little bit darker perhaps healthier um
but when I got home to film the ass the
Buffalo video I forgot that it was still
on there and I filmed the video and you
can completely see it in the video it
looks so weird so I thought about
refilling the video or trying to edit it
out and the day I thought it was really
funny um that it was there so I decided
to leave it so watch the video comment
on the weird orangi face that I've got
going on I hope the questions that i
answered were helpful but i thought was
sort of a cool friday fun light video at
least friday than this video's going up
i don't know when you're watching it if
you're watching during the workweek get
back to work but otherwise it was just
sort of a funny thing to keep up keep it
light fresh keep funky so hope you guys
enjoy my weird facial lines and has
asked the Buffalo video see in the next
one bye bye what's up everyone jon
rettinger from technobuffalo here back
with another segment I like to call ask
the Buffalo about once a week i will
post something up on techno
Buffalo where you guys can ask me
anything you want from technology
personal and i'll pick a few at random
and answer them on camera now the first
question I you guys are going to ask is
what's with the getup why are you
wearing a tie well I figured I owed you
guys a bit more than the hoodie and
t-shirt attire that I usually wear i did
a CNBC thing this morning the thumb the
youtube channel and technobuffalo if you
want to check it out and i figured out
to keep it on because it's fancy I'm
actually the mullet of the tech world
you can't you can't see it I am all
business up top but I am a total party
down below here with my jeans and
converse you can't see I am super
internet generation I guess all right so
let's go ahead i'm going to glance right
word and answer some of your questions
this one is from william Kylie Giles do
you think the multi tablet approach
Google will come out on top just like
with android phones uh well i think the
smartphone a battle is definitely going
to be a long war with probably no end in
sight however during that war again
there are bound to be battles on
certainly those are going to be won by
varying science we only have two apple
smartphones now on the market on two
different carriers we've got the iphone
4 on verizon and the iphone 4 on 18 p.m.
not really counting that this counted
three gs's that are available whereas
android there are multiple phones
available on multiple carriers so it
wouldn't make sense that a very full
feature extremely capable operating
system like android would be achieving
market penetration at a much higher rate
so do i think it's going to work for
tablets i'm not so sure it's going to
translate necessarily the same i think
honey cone definitely needs some
improvements especially needs app
support but that is yet to be seen so
that's the short answer go ahead and
continue mock questions here too hey
john what is the first gadget you
reviewed that
he amazed you that is from Axl sardo the
first gadget that really amazed me was
beyond the shadow of a doubt the first
iphone in 2007 I remember dragging my
wife into the apple store it was 10pm at
night when it launched just to look at I
hadn't seen Layton person and just heard
about it and I was just floored and you
think back in two thousand seven what
smartphone world looked like I had a
blackberry pearl beforehand that I had
been using there was windows mobile out
on the marketplace Android wasn't
released yet I mean it really wasn't
that much out there in terms of
smartphone smartphone generally gave you
better email capabilities sometimes a
keyboard and just awful awful browsing
and the iphone came along and sort of
was able to give you that multi-touch
web browsing which was incredibly cool I
remember taking the iphone when I first
got it to my grandma I went to go visit
my grandparents and I had all my
pictures on there i was able to swipe
through the pictures and pinch and zoom
something that we really hadn't seen
before and she was just absolutely
amazed with it as was i really had a
very high cool factor a certainly
subsequent iphone some sort of laughs to
that luster that the first generation
had when I think it really helps define
what would be the mobile marketplace go
ahead and continue hey this is from Paul
and we on oh hey John what new
technologies you'd like to see in the
future and what are you looking forward
to that is a good question I cover a lot
of mobile stuff and I considered tablets
and sort of laptop stuff in there I
would love to see and this is sort of
realistic wish list i'm not talking
about like Star Wars asked Holograms you
know when Leigh as asking obi-wan for
help realistically I would love to see a
good implementation of glasses free
technology on tablets I hate wearing
glasses I'm not the biggest fan of 3d
stuff in general but I hate wearing
glasses to do it with I would really
like to see a nice implementation of
glasses free technology 3 is definitely
sort of up and coming in the tech world
of already signaled want a lot of TVs
it's making its way now to video
game consoles of portable video games so
I'd love to see sort of that continue
I'd also like to see pico projectors and
I know we're probably alone on this get
better implemented and become smaller
into devices I think it'd be really cool
to take like the motorola xoom for
example and project onto all fond giving
a presentation wirelessly and speaking
of wirelessly I would love to see better
wireless implementation for streaming
content and whether it's wireless HDMI
DLNA Apple's AirPlay I want to get rid
of wider you guys can see down below in
my desk it is just cluttered with wires
I love you get content from here to
there to there to there without wires
and without totally reading myself um so
let's go ahead and come along to the
next question how do you deal how did
your wife do up your obsession to
gadgets my wife hates it this is from
innocent little girl 714 um so I'm gonna
get a little cheesy on here um my wife
is so incredibly supportive of what
would pretty much is a gadget addiction
she she really has even before it became
a career it was just a passion for me
she would indulge me a walk around best
buy with me she would look at all the
games i was looking at should go look at
the laptop she go to AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon and
look at the cell phones with me when we
had on the mall I right at the mall
she's always been incredibly supportive
and now is no exception so I am
extremely extremely lucky and fortunate
to have her behind me with the gadget
stuff alright so let's continue what is
your thought on the zoom is it worth
seven hundred dollars well I'm going to
be giving a full review of the zoom
coming soon I really want to get a
chance to use it the moral and the short
story is that honeycomb needs some work
it feels very unpolished it offers a lot
of potential functionality with
functionality like just not quite there
yet especially needs some more app
support so more on that coming later I'm
trying to shorten up the answer so I can
some more questions all right what would
you like the iphone 5 to have besides a
revamp to user interface so this is some
of the obvious and watch my rant his
name is josh Josh I want a revamp to
user interface I can honestly take care
i'll keep my leg clean don't care about
hardware all that much if Apple can get
the a5 chip into the iphone 5 awesome
but please redo iOS it has become
extremely stale I won't get into my rant
again uh about it but iOS needs an
update so I I you can say besides that
but it's definitely what I care most
about it's like that old expression um
maybe a bit insensitive but other than
that mrs. Lincoln did you enjoy the show
like the other than that is extremely
big um at least in my mind um alright so
let's go ahead and continue um do you
think by the end of the year there will
be a honeycomb tablet that is 10.1
inches in lighter than the ipad 2 i
think by the end of the year we are
going to have a ridiculous amount of
honeycomb tablet to get the galaxy tab
10.1 but there's going to be Justin
dated with honeycomb probably what's
ever after having come what comes after
honeycomb h i I don't know what it I did
ice cream or jelly bean who knows they
really some updates verum saying I'm a
lot we're not usually doing videos
they're releasing software updates quite
a bit so I would definitely say that
we're going to see a ton of new android
tablets like robot hands plenty of more
times what is your favorite ice cream
ice cream ice cream flavor from
PlayStation now uh when I go to an elite
my ice cream but I do the frozen yogurt
so when I go to one of the frogurt
frogurt frozen yogurt I'm like I'm
washed out today one of the frozen
yogurt places i will go with pistachio
sometimes some chocolate thrown in there
there's a cheesecake flavor which is
awesome so those are probably some of my
favorites neck
this is from Jonathan Ramirez just
spotted atrix think atrix takes full
advantage of the dual core processor why
and why not and this is actually sort of
similar to what i think about the zoom
awesome awesome hardware the software is
not yet taking full advantage of it I
think that's very true with the atrix as
well so I think we will definitely see
the next version even if that
gingerbread take better advantage of the
ridiculously awesome sauce hardware on
the motorola atrix i will answer one
more with the risk of this getting to be
an odyssey long video what are your
thoughts on the blackberry playbook
playbook vs ipad 2 vs motorola xoom that
is one we will most definitely do the
only time i had some hands-on with the
playbook was at CES actually I came away
very impressed with it it's a great way
to view contents and beautiful screen
the operating system worked well and a
little bit of smaller side is really
going to appeal to a lot of people and
speaking of all these tablets they are
also awesome ways to get some netflix
