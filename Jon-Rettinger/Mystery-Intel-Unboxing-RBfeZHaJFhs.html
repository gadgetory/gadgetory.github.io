TechnoBuffalo here and I've gotten
embossing something I really have no
idea what it is it's this weird blue
looking halo style tower let's go and
see what's inside so a couple days ago a
few things showed up at the office we
had this Asus x99 motherboard showed up
and then inside of this box was 16 gigs
of crucial Ram so I assume it's got
something to do with PC parts also on
the side of this it says Intel so that's
really all I know I know this is gonna
be like a tower or what's gonna happen
but I know it needs power yeah so I mean
look at this thing it's super cool look
and kinda like keep it as a prop let's
plug it in and see what happens and
there very few unboxings that I get an
audience for but much everybody here in
the office is watching to see what's
gonna happen so let's plug this sucker
in I'm gonna stand up and there's a
reset button on the back oh it's doing
something it just beeped it's there are
definitely lights going on the bottom of
it kind of I supposed to turn it
definitely make a noise don't leave a
second see something happens it's
getting louder that's it like it's
ticking
if they turn it alright just matched up
the two red arrows and now it's beeping
at me whoa just lit up around the sides
I feel like I should call in the bomb
squad or something whoa oh oh that's
awesome
I feel like Nedry from Jurassic Park
there's gonna be like a little baby
Raptor frozen in there we've done a lot
of unboxings but never anything like
this
that is awesome
what is it
dhanno DNA that's how dense ours are
made I think the show's over do we have
oh I don't want to break it come on do
that again we have Intel look inside so
take a look at that and then sew velcro
in there Intel solid state drive 730
series 240 gigabytes and I think that's
it I don't I can push this back down and
now there's a reset button ah didn't do
its thing all right I'm gonna push this
off the side for a quick second oh wait
no it's doing something again all right
that was cool so I guess I was right it
does look to be PC components so we've
got Intel solid state drive 730 we have
been meeting to build a computer at the
office for a while
Brendan Ralph will throw him but I kind
of want to build mine I want to use it
for all the twitch stuff for doing which
is check us out at twitch TV slash
TechnoBuffalo so I guess we can use this
stuff so Intel 730 240 gig SSD let's
take a look at that there it is tiny
little SSD with a pretty awesome skull
on it looks like an SSD the RAM they
sent us again is 16 gigs of DDR 4 it's a
4 4 gig sticks this thing is still mozi
I'm gonna go ahead and plug it so it
doesn't explode on me and then there's
just ridiculous and other boards I'm
have to learn how to build the computer
I guess oh it's funny but we can do that
for a while
alright inside we've got a processor
that's kind of cool
heavy to it is the new haswell-e
processor so we're gonna have a friggin
baller rig it's like going to get would
be what a power supply a fan a video
card and a case and I can build me a
computer I guess an operating system to
is important so this is a really free
and sweet setup
he got sent over and also pretty fast
seven-thirty SSD in this ridiculous
unboxing experience this is gonna make
every other unboxing experience just
pale in comparison a big oh look it's a
phone there
a power supply and a USB cord it's not
gonna be like boom
I gotta power it on and then let it open
up like that cool science project I know
guys I hope you enjoyed it I really had
fun doing this one until next time I'm
