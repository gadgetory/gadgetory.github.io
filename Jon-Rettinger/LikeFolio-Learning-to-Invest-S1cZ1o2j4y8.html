technobuffalo here most videos I'm
unboxing or doing a hands on the latest
gadgets but sometimes I got a special
video where I share some inside secrets
as to what I do to help run
technobuffalo and things that I do
personally this is one of those such
videos I want to show you guys how you
can start investing in the market if you
choose to let's go and get started so I
technobuffalo we have the privilege of
occasionally going on CNBC or fox
business or Bloomberg to talk about
stocks and technologies and things that
we know and I don't have a background in
stocks I've got an MBA but I don't come
from a financial background a lot of
questions I get is how my educator how
am I qualified to go talk about stocks I
do a little bit of investing myself but
only invest in what I know cuz not
honesty I don't have time to research on
other things so I get a lot of questions
on Twitter Facebook asking questions and
people talking about Apple as a company
or Google as a company so I thought I'd
be kind of interesting to share with you
guys a platform that I've used in that I
use and it kind of integrates everything
that we do on a daily basis so it's cold
like folio so essentially what it does
it links up your twitter at your
facebook accounts and it goes through
and tracks all the times you mentioned a
product or a brand so if you and your
buddy you're talking about it's a sim
city for example that's made by
electronic arts a publicly traded
company it'll put that in a graph it for
you you talk about Apple you talk about
Google or talking about the iphone or
the next Nexus 5 how many times that
gets mentioned goes up in a graph
essentially you'll start to see the
products that you talk about are all
publicly traded companies you can see
how they do in the markets so take all
this information put in a chart and i'll
show you how you would have done if you
invested a certain amount of money last
year and we're looking at right now so
it takes all the companies that you know
and talk about and puts it into sort of
a faux portfolio then you can decide for
yourself do you want to invest do not
want invest you finally want to dip a
little toe in the stock market or say
you know what it's not for me but at
least you get the information to decide
what you want to do and i choose to
invest at least we know what what i do
with sucks that i know about sucks that
i trust companies that i know and that i
use and that sort of gives me a little
bit of peace of mind so that's what i do
when i invest you guys wanna check out
link will be down below it's called like
folio i found it to be really helpful if
you guys have been
about dabbling to mark it's a really
cool Tori but if you don't want to
dabble in the market just want to see
what all your friends are talking about
and sort of see what you would do maybe
why I decided you want to start
investing just a really cool tools like
