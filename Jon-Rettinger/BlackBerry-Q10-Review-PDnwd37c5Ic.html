TechnoBuffalo is a full review for you
of the blackberry q10 I was super
excited for this phone it's got a full
QWERTY keyboard and awesome bb10
built-ins go ahead and see if my
enthusiasm is waned or is still there
let's get started let's get started I'm
gonna be getting away I do all my
reviews with a disclaimer I use this bad
boy for nine days straight as my daily
driver I thought that gave me enough
time to use it get to know all the
nuances of the phone and figure out
whether or not it's good bad or just
straight up in between this is not going
to be a full review of bb10 I've covered
that when I did the z10 before so I've
gone through that at length I'll talk
about it a little bit but not a full
review of the OS more of the phone
itself and how the OS works with the
device so no matter what the phone does
or what kind of key text input it's got
if it's not - making phone calls not
gonna be super useful to you I was a bit
concerned because the phone short length
that it wasn't going to pick up my voice
very well those concerns were very
quickly put to rest the phone quality
was awesome it was really really crisp
I've had demonstration before of HD
voice it obviously didn't sound HD but
the quality audio send it really good on
the other end of the call - everyone
said it sounded very solid no white
noise no pops nothing at all no drop
calls during my nine days of day which
is becoming more and more commonplace
now this is an unlocked unit that I did
test on AT&amp;amp;T s network I didn't try it
using t-mobile
so all this just reflective of AT&amp;amp;T but
it did work very well is able to pull in
a pretty strong signal strength as well
so if you live in a fringe area I don't
worry too much
I still remind you the specs this guy in
case you forgot what the q10 is packings
pretty much spec for spec the same as
the z10 of ZK depending on how you want
to pronounce it say for smaller screen
and that bear keyboard so what that
means is we've got a three point one
inch square screen at 720 by 720 with a
328 PPI at the Super AMOLED display
running blackberry 10 it's being powered
by 1.5 gigahertz dual-core chip it's the
Snapdragon variety augmented with 2 gigs
of RAM 16 gigs of internal storage and
of course you can up that via microSD up
to 64
bank cameras it's got one eight
megapixel sensor on the back that can
shoot 1080p on the front it's got a two
megapixel sensor living right there by
the earpiece Wi-Fi it's a standard stuff
802 11 ABG n-n-no AC here
Bluetooth 4.0 it's got 2100 milliamp
power battery on the rest of that stuff
you'd expect it does also have micro
HDMI flat hook it up to a TV alright so
I ran through the specs let's talk about
the phone since that's why you are here
so as I put together my notes this
review I realize most of what I said and
my first impressions were still very
accurate let's begin though with this
glorious keyboard since that's why most
people are gonna pick up the q10 because
they want that physical clickety clack
enos that it provides and the moral here
is I love it I love to keep around the
9900 this one is just as good if not a
little bit better the keys are actually
a little bit larger you don't have sort
of a curve to them totally flat keys two
frets replace awesome I really just
loved typing on this interestingly
though I'm not much faster typing on
this and I am on a virtual keyboard
barely enjoy typing on it more I found
myself typing longer email just to keep
my thumbs moving the feel of that actual
button at least for me was something I
really really enjoyed so when it comes
to the keyboard
I'm not surprisingly blackberry knock
this one out of park they've been doing
these for years and even getting better
and better at each iteration this is
really the creme de la creme physical
keyboard so hats off the blackberry for
that so if you want a phone that's got a
great physical QWERTY keyboard you can
stop watching right now this is the one
to get is absolutely incredible but if
you want a phone that does a lot more
than just a keyboard you're gonna want
to keep watching so that glorious
keyboard I mentioned comes with a little
bit of a setback so BB 10 doesn't have a
physical home button no matter where you
look if you want to go home let's do a
swipe up from the bottom which is great
it works well on the z10 on the q10
though you don't have much of a gesture
area right above the keyboard so when
you want to do your swiping I should
have to start almost at the keyboard and
then swipe back up to get home something
I found a little bit annoying would have
liked to have a tad more space between
the screen and the keyboard it didn't
really affect my accuracy I was able to
hit the home button all the time just
was a minor annoyance as I used the
device all right so next let's talk
about this screen it's a square 720 by
720 you probably think that's enough
pixel to make it look awesome you would
be wrong things just don't look sharp on
the screen this size they don't look
related I just don't pop out other
devices I've tested have now in all
fairness the device I've been using have
all been 1080p screens recently so I
might have a little bit of bias in my
brain that is coming out when I talk
about this
it's a passable screen it is not the
best screen on the market by any stretch
the imagination that size included and
we'll talk about the size of the screen
a little bit later next let's talk about
speed it's pretty quick same speed
pretty much as the z10 apps opened
pretty quickly no issues there at all
was able to play video and everything
nice and quick without really any issues
whatsoever so on every other phone I
test I don't care if there's a physical
buttons on it I don't care if there's a
physical home or end button but for some
reason when I use a BlackBerry device
can I don't have it I really find myself
missing it the dialer here is an app
that's got a launch to fire up and then
you can dial like that on every other
phone but I can't figure out why for
some reason I wish this had a physical
send and end button on it which is so
weird to say in this modern age I wish
we had more buttons but for some reason
on the blackberry I really just hope
that it was there go try the q10 the
store and see if you feel the same way
it's might be something that's unique to
me but from a personal standpoint I
really would have liked you've had a
standard end button if I want to pick up
a call to just do that that having to go
to different messages or dial pad having
to go to different screens and I know
iOS and Android don't have those either
so it's your rationale I get it but I
still wish they were there next a
megapixel camera is not much to say I
hear it's fine it takes average pictures
you're not going to blow them up put on
your wall and sign um Ansel Adams if you
want to take camera phone pictures gonna
be fine
it's average enough talking next about
blackberry app world it's still not
super awesome there are some apps there
but not a ton sideloading apps on there
super easy can do it through a Chrome
extension actually put an article up on
TechnoBuffalo telling you how to do it
but so if you want a side load they're
there but things don't always work
Instagram for example isn't in
blackberry zapper but you can side load
it but an older version of Instagram and
you have to do some weird login through
Facebook to reset your password stuff to
get it work and you're not gonna have
the video options that it's a grab now
offer so double-edged sword there you
can get more apps than always work
hundred-percent and always updated but
they are still there so my advice let's
figure out what apps you use the most
and see if you can get them either side
loaded or on BlackBerry App World the
big glaring one that wasn't in
BlackBerry app word at least for me is
in
Grahame whatsapp there is now so there's
still a lot of good stuff coming and
hopefully more I will be there over
their coming weeks and months next let's
talk about battery it's actually one of
the biggest batteries BlackBerry's ever
put on one of their phones a twenty one
hundred million power farad it work
great it's able to get through a full
day no problem at all off the charger at
seven thirty two emails being checked
pretty consistently hour so a phone
calls text messaging some angry birds
being played on here connected to Wi-Fi
most today at the home of the office
able to plug it in but looked like about
thirty percent battery life left so no
problem getting through one day two days
you're gonna want to plug it in but my
big test if I get through one day
without worry and that's good enough for
me and this phone is definitely able to
do it next let's talk about build
quality this phone feels awesome
blackberry again not just one out of the
park sort of that soft touch esque feel
of the weaved glass on the black model
feels really nice the phone's got just
enough weight to feel premium but not
heavy they really killed this one I
they've done a great job with build
quality on the high-end devices and this
one really really nails it I would have
liked perhaps some metal accents for
long the style like we had on the bold
9900 but sure of that aside this is a
really good feeling phone so some other
small gripes and pros I would have liked
to Bob viously had more than four apps
show on the screen at one time least
known for tasking apps but that's the
limitation just the screen size you
could scroll through and get more
beliefs before you can see we're be nice
to be able to see maybe six on there the
screen also felt a little too small to
me I would have liked perhaps a 3.5 inch
screen that wasn't square that still
have that same QWERTY keyboard but it's
certainly passable reading emails how to
do a lot of scrolling through but you
know again if you want something that's
got that smaller screen size in a small
package it's still a good way to go so I
think the more with the q10 more than
any other phone is you already know
before you watch this video if this
phones for you if you want a physical
QWERTY keyboard then yes by all means
pick this device up it feels awesome is
going to perform well I'd go to get to
the day with battery life you finally
have a real browser on the BlackBerry
device but if you're sort of in the I
don't know if I want a QWERTY keyboard I
don't know if I don't I'm going to
advise you to not get the q10 if you're
not sure what camp you're in their
amount of applications that are come out
that are great for soft keyboards I was
really really jazzed about using this
device after I use their mine
days I kind of felt myself wanting to go
back to my HTC one not because I didn't
like the keyboard because there was
other things I wanted to do other than
type and if you find yourself that all
you want to do is a phone for work that
you want to email with or text and this
is a really great choice if you do a lot
of other things you might want to look
at the z10 if you want to stay in
BlackBerry's ecosystem so overall this
film gets a very solid 7.5 on the
TechnoBuffalo scale it's very
serviceable it works well probably serve
you well for the next two years but if
you want something that can do a little
bit more can offer bigger screen size
higher resolution you might be best
looking elsewhere thank you guys for
watching I hope you enjoyed
do you agree disagree I'd love to hear
