to you by atlassian
do you disappoint you we'll figure it a
dark brooding movie like Batman vs
Superman deserved a dark brooding movie
review except I'm not a movie critic I'm
just a normal dude with the opportunity
to go to press screening to see Batman
vs Superman early so I wanted to share
my thoughts and opinions with you but
we're gonna do it in a bit of a
different way I'm gonna give you five
things to know about Batman vs Superman
spoiler free I'm assuming you've seen
all the trailers those i think i'm going
to talk about well have been in the
trailer if you haven't seen the trailers
either go watch them or wait till you
watch a movie and come back and check
this out but it will be spoiler-free
squad and jump right in with number five
this is a very different type of Batman
this is more Batman from the Arkham
spine of games it's a strong routing
Batman he's got a ton of gadgets and
beyond that Ben Affleck was freaking
awesome in it he was probably the best
part of the movie and I was as skeptical
as everybody else when they cast Ben
Affleck as Batman but dude absolutely
nailed it I would say he's better than
Christian Bale but I would definitely
not say he's worse totally different
takes on my character equally good
really well done number four one of the
final trailers for Batman vs Superman
showed the big batty doomsday it was
kind of all the things we filled that
the trailer but they did my first
thought was man that's it yeah it looks
bad i'm sure they'll get it done the
tiny movie comes out they didn't see Jan
Jim's day looked so bad it was
distracting him from the fight scene
that was happening it looks like it's
eighty percent done so when you get to
that big fight scene just just like do
this and kind of open your hands a
little bit so you can just sort of see
it and it might look real and I guess
there's a big fictional character it's
not real but the textures weren't even
there it was little disappointing number
three gal gadot was absolutely
incredible as Diana Prince and wonder
woman when she came on the screen you
could feel it it made me excited for the
Wonder Woman movie me excited for the
future of what he's doing at the
universe she rocked the hell out of that
role and her counterpart Jesse Eisenberg
as Lex Luthor was a weird Lex Luthor it
was like Martha
birds Lex Luthor it wasn't like the
Kevin Spacey urging a conversion we've
seen in the past it was like it
obviously a younger quirkier more
mentally unstable Lex Luthor I'm not
sure if I'd like to temptation
interpretation of it we're definitely
going to see much more of him in that
role in the coming DC movie so he's
there just be prepared to think he's
about to start a social network number
two the movies called Batman vs Superman
you figure there's a damn good reason
for those two to fight there is a very
flimsy reason that they fight like very
flimsy the only thing that's even
flimsier is how they make up very flimsy
just like come on that's that's how
you're gonna do it okay and number one
there are still big spoilers in the
movie that i did not know going in and i
read a ton of spoilers rumors that were
going into it so there's still some big
things that haven't been revealed so
there are some surprises hopefully that
you guys won't know going in the other
kind of bonus things that could have
mentions like when they show the robin
suit in the trailer with the writing
across that they explain that but
overall I found the movie to be on the
disappointing side if you like Colin
book movies and you like Man of Steel
you'll probably like this the whole
movies pretty much a response to what
happened in Man of Steel then you're
probably enjoy it if you just want to
relax for two and a half hours go see it
the CGI Shepherd doomsday it looks cool
Batman is a reason enough alone to go
see the movie but overall it's just like
a man with meh sauce on a mad burger so
we know what you guys think keep it
spoiler free in the comments the video a
thumbs up you always appreciate it till
next time I am John render TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you guys next video I'm
menacing exit if you work with people
