the original one plus one was an
incredible device packed to the gills
with power for a really affordable price
the one plus two though was a bit of a
disappointment it was a step back
missing key features like NFC but
hopefully they have righted the ship I
would like you to meet the 1 plus 3 1
plus sticking with the tried and true
model of cramming and some of the latest
specs for a really good price before I
talk about this beautiful looking phone
let me tell you the things I think you
need to know from the get-go no invites
they're gone don't worry about it let's
talk a little bit about the phone itself
it's pretty thin it's got a
familiar-looking all metal unibody
design it's got a pretty nice-looking
5.5 inch optic AMOLED display the screen
is 1080 but we're told that was to
extend the battery life the bezel on the
screen is also really thin at 0.75
millimeters powering this guy is the
latest from Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
oneplus spends a lot of time working on
charging and they likened some
technology from Oppo with technology
they're calling - charge that's gonna
give you over 60% charge in 30 minutes
what makes it unique that's gonna
continue to charge fast even while the
screen is on so either you're streaming
your games or you do GPS in a car 64
gigs of internal storage
it is not expandable but it does have a
dual nano SIM card slot so if you like
to rock dual Sims got that option USBC
is here again and a headphone jack which
is something that seems to be going away
so nice to have it stick around one plus
up to their camera games the main sensor
on the back is a 16 megapixel sensor was
supposedly a lightning fast shutter
speed it's got p-taff for phase
detection autofocus allow you to capture
clear shots and 0.2 seconds we've also
incorporated things like OAS and E is
I'm in the front you a megapixel sensor
with smile capture for supposedly taking
them selfies nice and quick the next one
is a bit surprising to me there's six
gigs of ram here just let that sink in
for a minute we live in a world where
phones have more RAM than my laptop did
like two years ago on the software front
it is running oxygen OS it's based on
android 6.0.1 and the bootloader will be
unlocked out of the box so you don't
like acting OS they made it easy to
throw on a custom ROM those you that are
familiar with oxygen OS it looks closed
stock with a few tweaks you can change
for example the capacitive buttons if
you want to switch the back and
multitasking buttons you can change the
on-screen buttons as well but new they
here at the bottom of the recent apps
screen you have the option to clear all
apps clear all background processes or
manage individual apps you get a lot
more control ordinarily would have oh
this is packed into pretty thin seven
point three five millimeter package
that's completely Carrier unlock give me
available in graphite or soft gold and
making a comeback we're happy to report
is NFC have got no idea why that was
left off the oneplus two other oneplus
staples you've come to expect are here
highlighted by and a slider alert it
looks to be a really nice phone it feels
good in the hand it feels premium the
oneplus I'm hoping is more than the sum
of its pretty awesome parts we don't
know how it's gonna perform out in the
real world so I'm gonna test it I'm
gonna use as my only phone and we'll see
how it stacks up how battery life is how
the dash charging performs how the
camera actually performs in real world
settings but something that you guys
want to see us test let us know down

I'll see you guys in the next video
let's see order two one plus three
you've got it now and you want to build
your own custom oneplus web app and you
want to work with your developers and
maybe I located somewhere else in the
world the folks at Atlassian have you
