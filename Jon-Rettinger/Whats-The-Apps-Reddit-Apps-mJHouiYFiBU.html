brought to you by hostgator and my epic
radio voice oh sorry I I didn't see you
there I was too busy browsing reddit on
my phone and just got distracted I just
Oh am I talking about I put the camera
right here there's a microphone right
here I'm sorry that was a terrible intro
what's going on is John Q here from
TechnoBuffalo and welcome to what's the
app today we're gonna be taking a look
at various reddit applications for iOS
and for those of you who are unfamiliar
with Reddit it's basically a website
where people share images videos stories
and anything that's awesome on the
internet so if intro intro first let's
take a look at the official reddit
application ooh Wow official so
impressed may I take your coat for you
sir it's a bit first let's take a look
at the official reddit application Wow
first let's take a look at the official
reddit application Wow official so
impressed may I take your coat for you
sir I and it's available for first let's
take a look at the official reddit
application ooh
Wow official so impressed may take your
coat for you sir and it's available for
both the iPhone and the iPad and I swear
I had to pay for this a long time ago I
swear it costs money but now it's free
so see ya man the app is really simple
and quite functional after you login all
of your subreddits are synced and you
can start browsing right away by the way
this is pretty much C core of Reddit
wasting hours browsing through super
awesome random content I mean check out
this picture of Shaq standing next to
his girlfriend epic right at the top are
the traditional reddit filters hot new
top and controversial something that's
missing from the listing that is also
quite important to Reddit are the good
ol up-and-down vote arrows you gotta tap
an item before you can see the arrows
not a big deal but I thought I'd mention
it I'm also not a big fan of how I read
a chairs content via email I mean look
at all this unnecessary stuff right here
I read it also utilizes the old-school
refresh button versus a more modern
pulled down to refresh method like
Twitter I know I know it's another
personal thing but after getting used to
so many applications implementing that
pulled down to refresh thing where it
just pulls down and it makes a noise of
Wow so satisfying it just feels a little
bit inefficient when it's not there I
bet it does load more content when you
reach the bottom
aka infinite scrolling which I do like
very much another plus is that you can
edit to add and remove sub reddits
really easily but the application lacks
the ability to actually submit a reddit
post which is odd on a final note before
we move on to the next application I
gotta mention the serendipity mode
sounds no idea what that means by the
way it's a collection of random sounds I
have no idea how they're activated but
there's one time I was browsing through
I read it and my phone vibrated and this
cow sound came screaming out minutes
scared the crap out of me
so I read it three out of five next
reddit pics as far as feature goes this
application barely has any you can't
submit links you can't vote up and down
all you can really do is browse through
pictures but I like that because that's
all I really do unread it so it's
totally cool with me man totally fine
and look at that pulled down to refresh
like I read it there are filters at the
top just tap on a picture and we're off
see this is all there is to it seriously
if this is your thing you can do this
for hours and I have almost I think
can't remember I was too distracted by
giant monster halibut look at him go in
addition to email sharing you can share
stuff through Twitter and Facebook as
well which is a plus but like I read it
when you share stuff via email it
includes all this weird random useless
stuff but it doesn't bet the picture
within the email so I guess it's not
that bad a pretty big downside if Reta
pics is that gif images don't animate
which is kind of weird considering that
this is an image dedicated application
the app is free but there's a pro
version that you can get for $4 that
removes ads allows you to add sub
reddits and a couple of other things
personally I'm cool with a free version
as our pics is all I need
although the stupid pop-up things are
really really annoying reddit picks four
out of five and speaking of pictures I'm
gonna take some time to give a shout out
to our friends at Hostgator Hostgator

the coupon code TechnoBuffalo at the
checkout wow that was super fun back to
Reddit the final application we're gonna
be taking a look at is something I've
been using for a really really long time
alien blue you know what it's free now I
had to pay two dollars for the iPhone
version and five bucks for the iPad
version totally worth it though as this
app is so awesome in short this is how
red it should be a breakdown of your
saved liked and submitted content cute
thumbnails of each subreddit quick
access to your inbox which I never use
full screen mode and Wow you can even
submit a link if you want to you can't
really upload a photo or anything but
you know at least the options there and
even have this nifty photo gallery mode
which is great for browsing through
pictures and check this out if you like
the thing you can just upload right
there and speaking of voting the arrows
are available right too in the listing
and the best part of this is at least in
my opinion is sharing via email it's
just a link in a title plain simple
wonderful and delicious there are loads
of other things you can do to customize
your experience such as text size a
night theme tilt scrolling and loads
more unfortunately there is no infinite
scroll feature like I read it but hey at
least it's got that pull down to refresh
thing alien blue 4.5 out of 5 well I
hope you guys enjoyed this review for
you redditors out there with iOS devices
have fun getting or ask me anything
today I learned in Pixar even few on
with these reddit applications and for
those of you who have never been to the
site before check it out seriously it's
really really good but I must warn you
okay it's really addicting it's like
really really addicting is I have
problems okay because I go to I go on
that site too much anyways this was John
Q from TechnoBuffalo thank you very much
for checking out what C apps and I'll
see you guys next time
