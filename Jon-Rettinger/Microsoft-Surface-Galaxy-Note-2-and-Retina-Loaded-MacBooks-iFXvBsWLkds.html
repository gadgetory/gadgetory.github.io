to you by Jackthreads welcome to him
around up my say needs me i'm jon
rettinger dent i'm here on the city
needs every day i'm shuffling shuffling
shuffling shuffling let's go ahead and
start with one of the hottest tech
products coming soon Microsoft newly
announced surface tablets we were there
at the event had a chance to get some
hands-on time with them very limited
hands-on time Microsoft was extremely
tight-lipped about what the specs were
going to be other than that there might
be an i5 thrown in there so two
different tablets there's the windows RT
version the windows pro version if
you're one of the differences
technobuffalo calm we have full article
explaining them but slice to say the pro
is gonna be a little higher SPECT how
Microsoft did not say when the pro
version was going to be coming instead a
few months after windows 8 launch which
is pegged for october november ish what
they especially didn't say what the
price of the tablets are going to be
everybody saying these look tremendous
they might be an ipad killer they might
not be an ipad killer i may not even
compete with the ipad at all but the
pricing is really a big issue of concern
so i said the windows RT version will
compete price-wise with tablets pro
version though it was worth things that
might get a little bit dicey it's not a
tablet with a dumb down operating system
this is a fully functional Windows 8
computer I think it's gonna be priced
accordingly with competitive windows 8
computers especially ultrabooks sir I
think the microsoft surface pro dish is
really going to be targeting so if
you're waiting for the pro version you
can be able to pick one up for 699 I
think are going to be sorely mistaken
we're going to be looking at prices
upwards of a thousand dollars for that
we also don't know how much RAM is going
to be in there how cute bullets really
going to be rumors seem to be of the
2gig number so hopefully that'll hold
true two gigs hundred twenty eight gigs
of storage and we should have a pretty
powerful computer that can do most
things you guys want to do and while we
are on the tablet topic let's talk about
Google's mythical Nexus tablet which we
may see announced at Google i/o coming
up quite soon we exclusively reported
that the 7-inch tablet was going to be
built by asus going to be rocketing
videos Tegra 3 or variant of
and was going to be priced below two
hundred dollars it seems like all those
are coming to fruition in fact we're
hearing rumors that this tablet is
already shipping with availability
supposed to be late next week or late
this week depending on when you watch it
one thing we don't know yet that was
what's operates them is going to have
we're hearing rumors that it may
actually ship with a pre-production
version of jelly bean mineral operating
system hopefully going to be announced
at Google i/o but still is yet to be
seen although I will say a quad-core
tablet although it might be Wi-Fi only
for less than two hundred dollars really
is a killer price point different
represents an impulse buy and I think
it's going to take a huge market share
away from other tablets you know I pad
and some of the other issues products in
particular one of my favorite phones of
last year and this year was the Galaxy
Note one I was there at its debut at IFA
in 2011 one of my favorite phones I used
as my daily driver I loved it's gorgeous
5.3 inch screen it was just an awesome
phablet to use I like the larger screen
than Epicure tablet with me it was just
overall a big tablet Ingham and it looks
like its sequel is going to be quickly
coming turnovers really fast in cell
phone worlds the appropriately named
Galaxy Note 2 might make its debut at
IFA 2012 where the original Galaxy Note
also made its debut supposedly preparing
for an October release this guy is
rumored to have perhaps even bigger
screen than the 5.3 inch found in the
original but the screen might also pick
your something new flexible display
which opposes going to make it as close
to unbreakable as possible but I'm sure
that'll be put to the test rumors have
it that it's going to be rocking the
quad-core Exynos processor with
hopefully LTE support fingers fingers
crossed for that LTE support and will
ship with jellybean completely bypassing
Ice Cream Sandwich the US versions still
don't even have yet officially alright

apparel going on now Jerry's report for
us and look good while doing it now back
to the show the last rumor has to do
with Apple it's hard to go a show about
talking about a new Apple product I am
in love with a 15 inch Retina Display
MacBook Pro I've been using it like
crazy battery life has been incredible
with screen is gorgeous but when the
knocks on it for some people that is
just too big to carry around well worry
not it looks like a 13 inch version is
going to be making its way in October
perhaps at the same conference where the
iphone 5 makes its debut so if you've
been sort of eyeing up that 15 inch but
you want a smaller size or perhaps you
want to save a few bucks their teenage
might be perfect just have to wait until
October October shaping out to be a
pretty big month with the new 13-inch
MacBook Pro is supposedly coming any
galaxy notes to perhaps on its way what
are you guys was excited about love to
