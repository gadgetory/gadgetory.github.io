world that seems to go at hyperspeed the
s8 is almost a year olds and the s9 is
coming in about four to six weeks I
thought it'd be fun to do a final
revisited a last look if you will at all
the things the s8 brought to the table
and sort of the newness that it was and
the climate that it came into the
smartphone world Samsung was right off
the note seven debacle these things need
it to be a hit now while it is the end
of the product life for the s8 it's not
necessarily the end of when you should
buy it
they're gonna be crazy deals and then go
on on the s9 comes up and the s9 looks
to be sort of an S version type upgrade
sort of fix some small quibbles and
small complaints with the almost perfect
s8 and s8 plus and for the sake of this
revisited I'm mostly just gonna say SE
the phones are pretty much identical
save for screen size and a little bit
different size in battery
so first the s8 got rid of the edge
version of phones we saw with the s7 it
was just the s8 and they brought in
beautifully marketed term infinity
display the Samsung displays are
absolutely incredible and they did a
gorgeous job this time around a big
knock I had a previous stance in this
blazing they look great when you were
indoors soon as you stepped outside in
direct sunlight they got completely
washed out and almost invisible Samsung
fixed that in this time around the
display gets incredibly bright don't buy
into the marketing hype of how many nits
brightness it is that's really just how
bright one single pixel can get with
some real user standpoint you can use
this phone and outdoors these are
obviously the best screens that Sam's
like had made before the note came out
they're pretty much identical but the
infinity displayed while looking nice
it's still been far from perfect in my
use often times I was activating the
edge panels by accident that was
relatively annoying to have cervan to
turn them off so I would accidentally
activate them it also makes the phone a
little bit on the fragile science and
the screen curves around and the front
and back are completely coated in glass
in fact as we documented on video I
cracked my si+ pretty badly and I was
sitting down
and it fell on a nun carpeted floor so I
don't like two and a half feet ish it
fell and it would be shattered the
screen so it was definitely more fragile
than those people like that fragility
also goes through on the back in fact I
used my si plus in the office without a
case as I mentioned in without and you
skin on the back and you can see what
the back looks like you look totally
gross and disgusting so if you pick up
and current-gen samsung phone whether
it's the note the s8 sa flushed even the
x9 when it comes out recommend putting a
d-branes get on that to keep the
scratches down and also give it some
protection I'll link to it down below in
case you want to check those out also
mark the first time the Samsung got rid
of their capacitive buttons and opting
for on-screen buttons for navigation I
love that change I also love that you
can customize it a little bit whether or
not you want the backup on the left or
the right give you more flexibility
though you had all sort of those buttons
that were always in the same area so
rounding out the awesomeness that the s8
was the cameras were absolute incredible
this was before the pixel 2 and before
the iPhone tens these were the camera
kings they were absolutely incredible
obviously making do with single sensors
they did incredible job with portrait
modes by that I just mean blurring the
background
they brought a ton of effects the
pictures look gorgeous and almost any
setting I'll be get a little bit
saturated but I tend to prefer it and
they give you a lot of granular setting
if you want to get in and tweak those
these cameras were beyond awesome in the
video side the video also looked great
the microphone could use a little bit of
improvement I think that's the case with
almost all smartphones but really good
I think salmon did a really good job
with biometrics obviously there was some
sort of face ID type technology when
this phone came out but they're gonna
see is absolutely incredible
you've got iris game you've got kind of
a rudimentary face a lot you've got pin
or passcode you've got options and
different layers of course the
fingerprint sensor on the back as well I
liked that there were options that you
could pick and choose from but coming to
the things that I didn't
so speaking of biometrics the
fingerprint reader on the back I've
talked about this ad nauseam I'm not
gonna sort of harp on it I hated the
location of mere presence or maybe you
guys or other issues that it wouldn't
bother you with caisson for me I did not
like the location in fact I never didn't
use a finger praetor because of that
another thing I didn't like was the
single downward facing speaker off to
found myself covering it with us playing
games listen back to two movies or just
watching content it's really annoying
sort of location of it you're watching
something like this you're playing a
driving game you gotta make sure you're
moving your finger all around and I
should mention both of those things but
to be improved when the s9 finally hits
and of course rounding out the other
stuff I didn't really like even used
Bixby in that that big speed buttons
it's a goodbye to the essay in the essay
plus it's an incredible phone and if you
have one it'll probably be good to even
skip the s9 and wait until the s 10 hits
but it's got great battery life the
screen is incredible the cameras great
on it have that fast charging it's USBC
everything about these phones I've
absolutely loved I don't want some sort
of pour one out for the s8 as sort of it
gets overshadowed very soon by the s9
did you pick up an SI you guys upgrade
from an s8 are you waiting for the price
drop last night I had to pick one of
these suckers up if you like these final
revisit and let us know I'm gonna do a
thumbs up and of course subscribe and
next to it little bell hit that so you
get notified when new videos are coming
we have a ton of awesome things coming
up including some flagship vs. and some
pretty cool car stuff I should be
hitting your sub box soon so next time
