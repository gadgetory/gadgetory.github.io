Hazleton from technobuffalo I'm here
checking out the brand new experience e3
tablet compact and it compact it is look
how small it is 10 it's got Snapdragon
801 processor you're looking at an
8-inch 1920 x 1200 pixel display a 2.4
gigahertz snapdragon 801 processor under
the hood three gigs of ram 16gb of
storage android 4.4 kitkat an APEC
megapixel camera on the back of course
with the front-facing one there but
really what I want to drive home is just
didn't like this is it's awesome it's
it's it's incredible how light it is you
have to really touch the feel and then
of course it also has a new feature that
allows you to play your PlayStation
games right on it using the PlayStation
app right there unfortunate I can't open
it let's try
and open it with one hand here there you
go well he'll get through the License
Agreement put it allow you to play your
PlayStation games with a controller or
wirelessly which is pretty sweet other
features here you're going around it
you've got nothing on top you've got
that nice metallic order a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the right
hand side power button volume control
keys not much on the bottom and then on
the left there that little docking area
an area for the micro SD card slot if
you want to expand the available storage
this is also IP 56 and 68 rated so that
means it's resistant against water as
you can see there in the background and
then more resistant against dust as well
so pretty awesome tablet right here from
Sony it's against the Xperia z3 tablet
compact this is Todd Hazleton from
