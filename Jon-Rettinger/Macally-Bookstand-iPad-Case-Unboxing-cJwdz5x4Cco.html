technobuffalo a case for the ipad is
absolutely necessary you've probably
seen videos of people dropping this on
pavement or dropping this even on a hard
floor surface inside of a house and the
results are not good the screen cracks
the corners get completely destroyed and
the back also gets scratched very very
easily so you must get a case if you
have an ipad now you have a few options
you have a lot of options you can get
the official apple case which is thirty
nine dollars and if you've seen it you
know that it's kind of made out of this
rubbery material it provides a great
level of protection you can fold it in a
few different ways to have different
viewing angles to prop it up on the
table but I wanted something different I
wanted something a little bit more
minimal and a little bit more less
rubbery something softer perhaps so
there's a company out there called
mccalley it's at mccallie kaam ma SI al
ly and i was looking around for an ipad
case i came across the website this
product hasn't been out there yet i'm
probably among the first to get it and
so there haven't been any reviews so
this case could very well suck or it
could be actually very good it's ten
dollars more than the standard ipad case
that you can get from Apple but it has a
more minimal design and it looks to have
the same level of protection and it can
also be folded in several different ways
to get those cool viewing angles so I
have no idea what to expect here it may
be awesome it may not be awesome let's
get to the unboxing and see what this
case is like open it here with my HTC
pen
alright and let's see microfiber cover
and stand so it looks like suede but
obviously that would be too expensive so
they make it out of microfiber which is
a nice texture if you've ever sat on a
microfiber couch or have used any
microfiber accessories so take a look
you can bend it to fold it up like this
or for a more flat viewing angle if
you're eating lunch or you want to type
on it so pretty cool kind of like the
apple ipad case custom fit for for the
ipad lightweight durable okay well i
want to know how it fits and how well it
protects so let me find a way to open
this okay here it is and i'll post a
link on TechnoBuffalo on exactly how to
get this okay so first impression very
soft I like the material let me give it
a smell test yeah it's definitely it's
definitely microfiber kind of smells
like chemicals so you know it's not
actually something real it looks okay
it's 50 bucks you're not going to get
something super amazing if you want
something super expensive you'll get a
baja case which is made out of handmade
handmade leather so let's see what this
looks like and how you put in the iPad
it looks like they make it very clear to
you hey anyone want an ipad we've got a
so it should snap in basically and I'm a
little concerned about how well this is
going to hold but maybe I'll be
surprised so pop it in pop it in okay it
snaps in very securely so securely that
I'm actually going to do this I'm
holding it by the case and it's not
coming out I really like that so here's
the difference between this case and the
eye of the ipad case you get from Apple
you don't get this sort of coverage here
and it snaps and vertically rather than
going
from the side okay so after a few
minutes of fumbling around I've figured
out how to use it so it latches on the
back which is a little bit annoying and
I'm a little bit concerned about how
long this will actually last because
it's using just the leather on leather
contact to hold it in place never
nevertheless the ports are all showing
without any obstruction you open it up
this way and this is how you get it to
sort of prop up okay so you take this
and you slide it in here you push up
like so and then you have two
configurations you have standing up like
so and i'll turn it on or you can do
sort of the keyboard style like so so
pretty cool I'm going to do a one week
update on this to tell you if this is a
good case or not my first impression is
that I like that it's different than
what you get from Apple everyone seems
to have the same ipad case but then
again it's not as high-quality as I was
hoping it's only fifty dollars but still
that's a lot of money for a case have to
use it for a few days and give you the
full opinion so that's the macaulay case
for the ipad it's called the books 10
put a link on TechnoBuffalo on how to
get it that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
