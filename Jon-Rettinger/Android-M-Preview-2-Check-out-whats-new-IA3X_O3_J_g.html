to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a mark in Sangin from TechnoBuffalo
and in today's video we'll be taking a
look at the latest developer preview for
Android M we've been playing with a new
developer preview since last week so
let's go ahead and see what's new one
the new app drawer is no longer broken
up by letters which was introduced in a
previous Developer Preview however it's
still in a vertical list and it now has
a fast scroll bar to quickly navigate
through your apps the widget picker also
received the same treatment and now
features the same fast scroll bar as the
app drawer the other big change to
Google's own launcher is inside a
launcher settings you now have an option
to rotate your launcher to use your
phone in landscape mode which some Nexus
6 users may find very useful in the
second developer preview for Android and
we found out that you can now enable or
disable icons in a status bar by heading
over to this system UI tuner for example
if the only thing you want on your
status bar is your battery clock and
alarm you'll be able to choose just
those icons who would have ever thought
that this feature would finally come to
bare bone stock Android another addition
to the second Developer Preview is the
ability to display your batteries
remaining percentage inside the battery
bar it's very very handy and something
that I truly loved one thing we
immediately notice inside the Settings
app is that the dark mode which we first
showed you in the first developer
preview is now gone that was actually
one thing that got me excited in the
first developer preview but hopefully
it's not gone forever this is just a
second Developer Preview so let's see if
that option will make a comeback moving
on the dedicated memory section of the
settings menu has been given a notable
redesign in version 2 the biggest change
here is a new overview screen that now
shows a total memory in either megabytes
or gigabytes instead of breaking it down
to specific apps the individual app view
is still present in this version and
it's been tweaked as well showing full
readouts and megabytes so you know which
app is eating most of your RAM and
previous versions of Android when taking
a screenshot you were only able to share
that image in nothing more and this
version of Android M however you now
have the option to delete that
screenshot right away which can be very
handy in my opinion let me stop the
video real fast and thank our friends
