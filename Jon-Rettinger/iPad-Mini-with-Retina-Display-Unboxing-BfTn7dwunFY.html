TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest mini tablet from Apple it is the
iPad Mini now all dolled up with Retina
display let's go ahead take a first look
so here's the box for the new iPad Mini
with Retina display oh I'm just gonna
call it iPad Mini because with Retina
displays two-minute words looks very
familiar almost the same box as the
outgoing Mini in fact on the side it
just says iPad Mini only spot you'll
find with the Retina display is actually
down here what I'll say with Retina
display we've got the 16 gig model here
in space grey or silver rather it's also
available in space grey but I can go up
to 128 gigs pricing is gonna range from
399 - all the way up to 830 and I'm
bringing in for special unboxing a
special old friend the obligatory big
oil unboxing knife so go ahead and cut
the plastic hopefully not slice any
fingers in the process this is available
today shipping from Apple is about one
to three days as of filming for the
lower capacity Wi-Fi model is about five
to ten days for the higher capacity
Wi-Fi models or any ones with LTE so go
ahead and slide this off I use my iPad
Mini quite a bit and I always thought it
was lacking the Retina display so I'm
really excited to take a look at this
guy and here is the tablet and it feels
almost identical to the way the outgoing
then you felt and push it off the side
for a quick second I bet we've got a
very familiar friends in here we've got
your wall work designed by Apple in
California see what's in there just for
fun iPad Mini info and some stickers in
the back and then just your lightning
cable and that is it push all that off
to the side let's take a look at our
friend here is the iPad Mini with a
Retina display I will pull this off
first quick set and we'll run through
all the specs before I do that why don't
we take a look at what the outgoing iPad
Mini looked like go ahead and pull this
right here and they look almost
identical from the bezel size to the top
size to everything if you hold them all
upside down you really can't tell
difference other than my old ones a
little bit on the scratch side
so from a design standpoint pretty much
identical so let's go ahead and power
the sucker on we'll run through all the
specs so you've got that same at 7.9
inch screen but now it's 2048 by 1536
PPI giving it a PPI of 324 it's really
curious if that looks like on the
smaller screen it's got the a7 chip in
it now in 64-bit architecture and the m7
motion coprocessor so essentially
spectra spec the same as the iPhone 5s
and the iPad air although it is that 1.1
a gigahertz slower clock speed than we
saw with the iPad air I think it's a 1.3
versus 1.4 no external storage option
but again even Galli up to 128 starting
at 16 5 megapixel camera on the back
I've got a FaceTime HD camera living
right there 802 11 a B G and n well
oddly AC is missing same through gripes
I had with the air and no touch ID here
Bluetooth 4.0 as well and it weighs 331
and grams let me go ahead and power it
on go through the whole setup process
we'll come back here in just a minute so
we've got this all booted up and it's a
subtle difference you don't notice it as
big as I thought I did from the iPad 2
to the iPad 3 things look a little bit
crisper but on a scroll smaller screen
it's not as sort of noticeable as it was
with that larger generation but let me
bring in the older iPad Mini and let's
compare at least some text we've got
TechnoBuffalo queued up on each the
brightness is set to the same on both as
you can see what text looks like and it
does look definitely crisper on the iPad
Mini with Retina display so you'll see a
big difference so when we're playing
games or watching videos probably where
the whren display is really going to
shine but at least side by side you can
see what they look like we'll pull this
one off to the side here for just a
quick second for design comparison
purposes let me bring in an iPad air and
the air looks like a bigger iPad Mini
now which I really like the design of
the mini so I think Apple is smart
to do the same thing with the air and if
you stack them you can see the thickness
of each they're both are really thin
very very light tablets in their own
regard so we'll do a full review of the
iPad means Retina Display run it through
all its tests full paces or anything I
don't you guys know if it's worth your
tablet dollar anything you guys want to
see particularly though leave it in the
comments
down below I won't be sure to show you
until next time I'm John Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you guys the
next video
