TechnoBuffalo here the March 14th
unveiling date for the Samsung Galaxy s4
is rumor no more invitations have gone
out to Samsung's unpacked event of
course TechnoBuffalo will be there but
as you get closer to the official date I
thought we'd run through everything you
can expect from the Galaxy s4
let's get started so let's go ahead and
start what you're gonna look at all the
time the display nearly every single
report out there has pegged it at a four
point nine nine inch display with full
1080p action so you have a chance to
take a look at the Droid DNA you've been
looking longingly at the HTC One you are
going to be all set Samsung's really
never disappointed in the display
department so we're expecting a
top-notch screen on this phone 1080p
looks beyond awesome on a vice certainly
it's a battery hog hopefully Samsung's
gonna have us covered with that but
expect a 1080p so I just mentioned
battery what other thing you could
expect to keep your phone juiced is
wireless charging
we're expecting Samsung to provide
support for wireless charging built
right into the galaxy s4 it's likely
going to be based on the Qi technology
which is weirdly spelled Qi the same
that's offer in the lochia nokia lumia
920 and other handsets with wireless
charging support although it's not
really confirmed at this point the good
news though you'd be able to drop your
smart phone right onto a pad and charge
it and pick it up and carry it on with
you also means be able to pick up Chi's
standard chargers so if you can pick one
up for the Lumia 920 or the Nexus 4 for
example that'll work for you anything
that standardized go ahead throw it on
and get your charge on all right so it's
gonna give the galaxy s4 its oomph its
speed its overall smoothness at least a
quad-core processor and I say at least
for a reason they've been varying
reports on what processor Samsung's
going to use in the Galaxy s4
we think it's certainly possible that a
global version of launch the company is
eight core Exynos octopus ounds cool to
say although we wouldn't be surprised to
see a quad-core Snapdragon version with
LTE launched in the US simply because US
carrier sent this way towards Qualcomm
chips in general those are still is one
of the biggest mysteries which really
won't know and
launch we're hoping to see an 8-quart
ship so you can see how Exynos octa-core
petition first being able to say eight
cores and a freaking bone is incredible
so probably again it'll be an
international version us should just
come with a Snapdragon quad-core which
should be plenty snappy
alright let's talk about carrier wide
availability this is obviously really
important to note samsung has been
really successful in getting its
handsets I made a large number of
carriers and launched the Galaxy s2 on
Verizon AT&amp;amp;T Sprint and t-mobile then
followed suit with the galaxy s3 on all
the same carriers that's no surprise the
phone sells well get it pretty much
everywhere we think the same is gonna be
true for the Galaxy s4 so no matter what
carrier on freeze in the US you should
be all set now for the bad news
no s-pen the first rumors we heard about
the galaxy s4 suggest that Sanson was
going to include s-pen idents upcoming
device however during briefings with
samsung over the past week we've learned
the company wants to separate its note
products from other devices in its
lineup as such we think the galaxy s4 is
going to launch without s-pen support
and Samsung will continue to use that's
utensil on its Note branded products
only it sounds like a like a fork in
other words you likely only see it on
the next Note phone the Galaxy Note 3
which you should see at IFA towards the
end of 2013 so HTC said they don't want
to get involved in a megapixel war
Samsung is the one that's starting the
megapixel war and they are up in the
battle with a 13 megapixel camera
Samsung will likely bump its camera to
13 megapixel sensor in the galaxy s4
it's totally a different path than what
competitors such as HTC obviously have
taken with their ultra pixel camera so
it's really interesting to see the total
differences between two companies one
because it thinks the quality of the
sensor is more important than the actual
measure of the megapixels itself and the
other megapixels MOH important sampson
cameras have always been pretty decent
they're not the best but they're beyond
not being the worst so they've always
sort of fell on the high side of middle
so see if the galaxy s4 keeps that it
really stepped up Samsung's camera game
all right what about the OS obviously
it's gonna be jellybean I think it's
going to be Android jellybean upgrade
two key lime pie spree obvious though at
this point that any new handset will
launch with jellybean
I don't think Samsung is going to do
anything fancy and be the unveil device
for key lime pie that's gonna go to a
nexus phone company that also has been
pretty grated up creating older devices
to newer versions of Android so we can
expect that with the Galaxy s4 and it
should awful offer Google's new Android
key lime pie operating system at some
point in the future I've been pretty
good about giving updates but always the
quickest about it
so don't keep your fingers crossed
hoping and get it you know a few weeks
after launch
so for RAM and storage I'm expecting two
gigs of RAM and two different models of
16 to 32 gig perhaps even a third a 64
option there as well with the expandable
storage
I think Samsung is gonna probably stick
though primarily with the 16 and 32 gigs
of internal storage though wouldn't be
surprised again 64 gigabyte model
Samsung fans love the ability to remove
the battery and additional storage with
microSD card slot so I imagine the
company won't move too far away from
these options also I think we'll see a
pretty standard now two gigs around
since that's become sort of just the
norm on most high-end Android phones so
you've run through all the specs but
there's still a big question what's the
second gonna look like we have a general
idea of what its gonna look like
thanks to leach case designs but we're
still not entirely sure what the phone's
going to look like officially or what's
gonna be made out of I'm gonna wait your
guess so that Samsung's gonna stick with
there ain't broke don't fix it model and
use plastic since all of its products
currently employ that material obviously
we'd love to see adventure out of the
polycarbonate plastic world and use
something like aluminum or aluminium
depending on where you are as Nokia HTC
have done history does repeat itself
though as much as we love to design a
Galaxy Note in the Galaxy s3 I don't
think we're gonna be disappointed at all
those are pretty good looking phones so
what's the wrap-up here there are a few
wild cards in Samsung likely have up its
leaves I'm betting we'll see an update
the TouchWiz new capabilities for
sharing much like we saw with the galaxy
s3 oh we've been told that Samsung would
like to see tighter integration between
phones and tablets especially through
NFC s hopefully we'll see some sort of
support on that front software services
are becoming increasingly important in
the mobile space I know that Samsung is
well aware of that so we should see some
new updates the TouchWiz perhaps the
less cartoony and resource heavy and
touch was sort of the go-to skin for
Android devices so when you guys moves
excited about for the galaxy s4 what do
you want to see what are you not excited
about is this the phone you've been
waiting two years to get I love to hear
your thoughts on all of it leave your
comments down below if you like this
