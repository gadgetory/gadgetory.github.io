stop take a breath this is not a galaxy
s10 review let me explain I've reviewed
countless Samsung devices over the years
review of Samsung's latest flagship the
galaxy s4 galaxy grand the galaxy s2
skyrocket galaxy mega 6.3 is this thing
is totally mega the tech community for
years was phone battles it was putting
two devices against each other declaring
a winner and listen I'm guilty of that
too but you're not gonna find that
anywhere in this video the galaxy has 10
is by no means a perfect phone but if
you look at all the features put
together the phone is magical
so some companies like to throw that
word around
magic magic magic holds magic but in
this case the Galaxy S 10 deserves it
I think part of the magic of the s10 is
appreciating like again where Samsung
has been like remember the s5 looked
like a bandaid on the back the original
Galaxy S was clearly an iPhone ripoff so
appreciating what Samsung is doing now
from seeing where they've been makes me
sort of appreciate the s10 more if you
look at this phone next to any others it
is so far in a way better than any other
phone display that you've seen it so I
think right like I started to really see
the difference in screen I was watching
it's the spider-verse on it and the
colors looked amazing everything looked
poppy it looked beautiful
and I think probably - I was I was
watching the Lakers against the Clippers
and it didn't help the Lakers play any
better I laughed when Kyle Kuzma shoves
LeBron to play defense but it looked
awesome the crappy play looked amazing
on this display and got me watched
probably lying that I would have posted
in front of my TV the fingerprint
readers gilts underneath the screen
that's awesome today is my grandmother's
89th birthday and my grandfather in a
few days turns 90 I went to their house
to help them set up their wireless
internet which is brands like brand new
to them and I showed them the
fingerprint reader underneath the
display and you should have seen like
just jaws drop and like eyes get huge
that seemed as much magic as me pulling
a rabbit at a hat or making a dragon
suddenly appear inside the room that's
awesome I think that is something where
Samsung saw a problem and they fixed it
I want to give Sam some credit for the
hole punch we've seen it before on other
phones but they carved out a hole into
an OLED screen I admire what they did
here for trying something new but I like
the way this looks I'm not getting extra
screen real estate but on the other side
I'm not noticing the hole punch and I do
notice it it looks different it looks
unique and you need these things that
are different that are trying something
new to get to what's coming next I think
if we can just be honest with each other
so you can put a bender wallpaper up
there Oh
series also I'll let magic cram into the
galaxy x10 is not gonna come cheap and
pour one out for your wallet if you ever
gotta replace it the best way to keep it
safe just put a case on it let me tell
you about the ex Toria defense lux so
the case looks and feels pretty good
it's got a machined metal exterior it
gives you the protection of like those
giant bulky cases without the giant
bulkiness of the case so if you're
stressing that the case is gonna block
the speaker
I got you it's gonna redirect the sound
right out of there from the case it
sound pretty good going right into your
year old so it's military-grade and
they're claiming it's built to survive a
ten-foot drop on concrete
you want to check them out link to them
down below when I say magic obviously
I'm not thinking pull a rabbit out of a
hat I mean I don't have to think about
the technology it just worked for me and
the five cameras in the s10 plus are
awesome so on the back you've got kind
of a normal one you've got a zoom and
you have a really awesome wide-angle and
on the front it's technically two
different camera sensors one is for
depth but also lets you and do some
wide-angle shots as well which is kind
of cool to happen generally honestly for
me when I use phones
I just want stuff that's gonna take good
pictures and not really think about it I
don't usually get too much into the pro
in settings I just go into auto or
portrait and take the shot that I want
what I really liked
with the s10 though was that anybody
could take good pictures I know I talked
about my family a lot but like that's my
use case so I'm taking selfies of
usually like me and my two kids or my
two kids and my wife so they know what I
have the wide angle on the s10 plus I
thought was super nice and they want me
to take a lot more pictures out having
to sort of do like a are motion to get
everybody in super tight let me take
more natural shots and that was I
thought really nice to have and I was
able to share more pictures with my
parents and share them online I think
that's kind of what a phone is about for
me being able to share my experiences I
don't think that the five cameras
themselves was like a magical thing but
I think what seemed like magic to me was
not having to think about which camera
to use I could just frame the shot up
and the software is smart enough to
automatically just to to the wide-angle
or to the zoom that was really cool
that sort of took my thought process out
of it and sort of letting me take
pictures and not focus much on like if
the phone's gonna work for my situation
attention to detail at Samson's put into
the phone this gen rivals Apple's detail
on the flagship iPhones it is incredible
every detail from the button placement
to having a headphone jack there was
thought behind it
they put thought into where everything
was located and any more importantly
into what it does maybe there aren't a
lot of firsts in the Galaxy S 10 but
they brought everything together into
one package and so having the ability to
charge something with something else
be able to use my fingerprint built into
the screen I think it's absolutely
incredible and almost every feature that
I could want in a phone some version of
it is in at the s10 you throw in the
amazing build quality the beautiful
screen the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor
and you've got a package that takes you
to where you want to go when you're
watching a sporting event watching the
Lakers lose you feel like you're really
there crying at Staples and you're
watching into the spider-verse
it feels like you're swinging with Miles
Morales the audio here sounds really
good at a very small speaker so I'm
taking pictures I don't have to like
think about what camera I want to use I
set up the shot take a picture and the
software does the rest everything this
phone packs is awesome in its own right
when you put it all together into one
phone really does start to feel magical
now you got a score in a hurry and then
file again to keep some time in the
clock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
