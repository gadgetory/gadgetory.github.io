TechnoBuffalo here's a full review for
you of the uniquely shaped Motorola
flip-out let's see if this odd design
translates to we're world utility let's
get started if you're interested in
picking up one of these phones be sure
to check out the folks at clove co uk
provide us to this review unit it's
gonna set you back just shy of three
hundred seventy dollars us it'll work on
AT&amp;amp;T 3G network it'll work on most
European 3G networks and Canadian
networks as well so pretty much work
mostly where you are in the world as
long as you have 3G GSM service so I
always start microphone reviews the
review of the phone itself it doesn't
make good phone calls no matter what the
form factor looks like or features it's
not gonna be that useful to you
well the flip-out does indeed make very
good phone calls signal strength is very
strong on it as well ordinarily where I
got three to four bars a signal strength
the AT&amp;amp;T this was pulling in four to
five bars a certain signal strength is
not best gauging using bars but is what
we have in sort of the most obvious
traffic or presentation and this did a
very nice job in my twenty call test I
also experienced no dropped calls so if
you're in a fringe service area chances
I will be able to pull in at least some
sort of network service to be able to
use your phone so we're a call quality
standpoint the flip-out really excels
all right now let's jump into the reason
this guy's called the flip out its
flipped out and designed so you go ahead
and push this from the bottom right out
to the top and you've got access to what
is surprisingly one of the better QWERTY
keyboards on the market the keyboard is
very reminiscent of some of the older
Motorola devices more specifically the
motorola q answer the q9 the q9h and all
the other q devices that came out after
it it's a fantastic keyboard and worked
very well there's a lot of keyboard
throw because either is a bit of
beveling on the edges so you think
thumbs can really tell where the keys
are I didn't like the sort of division
bar down the middle my thumb's often
trying to hit it thinking it was a
keep I did like the full top row of
numbers made them very easy to serve
access and dialed numbers if I didn't
want to use the on-screen keyboard or
using a calculator function just made it
a lot easier and do this sort of
flipping out design you don't have any
issues hitting this top row of keys with
a lot of sliders that's tough to hit
this top row without hitting your thumb
because of this form factor it really
made it nice and easy I didn't like
however this four-way navigation well it
works quite well it's not five-way
meaning you can't select by pushing in
and I can't finding myself and wanting
to do that that's what I'm used to on
most smartphones instead you have to
sort of halt back over to the right side
using this big Enter key if you want to
hit enter something that you're going to
have to get used to in addition to a
very small space bar key after about
four days maybe about three days ish I
was hauling through using the phone
became very easy to type on the sink so
it's gonna take you you know a half a
week to a week to get used to it once
you do you be able to haul out your
texts and emails with relative ease
let's go ahead and close this up and
talk a bit more about the phone so this
guy is running motoblur sitting on top
of Android 2.1 which is quite nice
certainly two points to have been
preferred but two point one is actually
word I expected from a device like this
so looking at it sort of unique screen
you are going to be staring at a screen
that is 2.8 inches the resolution of 320
by 240 and that's really one of the
biggest downfalls of the phone is that
screen resolution a text does not look
crisp at all I'll give an example of
what I'm talking about let's go ahead
and jump on into the browser which by
the way of course is multi-touch here we
have TechnoBuffalo you can't read any of
that text whatsoever you have to zoom in
quite a bit you can get text be readable
even zoomed in right there it's a bit
hard to read you can see it looks
pixelated yeah it's almost go in a bit
more to where it's covering the entire
screen fail to read it and that's really
due to the resolution on the screen I
would have liked a much higher
resolution on this screen from across
there standpoint it's not running the
fastest processor in the world
but it's 600 ish megahertz does haul it
quite nicely so it's not a slow phone it
is really hindered by that low
resolution screen let's go ahead and
jump back this is as I mentioned ruining
one of the newer versions of motoblur
which sort of brings it all your social
networking to Android this one's not as
obtrusive earlier burda motoblur
primarily I don't use most of it but you
have access to a ton of different
widgets that you can sort of use to
customize your captain calendar would
pull in your Facebook MySpace still use
that or what other their social networks
you use and sort of aggregate all of
your content so it's a nice addition to
the phone okay super cool array of
motoblur buttons triggers three you've
got menu buttons home button and a back
button so we talked earlier about the
keyboard that's not the only way to
input text you're on the phone we
actually also have an on-screen keyboard
which surprisingly for a phone this
small was relatively easy to use
it's Motorola skin but it does work on
this a positive display and surprisingly
works well and you can also of course
use the speech-to-text feature of the
phone so overall I found the phone to be
surprisingly impressive this is
certainly not meant to be a powerhouse
phone it's not meant for a mobile
professional this is more of a feature
phone with a smartphone OS if you're a
heavy texture and you want a bit of a
better web browser this is going to be
perfect phone for you if you're looking
for maybe some light emailing be able to
get your emails to come in ask them to
do that much of reading on the screen
you want to serve a small packet just
they're going to be a very good phone
for you if however you are a
professional relies on your phone quite
a bit for reading a lot of email is
working a lot of websites a lot of
multitasking and video viewing this is
not going to be the film that you're
going to want to choose however that's
where the stone is targeted if you were
considering you know some some feature
phone os's
this is going to be a great way
introduce you to the smartphone world
and sort of give you that step-up before
you get to a really full robust
smartphone this is a very good stepping
stone it's got sort of a cute design its
small it doesn't weigh very much three
went one megapixel camera on the back
takes decent picture shouldn't be able
to do that that's customizable you can
change the back color here you could
have white yellow black battery life
you're gonna very easily get through a
full day just phone works pretty well
its biggest hindrance however though as
I mentioned before is they're low
resolution screen but if that's not that
important to you
this phone is going to be a very nice
choice again for those entering or
thinking about entering the smartphone
world so guys I am John R Ettinger and
