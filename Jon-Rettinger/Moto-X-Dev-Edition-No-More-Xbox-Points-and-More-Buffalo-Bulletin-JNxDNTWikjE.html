moto x developer edition no more xbox
points cross party chat for Sony devices
and the Samsung developer conference
it's Buffalo bullets in time
hello fellow earthlings and welcome to
the Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story on the show check
the description for the links or click
on the graphics for each story if you
have annotations available I'm Ashley
sceva here your top stories Apple making
headlines again after various news
outlets discovered iOS 7's Siri update
doesn't care too much for google glass
telling siri ok glass elicits a variety
of pippi responses from apple's head
robot in charge ranging from I think
glass is half empty to stop trying to
strap me to your forehead it doesn't
work obviously apple doesn't think too
highly of Google's newest wearable
technology a semi-related story saying
okay Google now to Siri results in her
screaming and fear and cowering in the
bottom left corner of your iPhone that's
how good Google now is motorola also in
the news recently as a web portal popped
up touting the promised Moto X
developer's edition it's good to see
Motorola keeping their promise regarding
a dev device and this version of the
Moto X will have 32 gigs of storage an
unlockable bootloader and a special look
that includes matte black on the front
and a custom developer edition battery
cover no word yet on pricing or
availability but at the very least we're
pretty happy to see releases of
developer edition phones this year thus
far from multiple OEMs or hoping it will
be similarly priced to those other
definitions in gaming Microsoft killed
off the point system for buying things
on your xbox 360 offering a software
update for the console that changes
points currency to cold hard dollars and
cents lots of gamers have been waiting
for this update and it's pretty easy to
walk through the process and start
shelling out your local currency for
virtual goodies I'm sure you're
wondering what this means for your
existing points and it's pretty shocking
Microsoft's going to be taking them
cashing them out and paying for a lavish
retirement party for Steve Ballmer
shrimp cocktail is not going to pay for
itself guys Sony continues to rack up
bonus points with gamers after we
learned this week the ps4 and
PlayStation Vita would support cross a
platform party chat meaning you can
invite a friend playing assassin's creed
4 black flag on Vita to your party chat
and then talk to them while you're
hacking it up and watch dogs on your ps4
it's a pretty nifty little feature and
one more sure
current Vita owners will appreciate as
they're pretty sparse in number and have
been awfully lonely waiting for more
friends to interact with our grab bag
story today comes from Samsung as they
announced their official developer
conference the event will take place
October 27 through October 29th in San
Francisco and it'll introduce new
development kits for mobile smart TVs
and other hardware that sounds like
something you've been dying to take part
in you can register now for 299 bucks
and we do recommend registering early
considering how popular other developer
conferences have been this year that's
it for the Buffalo bulletin for today if
