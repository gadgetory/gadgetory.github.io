unified system account for nintendo shoe
yoshida's kind words for nintendo and a
great week for new game releases let's
get out of controller hello and welcome
out of control or the weekly
TechnoBuffalo show that covers all your
gaming news reviews demos and new
releases and easy to digest capsule form
I'm your host Ashley sceva it's always a
big week in gaming so let's start out
with the news ah finally the Sony
Playstation 4 launch last Friday too
much fanfare the console selling out of
its launch shipment of 1 million units
in just 24 hours that officially makes
it the biggest console launch in North
American history which is a pretty big
deal but the launch wasn't without its
issues Sony's terms of service was
updated last minute and added some game
license and rights language that needed
some clarification for gamers the
playstation network was up and down most
of friday some gamers reported wonky
HDMI ports and a smaller percentage of
ps4 owners even reported DOA consoles
ouch any hardware launch isn't without
its problems of course but it still
sucks for anybody who got a dead
launched a console especially
considering they might have to wait up
to 60 days to get a replacement from
Sony Oh all part of console launch days
right some great news for Nintendo fans
is last week Nintendo held another
Nintendo Direct event and announced
users will be able to register their
Nintendo network ID is on both the wii u
and the nintendo 3ds that means unified
system accounts and that also means
unified a shop balances so if you had 10
bucks on your wii u balance and 15 bucks
on your 3ds balance your new unified
balance be yes that's right 25 bucks the
handheld update bringing this change is
also coming with me ver so you'll use
the same miiverse profile across devices
as well this update has been a long time
coming for users so it's nice to see
Nintendo finally implement unified
accounts for everyone no word yet on an
exact date for the update to hit your
device's but Nintendo
they're aiming for next month now all
they have to do is make purchases
account bound instead of device bound
and we're all set Nintendo I hope you're
listening Sony and Nintendo in this last
news story and maybe a dash of Xbox as
president of Sony worldwide Shu Yoshida
told IGN that he not only wanted
Nintendo around he wanted them to
succeed why would a direct competitor
say something like that well Yoshida
says he has to we use plays games with
his daughters and Nintendo's family
friendly games kind of make it a great
starting place for new gamers who
Yoshida then hopes will buy a ps4 when
they're ready for more core gaming
experiences he also mentioned he felt
Nintendo's launch message for the Wii U
shouldn't have been at core gamers but
families instead since that's what made
the original Wii so popular but he also
admits he believes Nintendo's change
their message and is getting back to
where they're focused lots of nice words
being bandied around between console
makers this week between Yoshida's
comments and Microsoft's congratulations
