Sangha from TechnoBuffalo and today
we'll be checking out Amazons fire phone
which we had the opportunity to unbox
earlier this week and it's advice has a
lot of unique features and services but
the most intriguing is Amazon Firefly
which essentially puts the entire Amazon
store in your pocket we're here to take
a look at what the feature is and see
how it works now the fire phone is a
rather unique device that sports a
handful of cool features including a
dynamic perspective display one four
year prime Mayday in Amazon's fire OS
3.5 which is a heavily forc version of
Android today though we'll be focusing
on Firefly Firefly basically is a direct
link to Amazon to immense online
storefront it can access over 70 million
products from household items to video
games and much more but the feature goes
much deeper still
Firefly can also identify printed text
on posters magazines and emails it'll
recognize movies and TV episodes too and
it can also recognize songs so you can
access artists info all this would a
simple press of a button
but even though Firefly can recognize
lots of things I found it to be
incredibly inconsistent they figure out
the type of cereal Oh shopping for but
only offered it to me in massive bulk it
turned our hazelnut syrup into either
raspberry or vanilla it logged the wrong
kind of Gatorade and many more similar
examples it couldn't identify my
keyboard or mouse despite the fact that
I bought them from Amazon most of the
time as long as you have the package or
some kind of box a book cover a barcode
a big logo Firefly will at least get
close but it's not nearly as accurate as
we'd like it to be of course this is
just the first iteration of the software
so it's difficult to judge devices
performance it is however better with
other things
phone numbers URLs email addresses TV
shows movies and songs and the
technologies potential is already
starting to be realized I Heart Radio as
one of the main companions to Firefly 2
it'll immediately start a radio station
based on a song or artist and also find
you tickets for the artist through
StubHub when it identifies a TV show
you'll get information about the show
the episode that certain seen in the
Cassidy show developers have complete
access to fireflies identification
abilities too so there's a lot of
potential here at least there will be
once Amazon gets a whole lot better to
figure out what it is the fire phone
users are looking at and that's it for
this video guys we're still putting the
fire phone through its paces before a
final review but if you want to hear
some of the John's
on a device we've included a link down
below and if you have any other
questions let us know in the comments
down below and as always i'm mark limbs
hanging from TechnoBuffalo i'll see you
guys in the next video thank you guys
for watching please subscribe right here
to be the first ones to know whenever
new videos get uploaded we got a ton of
stuff we do phones tablets cars anything
has to do with consumer electronics
that's to be plugged in or uses
batteries we review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
