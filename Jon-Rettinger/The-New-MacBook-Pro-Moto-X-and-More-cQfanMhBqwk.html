to you by DIRECTV what's up everyone
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley ask ever any question you
might have in the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on technobuffalo com
you can leave your question in the post
comments or you can send them to me at
any time of the day or night at
technobuffalo or at Ashley ask Ella make
sure you use the hashtag ask the be so I
can see it and they'll usually answer
between three and five questions every
episode let's get answering because this
is ask the Buffalo technobuffalo
commenter Christian searching ER and a
few other people asked me hey Ashley I
need a macbook pro for college should I
wait for a new model I do not need it
until August okay so here's the deal
Apple is rumored to drop the non-retina
versions of the macbook pro in the next
refresh with Haswell processor so you're
going to get this great battery life
they might be phasing out the non-retina
versions and the earliest we're going to
see them is late-september but probably
October so you might be out of luck on I
need a computer by August you may have
to go with maybe a macbook air with
Haswell if you really want that has well
chip or you can get a macbook pro now
the best advice I could give you is
maybe buy it in September and kind of
cross your fingers that you will hit
that 30-day return policy where you can
give it back and get the new Haswell
processors but that's all I got for you
sorry Nick Casey Anderson asks hey
Ashley will the Moto X be considered a
google edition phone considering that
google owns motorola i hope so because
nobody really liked motoblur it wasn't a
very good user interface it was kind of
ugly and it was a little bit bloated and
I think not many people really enjoyed
it so I would imagine that now that
Google this is really the first major
flagship device that is being created in
conjunction with google now that google
owns motorola that this device will in
fact be stock android vanilla android
for all of you vanilla Android lovers
out there i got my
droid burg shirt on this week that is
what it's all about vanilla Android Josh
asks hey Ashley what big event is your
favorite throughout the year CES ctia
III WWDC I would have to say it's a tie
between CES and III so III definitely
for the sights the sounds I love to be
able to go to e3 and see all the new
games it was really fun this year being
able to see the ps4 and all the indie
games and all the really big blockbuster
titles and also see the xbox one and
everything they had going on and also
even go to Nintendo's booth and play
some games that reminded me of my good
old nostalgia of having a Nintendo when
I was a kid but I also really love CES
because a there are less lines to do
things and see things at CES which at e3
if you've ever been you know there are
lines everywhere and CES is a really
good chance to meet up with all kinds of
journalists that I don't get to see any
other time of year so meeting up with
colleagues going all the great parties
in Vegas it's a really really fun time
Peter Barnett says hi not John I what
are your thoughts on modaco switch do
you think OEMs may one day adopt this
technology so for those of you out there
who haven't heard of this motor co
switch is a mod by a guy named paul
o'brien and it actually lets you
seamlessly switch between vanilla
Android and sense 5 on the HTC One using
a shared data set so it's really cool
you're able to go back and forth between
vanilla Android and since five and you
don't have to continually like import
say your contacts you would be able to
use one set of data for both I really
like this idea and I think that while it
would be super awesome to have like
every flagship Android device do this I
don't think it's realistic in the sense
of this is a lot of extra time and the
other thing is is that carrier testing
would be a nightmare we would not see
updates even longer periods of time we
would have to wait for updates from
google because of course carriers tend
to keep those updates for months and
months and months in testing so I think
while an amazing idea and absolutely a
great idea it's not super likely so
unfortunately modaco switch amazing and
I think we'll have to leave that one to
the mods before we go want to talk to
you for a second about
