John retinue from TechnoBuffalo hearing
one of the most exciting features about
the iPhone 4 is its new Retina display
and one of the ones I'm most excited
about so I want to put the iPhone 4
head-to-head with the outgoing model the
iPhone 3GS see if it really does live up
to the hype
so the specs on the iPhone 4 screen it's
got the same 3.5 inch display as the
outgoing 3GS set the Scottie 960 by 640
resolution with an 800 to 1 contrast
ratio which makes it the highest
resolution smartphone on the planet and
the outgoing model to 3GS has a
resolution of 480 by 320 so let's go
like through some real-world tests and
see if this new redness white actually
lives up to the height so let's go ahead
and open up notes on each I've got the
same note open with the same test and
just looking at the screen you can
definitely see a difference right off
the bat the for the page looks more true
to color shows a bit more display on the
right it looks a bit washed out let's
zoom in on the text if you can see any
through a difference here before the
camera starts sort of blur out on us
move these both down this a little bit
and of course we've got the iPhone 4
here on the left and the 3GS there on
the right so just the point where the
camera starts to blur you can definitely
see a difference in the screw now that's
really the text let's go ahead and go to
some websites and see if that's a
difference as well on the text so we
will jump over to TechnoBuffalo comm and
we will zoom in go ahead and hit OK we
will zoom all the way in as far as we
can on the iPhone 4 and still no pixels
it looks very clear I'll go ahead and do
the same thing here and serve text to
text right next to each other you can
see that the iPhone 4 does look crisper
it does look clearer although I'm not
seeing any sort of pixels when I'm
zoomed in all the way on the iPhone 3GS
although the 4 is definitely easier to
read so far the test it doesn't look to
be that big a difference let's go ahead
and try some other tests so other places
will notice a big difference with the
screens is by viewing video so what
better place to watch a video then on
YouTube let's go ahead and zoom out
let's go
we can get some YouTube videos up on
here so we've got both phones ready to
go here I'm gonna go ahead and load the
same video with a top one that loads
which is the Motorola Droid unboxing
that I did so I'll go ahead and play
both of those this is a speed test we'll
do a full comparison Kimmy's two phones
at a later date but we can Li see the
quality of the video and I'll leave them
on the portrait orientation here as well
so that plate at the end that was weird
let's try that one more time what's the
other quality looks here I'll turn down
the volume on this so you can just focus
on the quality of the video all right so
let's see if there's any sort of
difference that we can tell between the
two so we've got of course the iPhone 4
here and the 3GS
and again through the same things that
we saw with the text it looks a little
bit crisper the colors look a little bit
brighter and things look a bit true or
to reality on the iPhone 4 then they did
on the 3GS although it does look like
it's anything that revolutionary I think
maybe I'm looking at pictures and images
perhaps we start seeing some differences
and speaking of pictures and images
let's see if there are any differences
let's go ahead and check it that out I'm
gonna go ahead and close out of this
we'll close out of here as well what's
going and jump into photos and see if
there is anything that we can notice so
here we've got a picture of my baby
niece and this is really the first time
where I can notice a very big difference
between the two when we're looking at
photos I can see that it's not just a
crystal clear here on the 3GS and the
iPhone 4 it really does look very nice
I'm gonna see if I can zoom in a little
bit more and see if we can tell the
difference ladies as much as a camera or
let us focus there we go
and you can see you two the two of these
there does look to be a very notable
difference here between the two displays
she looks cute neither one but looks
more natural and real to life here in
the iPhone 4 and I guys want to give you
a quick overview of the Retina display
and see if it really is a deal-breaker
one way or another on the iPhone 4 look
it's one of those things that certainly
augments the whole package of the phone
doesn't appear to be the sole reason to
go out and buy one and I hope you
enjoyed Jon render from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
