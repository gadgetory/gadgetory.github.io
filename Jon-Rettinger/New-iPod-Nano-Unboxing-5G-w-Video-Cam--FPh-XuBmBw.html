unboxing for you of the just refreshed
iPod Nano this is a version that is
capable of shooting video it can take
h.264 VGA video so it'll do it by 640 by
480 pixels and up to 30 frames per
second which is actually really
impressive
and there's a whole bunch of cool other
video features I'll talk to you about it
also has a 2.2 inch screen which is
actually a little bit bigger than the
last generation Nano I'll go over some
of the specs with you as I unbox it but
for right now let's go ahead and take a
look at the iPod itself I got the
product red version gives a little bit
of money to AIDS research so there is
the iPod on display iPod Nano on the
side told you that it's product red on
top and iPod Nano very small box let's
go ahead and pull back the plastic this
is the same iPod boxing that we've seen
for the past few generations of devices
so pull off the plastic slides right
open and here is the iPod Nano sort of
in a plastic tray go ahead and pull that
out we'll pull it off to the side for
just a second let's see what else comes
in the box designed by Apple in
California this not sure what that is it
tells you about product red apple give a
portion of your iPod Nano purchase to
the Global Fund to fight AIDS in Africa
for more information go to join red comm
so you got some start here information
you've got your headphones which I
believe also now include some correct
some controls ink for the voice control
which is now included on the iPod Nano
and this is also your antenna for the
new FM radio that is found on the new
nanos Universal dock adapter and of
course the obligatory charging cable
that'll work with really any iPod or
iPhone that's been around
so let's go ahead and take a look at
what you're all here to see the new iPod
Nano go ahead and pull it out of the
plastic here okay so here is the new
iPod Nano and that thing is really razor
thin let me do some size comparisons for
you so you can actually appreciate how
thin it is
here is the iPhone 3GS you can see that
does he look like a shadow next to it I
mean it's just so small here is the
Apple bluetooth headset which is known
for being quite slim you can see it
looks like the fat cousin next to the
Nano I mean there's really nothing there
and on the back there is the camera
everybody's talking about this is quite
shiny it looks like it's gonna be a
fingerprint magnet and maybe a little
Scratchy
but the lens seems to be integrated very
nicely into the back it really doesn't
add any sort of profile to it nothing
that's gonna get scratched it's a very
flush to the device itself so guy just
turned it on let's also do some more
size comparisons let's take a look at
the thickness is it gonna sound silly
but next to a standard quarter really
can appreciate how thin the Nano really
is does not appear to be even much
fatter than a standard u.s. quarter so
just a quick unboxing of the new iPod
Nano
stick around to the channel and
TechnoBuffalo comm I'll be doing full
overviews of the video video comparisons
and going over some of the real cool new
features that's found on the new iPod
Nano and my hope you guys enjoyed for
