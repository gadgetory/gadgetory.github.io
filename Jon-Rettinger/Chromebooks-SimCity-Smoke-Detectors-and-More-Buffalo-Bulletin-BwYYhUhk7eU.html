the HP Chromebook 11 sony kind of
compliments Microsoft the state of
SimCity and the nest protect it's about
flow bulletin time hello internet and
welcome back to the buffalo bulletin
where we recap five major stories from
our site technobuffalo calm every
tuesday and friday if you're interested
in reading more about any story check
the description for links or click on
the graphics for each story you hear if
you have annotations available and
toggled on i'm ashley sceva here your
top stories HTC co-founder and
chairwoman cher wang spoke to CNBC early
this week saying HTC would not accept a
buyout offer at this time or a place
Peter Chou is CEO those are bold
statements especially considering HTC
posted their first ever quarterly losses
last week but Wang says innovation is
more important to her than stock prices
she also claimed HTC had a quote very
interesting road map unquote coming up
so we will see soon if HTC has any aces
up their sleeves google announced a new
edition of its popular Chromebook line
of laptops this morning the HP
Chromebook 11 is a Chrome OS powered
netbook that's extremely wallet-friendly
coming in at just 279 bucks the specs
aren't exactly top-of-the-line but here
they are a 1366 x 768 IPS screen display
dual-core Samsung Exynos processor 2
gives a ram 16 gigs of SSD storage 5
accent colors and a very light weight of
just 2.3 pounds looks like it translates
to a good grab for anyone needing a
basic netbook with a little bit of style
over in gaming Sony did something we
don't see almost ever they praised
competitor Microsoft in an interview
with games industry international well
then again that compliment felt a little
backhanded as Sony basically praised
Microsoft for backpedaling on all their
original Xbox foreign policies that were
really unpopular with gamers but again
it could be honest praise I don't know
either way we'll take a moment of peace
between warring giants during the
horrors of the console wars also in
gaming Maxis general manager Patrick
buechner wrote up a state of SimCity
post and gave
some bad news and some good news the bad
news is that he made clear limitations
on both SimCity's glass box game engine
and consumers lower spec pcs meant City
sizes would not be increasing anytime
soon the good news though was that he
mentioned Maxis would be putting that
additional effort into exploring an
offline mode for SimCity so at least
there's that and finally our grab bag
story the week comes from nest who
finally unveiled their rumored smoke
detector it's called nest protect and it
aims to make those annoying low battery
trip trips and screeching ly loud I'm
cooking bacon not burning my house down
false alarms a thing of the past it
monitors smoke and carbon monoxide
boasts the same kind of remote
connectivity the nest thermostat does
and it's already available for pre-order
it'll cost you one hundred and twenty
nine dollars when it officially hits
retail shelves next month that's the
buffalo bulletin for today if you
enjoyed the show give us a thumbs up
that would be super amazing of you and
