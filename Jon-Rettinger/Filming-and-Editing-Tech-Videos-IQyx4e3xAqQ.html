to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
walk about their pursuit of Retton jazz
riff summer host john wright interest to
show where i usually talk about anything
going on in my mind as to about
technology for the past month though
I've been sort of intermixing interviews
and TechnoBuffalo folks here at the
Irvine office you get to know who works
behind the scenes and what they do to
help make the whole TechnoBuffalo ship
actually work this is the last guy that
works in the office sitting right next
to me is the newest technical hire it is
mr. Ron Purita you might have noticed
that back about three to five months ago
the video quality on TechnoBuffalo
started getting way better mostly
because I stopped doing the video
editing and this guy took over Ron's got
a tremendous background in film
production so I want you to yourself a
little bit and give you a little bit of
your story um so I've always like really
had a passion for filmmaking I kind of
started when I was like 11 or so I went
to summer camp actually and where my mom
kind of forced me to go and I got really
into filmmaking and just kind of the
process of it learned filed cut started
early bought a camera that summer for my
parents to buy me an iMac Final Cut and
just started kind of editing making
little videos and for the next like six
to seven years I was just always making
videos with my friends and that sort of
thing and when I was about I'm really
young by the way when I was about 18 I
decided to get into commercial
filmmaking and started trying to pull
clients that started working I reached
out to Jon emailed him one day I was
like hey you know I saw your videos I
think I could really add something I see
you know a lot of room for growth it's
about a year ago this is when we were
still doing techni buffalo's driven
rhetoric i actually was more focused in
the automotive commercial side of things
just because it was easier to like
market and build a business when you're
in a really focus like that so I reached
up Jon they were doing a car show and I
was like you know let's give it a shot
we actually did the Mazda 2 review ditch
you can go back and watch put a link to
that right down below and it's the best
produced video of a car that you didn't
necessarily like that much I also did
have a week to edit that which I haven't
had a week to edit any
ever since I started working here so
usually get what like I'd say I get
about a day two days three days Nats
usually give I'm really lucky sometimes
you know some reviews have gone up
within a day and for me it's been a real
learning experience just because I've
been used to having like up to a month
to edit you know like a four-minute
video so when I started when I was like
complaining they like Ralph and John I
was like I can't do this like I get
really attached to video then I beg no
it's not good enough and needs to be
better and so getting used to the
workflow the turnaround time the
schedule that was all like a learning
curve I'm still I'm still learning and
I'm still working on it so it's it's
really a big change for me so if the
folks out there you saw that you enjoyed
editing or thought you might enjoy
editing so you try to get the tools you
could to help learn the craft and when I
started doing it and sort of the best
way to learn and then you started
reaching out to people who you thought
might help you get exposure experience
definitely and now you sort of did so we
did that video about a year ago and then
probably go we started looking for a
video editor to sort of help with the
editing and my first thought was Ron who
had helped us with the maza Tube video
so we talked and Ron's local ish Ron's
got a about an hour so drive down from
Los Angeles he's in the office usually
three days a week Monday through
Wednesday and a handle sort of I'll be
editing so you had it now and what kind
of software used at it I work in
premiere we use the Creative Cloud here
so it's not just premiere we use After
Effects SpeedGrade sometimes we use
Adobe Audition for some audio stuff even
though we try to get as good of audio
quality as we can directly into camera
so that's kind of sweetly so like high
level let's take a general video let's
say we're doing an unboxing what would
you do before we start a film during
film and serve after after filming
where's your bullet pointed out so I'd
say before filming does not really
that's kind of where your job is you
know you usually put together like a
list of points or something like that
for me it's more trying to find a style
in to look for videos so I'm sure you
guys have noticed videos continue
changing and that's kind of why we're
still developing a style we're still
working on assets we're really trying to
continue to improve until we're at a
point where we're happy but filming you
know we'll set up the camera the lights
around here you guys can't see but we've
got right lights out
all around us we've pretty much marked
everything down with gaff tape so we
know where everything goes so we try to
get as much consistency as we can we'll
just hit record John's really good
usually with like one take or so unless
we have some you know some oddities or
something goes wrong with the audio we
usually get it done in one take you stop
interviewing this Yahoo for a second

to better yourself check them out again
lynda.com so I check my Buffalo give you
a free trial so what advice would you
give to folks out there who want to get
into this field you know what have you
learned that could serve help someone
that wants to do what you do what I
would say is be aggressive you really
have to not be annoying but you really
really have to go out and if you want
something I've always been a big
believer in that if you want to do
something you have to go do it you can't
just wish it to happen I mean I think if
you've asked every single person who's
worked here so far they've said they've
made it happen from you know ralph to
brandon they've gone out of their way
reached out to you and even you when you
begin you do the same thing so stay
hungry you know people are going to say
no to you for whatever you want to do
and just kind of try to take it on the
chin keep going and just try to go make
it happen on your own and that's really
good advice if there's a career that you
want to go and whether it's what we're
doing or something else you have to be
aggressive with it and like run said
respectfully aggressive and no
rejections going to come and that's a
good point everybody here reached out
something that they wanted and I did the
same thing when I was starting I reached
out before I started TechnoBuffalo I
actually reached out to see net and
gadget and Gizmodo to try and do video
work for them and nobody got back to me
no one no one ever
so I figured I'm going to try and do it
myself you know Ron I'm she reached out
to a lot of people for video work I mean
you just created a new video on
Instagram sensation yeah my name is
grandma Betty she's I was actually super
fortunate about a month ago she's this
81 year old woman just fighting cancer
and she's like the happiest person I've
ever met and I mean that was basically
and she has like over 600 something
thousand followers and I flew out to
Indiana for a couple days got to film
her family that was you know that was I
was really fortunate but that you know
it's like what you said I you know
reached out to her grandson on Twitter
and and just you just got to kind of try
to make it happen and if you guys want
to see that video I think it's
tremendous video I'll link to that down
below as well
so at least for right now this is going
to wrap up the interview series and
other folks that don't work out of the
office come in we'll sort of put them in
this chair Ron's got kind of his hands
full over the next few months we're
actually moving offices around September
October we're gonna have a full studio
inside of our office where we can dress
sets and sort of up the production
quality Ron's going to have quite a bit
of work coming up where's the name at
just the Ron parade of studio and Ron
and Ralph sort of working really
hand-in-hand that Ralph who you guys met
at the last video and since it's cool to
be able to see everybody sort of work
together to make this machine run and
with one person wasn't doing their job
every time I grind to a halt the fact
that we keep growing it kind of keeps
coming the videos are there on time and
they're annotated and the videos look
incredible
are all a testament of a lot of people
behind the scenes that you don't see
it's not me that does all the stuff I in
a lot of ways have the easiest job out
of everybody I just sit here and I talk
I'm done talking I leave and then the
video magically shows up online the
article written about it with
annotations inside of it with After
Effects and color graded there's a lot
of work goes into this and sort of the
entire staff who's in the office and not
in the office everyone does a really
incredible job and I'm sort of proud and
happy you guys got a chance to meet
everyone at least a little bit and get
to know us and all the work that goes
into everything that we do so you guys
