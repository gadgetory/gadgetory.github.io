buffalo show I'm leave your two heads
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazleton everybody 45
already huh I know it we haven't missed
a week at a while yeah weird although I
got asked on Tuesday evening because i
usually put up the show the evening
before you we were gonna have a show on
wednesday and once again microsoft did
not consult with us yeah you know it's
always microsoft yeah it is always my
cousin and the funny thing is there were
some announcements yesterday but we
probably still could've done the show oh
that first error was almost painful yeah
very developer focus which it should
have been I mean it's a build conference
but sometimes in the past it hasn't been
always just about developers right off
the bat well you know and the thing was
I didn't close that tab for hours cuz i
was in conference cause i clicked on the
tab and they were still going yeah yeah
it was like our for keeps cuz they start
to go into the sessions i think yeah i
ha good grief it just it kept going and
going but that was one of the things we
want discuss it unfortunately I did not
get seen much of the show yesterday
because I have a bunch of meetings so
Microsoft we've learned the eel honestly
I did not even here yet what is the name
of the new browser its edge which is
kind of funny Microsoft edge instead of
I mean it was called projects partner
before now it's officially Microsoft
edge and it kind of even looks like the
old explorer logo to like they're still
using kind of the e which is fine but I
mean edge for me why are somebody
products like getting called edge right
like especially in tack where to me it
always has connotations of a slower data
network well I you know the thing is
it's it's one of those things where I'm
sure some sort of research group went
out and tested a bunch of buzzwords yeah
you know and then what does the word
edge mean to you I actually had a friend
of a friend who worked at an advert
advertising agency who helped come up
with Bing
and it was only game they'd all go home
at night part of their job was I'll go
home at night come back with a list of
words the next day and they kind of
narrow it down so I I'm not sure being
would have been the word I would have
settled on but I to me bing doesn't mean
anything yeah I guess it's kind of like
ping cook in which my father used to
work for a company called oh yeah for
golf clubs may also you know data
transfers I don't know yeah it's but you
know the other thing is I mean Google
became a verb you know it was easy to
say all I'll google that I'm sorry I'm
never in my life going to say oh I'm
gonna bring that doping that yeah hey if
you think Donnie no that's not going to
happen yeah it sounds like something I
would hear it a movie where people think
they understand kids and thus Langley is
right right right yeah a man i'm gonna
go ahead big right yeah no no but anyway
so edge okay fine still an odd term uh
we did you see the hololens again yeah
looks bad I was kind of floating in and
out word were they playing with a
virtual dog at one point yeah they had a
virtual dog and I made a joke like okay
I've always wanted a virtual dog but
they did show like a cool little robot
that you could have like the robot's
body was virtual but the actual robot
existed too so it was like kind of just
a platform you know like this didn't
look like a robot in real life it was
just kind of object moving around but
then it was built out and so on in
virtual reality which is cool I also
thought it was neat how you could sort
of look around the room and pin windows
to different parts of the wall and then
like if you had a YouTube video to get
pinned to the wall in front of you or
then have it follow you around that was
pretty cool stuff well we have a
question from such a Mahal asking if
you've gotten to try hololens and I
don't think any of us have gotten to try
it yet now we haven't and actually we
had somebody at build yesterday brandon
russell was up in San Francisco because
of time constraints and stuff we had
them come
back after the event and they had
appointments today though where the
press could could check out hollow one
so we weren't able to stick around that
long but hopefully soon they said also
just for background they say we couldn't
take photos or videos so it's not like
we would have been able to bring that
much content to the site but they said
there will be plenty of opportunities
for that in the very near future so it
sounds like we'll be able to see it
again soon I hope so well from Benjamin
McDonald's he's asking how much you
think hololens will cost I don't think
any of us they've got even a ballpark on
that yet yeah I honestly have no idea
I'd like to drop a number it's probably
wrong yeah well i don't know i mean the
the way they've talked about seems like
they're not aiming for a huge price
right yeah it sounds like they want to
make it broadly available to consumers
but and like the way that the stuff
they're showing you know like a a dog
right like that's not an enterprise
application nobody's going to go out and
spend three thousand dollars on
something that gives them a virtual dog
but i think you know it's not going to
come in probably like a hundred bucks
seeing as i have six dogs the last thing
I want is a virtual dog yeah I know
right I don't mantle and two cats I I
don't need any virtual pets thank you
yeah come on floaty let's go out yeah no
I don't need a little groups all over
your apartment yeah I mean now if if
they'll let me create a virtual platypus
yeah you know just because I want to
play with nature's joke like a tiger I
can have a Tigers virtual tiger hanging
around my apartment that would be kind
yeah but then you get into the whole
Siegfried and Roy problem right okay
with it then why not but I I don't know
now here's a good question Christopher
miles though our bings results actually
worse than Google's or has google just
acquired all the mindshare I don't it's
like I gotta be honest I don't really
use being that much but I guess it's
because I'm so used to using google and
I think it does have the mind
she right I actually did try switching i
went to using just Bing for like two
weeks uh-huh I went back to Google yeah
the results weren't that much worse I I
don't know why I just heard an r2d2
sound um the unlock behind the sheet
there yes exactly the the results
weren't that much worse I just really
did not like the use the user design the
yo the user interface I didn't think was
a smooth or as user friendly right um
that being said I I will still check
Bing but typically i just stick with
google just because I I have tried and
just it just didn't appeal to me yeah
and I don't know the market share League
off the top of my head I know you're
talking about mine share which is think
Google or the market shares like first
search ninety percent google like I get
it it's ridiculous how much they have
but was there anything else yesterday
that really stuck out to you from
Microsoft that was yeah there are a few
exciting this one is continuum and it at
first it's part of a windows for phones
and at first I was like oh this is like
continuity from Apple like copy but it's
not it's it takes and I think it
requires future hardware so I guess the
next Lumia phones that we see the next
windows phones but it takes like say
you're running an office app like we're
a PowerPoint or something like that you
could plug it in to a monitor so some
kind of hdmi out but windows phones
right now don't have that and then the
keyboard and mouse and you use of a more
fuller version of that application so
like say its power point it's not just a
simply blown up version of the one
that's on the phone and it's also as far
as I could tell not the same as like
full office but it's somewhere in
between and it gives you more control
but it's all powered by your phone which
I thought that was pretty cool that's
kinda cool especially if you're somebody
that works at numerous different
locations you know you could just take
your phone with you and all you would
need is a monitor and a keyboard right
each location which
concerning the price of monitors these
days that's that out right on and the
other thing is I my mind just went blank
but the Apple reviews sucked it all out
of you really did that I just finished
the Apple watch for me yesterday and
it's close to 3,000 words my my brain is
done but oh the other thing is the
office apps on for mobile so windows
phones and then there a lot of their
tablets are free so you get like a
pretty even more full version of office
when you blow it up on the screen so you
don't necessarily need you know a
license on your computer oh that was
pretty cool other things I took a couple
notes um Spartan now called edge third
party Cortana support that was cool they
showed yesterday they'd say like hey
Cortana you know send a message to Sean
using viber and and say like hey and it
would just launch the app and say hey to
you which I thought was neat I don't
know how much we need like a hands-off
experiences like that because I don't
use it all that much anyway like even
with the iPhone Siri and Google now and
stuff but it's neat that it exists um
they also announced spotlight which is
like different lock screens and I guess
it's like custom with customized with
personal information and stuff but also
with adits which I thought was weird and
I think for apps and stuff I don't know
why they would do that but maybe they
could offset prices or something I
didn't really understand the full
concept of using ads but obviously
you've seen amazon do that with the the
Kindles and stuff and then carrier
billing was another one they're going to
add that to the app store in Windows 10
and it's not just for phones so you can
buy apps through your carrier especially
if you have like a tablet or a laptop
that's connected you go to ATT and you
buy an LTE connection with your laptop
it's all carrier billing which I thought
was pretty cool these are the big
takeaways I saw from Christopher miles
do you think Microsoft would make edge
installable on other os's which is not
something they did with Internet
Explorer yeah I don't know they didn't
talk about it don't think yeah I I think
they should I mean I Safari safaris you
know you can install it when
so why not go the other direction why
not try to increase your mind share in
your user base yeah but especially if it
works well because I gotta say I've been
using chrome on my max and it kills the
battery life I kind of gone back to
Safari here and there but I generally
prefer chrome but I i generally her
chrome as well but lately it's
something's not right yeah you can I can
like watch my battery drains me when I'm
not plugin yeah well I mean even on my
imac it's it's taking up so many
resources it's ridiculous yeah crazy i I
don't know what's going on I I would
like to see chrome go back to being the
the nice user friendly browser but
something's not right I think I like
about chrome she was like my shortcut
bar you know it's all colors and stuff
like that the icons and Safari just sort
of looks very plain but it is optimized
for battery life on on max well the
other topic we want touch on guys I do
see there's a lot of Microsoft questions
and we will come back around but I just
want to get the topics established for
this week the second topic of course was
the LG g4 finally being announced well
do we even call it an announcement when
they pretty much told us everything they
did it gone over so many features ahead
of time they revealed display they
revealed the user interface they
revealed the camera but then we finally
end the leatherbacks but then we finally
got everything sort of pieced together
which was good it's a really good event
the phone looks awesome we'll have more
coverage of this is a funny story Jacob
and I were at the g4 event in New York
City it finished up we wanted to go
somewhere less crowded to write up some
posts and we walked out but they we
apparently missed when they were giving
out the units or where they were giving
them out so it's getting overnighted to
irvine we'll have coverage on the site
but we didn't pick up the unit did they
even give a hint that they were going to
do that well they had announced this
like trial or this program to give out
4,000 unit
so the public or whatever you know for
like testers and for people to play with
the phone so they had this pile of g4s
kind of roped off in a pyramid but the
day before when I had met with LG I was
under the understanding that we weren't
going to get review units next day and
then with that yes they did which is
funny so I'm really excited about the
camera though it looks awesome I've seen
some of the demo shots of it stuff like
that the back felt pretty good the
leather one is nice I'm not crazy about
the plastic back I think they're calling
it ceramic pretty much plastic and I saw
one question I guess we can address it
here but the Snapdragon 808 I guess it
does support quick charge to point out
call come says on their site that's what
the comments is here LG says that the
phone does not though and they said you
know it'll charge faster with I think
they said 1.8 volt charger but otherwise
it's not officially quick charge to
point out the just a little inside
baseball for everyone not it when we go
to these events it really is kind of hit
and miss are they going to give us a
review unit on the spot are they going
to send it later the the most amazing
thing and I I don't feel I'm speaking
out of school to say this is how often
we don't get the specs for the phone
until after the event because the PR
departments will go oh we don't have
those yet I'm like phones been in
development for probably a year yeah you
know a suspects and though oh well we
haven't got them finalized yet oh
they're finalized the phone is built
there's built units yeah believe me it's
finalized yeah that's funny how often
our information can come in last minute
yeah 3 last minute yeah it's amazing so
well we have a couple questions here
about the g4 and from Kyoko Yuki believe
apologize if I got that wrong do you
guys think the g4 is gonna be better
than the s6 um man I feel like it's just
a matter of taste what you're looking
for in a phone it I mean we'll review it
obviously it's going out
irvine i don't know if it's better or
worse or whatever we saw early
benchmarks and now keep in mind LG
provided these to us so they could you
know potentially serious the wrong that
or not that i think they would but that
showed the performance of 808 on a par
with ex you know seven series that's in
the snapdragon all right in the galaxy
s6 and s6 edge and they were within you
know milliseconds or seconds of each
other for opening apps and doing stuff
like that so LG's promises says it's
right up there in terms of performance
in terms of the industrial design I tend
to lean towards the galaxy s6 I like the
metal I like the glass but the you know
the g4 is not going to get fingerprints
and stuff like that the camera looks
like it might be better I would never
say that you're going to be disappointed
with the camera on the s6 great camera
I'm excited about some of the other
features the excess 62 I like the
wireless charging is built in you can
get a special back for the g4 that'll
allow that but it's not sort of included
and then Samsung pay our yeah Simpson
pay sounds like a really cool technology
that's launching samsung had said this
summer and others a report today saying
September which i guess is still
partially technically this summer let me
sorry for that so I don't know it's just
what you want the screen is awesome
though and they actually showed us and
again LG showed us this so it's not
Samsung you know getting a word in but
the quantum quad HD display showing
raspberries or strawberries red
strawberries and then the s6 showing the
same picture and it did look kind of
orange on the s6 versus what LG says is
more accurate colors on the g4 so but
again i love this screens on the s6 too
so oh and once we get the the g4 aon and
we can play with it more that that would
be a question that we'd be able to
answer more precisely yeah from David
berkovich what things you wish to LG
would have included in the g4 that you
want to be included in the g5 um I don't
know I say things like wireless charging
right because it seems needs me but then
again it's lot slower than quick charge
which we've talked about before
and I end up just plugging it in any way
I think I'd rather just see even more
premium materials and I know LG's liked
adding like I think the leather takes
however many weeks or months to tan with
vegetable oils and stuff like that and
it looks great but i don't know i like
the metal phones these days maybe if LG
could just do that i have zero interest
in a leather back on my phone yeah me
too on the same way they're like it ages
nicely in all this stuff only you
started leather that much oh no I'm
sorry I'd know you know uh from
Christopher miles do you think LG has
surpassed HTC and mindshare for the
Android faithful um I think LG's got
larger market share and then in terms of
mindshare i'm not sure i mean i don't
think i've seen any data on m9 sales i
can't speak to how well it's selling or
anything like that and that would give
us a better idea of my chair yeah sure I
don't know I you don't hear people
discussing LG that much a better you
don't hear people discussing HTC that
much either I don't son but I was
surprised I was talking with somebody
the other day and they were saying they
want a new phone and he's like I'm gonna
get the One m9 I think what do you think
about it and I was like it's a nice
phone but I'm not crazy about the camera
and he hadn't heard anything about the
camera he said he'd been reading up on
in on stuff so oh he'll be interesting
from brazen Franco am I the only
skeptical about Cortana on desktop I
mean that's the purest definition of
spyware it's an interesting question um
I think it's optional I'm sure you get
your I mean you don't have to use
Cortana ever right yeah but it brings up
an interesting point like the Amazon
echo I mean we've got more and more you
know always on always on they always
listening and that maybe it's the old
man and me you know but it's it does
worry me a bit yeah I think it's your
personal data but you do opt in so I
don't I mean I guess it's
I wear but it's the same thing as saying
like Google now is spyware because you
let it read your emails and then tell
you when your packages is coming are
coming and when your flight down know
exactly I don't know um I don't know if
I'd be that concerned about Cortana in
the digital age pretty much everything
is spying on us also from brazen Franco
I'm surprised to see ms taking cues from
the Linux world in boo to convergence
maybe they'll finally implement a
functional repository manager that's
been a problem with windows for as long
as I can remember so I I wouldn't oh I'm
thinking the registry the registry was
always my night arm whenever I had to go
in there uh I wondered when somebody
would bring this up from Christopher
miles do you think continuum can succeed
where the motorola lapdock fail yeah I
the second you were describing that I
just kept flashing back to my first CES
and Motorola look you can duck your
phone with your laptop I had that thing
somewhere I don't think I deal anymore
you did you return it yeah sure I did I
mean it's not here I thought years ago I
was probably working for mobile burn at
the time um maybe right like if people
use it but the thing that's cool about
continuum is doesn't sound like you need
to well I don't think at all you need to
go buy this like separate doc just for
it to work which is what you had to do
with the atrix in the in the motorola
lapdog you need it that special part and
this sounds like you just plug it come
on eter get a bluetooth mouse and
keyboard and you're good to go from such
an Mahal hey Todd I see you ended up
buying an Apple watch which one did you
get and how is it so far yeah so I swore
left and right I wasn't gonna buy one
which is funny and and then I had this
conversation well I can always return it
because I do that well too here's what
happened we TechnoBuffalo bought three
of them we bought an apple watch and two
apple watch sports and John said
jon rettinger said you want to review
and I said yeah of course I'd love to
check it out and I thought well
reviewing it for technical Buffalo's you
know obviously going to be the quickest
way that I'll have a chance to check one
out and actually play with one for a
while because I didn't order one for
june delivery so they arrived in the
office last Thursday I paid for it to
overnight it here for the weekend and I
actually I fell in love with it it's
really great and I decided to buy it
from technobuffalo I did end up buying
one it's it's not one of those things
where I'd say you know if you have
android where you have a moto 360 which
if you listen to show you know I like a
lot and Android like oh this thing's way
better you got to go out and buy it but
if you're on an iPhone and you you know
wanted a SmartWatch is a great choice
and probably besides the pebble pretty
much the only choice or the Microsoft
band also supports iOS it does a lot of
cool things really well my favorite
really the my favorite part over Android
wear is it has the hardware buttons to
navigate menus and stuff a little bit
easier and then the force touch screen
is cool but it's one of those things
we're like as you use it you start to
realize where force touch is applied it
doesn't come with like a big I was
joking with john you know when you go to
the store and you buy a Timex at walmart
or something like that and it comes with
like a fat booklet of how to use it and
how to set the date and all that kind of
stuff it doesn't come with any of those
manuals so I was learning along the way
like to dismiss all the notifications
that come in you can just force
touchdown which is like a harder push on
the screen and you can clear all it
stuff like that so I'm still learning
parts of the UI which can be clunky but
I really like it well the Apple watch
review will be up later today so
everyone keep your eyes on the site for
that yeah oh and for battery life just
to bring it up in case anyone's
interested it's I usually take it off
the charger about 7-730 in the morning
it's pretty consistently been at about
42 to forty-five percent every night and
I go to bed around 10-1030 so the
battery life is good for the day sounds
like you could stay up later if you
wanted to and I charge it every night
and I write in the review so here's a
little teaser that
you know I've said in the past about
Android wear and in fitness bands and
stuff that I don't like having to charge
these things all the time I end up just
not wearing them but the Apple watch for
me has been functional and not enough
that I want to charge it every night and
I want to put it back on the next day it
so that hasn't been a huge issue and the
magnetic charger works really well just
drop it on so as good as the Moto 360
wireless charger which is kind of just
easier to plunk down that shows you the
time and stuff what is neat from David
berkovich Todd how long before you
return the Apple watch yeah I know right
I don't think I'm gonna return it
anytime soon I do it's one of those
things you know 400 bucks is a lot of
money and I say this interview to you
for something with a rubber band that is
very comfortable but I do kind of wish
that I had the nicer single body this is
aluminum I just think it looks a little
better but I saw some of the reports
that the sapphire screen sort of makes
it not as viewable in direct sunlight
and this is really really easy to view
and direct sunlight so I like that but i
probably will try to get another fancy
might just go with black or something
macrumors just ran a story that Apple TV
sheet apple TV shipping estimates
slipped to one to two weeks ahead of
WWDC via so fresh maybe please it's
about time so yes everyone keep your
eyes on the site later today for the
Apple watch review that will be going up
let's see here from Kris for miles with
rumors of iOS compatibility how do you
feel Android wear compares directly with
the Apple watch ah yeah I mean it's one
of those things if you already have
Android wear and I guess like an iPhone
as a secondary device and you want to
use the two together or you want to buy
android wear because it's more
affordable then that's a pretty good
idea but I do like the apps on Apple
watch a lot better actually and I find
the user interfaces lot easier to
navigate but we do know Android wear is
updates coming the latest ones coming
the with the G watcher Boehner the LG
watch urbane which starts shipping soon
I need any day now I think um so lets
you know i want to hold out and wait
till i play with that and whatever
google has a google i/o if they talk
about new feature to come into to their
watches q but i'ma I guess I what I'm
trying to say is i'm not going to knock
android wear just because i like the
Apple watch I think they're you know
both pretty great products from
President Franco so happy LG for once
didn't follow samsung and it's madness
well the TV antenna on the Korean
variant work only for Korea frequencies
may end up importing it just for the
extra battery included speaking from my
international travel their bands are
different so i would say more likely
that the TV antenna will not work over
here i learned that lesson the hard way
when I i bought a little FM radio years
and years ago for my trips to japan i
get over there turns out there are
completely different frequency yeah yeah
i was like oh great well so much for
that idea of listening to the radio as i
walked round the issues back before a
smart phones everybody yeah did you just
use Spotify well cuz there was the year
2000 but I would imagine more unlikely
the TV antenna will not work over here
yeah probably not and I don't know where
you live raise them so I mean they could
pretty much outside of Korea won't work
uh from such a Mahal will any of you
guys be picking up the LG g4 I I used
the g2 for a while I really liked it but
the g4 is just not screaming to me it's
not calling out to me either um and
again I haven't had a lot of time with
it i just did our hands on at the event
so we'll see what the guys think out
irvine but i don't think i'm gonna buy
one I mean I don't generally go out and
buy a
are these well I should take that back
cuz you're am with the Apple watch but I
don't generally go out by a lot of those
like ships it just gets too expensive
from such a Mahal the second of Buffalo
still pay for Apple products to be used
in videos or are they being sent as
review nuts from Apple Apple sends
review units to like six to ten sites
total I think uh and one of those is
always Walt Mossberg know we we stole
every Apple product you see us review or
take pictures of or anything else we
have had to purchase yep which I I have
to address this i know we've addressed
this before every single time we write
anything remotely positive about apple
we get comments about wondering how much
apple pays us to write all of that and
there were a couple comments this week
about you know at technobuffalo should
just finally come out and say they're
being paid by Apple we have never gotten
so much as a free sticker from Apple uh
we we do get him to go to the events and
that's on our dime Apple so far as I
know Apple hasn't even fed us at any of
these events some companies will feed
you some don't so ya know we we still
purchase every single Apple item you see
on the side so when Todd says we bought
three Apple watches we bought three
Apple watches yep and a the 4k i'm at
get the macbook gently yep exactly so
yes we still buy everything uh let's see
here we've got a bunch of questions i'm
going to try to get to as many of them
as I can uh from Christopher miles
thoughts on the rumored fourteen hundred
dollar tag how our Android wear watch
revered to be based on the $1,500
Carrera I um I think peg that much for
any Smart Watch is inside
game yeah but it's yeah tag is pretty
popular in the luxury market I mean
depending on where you are what they say
yesterday I think the rumor was like 48
hours of battery life which is I guess
is pretty cool better in the Apple watch
um seven guys I know fourteen hundred
bucks I mean luxury right ligi of the
ten-thousand-dollar Apple watching
seventeen thousand dollar Apple watch
and tags pretty well known but I don't
know yeah yeah notice everyone seems to
mean it over in the pebble we do know
that it's the the I guess you said the
rumored price but the actual watch is
confirmed so it is killing me from such
a Mahal as there used to be a internet
explorer for mec back in 2003 yeah I
don't know what discontinued that but it
did exist no clue why they change their
policy on that from David DeMille Todd
what made you like the Apple watch so
much look for the review later today
we're not going to tell you everything
that's in it it's long and I'm tired
it's the reading uh interesting question
from Christopher miles I've heard from
certain unnamed sites that Apple only
sends units the sites that talk
favorably about their products any
insights on this I don't believe that to
be true actually true there's it's
partially true but I mean I've seen Walt
you know in particular I have seen him
say negative things about Apple yeah but
they do blackball people as it's called
oh yeah oh yeah they definitely bike
ball people but yeah it tends to lean
that way but I not sure it's a hundred
percent that way for whatever reason
though they they keep the circle of
review and out sites very very small we
wish we were in that circle because I
don't think any of us enjoys being up at
midnight for the product releases kind
of my Apple watch is right yeah exactly
oh I've done my I skipped the Apple
watch one luckily John
he skipped that one but I've done my
fair share of those midnight releases oh
good grief uh from such an bahal
microsoft hollow animals for hololens
just like how there was connect animals
for xbox 360 yeah they're yeah that is a
definite possibility by your extra pets
yeah exactly hollow petting zoo uh uh no
thank you uh from Christopher miles do
you think apple will implement Siri in a
fashion similar to Cortana and OS 10 I
think they're going that way yeah yeah I
definitely think that I I think we're
going to eventually see Siri on desktops
and laptops hopefully she'll be smarter
by them yeah hey was this last time we
actually use the other I know you used
her in the review right but other than
that wonders last time you use Siri not
I mean I don't even know maybe like
check the weather just like because when
it's plugged in on my desk with a doc I
could see like hey Siri which um I
should say like watch this just here
it's in my review but hey Siri like see
that's supposed to work on the Apple
watching just it barely ever works so
anyway so much with the Apple if that
you can do it manually but I I taken
aback I use Siri two weeks ago I had to
leave before manchester united game was
over and i was gay guy my car and i
quickly headed just ask manchester
united score right yeah but i mean other
than that who knows when the last time
was I used it from David DeMille Todd
what did you return this week um well
technically I returned a laptop to
lenovo but I didn't buy it it was very
that was reviewing it so that doesn't
count I did you spot this morning mail
that back ah that's it it's from brazen
Franco okay can't wait to see Todd by
the tag hair
or where device no no no no not that's
wait that's way out of my blood sugar
from David DeMille do you think the
higher quality screen on the LG g4 with
the same size better you'll make the
overall battery life worse um in my
briefing with LG they said that the
snapdragon 808 processor and the screen
together should save you eleven percent
on battery life so apparently the screen
is better even though it's higher
quality I guess it's been tuned they
changed everything I mean that's why
they're calling it quantum but a better
contrast but our colors and I guess
lower power to some degree I guess
paired with it it's now dragging you
away yeah what we'll find out you know
when we we get the really nice cream
from brazen Franco I actually have some
thoughts on this uh what are your
thoughts on tattoo gate yeah I thought
that was interesting it's the Apple
watch I guess some these sensors on the
back can't see through some tattoos
depending on the color it gets darker
ink to read heart beats for your heart
rate and I it I think it uses the same
technology where it's like a green light
so maybe it's something to do with that
mm-hmm uh you know the way I look at it
and I have zero zero problems with
people tattoos but you know a company
you can't take in every single variable
you just can't and just kinda tech works
if you look at the the number of people
with tattoos in that area there it's
going to be a very very small percentage
of the population I think it's
unfortunate that doesn't work with their
tattoos but I wouldn't call it I I've
seen some people called discrimination I
I think that's great way way out of line
it's just
it's just a matter of the tech not
working that's i mean that's like yeah
hang at apple's discriminating against
people without wrists before else do you
put it on your ankle yeah exactly
exactly but uh yeah I just I I think
it's being blown out of proportion yeah
I just don't think it's that big of a
deal but hmm let's see here and actually
we're gonna go little short guys I I
apologize for that i have just got an
emergency instant message that has to
deal with something extremely important
