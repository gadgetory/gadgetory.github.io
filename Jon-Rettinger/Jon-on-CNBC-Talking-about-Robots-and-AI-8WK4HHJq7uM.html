now we come to Watson we're looking for
Bram Stoker and we find who is Bram
Stoker and the wager hello
three 41,000
for 13 and a two-day total of seventy
seven thousand
and it I suppose truly made it look
Elementary man versus machine this time
Watson the IBM computer cream two of the
best the best jeopardy players in
history in two games across three days
Watson earned more than the two players
combined Wow well Watson's win be dinner
conversation for President Obama tonight
he's sitting down with top technology
exacts including Steve Jobs Mark
Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt the group
will reportedly discuss innovation and
job creation and probably Watson but do
innovation job creation go hand in hand
or does innovation put jobs in jeopardy
joining us Natali Morris senior editor
at cnet com and jon rettinger president
of TechnoBuffalo John let me start with
you you know we sit here and there's
it's neat and cool to watch and rather
scary with that little green thing going
on to watch Watson house those winners
but this is a broader problem perhaps in
our society absolutely there's
definitely a Hal sense to seeing Watson
out there in action what witnessing
right now is really a paradigm shift and
how we interact with machines and
anytime there is a paradigm shift its
oftentimes met with a bit of reticence
so when we saw the telegraph operator
give way to cell phones and different
communications those automations and
artificial intelligence ultimately opens
avenues for new jobs and new employments
for people so it's not necessarily
robots are going to be taking the jobs
that are available it's how humans are
going to interact with these new
automated machines and John give some
examples I hear your point but I know
that you you thought about this I mean
in places where we have seen job loss as
a result of technology I understand you
say conversely we may make up for those
jobs elsewhere but let's just look at
Wall Street where a lot of our viewers
are today we've seen it there right you
know we have seen it certainly there
there's automated trading less people on
the trading floor there's trading
software which wasn't there in the past
but they're also the people that are
making the software that are servicing
the robots that are in charge of updates
and maintenance so there's definitely
both sides of it we don't have the
benefit of decades of hindsight yet to
see where the new job creation is going
to be the automations that we've seen in
the past have led to the employment
giants Google Microsoft and Facebook the
company is that you just
all right Natalie what about you you
have an interesting Jetsons reference on
your take on this yeah you know what I I
thought about this about how we compare
humans to machines now you know I have
to hire a nanny to watch my little boy
when I go to work and that nanny has an
emotional component that's very
important to me it can robot do what the
nanny does yeah sure they could probably
put Neosporin on the wounds I put an ice
pack on the head when did little boy
bumps his head but is it going to be
able to soothe my child the way I want
him to is it going to be able to have
that emotional component what I worry
about with the lesson of Watson is
something called neuro plasticity it's
where your brain changes based on the
tools at hand so if you look at the way
we're preventing presenting information
to our viewers there's information below
the screen there's information above the
screen we're expecting the viewers to
process all of this we change the way we
think about things because there's so
many messages coming out us there's
Twitter there's your newsfeed and so we
don't realize that the way that we're
different from a machine is that we can
synthesize we can analyze we can think
and act and make decisions emotionally
not just based on data which is all that
Watson can do Watson won all that money
and didn't say great Jim Watson jr. can
now go to college Watson just as bad as
bits and bytes we don't do that so I
think the lesson we can take from Watson
is what our strengths are not how we're
worse than Watson that's true and we
give Watson a name and all the sudden I
he does become a little
anthropomorphised right so Natalie
what's interesting though is you're also
saying that more automation and more
information can make our jobs easier
what do you deal though with this um how
do you do with the issue of the fact
that that means that jobs are lost well
like I said I think that we should think
about the jobs that we can automate and
think okay that's something that a human
once did but there are jobs now that we
can put our strengths into what if we
all went to work every day and thought
well the reason that I'm better than a
machine is because I can synthesize I
can think more profoundly so I'm going
to capitalize on that ability as a human
and then instead of just trying to get
on an assembly line we all thought about
how we can think outside the bus I mean
when the workplace
be such a better place to be it's an
interesting point John what about that
you know but some people make sure okay
first it was in India now you've got
doctors there who can look at cat-scans
instead of people here I mean every
industry in this country has not been
immune to outsourcing now on top of it
potentially you could have a whole
nother level of job loss we still
haven't fully recovered from outsourcing
no absolutely and if I can reference
back natalie is nanny reference i think
we're certainly far away from everyone
having Rosie you know in our in our
homes but the technology and the
artificial intelligence the automation
are certainly making our lives easier
we've got the da Vinci machine for
example that's leading to more precision
surgery and increased life span for a
lot of these surgical patients so there
are a lot of opportunities where this
automation that's artificial
intelligence is making our lives a lot
better now certainly there's not going
to be that emotional component robots
are never going to think in robots never
going to feel but there are a lot of
avenues and a lot of employment
opportunities where that thinking and
that rational thought is that necessary
you've got human error as well if looked
at the automation at a checkout when you
go to the grocery store as well so
there's a lot of opportunities for
automation to improve and automation to
help our lives all right Natalie John
thanks to both thank you welcome alright
and let us know what you think have you
seen examples of job-killing technology
in America actually given how that
segment one let's throw Natalie's
question out there at you would you be
comfortable with a robot if there really
was a good robot a Watson like robot
