from TechnoBuffalo and welcome to what's
the apps WTA yo not too sure what that
means but besides with you have anyways
it's a little a preview show here on
revision3 and technobuffalo where I just
check out some apple vacations and today
we're gonna be checking out some games
bird based games actually and why bird
based cuz you know birds are cool they
got feathers and they can fly in jealous
i wish i can fly but i can't i'm not
bird starting us off would be tiny wings
this thing quickly became an instant
favorite and it's become one of those
must-have games for your iOS play thangs
the story is simple you're this little
birdie bird that can't fly so you got to
use momentum to venture as far as you
can before sunset because you know when
the sun go down your birdie has to sleep
the music is calm and soothing all you
gotta do to play the game is tap to make
your birdie dive for those of you who
haven't played this game before do not
underestimate the simplicity of it the
game can get quite intense more often
than not i found myself pressing down on
my screen pretty damn hard because this
game is just so intense the only
downside is that there's no iPad version
but because the graphics have that
textured feel compared to other iphone
apps it honestly doesn't look that bad
on the ipad i give this thing a 5 out of
5 definitely pick this up next on the
list raging birds the premise of this
game is that your this little red birdie
trying to protect your eggs from this
brat with a slingshot and how you go
about it is by pooping on him and I'm
dead serious that's how the game works
like almost all iOS games a game is
structured around a level system the
music is kind of cheesy the graphics
aren't really that nice looking at it
mean just check out these buttons and
decontrol probably the most important
part of all its clunky you swipe your
birdie to make a move and you tap your
birdie to make them poop I guess it's
just the timing of the poop and the
slight lag enos that kind of threw me
off I give this thing a one out of five
one point for the pooping part because
i'm just so mature that way next on the
list air penguin
game is sort of like a combination of
the games cut the rope doodle jump and
tiny wings you're a penguin trying to
reach a destination by hopping on ice
pieces while collecting as much stuff as
you can such as fishies and stars ease
the game opens up with a really cute
comic based storyline afterwards you see
a map screen similar to the one from
Donkey Kong Country on Super Nintendo
you control your penguin dude by tilting
your device unlike doodle jump where you
just go left or right Air Penguin goes
in all different sorts of directions
which is cool but it's kind of tricky to
play I really love the game doodle jump
but personally I don't really like this
all direction kind of game style and oh
when you die your ping Yuen drowns well
I don't know if he drowns a number with
but still I found that my penguin
grounds quite often overall tube
graphics cue music and cute story I give
this game a 3.5 out of 5 if you don't
mind the control you might want to pick
this up in oh yeah PS no iPad version
next on the list rip off like the name
implies probably more directly than
indirectly this game is a ripoff of
several other games first of all the
graphics and even the fonts are a ripoff
of patapon a game on the PSP super
awesome rhythm based game by the way
like raging birds your goal is to
protect your eggs and you do so by
swiping or ripping like the game title
implies your enemies those patapon
looking creature things but oh no watch
out for the bombs yes gameplay wise this
is a fruit ninja ripoff the only
difference is instead of using your
fingers to slice you're pretty much
tapping but your birdie guy does the
slicing action but you know what the
gameplay is actually pretty fun and is
actually pretty addictive so besides all
the possible copyright infringing
elements of the game it's solid imma
give it a 4 out of 5 and last but
certainly not least anger at birds
arguably the first bird game that kind
of started at all the story goes like
this a bunch of evil piggies some with
mustaches took your eggs yeah I know
right girl why they'd be getting up all
in your business so you got to get your
eggs back by constantly breaking down
their fortresses made out of sticks and
stones by launching birdies via
slingshot doesn't get any more
thick than that there are a bunch of
different birds with different abilities
and like all iOS games it's
louisville-based and you're trying to
kill all the piggies with as little bird
bombs as possible per level the graphics
are awesome in the music classic
gameplay simple smooth and addictive
unlike the other games on the list not
only those anger I bars have an iPad
version they have other versions of the
game as well Angry Birds five out of
five a classic mobile game well I hope
you guys found this review helpful and
I'm not going to take up any more of
your time because I know you want to get
your game on with them bird games I've
talked about so thank you very much for
checking out this video this will John Q
from TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
