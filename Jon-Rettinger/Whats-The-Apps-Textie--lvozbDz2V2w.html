brought to you by Netflix well oh there
you what's going on John Q here from
technobuffalo and welcome to what's the
apps and I'm pretty sure we all know
that iOS 5 magical pixie dust and stuff
is coming really really soon later on
this year sometime and one of the more
talked about features is I messaging or
I messenger whatever is called it's
basically apple's version of BBM or
exclusive messaging my screen just
turned off but that's fine just just
bear with me I should turn that back on
give me a second BAM the backgrounds
back you kind of have to have it back
favor that's how you make this thing
look legit man you know so I miss doing
apple's version of BBM BBM exclusive
messaging I personally don't get it I
don't like it but then a lot of people
do so so yeah so if you want experience
you know I messaging or I messenger now
there's actually an application that
will allow you to do that so for this
episode of whats the apps we're gonna be
taking a look at texty it's got a smiley
face icon and everything wonderful texty
is a super slick messaging application
for iOS that means you can load it on to
your iPad iPhone or iPod Touch and heck
if you have all three you can load it on
to all three it basically functions like
the up and coming I'm message
application in iOS 5 sort of like a
hybrid between your standard IM
application and text messaging and you
know what it was actually made by the
guys who created tweety which is now the
official twitter application so yeah you
know this is good stuff right here texty
is really really simple to set up once
you install the application all you
gotta do is create a new account or sign
in to an existing one there's no real
way to log out so I had to uninstall the
application and login again this is the
shot you guys have seen right now
inconvenient but you know it looks good
on screen after playing around with the
settings and even going to their website
I found out that you can't really log
out which is weird the only thing you
can do is uninstall the application and
reinstall it like I said weird right I
mean right texty is unique in that you
can message people two different ways
through their email or through their
mobile number if they have a texty
account your message will pop up
right there if they don't and you chose
to tech see their email they will see it
in their inbox and yes they can reply
back to you I tested this stuff so you
know this is legit right here as I
mentioned earlier you can also text the
phone numbers but it's a u.s. feature
only because i live in canada we i can't
really test it out no matter what it's
like not a loud kind of thing but i did
read comments and feedback and it seems
to be working pretty okay like any good
messaging application texty has push
notifications with sound so that when
you're around people you can give off
the impression that you're really really
popular all of your friends info
including their avatars all come from
your contacts app super handy I love it
when things all sing together it's so
magical and if you thought that was
magical you can even face time with your
friends right from the application ID
tap it right now but I don't want to
show my personal info and did I just say
I'd tap it yes I did dirty the coolest
part about tech see in my opinion at
least would be the photo sharing feature
it's awesome it's very well integrated
and it works seamlessly I remember one
time out of convo with just pure
pictures granted it was a little bit
more creative than just taking turn
snapping pics in my face but you know
what never mind snapping pics my face is
pretty fantastic the options are pretty
minimal but practical I really love how
you can change the font size and heck
pink bubble color right on you can even
tweak how you want to be notified when
you get pinged because the app is free
having ads is kind of expected they're
pretty out of the way and you don't even
see them half the time if you're one of
those oh I hate ads kind of people you
can pay two bucks and have an ad-free
version personally I don't mind them the
only downside I see about tech see
besides not living in the US would be
that you can't block people so let's
don't i'm not i don't know if this still
happens but let's pretend you have this
haida right here who likes to spam you
because he has nothing better to do any
and he likes being annoying there you
can't really do anything about it but
other than that texty is just fine and
dandy speaking of dandies I'm a give a
shout out to netflix netflix streams TV

is awesome i can't experience all the
features because i live in canada but
it's totally fine because it's so
seamlessly integrated and it works so
well and you know what the darn thing is

out of five easily smiley face so if you

messaging or I messenger today
