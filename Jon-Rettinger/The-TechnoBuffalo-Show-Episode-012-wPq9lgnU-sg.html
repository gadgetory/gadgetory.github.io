TechnoBuffalo show I am I of your three
host for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site i'm joined by executive
editor mobile Todd Hazleton everybody an
executive editor of gaming joey davidson
what's up guys how are you all doing
today yes doing things yes things I'm
doing them things are getting done doing
things he is rude uh-oh we got a couple
topics that we want to go over today and
of course the first one is the big news
of the week the finally and I stress
that finally the announcement of the LG
g3 finally finding story Todd I said
something to my mother the other day
about there was we are having this LG
event on tuesday and she goes oh where
they announce i go the LG g3 and she
goes isn't that already out you guys
write about it every day yeah one would
think and that's kind of like what we're
saying finally because everything every
last detail on this phone was leaked
every picture every I mean we knew what
we what we had coming into it and I
think that was kind of just like okay so
now we're going to this event where
they're going to spend an hour and a
half talking about a phone we've already
been seen for two weeks well now what's
funny though is you know we did think
everything I had never once seen anyone
say that there were going to be two
different versions with different
amounts of RAM yeah that's weird well I
mean I know I know they make like some
hardware changes like that going
international you know like different
markets yeah like that so but but it was
kind of cool to finally hear like we
already knew that that laser on the back
was for focus and stuff but then they
kind of explain why it was there and and
like learning that there's an adjustable
keyboard and stuff was kind of neat i
mean there's small software things that
aren't really huge but there were some
things we learned yesterday yeah i did
think the adjustable keyboard was kind
of a nifty little trick yeah it seems
cool so yeah so well of course we
already have a couple questions because
we announced that we were going to
discuss the LG g3 and which is so much
fun to say three times fast from Sasha
Mahal who I am now going to refer to as
Jeff yeah he tweeted me last night and
asked if I was ever gonna pronounce his
name correctly and I simply replied well
change your name to Jeff and we'll see
what happens so hey Todd how does the LG
g3 compared to the LG g2 um the design
aesthetic is sort of similar in the
sense that it's very curved and nice
like that but it's better obviously the
hardware is better everything about the
phones better I know there are some
YouTube commenters yesterday who seem to
disagree that there actually is a
metallic layer used in the back which is
then coated with a matte layer so but
that actually helps get rid of the
fingerprint problem at the g2 that on
the back displays way better you've got
quad HD camera is better they use the
OIS plus optical image stabilization
plus that was first employed in the g
pro 2 which we saw back in World
Congress overall I mean it's an upgrade
in every single way so it's a better
phone ok well we will of course have our
our full review coming in a probably
next week well actually do we know when
we're getting reviewing yeah we don't
know when we're getting your units yet
so my feel a little while ok well then
then I won't say next week cuz well
first we need to actually get a phone
okay yeah i mean we could just start
reviewing and you know see what happens
yeah but I mean it's available globally
today so we could theoretically just buy
one maybe we'll do that we'll see right
now I saw Hall Raja asks and I think
this is off of one image in the
presentation yesterday do you think the
LG g3 will come with a SmartWatch
running Android wear well I don't think
it's going to be in the box but there
was one quick slide in the whole
presentation that showed the LG G watch
next to the LG g3 which seemed to imply
that they're going to be close and
release dates
yeah I wonder well we'll release date
for the phone is today in like 170
countries but um Android wear we'll
probably see it at Google i/o later next
month and I wouldn't be surprised to
like a bundle package but I don't know
we haven't spent icing for that yet or
anything but maybe you know US release
and Android wear maybe that'll work
together I mean we've seen carriers
offer discounts on the Samsung gear 2
neo and stuff like that with the galaxy
s5 so well I unfortunate i mean we can't
talk a whole lot about the phone BK you
got to spend what with it Todd 15
minutes yeah we I mean we had it and
then we gotta run and try to get the
video uploaded so you know I don't
remember you know you're elbowing
everybody in the world to try to get
these things so so if you all do have
some more LG g3 questions we will come
back to them but honestly right now we
we don't have a whole lot to say about
it because we simply not have much time
to play with it yet but it's just nice
that it's finally out there and we're
not going to be dealing with rumors
forever but that it kind of ties into
the second topic we wanted to touch on
today which is when is it too early to
announce a release date we've seen
several instances recently of games
being pushed back well beyond their
initial release date said just last
night the order 1886 was pushed back the
steam controller was pushed back what
was the other game of those push back
this week even within evil with it yeah
so and this also goes from phones don't
tend to miss the release dates quite as
much as games do but right you know the
this led to a conversation Joey and I
were having this week about when is it
too early to start the hype machine wash
dogs we were just talking about that a
little bit before the show oh that's my
answer to you know what guys I think I'm
just gonna say watch dogs again and
again for the rest of the show and let's
hope that it answers all questions that
ask we don't want to imply that it's a
good game well I
I wasn't going to bring up watch dogs
because I didn't know if you wanted to
save things for the review who well I
mean I don't you know I mean it's not
like I'm under embargo here I we didn't
get a review copy of the game um a lot
of it's odd a lot of places didn't get
review copies and I don't know some
places did some places didn't places
like polygons they didn't even get a
review copy which that to me says a lot
well it says it says that the publisher
is lacking confidence in their product
typically when you get a sony and
nintendo in particular really good about
getting out early copies i remember
uncharted two came like four weeks early
like they were just like this games good
check it out mario kart 8 showed up like
the release date is this friday so it's
May thirtieth and and we got that like
May second like that's crazy and its
really compelling when they do that but
then other companies they either do
Activision is notorious for release day
review copy arrival for things like call
of duty and if if you don't want to get
it on release day the only other thing
that they'll do is they'll whisk you
away to a resort and make you review it
under their scrutiny so they'll like sit
there and they'll say okay you have
eight hours of the campaign here's a
developer to help you and then after
that we got a little multiplayer party
will will put you through like six hours
of multiplayer downstairs in this event
room and it's it's really tightly
controlled conditions for review so I
don't know that's a tangent a half but
what it's it's odd to me that that watch
dogs either people were skipped I mean I
still got copies of assassins creed 4
even like after it was released and then
when the when the DLC the was that
freedom cry dlc came out they sent me
another copy of assassins creed 4 like
just in case you lost the other six that
gave you here you go it's just so weird
to me that the Ubisoft has such like a
disparity in confidence between the two
where were we with this I don't even
know if we were talking about happy I'm
too early to announce something and it
it's sort of a heightened machine but
sometimes it's not like in the case of
the asuste padfone X which we just got
the release date and pricing today it's
a june six for 199 on contract ATT that
phone tablet hybrid was announced in
january well yeah insane and it's not
even like a flagship right and i think
our launch launch an announcement gaps
for phones are much more narrow than
games which is like you know a phone
will be announced in and see their like
sometimes it's available that day
sometimes it's available a couple months
later or weeks with games and the reason
why I said watch dogs there is because
watch dogs was unveiled like to III s
ago 13 I don't need my brains kind of
typing better to I think but yeah so two
years ago they unveiled it and then it
suffered the layout of the holiday
season and it was pushed in the May now
undoubtedly it'll sell very well because
it's it and Mario Kart are like the
games this month um you know and and and
good for Ubisoft I think that was a
smart decision for them and ever having
played the game I don't I think if watch
dogs release next to grand theft auto 5
the perception of it will be very
different than it is right now grand
theft auto 5 was it and I've only had a
six hours with watch dogs maybe five
hours with watch dogs but I can tell you
that in those five hours I have been
more impressed with grand theft auto 5
is initial five hours than those of
watchdogs and i think that's that's part
of of the the reason why it's being
victimized there is because of how early
it was announced and this is a game that
was announced and promised two years ago
and then it we waited and waited and
waited and now that it's here I don't
necessarily think it's living up to that
that time frame yeah that's gonna be
tough yeah cuz I mean they're building
hype a lot differently than phone makers
I think you like phone makers are sort
of like here it is now we got a
hypothetic here are some screenshots and
art stuff like that is you movable don't
even get me started on man I I showed
them to you Sean Ubisoft has become
notorious with bull shots as they're
called these
these rocks that are that I mean Shawn
you can what did I show you this morning
oh it was amazing that the official
Ubisoft screenshot that he showed me was
crisp and clear and gorgeous and then he
showed me a picture he had taken off his
copy which by the way what system are
you playing it on we were being asked
ps4 he took a screenshot it's like two
completely different games really they
don't order the rendering it on like a
computer or something or just like
photoshopping it oh I think that that I
think they're being rendered and
polished supposedly uh Eurogamer host
the digital foundry articles and if you
are a big nerd about like resolutions
and frame rates I suggest you look at a
google search digital foundry and then
watch dogs for instance they're there
performance analysis of watch dogs is
actually up and out there based on their
analysis the ps4 version is the better
one it runs it at smoother frame rates
than the pc version which is just it's
asinine this is a game that that should
be pushing my next-gen hardware to its
limits and it's not it just it looks
very much like a slightly crisper
version of last year's games which is
odd that is weird kinda reminds me of
when crisis came out and like I guess it
looked good but even on when I was
working at laptop magazine at the time
so we had like the latest alienware
computers and it was sluggish on those
he was just poorly coded or something on
it well what about it I think the thing
about crisis Todd was that it it really
really really really demanded a PC well
beyond its contemporary age in order to
run to perfection huh you can if you
have a build a pc today and you max out
everything on it and you drop like 3k
you'll be able to run the original
crisis and it will look gorgeous right
but I see you're saying it's not even
it's not even a secret Eck they make
pretty games to the Crytek engine that
they used to develop crisis and even
Crysis 2 and 3 is very gorgeous working
very well Ubisoft I'm just I'm not
convinced that they're capable of making
games that can that can Wow on the level
of
of crisis and I'm talking purely for the
sake of visuals here in this argument
that if you if you follow technobuffalo
at all are like our especially the whole
gaming departments work really we don't
prioritize graphics / mechanics but but
when you're your big advertising pull
for a game is the graphics like we're
going to talk about it in the case of
watchdogs everyone was expecting this to
be like that that gorgeous next-gen game
and I'd argue that assassins creed 4
looks better than watchdogs our own eric
frederiksen is playing through red dead
again just for the lulz and he said that
it was a watch dogs does which is scary
to me in Riga that's crazy no yeah I
find it I think red dead has become our
second Pokemon I don't think we've done
an episode of that red dead bored
because it bears it's worth mentioning
when when it's a standard bury you know
if if we were a film podcast I guarantee
we talk about alien a lot or Godfather
like these are these are like the games
they have define an age oh no totally I
think red dead is quite possibly my
favorite game I've ever played period
it's up there yeah there with ultima
online for me you're the Therans call
one and two for yeah i thought i saw the
article yeah you're like well I we've
got off on one of the most amazing
tangents ever but it was somewhat
involved here but the question is should
these companies wait until they're
confident in their release dates before
announcing them well i don't but i don't
know you you go Jay well I mean when I
was gonna kick it to you Todd because I
think it I think with phones there's a
really obvious answer here it's such a
more cut-and-dry business than games is
really i mean it's it's a hardware
business it's not a software business
right yeah yeah i feel like with phones
i mean and you sort of have to stick to
especially if you start taking money in
pre-orders and stuff you should really
stick to it and it also with phones i
feel like it's super
because you're dealing with two year
contracts and so when people's contracts
are up if your phone is not available
for them to buy it then they're gonna go
with the competitor for that reason
alone versus you know like games like I
guess we'll keep waiting because I
really want to play that game anyway and
I'm gonna buy all of these games but you
can't just go out and buy all of these
phones I think that's sort of a big
difference right and to announce a phone
and then delay it every delay that you
lay down on a phone you outdated its
specs exactly exactly yeah yeah that
doesn't really happy with games like
Pikmin 3 didn't get less powerful
because it was delayed but well yeah it
looks like most you could do more with a
game is not the mortar you have time to
work on earth yeah so that I mean any
there's this Shira Miyamoto quote from
forever ago that any any game a good
what is it I can't remember what the
exact quote is but it's like a bad game
is bad for ever but a delayed game could
be eventually good or however that quote
goes but that's the general spirit of it
you know right well Joey I do you think
and I'm thinking off the top my head
here or so in the movie business it's
become quite common for movie studios to
stake a weekend they even before they
have start pre-production on film to go
this is when this movies coming out I
mean we know the release dates for
amazing spider-man three and four
already right yeah and so yo Sony is
sitting down going these are our weekend
stay away from them right but do you
think that's happening in gaming at all
that they're working to release dates as
opposed to working to the best product I
think it's well as a yes and no because
if you look at October of this coming
year you've got a ridiculous slate of
games already even within was just
pushed into October the batman arkham
game is going to come out knocked over
there's a full there's a full run of
luck games that are coming out in
october and if if movie publisher or
game publishers are buying into the
argument that they need to claim stake
to a weekend and then you know i don't
know that not if it basically not
published alongside each other than
months like that wouldn't have
happen however I do think that it it is
in publishers best interest and I think
that they're doing this to kind of
recognize the games that they're coming
out with our alongside and if there's
any type of genre overlap maybe they
want to space themselves out a little
bit which could could I mean supposedly
watchdogs was delayed for polish which
is kind of scary but I wouldn't be
surprised if it was delayed because of
grand theft auto 5 you know they wanted
to get out of the way of that beast and
then release in their own territory and
be the only big open world game of May
are you trying to say Grand Theft Auto 5
had good sales I think it did okay right
okay mediocre to okay yeah maybe they'll
be a grand theft auto six would the
numbers aren't in yet you know games i
really like speaking of big open world i
don't know i bring this up but another
tangent the Just Cause games just cause
damn I guess I played last man that just
cause three's coming it's gonna be
coming I mean it's rumored or whatever
when Square Enix picked that one up they
made a ton of money and Avalanche
Studios did very well it just cause 2
it's a good game man nice yeah I'm
excited for that too yeah I will say as
a recently titanfall grows on you the
more you play it really I haven't played
it much i'm still stuck on well realm
reborn i'm actually on my third time
through the ranks oh not received or
whatever it's called in this one yeah
it's called region yeah what gotten what
intrigued me was as opposed to like call
of duty where you know you just hit you
know the button and you go right you
actually have to once you get up there
you have to complete certain goals
region or else you're stuck so I mean I
got really good with Titan fights going
from gym to to gym three and then I
looked at what the requirements are for
Jim 32 Jim far away I'll probably stay
at gen 3 for the rest of my life but
because there's no way I'm going to be
that good with the plasma railgun that's
what the first black ops for me I like
prestiged and then I was like ah this
isn't fun anymore excellent yeah because
you get so used to using the weapons
from the higher ranks and you forget
where you unlock them yeah exactly yeah
so what like when you restart your like
wearing my mind's you want mines yeah
all those things that make it fun
exactly exactly well i think i'm also um
Joey I just saw your IM please take care
of that yep it he has a phone call you
must take so the the question I guess
Todd is and we've had a couple more LG
g3 questions come in so we'll tackle
those while Joey's away for a moment
sure from rockster 103d they do you I'm
assuming he meant think do you think the
hell GG three will have better sales in
the HTC one oh yeah that's a tough
question if its price the same and we
don't know them I mean I think the
Australia and Singapore prices came out
over the night but uh if it's priced the
same maybe because it has that quad HD
display that people are to be like whoa
but then the one you know has that metal
body that's really nice too but you also
have to consider market shares of the
phones and you know what people have had
in the past and the market I think based
on that alone I'm pretty sure LG has a
much larger market share than HTC which
sort of gives it the you know sort of
the lead going into it but I don't
really know you know it's too early to
say I think we'll see and then the fact
is actually these manufacturers don't
usually break down sales you see Samsung
say like hey we sold 10 million units
every now and then but when quarterly
reports come out it's sort of just like
phone sales altogether so ya know um but
for both companies usually they're sort
of the big sales are in the mid-range so
it's not really like they want to make
these big flagships and get them out
there but a lot of times you know you're
trying to sell in emerging markets and
stuff like that but there's a lot a lot
more sell through right yeah I think
that's where it's going to be the big
question mark is in the emerging markets
because yeah so these lower end phones
that you see
they're launching like it I believe it's
LG's l-series and stuff like that right
right which we had one other question
about the g pro series and i find it
here yes from us from jeff hey Todd what
are the main differences between the LG
G Series like the LG g2 and the LG G Pro
Series the g pro series usually the
larger screen i know that GT has a five
and a half in or sorry the g3 as a five
and a half inch but the g pro seems to
follow sort of the note launches from
samsung so usually LG's answer to the
note series and then the g2 g3 is sort
of in the same bracket as what you get
with the galaxy s5 so usually trying to
answer both of those devices and g
series comes out early still last one
came out of a World Congress now we have
g3 right now we're at may so next maybe
the next G Pro will come out again next
year a World Congress sort of answering
the note that we'll see in September
probably from Samsung I'm going to take
this question just because I think this
is something we actually should address
from Dominique Webber I feel kind of bad
for Todd for the crap he's getting in
the comments on his hands out yeah I
think he did a good job for one man
thing I I will defend Todd I will defend
john i will defend anyone that is a
youtube video at one of these events you
have to understand we're filming and
dominique thank you for what you had to
say dominique you have to understand
we're filming under less than ideal
conditions we are filming with devices
that there are three people standing
behind us waiting to get their hands on
it as well and you have a very limited
window and it can't be polished and it
has to be right usually the first yeah
you can get I mean I I shot a couple
videos at four with Samsung tablets at
CES this year and I I typically don't
shoot videos I didn't get a whole lot of
crap in the comments I should have I was
not happy with them once i was done but
i had its i had samsung telling me hey
guys
everyone out and I'm like I still have
two tablets to shoot Oh the funny thing
is yesterday people were like I think
someone was like it looked like I was
trying to steal the device cuz it's
attached to like this super elastic
thing and I'm like I'm trying to turn it
over in my hand while filming a video
it's like bouncing back it's like oh
that's that's another state because I
I've had to deal with those stupid cords
you're like you're trying to get it in
the right position the cords trying to
pull it back yeah ball and you like drop
the phone off you never know so yeah
guys we will always do the most polished
video we can but when we're at an event
we're going to do what we can but
they're not going to be what you see
when we shoot in our office and we can
take yo two or three takes with no
cameras yeah multiple cameras two or
three takes we don't have other press
people across the table from us filming
their videos and you know we have to
talk over them it's there's a lot going
on when you're on the floor yeah so
thank you very much Dominique for
pointing that out yeah Todd gets some of
the most amazing comments on YouTube and
I saw your tweet last night thought
about why do I bother reading oh yeah I
was just like I can go into bed uh yes i
will stop calling you Jeff okay so I and
now since Joey's back getting a little
bit back to our release date things I've
not had time to read up on yet what's
going on with the steam controller uh
well I think that that valve just
delayed their official iteration of it I
think they're looking to refine it a
little bit further and deleted in the
2015 I don't think that the steam
controller is an integral part of the
steam machines just because the very
nature of what they're doing is such
that any controller will work with the
platform at least hopefully that's
that's the aim so I don't think it's
going to kill anything but it is kind of
a bummer for those that have been
looking forward to the steam controller
it's an interesting design and I'm you
here to try it so yeah it's unlike any
design i've ever seen that right I agree
I agree yeah so yeah that's going to be
very interesting well we're let's go
ahead and jump into our open question
and answer session here and Joey we've
got one for you from David berkovich
what features do you want to see an
Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire um Ruby
and Sapphire are someone is knocking at
my door I think that when I are pretty
awesome games they're probably saw my
favorite in the Pokemon series but for
me as far as remakes go especially with
Pokemon I just like convenience tweaks
being able to trade while in the field
or whatever else or that kind of stuff
anything that that makes playing the
game more convenient I'm a fan of and
hopefully they'll bring back the watch
like the clock on the second screen
because they used to have that it wasn't
an X&amp;amp;Y I was a big fan of that such a
nerdy inclusion but I like having clocks
in my games I know it sounds so weird um
but it makes sense pokedex should have a
clock right what kind of pokedex have a
clock so just really just as far as
features go I don't care what they do a
supposedly we might see a new take on
the story that's cool i'm personally
more interested in seeing a convenience
features at it and more than anything
else so i just was so scarlett in to all
of joeys clothes for the Scarlet nerd
the nerd the nurse yeah I'll take
instead of a free culture survey for
adultery hits all out I want a clock my
polka duck pokedex bro pokedex excuse me
creepy okay now here's a question from
Dan leghe's um guys if I mispronounce
names I'm sorry I'm horrible I my last
name is spelled a une I mean I've had a
mispronounce name all my life so
what do you think of the proposed smart
home system from Apple this is
interesting to me because there's a part
of me that's always wanted all these
smart home features and when they
started happening I was like ooh but
they're not a smart price nah and you're
upset the Google was apparently looking
at drop tears i love Dropcam and now so
far Google's kept their hands off nest a
0 and so that gives me some hope for how
things are going to work out with
Dropcam but yeah it still concerns me
but it's interesting to finally see all
this home automation coming along I
guess whoever was knocking at Joey's
door is still knocking hi yeah so it's
it's interesting I finally see all this
home automation coming anyone that reads
TechnoBuffalo seeing my flashback Friday
series and I I have a fascination with
those old 50's films that ill your food
will descend from the ceiling you'll be
able to do you know this at home and all
that so that's always fascinated me but
you know when you look at the prices of
say like the nest you know yeah that the
nest thermostat is awesome but it's 250
bucks right and so yeah this is great
that Apple I I especially love the idea
the one Apple pen that showed you know
you walking into your home and the
iphone automatically turns on your light
so it's a great security feature but how
much is that gonna cost me right yeah
and how was what was this smart home
since I know as a report that came out
over the weekend I believe but what is
it is it a platform as its software
they're trying to release her I saw it
was maybe like going to be like an apple
you know like apple approved accessories
sort of thing right it's gonna be a
couple the report goes that the new
Apple TV that's been delayed who knows
how many times will be the smart hub for
everything okay and then it will be a
software platform there will be labeling
like you approved for ipod it would be
approved for whatever the name of this
is right okay and so you could buy
accessories that would talk to the apple
TV and then the apple TV would talk to
your iphone or ipad and so with your
right
would start turning things on when you
leave home and turn things off so on so
forth that's neat pregnant that's need
like what yeah it's just it's the the
price of the situation I mean yeah
that's all stuff i'd like to have but
it's not going to be at least i don't
feel it's going to be until you know
four or five six years down the road
when the early adopters have bought
enough to start dropping the price yeah
i'm picturing things though like if you
had bluetooth low energy appliances that
that were communicating with your Apple
TV so say like Apple partners with LG or
something or like another smart home
system that competes with nest from
another company then you could like walk
into your house it knows the temperature
knows your home because it has
established that bluetooth low energy
connection then you can go you know tell
your phone to run the dishwasher and
stuff like that I guess I guess I could
see it all working with Apple but like
you said it would be seems like it would
take a couple years to get everybody on
me yeah I definitely think so unless I
go buying people yeah from Sasha bahal
honest questions for all three of us um
which he says right at the beginning
what announcement do you really wish to
be made at e3 2014 and what announcement
do you think we will see and also who do
you think will win III 2014 but joy
since this is good I'd like to see
ultima online issue the rules from 1997
oh I have nothing uh Wow okay um I'll
try to handle them in order yes
personally I want to see the last
guardian show back up at e3 2014 for the
PlayStation 4 just do it and let photo
way to go on to other projects finish
that beast up and start making other
awesome games eco and shadow the classes
are masterpieces in my opinion and if
the Last Guardian can live up to that on
the PlayStation 4 and look as gorgeous
as it can it will be unbelievable so I
would like to see that happen
what announces do I think we'll see I I
could I could see a price cut for the
wii u maybe the nintendo doesn't really
like to drop prices around III for some
reason we might hear from Beyond Good
and Evil 2 again i know that nichelle
and sell was the one that was working on
that from ubisoft and it's kind of gone
on hiatus and a couple years back he
said that i want new consoles before i
start working on that so new consoles
are here and he teased some concept art
of the main character not too long ago
so that could be a thing and who do i
think will win the e3 I don't really I
out like that phrase because winning is
something that's really subjective and I
noticed such in that you put a win and
quote so I appreciate that but last year
going off of that phrase i would say
that sony undeniably one III this year I
know that you guys love to hate them and
I say you guys generically but Microsoft
has already been doing some interesting
things and one of them was getting Phil
Spencer to head the Xbox division and
since he's been on we've seen things
like the dropping of the connect as a
mandatory requirement for the xbox one
and the lowering of the price to 400
bucks those are things that gamers
wanted and have have wanted from the
beginning I think that if any company
stands to gain the most ground it's them
I don't think Nintendo is ready to show
off anything new just yet i think that
there's still a little bit life left in
the wii u as as small as it might be but
i think that if anyone's poised to make
the most crowd noise this year it it
could be Microsoft though who knows I I
think Microsoft learned a lot of lessons
from last year old boss look where their
old boss wound up he's the head of Zynga
tell you about how Microsoft in their
Xbox division was viewing the gaming
populace at Don Mattrick left xbox for
Zynga where Zynga now how are they doing
yeah exactly yeah now I think Microsoft
is going
think we're going to see a very
different Microsoft this year than we
did last year they can't take another
year like last year where to be blunt
their ass was handed to them on a silver
platter by Sony well and I mean Sony
their marketing folks established this
amazing narrative of their the bad guys
we are the good guys and they threw it
into this culture that's very much
centered around stark villain and a
stark hero I know that that sounds
cheesy but that's what games are and so
to villainize a company was one of the
best things Sony could ever do for
themselves and it's paying dividends
with the PlayStation 4 you can't go to
any website that centers around gaming
or tech without seeing someone comment
sections yelling about how the X bone is
dead or doomed in the PlayStation 4 is
better and a lot of that is is based
solely on the fact that Sony position
themselves so expertly last year it was
a master class in marketing yeah really
was yeah otherwise so I I I don't know
if Microsoft can kill that image this
quickly you know with just a year but I
think we're going to see a very
different Microsoft that is going to
attempt to be a much more consumer
friendly company than it was last year
yeah and I think Major Nelson will be
tied up in gags in a closet he's not you
know he plays the cards he's dealt I
think that I feel Spencer's going to be
doing him a lot of favors and if Major
Nelson is a great personality and if if
the xbox team can give him content
that's good and easy to sell he'll he'll
sell the crap out of it you gotta
remember these guys are salesmen that's
all that they're there for that's what
they're doing and so I know that we like
to throw words like win and lose at
these console manufacturers but it
ultimately they're just businesses and
we're the customers that's all it is and
I know that we like to categorize
ourselves and more interesting ways than
that but there's no winning at e3 it's
all about consumer perception and
whoever wins that perception is who wins
I think Microsoft stands to gain the
most will they I have no idea
who who's the guy last year that had the
unnatural relationship with cars on
stage I don't know the fours a guy like
me this in McLaren I've been sleeping
with it I I will only be satisfied if
this year at e3 he shows up again and
actually looks a seat yeah because I
started started to get uncomfortable
during that presentation I was there it
was afraid of liquid projectile at any
point did you just want stand up and go
do you want to sleeve you alone should
we go Doritos and Mountain Dew and hit
the road does anyone have any candles on
them yeah it was weird it was a weird
moment yeah it was so weird I'm just
hoping that we get another great musical
act this year oh um I'm because of how
my plane ticket laid out i'm actually
not going to be there for microsoft and
i'm gonna be like i'm gonna be landing
and running directly to the e3 briefing
so that should be far the EA briefings
that should be fun hopefully I'll miss
any any big performances we'll see we'll
see uh from Dominique Weber could we
expect some Assassin's Creed news at e3
yeah yeah I mean they aren't they
announced I camera it's Assassin's Creed
unity and something else one of them is
for the xbox 360 and ps3 and the other
one is for the ps4 xbox one and pc I'm
not sure what the wheel our plans are
right now but it's set in the French
Revolution we know that much Assassin's
Creed is annualized and Ubisoft said
that they're not really interested in
new ip's unless they can annualize them
at this point so from now until
Assassin's Creed stops making them money
yes we will see more about assassins
create a t3 all so far crime far cry 4
will be a t32 so unbelievable from
rockster 103 do you think people will
buy the iphone 6 even if they don't like
the design yes
huh I mean why why would you because
it's the brand man i might my motto I
know I'm saying I mean it'll sell well
but like like if I don't like the design
why am I gonna buy it but I know the
general public issue yeah maybe for you
me and and Sean the answer would be no
but fer for the folks that don't give a
rat's the answer will be yes mm-hmm no i
phone gotta get it but if it if it's
like furry and stuff like people i don't
know if people i can get into that no
fingerprints on hair big like a
basketball like yes both six you can
dribble it yeah i don't like this design
i'm gonna buy scary it around like oh I
hope the next iphone is just one of
those magic eight balls yeah so like if
you want to send a message right like
it's asking Syria question but the
answers are always randomized yeah nosy
I i if I was the I tree I now
desperately want iphone 6 at the backish
70 shag carpet yeah yeah I feel like
Moto X could probably add that to the
motivation yes tried by that shag Moto X
check shag with a cup catches on fire
just like yeah we're from Sasha
Mahal Sean without a signature hat
what's going on that means that it's
actually finally gotten warm enough that
you out for me to where I he's storing
it in the style of other hats behind
that sheet okay funny store on up would
you just clean that shelf funny story
about the sheet so when I'm not filming
I lift it up so I don't walk on it and
about once a week now the air
conditioner will move it just enough to
sell off my motion detector camera in
here ah it's all good texted like a two
in the morning being invaded yes yes and
so it takes me directly to your whatever
movement had detected it i'll just see
the kern go I was trying to get out Sean
okay grinding it out yeah sure you know
what I expected she
Sean sheet at the season finale of next
year's true detective skinny the end
gonna be then lifting up the sheet and
just going time is a flat circle looking
up the sheet gonna be awesome yep yeah
but my sheet is going to have a starting
role and true detective season two I
think so oh my poor sheet but uh yeah
the Hat is still here in the office it's
just not on my head uh question about
and Joey I don't know if you had a
chance to look at this yet what do you
think of Google self-driving card new
design I haven't looked at of it yeah
that was cool I think it was announced
what last night or something it was
announced late last night and the thing
is the car has a top speed of 25 miles
per hour so this is not wholly yeah it's
not expected to like go driving on
highways or whatever I think this would
be awesome especially if it's electric
and I is it electric I don't know okay
will you okay I'm looking at it right
now I don't think it's electric why if
it was electric this would be awesome
for college campuses for large company
campuses for airports I the number of
uses would be endless you know for those
situations now for general consumer I
don't know any consumer that's gonna go
yeah I just bought this car it's got
tubs you to 25 miles per hour you can
imagine like for uber replacements in
cities like oh yeah if I wanted to go to
the grocery store it like comes up I get
in go to grocery store come back that'd
be cool and now New York City Oh would
work because I don't think anyone has
ever driven faster than 25 miles per
hour I don't know man some of Daddy's
hidden like 200 yeah and others like fly
through the frickin bike lane whatever
bro what's had a toy fair meeting on a
sunday morning in in New York and I was
staying up at like 57th and Toy Fair was
down like 23rd mm-hmm and so typically
it took me almost an hour on the
weekdays to get down there but I had
arranged that year for a special
me on Sunday so I I left like an hour
before my meeting i was there in like
three and a half minutes oh yeah they
don't they don't care yeah on Sunday
morning when there's no traffic it's
just like I don't care the population of
New York City drops Lee insanely
actually was it was telling a ver
somebody back in the day GPS and they
were showing like sort of the breathing
of Manhattan and the traffic patterns
and how like during the day like
everything was just super backed up and
then it was just empty their like again
at night so like at night you can go get
around real easy in a cabin is cheap but
yeah yeah we have you ever read they
buries a book about his trips to Japan
no I I need to find the segment for you
that was just about taking a cab ride in
Tokyo what does he describes it
basically as he thinks he passed through
somebody's living room at one point
hahahahaha the cab drivers in Japan are
hilarious man they really are with their
with their white gloves and like every
cab has like the lace heads headrest
really oh yeah oh yeah I've never been i
gotta guess with that well I know and
you do not open the door yourself they
they open it for you through a little
automatic system and you can actually
break the door if you open it don't you
dare touch it ever got yelled at about
that pretty quickly yeah you do not
touch the doors in the cabs Wow nice
yeah it is the most bizarre found a
curious ever got awesome you know as
opposed to like the the English cabbies
I think I i I've written cabs in London
Manchester edinboro I think I've had one
cab driver who did not engage me in a
trip length discussion either about
politics or sports Oh anyway I've heard
that black cabs are awesome black cabs
are the most awesome vehicles you know
I'm tall I'm 6 foot 4 yeah I can sit all
the way back in the seat stretch my legs
all the way forward and not touch the
divider
awesome that is yeah and fit all my
luggage in the back area with me yeah
dude black cabs and apparently those
cabbies know London like crazy to get
your hack license in London you have to
study for years and you're given a blind
test that changes I believe it's every
couple months so nobody can share it you
or you have to find the shortest route
between two spots from memory in written
form there you know see that's crazy i
don't think any other cab system is like
that in the world and sometimes when you
go to New York like there's I still get
in cash or dudes or using GPS right ya
know London cabbies are known for they
know every well it probably one of the
most complicated cities in the world
yeah there's no system to it well no cuz
it's its infrastructure that's been
developed for like a thousand years yd
exactly yeah exactly wow I never thought
we'd have a cab discussion on a man and
you're changin this interesting thing I
wouldn't see someone like do a real big
investigation on infrastructure and some
of the leading cities in the world and
see which cities are doing it right and
which cities are a complete mess in LA
hmm con la I cannot stand driving in
Chicago and LA you know I drove once
from irvine up to see a friend at the
next to the staple center the LA
Convention Center yeah it's called le
live now yeah yeah so I was driving up
there and I'm listening to my GPS it's
like in a quarter mile stay in the three
middle lanes in the right three lanes
and a quarter mile stay in the left
three lights like the thing that gets me
about LA so much is that like they could
eliminate the driving and gridlock
problem if they just had a train system
that made sense because of how
ridiculous their urban sprawl is their
train system Todd that is the craziest
face right now let's read an interesting
