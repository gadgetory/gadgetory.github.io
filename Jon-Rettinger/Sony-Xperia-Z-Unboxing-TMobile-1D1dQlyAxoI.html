Hazleton with TechnoBuffalo and today we
are checking out a white box now we're
checking out t-mobile's Xperia Z it's
from Sony and I'm gonna unbox it for you
right now
see on this we've got a little plastic
paper sticker thing that points to the
USB charging port on the Left memory
card the charging dock connector back
home and task buttons volume and zoom
that's on the right hand it's a zoom if
you're using the camera the power button
which Sony told me is becoming more and
more of this sort of steeple on their
product so everybody knows hey that's a
Sony and they actually had me close my
eyes and pick up the phone and say
where's the power button Micro SIM card
slot this is t-mobile so you get 4G LTE
support on the front you've got this
5-inch display it's Bravia Engine 2
technology throwing that anywhere let's
see we'll go to the back here again
we've got black and actually sort of
like a carbon-fiber inlay here along the
edges sony promises that's to make it
extra strong so that we've gone over the
sort of the side features of the phone
it is IP 55 and 57 resistant that means
resistant against water and dust i'll
get to that in a second let's just go
through the box real quick because this
isn't unboxing you get the charger looks
like they sort of put it together for us
as you can tell it's just a straight up
white box so I think they kind of set us
up this empty bag our sim tray or card
and some sony minnows have you got
guidelines and important information and
your Start Guide for the Xperia Z while
we turn it on let's go through some of
the features it's also have a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core processors the 5
inch screen up here 1080p Bravia Engine
2 as I said on the back you've got a 13
megapixel camera a single LED flash
t-mobile logo and again this runs on
t-mobile's LTE network which is
available in seven markets right now and
what happens if you don't have service
actually fall down to its HSPA+
two megabits per second network which is
actually pretty good other features on
this ball we're booting up include HD
voice and again the water resistance
means you can drop it into three feet of
water for up to 30 minutes so not too
bad so we're looking at this together
but I got a preview with them recently
in a meeting with Sony so I have an idea
of what's on this phone we've got the
Walkman I'll movie Sony select now we
saw all of these features already when
we reviewed this unit so let's go
through and see what else t-mobile is
added at the mobile hotspot t-mobile TV
t-mobile my account visual voicemail and
it looks like not much else which is
good because you sort of don't want all
that bloatware as I like to call it
t-mobile let the FM radio intact as well
let's go through some of the camera
features it has this nice there we go a
little delay on the camera there sure
we'll have I'll turn on GPS whatever
auto it's called superior auto mode now
this will automatically if you're in the
dark say let's see you see that little
icon that's popping up it says low light
and now let's see if it'll automatically
go into a macro mode let's see there's
an icon there it says macro so it
automatically knows what to do when you
have it in that mode so that you shoot
the best effects and because it's
water-resistant you can actually take
this underwater too and shoot although
usually this displays don't work
underwater so you're gonna want to make
sure you take that into account before
you take it below the surface to
megapixel front-facing camera here looks
like we've got lookout Mobile Security
installed on it we see that popping up
here 20 updates out of the box and I
don't know what version of Android this
is running so let's check that
4.1.2 okay so we're not running on four
to two jelly beans so it is slightly
behind everything feels super snappy
it's got the nice processor on there
help there's a little bit of bloatware
widgets if you want to deal with that
okay so now I've got the videos open
let's take a look at this display here
see how nice it looks and check out the
viewing angle and get the audio going to
the viewing angles look pretty good
there oh oh I'm not sure what just
happened with that your angles look okay
it screens really pretty looking those
are all popping out okay so that's a
quick look here at the t-mobile Sony
Xperia Z it launches in July for $99
down and it'll require $20 monthly
payments for 24 months if you get
approved for that credit on t-mobile's
new simple choice plans anyway quick
look here this is Tod Hazleton with
TechnoBuffalo
