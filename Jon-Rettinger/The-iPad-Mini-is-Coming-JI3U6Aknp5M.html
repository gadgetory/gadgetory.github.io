technobuffalo hear the rumors are about
to be put to rest Apple early this
morning sent out invitations for their
ipad mini event they've got a little
something more to show you let me go
ahead and tell you what you can expect
so invitations are out the iPad Mini is
going to be upon us I'm not gonna lie a
little part of me thought we would never
actually see an ipad mini every one of
those prototype devices just get tested
and tested and tested but never actually
at least turns out like that part of me
is done no more the iPad Mini is
absolutely coming what you can expect is
a seven point eight five inch version of
the bigger tablet that you've known to
come love or loathe pricing is still yet
to be determined but rumors of a lower
storage a gigabyte version starting at
$249 seem to be floating around quite a
bit with storage sizes going all the way
up to 64 and we're also hearing rumors
now cellular radio is going to be in
there despite rumors prior saying that
no no say that radio will be included
and if that holds true we should be
seeing AT&amp;amp;T versions verizon versions
and also sprint versions meeting we
could have up to 24 different variations
of the ipad mini also expected is a
revamped version of the imac with
updated specs filing a new design maybe
even a Retina display we may also see
the debut of the 13 inch Retina Display
MacBook Pro and redesigned mac mini
looks like everything that's not an
iphone is going to come close to getting
an update later on next week so you guys
excited not excited what do you think
about the ipad mini are you going to
pick one up you have no interest you
more interested in the microsoft surface
which coincidentally is coming out just
a few days after the apple event it is
tablets falling from the sky a lot of
awesome choice it's a great time to be a
consumer love to hear what you guys have
to think i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo see you next video
