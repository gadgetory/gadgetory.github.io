the black phone Elop heading up xbox
twitch on xbox one and candy gets
crushed Buffalo bulletin time hello
internet and welcome to the Buffalo
bulletin where we recap stories from our
site TechnoBuffalo calm every wednesday
and friday for interested in reading
more about any story on the show check

on the graphics if you have annotations

Harry top stories Mobile World Congress
kicked off earlier this week in
Barcelona Spain and we've got a ton of
coverage Nokia officially unveiled their
lineup of Android phones samsung
unpacked the much-hyped galaxy s5 the
gear to the gear 2 neo and gear fit
blackberry announced the Q 20 and z3
Sony's Xperia line expanded with Z 2 m 2
+ z2 tablet Intel unveiled a new 64-bit
Atom processor and that does not even
begin to cover it it's been a huge
conference thus far with a lots more to
come this week we've got both written
and video hands-on coverage of a lot of
these new devices and you can keep tabs
on what's happening at mwc all week on
our site last month silent circle and
geeksphone teamed up to reveal the black
phone and android handset they claimed
would offer the most secure and private
way to communicate on a smartphone this
week they announced black phone would be
available for pre-order starting at six
hundred and twenty nine dollars off
contract the phone offers a modified
private OS that includes specialized
apps from silent circle now some of
those apps are actually already
available for Android and iOS but a few
others are exclusive to the device the
device itself won't ship until April but
you know the NSA probably already knows
you're thinking about ordering one over
in gaming some major shifts happening
for xbox microsoft announced early this
week that stephen elop former head of
nokia would be replacing Julie
larson-green as the head of devices and
Studios division at the company that
puts him in charge of products like
Microsoft Surface and Xbox which is a
little unnerving considering we heard
rumors he would kill off Bing and sell
off Xbox if he ever became CEO of
Microsoft fortunately for gamers that
CEO gig went to Sachin Adele
but who knows if Elop might ever
convince him of spinning off or selling
xbox also happening in Xbox land twitch
announced this week full integration
would finally happen on the Xbox one
starting March 11th if that date sounds
familiar it's because that's the very
same convenient day titanfall drops for
Xbox one gamers everywhere will be able
to tell their connects Xbox broadcast
and twitch will on streaming with a
picture-in-picture inclusion of the
broadcaster it took a little longer than
the playstation 4 integration mostly
because Sony built the twitch app for
ps4 butt twitch built their own software
for the Xbox one come March 11th it'll
be raining Titans all over twitch lastly
our wildcard story this week is a big
smug deal with it to king.com who
recently filed a trademark for the word
candy they also later wanted to go after
the word saga but it looks like some
good old-fashioned internet rage drowned
King and wave after wave of bad reviews
and bad press and King officially filed
to abandon their trademark application
for the word candy this week proving
once again that hell hath no fury like
an Internet scorned hopefully they'll
also abandon their quest to trademark
saga but overall a candy crushing
victory for the denizens of the web
that's the buffalo bulletin for today if
