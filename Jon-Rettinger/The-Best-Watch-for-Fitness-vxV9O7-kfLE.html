to you by one razor so with the holidays
coming up I'm sure a lot of you guys are
sitting on your couches right now eating
cake eggnog and really not moving I
respect that but once the new year comes
around I'm sure a lot of you guys were
making year's resolutions about going to
the gym eating healthier and all that
kind of stuff so to help with that today
I want to take a quick look at a new
sport wearable the Moto 360 sport let's
go and get started so if you're like me
you're probably wondering what makes the
Moto 360 sport different from a regular
moto 360 and right off the bat is the
build
you got the silicon van which feels
pretty good but bear in mind it's not
really as formal or as classy as maybe a
leather one is the whole watch feels
lighter feels good on the wrist pretty
comfortable it's also ip67 water and
dust resistant not waterproof but should
you find with all kinds of sweat not
sure how many kinds of sweat there are
but your kind should be fine so as you
can imagine this specific exercise
really gets my heart rate going which is
another cool thing about the moto 360
sport the heart rate monitor is a
constant heart rate monitor meaning you
don't have to stop and stand still while
it measures your heart rate it can do it
whenever and will do it over the span of
something like a run or whatever you
call this one of the things I'm kind of
torn on with this device is the display
it's any light display which is
different from the standard Moto 360 it
doesn't look quite as good but it gives
you great outdoor visibility in short it
looks like an e-ink display in really
bright light so you're blazing the trail
like Lewis and Clark you're gonna be
like the GPS feature it gives you more
accurate stats on how far you're running
how fast you're running the pace all
that good stuff and when combined with
the heart rate monitor which is constant
like I mentioned in the Moto body app
overall you're getting a much more
cohesive workout experience versus the
Moto 360 and the saddest part is that
I'm getting tired from running in place
but that's why we hit the trail
what I like about the motor body
watchface is that it's interactive and
everything is kind of one touch away if
I hit the top right I get my steps walk
bottom right I get a timer bottom left I
get calories burned and top left I get
my heart rate monitor all very
convenient which is great when you're
working out so those are my thoughts in
the Moto 360 sport everything else here
for the most part is the same as the
Moto 360 you got Android wear your your
flat tire the good and the bad what do
you guys think let us know in the
comments below I'm normally not a huge
fan of wearables but I do like this
because it is more focused on the
fitness side of things give it a thumbs
up if you liked the video and hit that
subscribe button so you guys the next
one so as you can see I've been
connecting more with my inner athlete
and I think it's time for me to get a
little bit more aerodynamic swimmer
shave their legs I'm going to shave my
face and for that I'm going to go to
guys at one razor you can get one safety
razor 24 blades and a carrying case for
all under $20 check out get one razor
comb for more information linked in the
