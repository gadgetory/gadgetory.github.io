to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here welcome back the pisode of renter's
rips the show where I talk about
anything going on in my mind the world
of technology positive or negative up
this week it's all about the Xbox one I
temporarily stole the Xbox one from the
office and brought it home to want to
use it a bit more of course the lore of
titanfall was calling my name so I want
to share my experiences with using the
Xbox one before everybody's fanboy claws
come out let me clarify
I've always been an Xbox fan in fact
since the very first Xbox I've never had
a competitors console that is until the
current generation I never liked
controllers on the Playstations I always
felt cheap and like you never felt
really good in my hands I've got
particularly kind of larger size hands
and then I played with the brand-new
Dual Shock a control that comes with the
ps4 and I absolutely fell in love I
loved it it felt perfect so I start
thinking ps4 seems like a very viable
option to keep you out to decide which
console to bring home to my house of
course we reviewed both here at
TechnoBuffalo I thought I was gonna
switch it up a little bit and see what
Sony had to offer I've been loving the
PlayStation 4 of my house in fact I was
using it to stream pretty much
everything I was watching I hadn't
turned on my Apple TV on the better part
of three month because everything was
running through the ps4 it worked well
everything was really quick the quality
was great streaming a movie from Netflix
almost seemed like I had put in a disc
it was able to load so fast but the
battery life on the controller is really
really really bad as of right now there
really aren't any viable third-party
controller options out there at least
for controlling medias you've got to use
the actual controller that comes with
the console and been dying really fast
so I thought to myself self we've got an
Xbox one at the office the Xbox one has
voice controls and titanfall is coming
out perhaps you want to get an Xbox one
I haven't really used an xbox one much
since our initial review on I have just
got a software update so I thought it'd
be a perfect time to actually try it so
I grabbed
all of it came in late at night someone
could see me grab all the equipment and
sort of shuffled on out on I've been
kind of enjoying it I wanted to share a
few different experiences I'll talk a
little bit about the game side of it in
titanfall but out using the console nas
gaming machine but for streaming so
Microsoft making really a big push for
using it as sort of an all in one media
console but not with the controller
using just your voice if my issue with
the ps4 words a battery always dad I
thought it could be kind of fun to try
and use the Xbox one using just my voice
and my hands so over the weekends I
wanted to watch the jobs movie - one of
the Ashton Kutcher sidenote Kutcher was
actually pretty decent but the movie
wasn't abysmal mess probably some of the
worst anything I've ever seen it was
available to play in the Microsoft video
store so I thought okay no problem I did
old tutorials on Kinect
I said Xbox on I'm going to turn on all
your consoles right Xbox on area um it
loaded I used my hand I waved it up I
found what I wanted and then to launch
an app I can chose to push out and pull
back and sometimes it shuffles on over
the next icon you've got pans it was
about 50/50 so okay I had a launch
drawing application a couple times able
to go back by doing this and meanwhile I
see my wife on the other side of the
room looking at me and I got a very
crazy person I'm like I mean you look
you look silly using Kinect there's no
way around it I will say though it did
work and then once I was able to play
the movie everything worked really
smoothly by just saying xbox select you
get a little green icon show you what to
say and it really makes things easier
being able to say Xbox pause Xbox play
resume that kind of thing was really
easy I didn't miss having a remote at
all even with a baby screaming my wife
talking to me and still recognize just
my voice that was really cool to see the
voice out of Kinect works really really
well so the motion sensor using your
hand was a little bit iffy they go and
try and use the Xbox one is my only
streaming machine and not use a
controller at all it's a little bit of a
pain but it's kind of fun to still talk
to the console creeps me up that
connects always listening to me and I
got to leave it on my counter but it
didn't work as advertised and then the
real reason I want to bring it home
titanfall I love me
titanfall used to look like an
incredible game I always love you guys
even know where I go with this
immediately I always love the campaigns
I love playing through a story
Julie Davidson talked about the sanic
titanfall review and you can see the
link down below
looks like you're in such a rich rich
world you got weird dinosaur people
walking in the background it got dragons
there's so much story there and they
never talk about it at all I would have
loved to have gone through a campaign on
you should jumped right in to
multiplayer world even whatever they
call it campaign is still multiplayer it
plays really well the gameplay is really
smooth the backgrounds absolutely
gorgeous the textures are great the
gameplay was a lot of fun I still missed
a campaign Mauro Bing these for me this
is my Teeter super tiny titanfall review
if you love multiplayer games if you're
big into college do nemo so you play
multiplayer that you're going to friggin
love titanfall if you like to play
through campaigns you like the story
sort of get lost in the cinematography
of a game this might not be the one for
your sleeves bear that in mind
so let me exhale for just a quick second
take a look at - hairy face need to
shave we could thank our friends at
Dollar Shave Club I can go use one of
their razors so buying razor is kind of
a giant pain in the butt you got to
dredge the store you got to try and find
the key to that razor fortress deal you
got a shell out take those amount of
money for shave tech that you probably
don't need a razor it worked fine when I
was a teenager I don't need something
that vibrates I can use in the shower
we're gonna you I don't need all that
creative technology but for soon there's
a company that's doing away with all
that superfluous business and it's
called Dollar Shave Club and it couldn't
be any easier for a few bucks a month
Dollar Shave Club ships amazing razors
and other bathroom stuffs to your door
and the blades just as good as really
any other competitors out there
I really just a fraction of the price
they've also got dr. Carver's easy shave
butter to make your shave even more
buttery smooth actually works really
really well it doesn't have like a big
thick white froth it's sort of smoother
almost like a cream the more although
try dollar shave club if you have to
shave you might as well save some time
and money in fact you can shave time and
shave money

so the moral here with the xbox one it's
in
of the experience over when I first
reviewed it and this is really when it
first came out I've enjoyed it I really
the controller still doesn't feel as
good to me as Sonia's but I really like
the quickness of the d-pad on Xbox
controller and I just sort of found
myself trying to use it more and more so
you know six have dozen of the other
they're both good consoles it's been fun
to try to use something which is now
different to me I don't think the UI on
the Xbox ones I know a garble mess I
don't think the tile interface really
works very well but you know hopefully
they'll change that certainly when we
saw the UI and the original Xbox 360
versus what it looked like you know it
looks like now is totally different I
think we'll see something similar on the
Xbox one so kind of rambling but just my
overall impressions and opinions with
using the Xbox one what do you guys
think my missing something
