probably invoke some fort of like
guttural feeling whatever that might be
just put it aside and let's check out
the latest flagship from Samsung so I
want to get a chance to really
experience and use the phone before we
just rush to do a review so I used it
for over two and a half weeks I took it
with me as my main device on a road trip
from Chicago to New Jersey and I don't
think there's a better more objective
way to really get to know a phone than
to be stuck in a car for 10 plus hours
just using the thing I'm John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo and this is
our review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
let's get some of these elephants in the
room out of the way the galaxy note 9 is
expensive there's no way around it
starting at a thousand bucks going up
twelve fifty in the pantheon of premium
phones as kind of odd as it might sound
right now the note nines pricing is
right in line at the competition and
maybe even gives you a bit more value in
quotes depending on your future
priorities but we are gonna get to that
it's also a hundred percent iterative
from last year's no date may be of issue
with it but I loved the no dates
aesthetic so as long as the design isn't
bleed into the next three plus years I
have no problem there and don't take the
iterative part to mean there aren't some
surprises because there actually were
plenty so one such area of improvement
in a big surprise was battery Samsung
what big like really big increasing the
capacity by about 20-ish percent from
last gen and that was a whopping four
thousand milliamp hours and the results
speak for themselves
so on the road trip we were filming a
ton of content and I was texting the
note pretty hard using it as a hotspot a
camera and about everything else that I
could and the thing lasted like a champ
and I purposely didn't just plug it in
while driving I wanted to see its
endurance with auto brightness turned on
I was looking at about five and a half
to six hours of screen on time and went
almost a day and a half before the thing
just died and that was super stellar and
really impressive maybe not the best in
Mobile when you factor in its powering a
six point four inch qHD screen it's
crazy impressive also worth noting
though the default display is set to
full HD plus and speaking of screen I'm
just gonna say this now as a matter of
fact Samsung makes the best screens in
mobile and the note 9 is the best
display I've ever made that you'd expect
that it's incredible and pretty much
every circumstance thing just shines
colors are bright outdoor visibility is
stellar and just about everything is
awesome I'm still impressed every year
at the displays Samsung puts on their
phones the displays look like there's
just a sticker on it if any displays
still holds up I have zero use for any
of the edge features but you dig how it
makes a phone look noise and games all
look great and also odd note but
speaking of movies
you're really good not quite like boom
sound level good but a drastic
improvement over the note eights and the
s9 plus so it's really pleasant surprise
so while that screen is absolutely
awesome it's also notch Allah so big ups
to you Samsung but man it is a big old
package the build quality is outstanding
and I'm glad it's got a metal bound
around the side because I almost dropped
the thing four separate times while
taking it out to try to film it's a big
phone there's there's no way around it
if you're not down with the giant phone
try it in store or look at something
else entirely buttons feel great so
we're T to point out but some of the
phones are tested recently it kind of
mushy buttons including the big speed
button and it's here and you can't remap
it that a third-party app and that just
sucks so we had the blue color which
absolutely loved the glass back looks
incredible at least it did we took it
out of the box but about five minutes
later it looks like I rubbed my hands in
oil and wipe them all over the back of
the phone here this phone will never
look clean accept it embrace it or just
put a D brands get on it and give it
some scratch protection as well that's
what i did ii got back from the road
trip we've got the yellow carbon fiber
if you like the look it also matches the
cool yellow S Pen and put a link to it
down below the camera setup here is
almost identical to the s9 + so you know
it's good give them a tunnel light
you're gonna get some of the best
pictures in the business low light still
looks good it's got dual aperture normal
pictures or a bit over processing
saturated but at this point that's just
becoming like a Samsung hallmark if you
don't like it
settings can just be tweaked and
speaking of settings there's some new AI
at work to detect where you taking
pictures of it seems like a me to play
from Samsung's and everyone's doing it
also you should know the built-in mics
are way better than last year's now we
are at Notre Dame Stadium I've wanted to
see this pretty much my entire life
so with the new Bluetooth enabled s-pen
the Blue Note and yellow pen looked like
the Best Buy or Michigan version I
really use the s-pen take many pics in
fact I didn't really use it much but if
a stylus is your jam it's here and it
works almost identical to previous
versions which is just code for like it
works pretty well but always not awesome
in note 9 land the iris detection would
not work with
glasses like never works not even once
that was super annoying I had to use a
fingerprint reader that mercifully has
been moved to below the cameras I
thought it might have just been me or my
polarized sunglasses so Robert tried
them and had the same results it didn't
work which is really annoying
considering it worked on the galaxy 9
Plus and then no date so I don't know
it's different here with the note 9 it's
funny oh good phones have gotten
performances now almost like a dead
category the Snapdragon 45 and 6 gigs of
ram combo it's surprisingly commonplace
now the phone fell fast
I had no slowdown and really expect to
either Samsung skin UI whatever you want
to call it is pretty heavy but at this
point it's polished but I do so wish
updates just came faster also of note if
there's a ton of additional band support
in the note and I and supposedly
improved LTE speeds and ordinarily I
wouldn't comment on this since it just
be testing in my home area in my home
city but since I drove across the
country I was not that impressed with
the ability to hold a signal or its data
speeds so while I was driving I also
created my iPhone 10 with me and they
both had Timo Sims in them there were
many times my iPhone would have serviced
when the note didn't and a lot of times
I to switch over to the iPhone to upload
pictures because data speeds were slower
on the note 9 and against I was able to
test in like seven different states I
thought it was kind of worth mentioning
here so I did a few complaints but the
note 9 is pretty much smartphone
perfection samsung has been polishing
honing their phones it's culminated in
the note 9 if you want any phone that's
going to be fast going to be powerful
it's gonna check off pretty much every
super phone box you want including ip68
expandable storage wireless charging
fast charging samsung pay really big
battery you're gonna be hard-pressed to
find anything better than the samsung
galaxy note 9 if you want to get a new
phone and you can deal with the size the
note 9 is a great way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
