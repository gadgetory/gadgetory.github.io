TechnoBuffalo here and in his flagship
unboxing time I've got in my very eager
hands the latest from Samsung this is
the Galaxy s5
we've got the international variant
right here with an octa-core processor
or two quad core depending on how you
want to look at it I've had a chance to
take a look at the phone yet so really
excited to dig in so let's stop talking
and start unboxing so here is the box
for the galaxy s5 looking very familiar
and it's sort of fake wood grain to the
galaxy s4 except it's got a giant v on
it the version we have here is the
octa-core international variants which
if we flip this guy over it's got two
quad-core processors one at 1.9
gigahertz and one at 1.3 you pick up
most versions you're going to get a 2.5
gigahertz quad-core processor inside
let's go ahead and open this sucker up
boom there is a galaxy s5 looks like
this one's been manhandled a bit before
and there it is that is the s5 with its
Indian playback push it off the side for
a quick second so we're gonna get in
this international versions box case you
want to keep track at home it is the G
908 variant we've got typical USB cord
except this time it is micro USB it's
not USB 3.0 we've got headphones there
we're also gonna have a power brick and
that is about it here's a phone though
that's why everybody's here to get all
this garbage off to the side power it on
and let's run through the specs of the
Galaxy s5 which announced is powered by
Android as they are required to do we
were looking at a supposedly very
gorgeous 5.1 inch green with a 1920 by
1080 resolution if you can do quick math
that is 432 PPI and if it's it's AF HD
Super AMOLED display Android 4.4.2 at
launch is here it's got 2 gigs of RAM
inside of it either 16 or 32 bit
configurations but don't let that throw
you off it's got a micro SD card that
can hold up to 128 gigs on it on the
back we've got a 16 megapixel camera
they're on the front we've got a two
megapixel shooter it's got Wi-Fi of
course 802 of an ABG and an AC bluetooth
4.0 and a 2800 milliamp hour battery of
course NFC something noticeable changes
versus the s4 you've got a heart rate
monitor built right in there sure where
the flash is and you've got a
fingerprint sensor now built right into
the home button as well
design-wise looks very familiar to the
galaxy s4 you've got your volume buttons
living there on the left on the right
you've got your power and lock button
3.5 millimeter headset jack and the
bottom below this little flap there is a
USB 3.0 port and the flap is air because
it is water resistant is actually a sort
of a rubber gasket all around the back
here and also some protection inside of
the headphone jack there let me go ahead
and get this guy all set up and take
quick look at the phone itself so we've
got the phone all powered on I will say
on first blush the screen is gorgeous
Samsung really knows how to do their
displays so here is the new TouchWiz a
little bit flatter but still just as
bright I can see all sort of the built
in touch with apps we'll go through this
and more depth when you are for review
and do a software tour you can see
what's here notable changes go ahead and
pull this down you see it's got a
flatter look s finder and quick-connect
s finder is it gives you sort of a
universal search for your phone with
really nice feature to have continue to
pull down and if you love shortcuts
there quite a bit here you go ahead and
see everything that's there it's sort of
done with the Samsung style icons but
that's standard Android stuff let's go
ahead and jump in we'll go to settings
you can see what that looks like there
it's been totally redone so it might
look unfamiliar to you but it's so
broken up instead of tabs across its now
as you scroll down so you've got quick
settings network connections connect and
share sound display personalization
motion gesture air view user backup
system and then all of your applications
application settings are there as well
and again you've got a fingerprint
sensor built in here as well which is
kind of a new feature so some of the
other noticeable things that are here
you've got ultimate power saving mode
see that you power saving mode I've got
25
battery left in the phone about 24
percent that would give me 3.1 and DS
and standbys you're gonna have a ton of
standby time here sort of pairs this
phone down to its its core functions
scroll over to the left you've got the
new my magazine features built into the
phone it looks sort of similar to what
we've seen on other Samsung devices but
a bit of a snazzy UI on here so of
course we'll do a full overview it will
run through all the fingerprints that a
scanner will show you the heart rate
monitor and show you all the cool s
features that are packed in to the s5
any particular you want to see I leave
in the comments down below let me bring
in some competitors and some older
generation phones see if they all look
like so we've got of course the s5 and
the HTC One m8 squared off right there
you can see the two of them side-by-side
they're friends ish definitely a
different feel to both devices you've
got the metal versus the plastic so much
ever you prefer here is the kid brother
the Galaxy s4 and certainly the s5 looks
for these from design standpoint an
evolution over the design that Samsung
pioneered with the s4 and for good
measure
here is an iPhone 5s singing of both of
these guys look like next to each other
of course side by side and let's make
just a giant phone sandwich won't put
ensure that the s5 is the one on the
bottom so it'll be at least on my
right-hand side right here so you can
see what all those look like when they
are all together for a very weird family
portrait so what do you guys think about
the Galaxy s5 and in particular you want
to see a show of course will show all
the new sensors and show the screen and
the software what we want to do whatever
you guys want to see so please leave
comments down below and let us know
whatever that might be will compare with
other flagship devices of course and up
you guys decide if this is the right
phone to grace your pocket for the next
one to two years say an X on it what's
