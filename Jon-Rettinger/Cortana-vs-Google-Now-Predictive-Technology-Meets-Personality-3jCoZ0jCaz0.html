to you by godaddy what's up everyone jon
rettinger from technobuffalo here last
week we had a battle of digital
assistants we had apples series squaring
up get Microsoft's Cortana the logical
continuation to that is to show you how
Google now stacks up against Microsoft
latest so go ahead put these two
head-to-head and see which one you think
comes out on top so the usual caveats
here are going to apply Cortana is still
very clearly in beta and beyond that
it's running on a beta OS in Windows
Phone 8.1 so take that for what you will
on the left of course we've got google
now running on an AT&amp;amp;T version of the
HTC One m8 someone asked exactly the
same questions that I did when I
compared Siri versus Cortana so you can
see how both would compare let's go
ahead and start and usually when I've
done these up hitting both the same time
see which one come to a quicker but I'm
going to go one of them the other two I
want you be able to hear what the phone
say and how quickly they say it what's
the weather outside it's 86 degrees and
partly cloudy in irvine and Cortana
could launch either by hitting the
search button or just the iconic you've
got it there what's the weather outside
it's currently 85 n clear so you see
different there and how the information
is shown you got the grayscale or the
black and white scale rather and sort of
the google card look on google now let's
go for some sports questions who won the
angels game so that took me to the web
you sometimes it'll show you the actual
score though who won the angels game on
monday the los angeles angels defeated
the cleveland indians 623 that they did
set an alarm for 30 minutes setting
alarm for 1203 p.m. you can wait for the
blue bar to go over to the end where you
can just hit set alarm
that's how that works set alarm for 30
minutes all right your alarm is set for
1203 p.m. very quick let's do some
reminders remind me to buy milk so it'll
pick when and where I should also say
that both these are connect to the same
Wi-Fi networks here at the office remind
me to buy milk tomorrow sure thing so
both of them asked the same questions
what day and what time Google now does
it with Tex in Syria and Syria right now
Cortana rather does it with voice not
Syria of course our next let's try
opening applications launch Chrome
opening up let go and lunch in chrome
launch internet explorer all right
starting internet explorer so go ahead
and launch internet explorer now what
about if you want to go to a website so
let's try that go to TechnoBuffalo com
opening web page so that would go and
open the webpage wait so that blue bar
goes across or just select it go to
TechnoBuffalo calm so that pulls up a
Bing search you can select it right from
there let's ask it some sports questions
how old is Kobe Bryant Kobe Bryant is 35
years old how old is Kobe Bryant Kobe
Bryant is 35 years old khob a that's try
movie times show me movie times for
Captain America

are the 10 questions that i wanted to
show but just for fun let's do one more
tell me a joke tell me a joke why didn't
the spider go to school because you
learned everything on the web hmm it
shows a bit of personality that Cortana
has so what do you guys think certainly
Google now I think is the crème de la
crème of digital assistants before but
Cortana while still kind of late to the
game still in beta is really really good
so don't really can't decide which one's
best which one's going to work the best
in future but I didn't want to show that
Cortana despite being new is really up
to par with the best digital assistant
going right now so I think Microsoft did
a really nice
job but you know what do you guys think
so what you guys think about google now
vs. Cortana certainly Cortana still in
beta but it's a pretty strong showing
for a beta product let's hear your
thoughts well maybe this help you
determine which phone you want to get
maybe look differently at Windows Phone
or no way you are solely only looking at
Google hope to hear you guys thoughts on
it please leave the comments located
