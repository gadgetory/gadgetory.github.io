editor at technobuffalo calm and I'm
here with a look at Proteus get ready
for it
man so do you guys remember that one
time when I was all like anti chamber is
gonna be one of the strangest games we
ever feature on we play it's unlike
anything we've ever shown off in this
series before we'll probably never used
something like it again I lied terribly
if antechamber was weird I don't even
know where to start with Proteus Proteus
is I don't know it's really weird so
we're antechamber was a puzzle solving
game Proteus is one of those things that
kind of starts to skirt the line of
being a game at all this is an
exploration title just take it in for a
second you saw how it starts that was
the first time I fired this game up this
is actually the first time I'm playing
this game right here what you're seeing
right now is the first time i'm playing
Proteus I'm just meant to explore an
island so just listen to the music and
pay attention to the graphics it's going
to be strange
let me clarify that statement I made
just a minute ago you know the one about
Proteus skirting line of being a game
Proteus according to its creators is a
game according to my personal stance it
can be interact with it has a sense of
progression and it tells it a sort of
story he's a mechanic's familiar to the
wall of gaming so it's a game when I say
story I don't necessarily mean like a
stricken area it just kind of tells them
I don't know the feeling of this island
that you're on however Proteus has no
clear and finite end goal aside of
exploring there's no real sense of
victory that comes from defeating like a
boss or an enemy the only winning that
can be achieved is satiating that sense
of wanderlust there's no boss there's no
direct conflict no strict line of puzzle
no real sense of victory produce is
about exploration it's like a for ray
and sound music and visual stimulation
it's weird it's pretty and it sounds
really great and it's just this strange
bizarre creation
so this is an experience that will cost
you ten dollars you can buy it from the
developers site visit proteus com and
they'll actually give you a mac and
Windows version instantly that's drm
free and they'll include the steam
version so ten bucks and you can support
the developers directly and buy in on
this really bizarre experience it it's
kind of an odd thing to put into words
but going to the island on Proteus even
virtually and for the brief time that I
was there during this video recording
this video i should say it's kind of
brought about this really odd sense of
childish wonder like you're experiencing
these really strange noises and that
this really strange environment complete
with the weather and odd creatures great
strange bizarre music and it just brings
about this feeling of
all don't really know what to make of it
you don't know how to process it as you
want to explore it and that's one thing
that I have to say these to add key and
David cantata kanaga i guess i'm reading
that I'm sorry David if you ever watched
this video I'm so sorry so edit ated
just kind of really achieve this this
world that had to be exporting commands
exploration is something that you get in
and go yes I want to walk over there and
I want to walk over there and now
there's some odd shapes in the
background and I want to see those
you'll see me kind of looking around
here in circles as I'm in this odd
cemetery style place and I'll notice
some statues just off in the distance on
the mountaintop and I go to them
and there's no real reason other than
they're clearly beckoning and something
needs to be done about that so I go and
that's what Proteus is it's just
deciding to go and explore and then they
reward you for it they reward you for
walking out there with these really
strange moments and odd effects and
something special happens at the end of
this video that I was not expecting at
all I'm not going to give it away now
it's five minutes away but i have to say
kudos to these guys for creating an odd
world without a real set of rules other
than walk around and be rewarded for
walking around I like that about this
game and that's definitely what makes it
worth ten bucks it's bizarre it's not
for everyone and I'm not going to sit
here and say that you're gonna love
Proteus but if you're the type of person
who enjoys these types of things who
likes these unique experiences I
recommend it it's weird but it's great
it's really exploratory and that's
what's awesome about it
all right now that that moment with the
strange statues atop the hill is over
you're going to see me walk towards this
kind of area of cascading stars but
looked almost like a waterfall I was
playing I just felt I needed to go over
there truly is in line with what the
games trying to achieve I mean there's
so many moments like the one that you're
seeing right now we're just the world
instantly comes to life and pushes you
further so like I said I really
recommend Proteus to those of you who
want to experience something different
we'll be back with more normal games in
the coming weeks we've already done Sly
Cooper in between this and antechamber
but if you guys like this type of thing
let me know I'm more than happy to keep
doing and I love playing these types of
games and diving into the unexplored
world of indie gaming and the strange
and special stuff that they offer up for
now I've been joey davidson check out
the gaming stuff and all the stuff at
TechnoBuffalo com thanks for watching
