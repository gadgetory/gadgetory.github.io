to you by Linda what's up everyone John
written from TechnoBuffalo here and I've
got in my hand be very hard to find one
plus is the 5.5 inch smartphone may buy
a brand new Chinese startup that's
taking the mobile world by storm
it's bringing a ton of hype with it
let's go ahead and open it up it's even
swarthy
of all that attention I took here's the
box for the very diminutive oneplus
before you guys ask unfortunately we
don't have any invites it's got kind of
a soft touch feel to it comes in a
separate box with what I assume is going
to be the power adapter go ahead and
slide the sucker out of the box I have
not seen one these in person yet so I'm
very excited it's kind of nice
presentation of it also has that soft
touch on the red and boom oh the
climactic boom there it is the oneplus
sitting in its little oneplus shelf it's
look like there's a screen protector on
it which is kind of weird go ahead and
pull it up just turn over get out of the
box does not want to come out of the box
and there is the oneplus and all of its
5.5 inch glory and there's a little logo
on the back this is like the Loch Ness
monster phones the Yeti of mobile
devices often talked about very hard to
find push off the side for a real quick
second thinking else into the box in the
soon we're gonna have that much else
we've got this thing I don't know what
that thing is but we have it so that's
very exciting for us we have a anti
tangling micro USB to kind of cool
looking USB port there we've got I
assume this is your sim removal tool by
the way all jokes aside then we've got
some books on things in here it says
fingertips and we'll know if somebody
got copied all in Chinese I cannot speak
what I believe is Mandarin or cannot
read Mandarin so unfortunately that just
looks like squigglies to me push all
that stuff off to the side take a look
at this last little box that came with
everything someone's going to be the
wall wart I would suppose that to save
some a shipping costs they are shipping
the Woolworth separately depending on
what country you're in so push that out
and there it is a wall wart with USB
port very exciting but that is not while
you are here you're gonna take a look at
this guy this is the one plus and I go
ahead and power it on and we can run
through all the specs take a quick

that's ly n G aid comm so I
TechnoBuffalo so we've got this sucker
all booted up and at first I thought we
weren't gonna get one head cyanogen on
it but we do it has cyanogen it's based
on 11s Android 4.4 so cyanogen so one of
the few phones actually ships with the
very awesome signage and ROM on it as I
mentioned you've got a 5.5 inch screen
to 1920 by 1080 display if you could do
a very quick math that means it has a
401 pipi or pixels per inch it's being
powered by a 2.5 bigger - Qualcomm
Snapdragon chip it's the 801 so it's
quad core 3 gigs of ram 16 or 64 gigs of
storage I believe ours is 16 but we're
saying hey John no big deal I'll pop it
a microSD card you're gonna be out of
luck because you cannot to do that it
doesn't have a slot for it
it does have cameras up on the back it's
got a 13 megapixel shooter on the front
we've got a 5 megapixel shooter that
lives right there it's got its support
for most networks here a lot of the gsm
LTE networks HBO the pop in your SIM
card get L to you really on anything you
are but if they check for compatibility
based on region and carrier it's like a
first look at
the OS and the phone itself so first
that's logo you don't see very often
anymore usually it is Chrome I can see
on the bottom here you probably can't
even see it on camera
there's a menu button a home button in
the back button they don't appear to be
backlit maybe that's somewhere in the
settings but they are there let's go
ahead and jump on and take a look and
see what's going to come out of the box
about really quick you'd expect that
though from from cyanogen I'll go ahead
and jump down to the bottom and this is
how you know you've got something
special
add the box you've got super user right
there don't do any sort of routing to
get access to that go down and check out
about phone cyanogen updates based on
Android 4.4.3 go ahead and go back home
what else is going to be in here looks
pretty standard googly stuff about the
extras that cyanogen gives you like
terminal emulator I will go ahead and go
back home it's kind of hard to find at
home but not being able to see it
pulling this down pretty standard
Android fair on the lockscreen though
things are a little bit different and go
ahead and pick what apps you want to
launch they've got a key weather all
queued up and ready for you on your left
hand side device you've got your volume
rocker pronounce where your SIM card is
going to live on the bottom there's
where you're gonna charge and sync and
it's flanked by dual speakers on the
right hand side power and lock button on
the top 3.5 milimeter headset jack
coming back that is your camera and that
is about it so we're gonna run this guy
through there's a battery of tests but I
want to know what you guys want to see
anything particular you want to see
covered on the oneplus be sure to let us
know leave in the comments located right
