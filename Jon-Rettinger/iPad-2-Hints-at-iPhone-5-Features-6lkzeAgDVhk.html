technobuffalo here as one rumor mill
cranks to a halt another one starts its
grinding what does the ipad 2 mean for
the iphone 5 now I know what you're
saying John I petty was just announced
stop with the rumors why are you talking
about Apple well my general rule of
thumb is that if I get five emails in
one day a particular topic i will make a
video because it means a lot of you are
interested in what the question is this
particular topic I've received 10 emails
on today from either the contact us link
on TechnoBuffalo or via YouTube p.m. so
i thought i'd be interest and actually
talk about on camera now there's been a
ton of ipad 2 news coming out today I
understand if you're a little bit
saturated on it it's been tough sort of
look at any tech site really anywhere
and not be sort of plastered with Apple
news Apple's a very polarizing company
some people love it some people hate it
some people are right in the middle so I
want to give you guys a bit of
disclaimer before you watch this video
all right so now we've gotten that out
of the way and those that are continuing
to watch are the ones that are actually
curious I think the ipad 2 actually
gives a very good signal and hint as to
what we can expect with the iphone 5 on
the iphone 5 and the iphone in general
has been on a bout a year-long release
cycle since it was first released in
2007 with a new model coming out about
every june june ish let's just say so
right now we're in March so we're after
the later end of the release cycle about
a quarter or so left to go before
presumably will see a new iphone 4 so
what is the ipad to tell us about the
iphone what we saw the a4 chip that
power the iphone 4 debut first in the
eye from the original ipad so now we've
got a new a5 chip which is dual core
gives you nine times the graphics
capabilities and twice as fast and all
that business so chance
our we're going to see that same a5
system on a chip architecture migrated
over to the iphone 5 so what that's
going to mean is you're going to be able
to export your videos much faster via
the hdmi accessory which presumably will
also make its way to the iphone 5 the
hdmi cord that was announced today is
backwards compatible with the iphone 4
which all i'm going to show video in
720p presumably the iphone five will
show the video in 1080p like the ipad 2
is capable of we also saw the ipad to
lose a lot around the waist on obviously
we will see the iphone 5 get a little
bit thinner that one was a no-brainer
but the percentage of thinness is pretty
astounding so right now the ipad 2 is
actually thinner than what we see with
the iphone 4 i'm sort of gotten both
right here you can see the difference
you know there's a little bit of a
tapered edge you know if you can see
that right there with me sort of glaring
over the side there's a bit of tapered
edge on the initial iPad it's more of a
flat back now on the ipad 2 so we'll see
the iphone sort of lose a little bit in
the fitness apartment when there's first
announced it was the thinnest smartphone
on the planet it since many Clips many
times over by several Android devices
and you know I believe some windows
phone 7 devices will see an improvement
in battery life Apple was able to sort
of up the specs of the iPad and still
keep the 10 hour battery legs hopefully
that same battery technology will
translate over to the iphone 5 so the
obvious thing that we're going to see
with an iphone 5 and this sort of we've
been a problem in that in a duck
category much like the cameras in the
ipad 2 sitter faster better battery what
we're not going to see is just as
interesting we heard no mention of 4G
LTE either on ET and cheese upcoming
network or verizon's already existing 4G
LTE network so I think we're going to
miss out unfortunately on 4g in the
iphone 5 which I find extremely
disappointing what I'm really hoping for
with the iphone 5 now talked about this
in many videos is a revamp iOS we saw
iOS 4.3 make it steep
you coming march 11th what I'm hoping
we're going to see in June or July time
frame is a debut iOS 5 with a redesigned
user interface and I'm not going to get
into my thoughts on iOS right now but
splice to say it's gotten the various
Dale if you want to know what I think
more about it there's a link down below
where i talk about my thoughts on iOS so
again like i was with the ipad what I'm
more interested in is a user experience
and less about the raw hardware specs
very curious to what you guys have to
say or do you think that am I missing
anything do you think the ipad 2 is no
correlation at all to the iphone 5
really a sort of interested to hear what
you guys have to say so leave your
comment down below i'm jon rettinger
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video I'll leave you with my I'm
record
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
