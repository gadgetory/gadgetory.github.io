with an unboxing for you of the Motorola
Pro Plus mobile phone 2.3 Gingerbread on
here and as you can see we have both a
touchscreen and a QWERTY keypad so a
quick look around the box for you side
profile of the phone there a few little
pieces of specification details about
the phone and of course the product shot
on the front here so let's get this
unboxed for you have a look around the
handset now this is sporting a 1
gigahertz processor and it has 4
gigabytes of internal storage and you
can of course put micro SDHC card in
here up to 32 gigabytes so let's take
the hands out itself we pop this to one
side come back to that in a short while
further down inside the box we have got
the back of the phone grab this out
straight away so this has got eyesore
textured feel to it and it is made of
plastic so no metal on the back of this
one we have also got a battery where as
the battery out and it is a three point
how you even volt battery and it's
fifteen hundred and fifty milli amp
hours so fairly decent capacity battery
for this handset
in this little bag here we have got the
micro USB connection standard USB
connection on this end and we are in the
UK so we get a 3 pin UK plug now if
you're watching this in the US and you
pick one of these up you're going to
have to use one of your own power
adapters or make sure you get a country
specific power adapter with the 2 pin
plug on there USB connection on the top
for charging the handset in this little
bag here we get a hands-free kit
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
on one end the two headphone bits here
to go in your ears and we have got a
click to talk remote in the middle here
with a little tiny microphone there for
making and taking calls right down in
the bottom of the box we have got some
smart safe protected this is just legal
information and then we've got some
details about the handset itself how to
get up and running and get your handset
all powered up and ready to go so let's
pop all of this to one side and I'll
give you a look around the Motorola Pro
Plus so it's fairly large handset
actually but no slide-out keyboard I've
obviously got this keyboard visible all
the time let's ER get this battery in
and see if we can get this powered up
sorry about Reese not seen like so we've
got room here for the SIM card and then
room here for a micro SD memory card as
well remember this sport up to 32
gigabytes let's pop the back on bottom
in first and then click it all the way
around and it is really plasticky but
once that backs on it does feel very
nice in the hand let's power this
handset on we've got a power button at
the top here and whilst this is starting
up let's have a look around the handset
so we've got a microphone pick up here
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
it will tap here for taking the back on
and off and of course that power on/off
button on this side we've got a volume
rocker and it's quite a nice design a
nice sleek design on that so side
profile so that really does look nice so
it's very fetching on the side profile
on the bottom here we've got another
little microphone pick up when you're
making and taking those calls and then
round on this side we've got the micro
USB connection for charging and
synchronizing your device obviously on
the front we've got the screen which is
a 640 by 480 resolution screen measures
3.1 inches and then on the bottom here
we've got the QWERTY keypad and just
above the QWERTY keypad we've got the
touch sensitive buttons for menu home
back and searching the device round on
the back we've got five megapixel camera
and this 5 megapixel camera is indeed
autofocus with an LED flash so let's get
all of my detail was put into the
handset and then I'll come back to you
with a quick tour around the Motorola
Pro Plus so I'll run through that
initial setup on the Motorola Pro Plus
and we're presented with that 640 by 480
3.1 inch screen it's got a scratch
resistant Corning Gorilla Glass on the
front and even though it's quite low res
the text as you can see there is pretty
well-defined as we swipe between the
home screens you'll see there is some
lag and jitter on occasion you'll see
this more apparent when I'm showing you
a website and that is probably down to
the one gigahertz process and not quite
being up to scratch but it still
performs ok let's go back out to that
home screen and show you a little bit of
browsing and we go up to this top bar
here and let's use this QWERTY keypad we
go to take a note Buffalo if I can type
correctly here we go so we're on the
TechnoBuffalo website we're connected
via Wi-Fi and that's loaded pretty
quickly and let's pop into one of the
articles and
let's have a look at the pinch-to-zoom
it's pretty pretty responsive and as you
can see this is what I was mentioning
before that even though we've got that
low resolution screen there's a good
definition to the text so a nice
browsing experience on the motor rotor
Pro Plus and it does scroll nicely as
well even though we've got a slight
jitter
on occasions it doesn't perform too bad
at all have a look at the viewing angles
as well and see here side on you have to
excuse the reflection of my monitor in
the background there let's try it this
way so you can see a fairly good viewing
angle on there and again this way so the
screen is pretty good let's take a look
at this keyboard as well so we've got a
physical keyboard on here and you can
see that the shaping of the keys and the
spacing is decent as well and it does
provide a fairly good sort of tactile
feedback I think that's a pretty good
keyboard for quite a low price phone so
this is my first look at the motor rotor
Pro Plus this is going to cost you
around about 320 pounds in the UK and
that's for an unlocked SIM free version
if you're in the u.s. that equates to
around about 480 dollars
beat shoutout must go to clothe
technology at closed-door code at UK for
sending me through this handset to take
a look at thank you very much for
watching I will see you all in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
