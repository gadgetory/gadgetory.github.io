technobuffalo and in this video we're
going to take a look at the hardware of
the new zune HD before we actually turn
on the device and look at the software
and look at how it compares to the ipod
touch so to start a little note on size
as we mentioned in the unboxing the zune
HD is a very petite device very
lightweight but how small is it well
here it is compared to a standard credit
card quite small and here it is compared
to the ipod touch again so definitely
smaller than the ipod touch obviously
bigger than a credit card so the screen
is 3.3 inches diagonal and again it uses
OLED screen technology which no other
media player of this kind has yet let's
zoom in on the bottom here down here we
have the zune logo +1 button that will
bring you back home to the main screen
and again we're going to go through all
of this in the software tour and other
comparison videos now what's interesting
if we turn over to the size that we see
the zune HD is kind of built-in wafers
so there are there's a black layer gray
layer and black layer and this is
continued throughout the entire device
it's a really interesting way that they
built the device and it looks quite nice
too this button here brings up the play
controls on the screen so whether you're
in internet browsing or the marketplace
this button will always take you back to
just a kind of overlay screen where you
can adjust the volume and change the
track on the bottom we have the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack next to the
syncing and charging port what I found
audits that the zune HD did not come
with a wall charger only a sinking cable
so they kind of require you to plug it
into your computer unless you have a
converter jack on the other side we have
nothing and on the top we have the power
button and on the back we have this
beautiful brushed metal although tapping
it makes me think that it's not metal
actually and probably plastic and it
probably isn't it could be a composite
some sort of mix here we have the zoom
logo a serial number
and uh and that's pretty much it so
that's it for the hardware tour on the
zune HD overall I think Microsoft did a
fantastic job designing a very sleek
looking device in hand it feels light
compared to the ipod touch which makes
it feel a little bit cheaper it feels it
feels like the zune HD uses a lot of
plastic whereas the ipod touch uses a
lot of glass and metal so that's
probably why it's it's a lot more kind
of lightweight in hand so we'll be back
soon with more coverage on the zune HD
including comparisons with the ipod
touch and a look at the software will be
back soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
