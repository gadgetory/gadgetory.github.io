to you by thrillist on this episode of
ask the Buffalo we are covering
everything from the wide wide world of
technology will be talking about Windows
8 which is now in developers eager hands
we're going to talk about video games
we're going to talk Apple we're going to
talk android and we're even going to
talk some webos if you want to ask
questions you can do it in one of two
ways either go to the website on Tuesday
which is TechnoBuffalo calm leave your
comments down below and that's you
leaving your comments not be playing a
fanta keyboard or you can go how to
twitter and use the hashtag ask the v
and send your questions to act
TechnoBuffalo and i will see it and i
will read it and perhaps i will answer
it on camera we're going to talk about a
ton of technology today let's go ahead
and get started so our first question
has to do with the just sort of pre beta
release windows 8 and it comes from user
I'll lira follow us hey John do you
think windows 8 will work on
non-touchscreen pcs and the answer is
yes absolutely so most of what we've
seen on windows 8 a lot of the press has
been it's been the Metro UI sort of skin
that puts on top of Windows 8 if you're
not familiar with Metro UI or maybe it
hurted in the background it's not a you
why I use a lot of jello where skin
tight jeans nest fashion sense it is the
term given to the user interface
Microsoft uses in Windows Phone 7 that
grid of tiles or live tiles Microsoft
likes to call them is being adopted
across a lot of Microsoft platforms
we're going to see it on xbox now we are
seeing it on windows 8 however living
below that skin is pretty much regular
windows that we've seen with windows 7
they're obviously some tweaks in there
you've got a ribbon now and you explore
and a lot of other subtleties and
coach beeps that you might not notice
Retta later might not seek to the end
user but below that is pretty much
standard windows that you can use with
your mouse and keyboard so if you're on
a non-touchscreen pc presumably that
metro UI skin won't leave it or you can
navigate it with you your mouse so yes
that was a long integer question yes yes
it will work our next question comes
from Shiva Singh who asks what is the
bold 9900 going to be released for AT&amp;amp;T
wealth AT&amp;amp;T I am asking you the same
question when is the bold 9900 going to
be released i'm using a 9900 on your
hspa+ network but it's Rogers branded
you have to get an unlocked unit if you
want to use it on AT&amp;amp;T unfortunately I
18t hasn't said when they're going to
release it but there will be the first
to tell you that hey we have released a
torch to the 9810 which I have behind me
right here is out and available and it's
exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T but they're going to
tell you because that's what they told
me when I asked them about the 9900
which they've said they will carry my
presumed time frame as that will see it
towards the end of October early
November certainly before the holiday
season is when we'll finally have a 9900
on a tMT's network that would probably
be suspiciously close so when we finally
see qnx powered BlackBerry devices
finally get preview our next question
comes from see man 1494 who asks are we
going to be releasing a TechnoBuffalo
app anytime soon the question is a good
one jump watch do the answer the answer
is yes we will be releasing a
TechnoBuffalo app soon releasing across
platforms unfortunates all I can say
right now but we are in development of
it and hopefully I will be able to give
you guys really state more information
very very very shortly our next question
comes from guests with the HPV r 4 GB a
good smartphone do you recommend it junk
watch do you recommend it hmm nobody's
going to recommend a beer 4G as a phone
not only is it running
on hardware that HP is really no longer
going to support it is also on hardware
that baby fingers couldn't use the
keyboard on that thing is minuscule of
tiny don't use it the screen is very
very very small it looks like a phone
that even Zoolander would use so no
despite how cheap even if they're going
to pay you to use it do not pick up a
beer for Jeter a ton of other free
Android options available that are going
to be great choices iphone 3gs you can
pick up from AT&amp;amp;T for pretty much next
to nothing go with anything but the beer
orgy I want to take quick minute to
thank our friends and sponsors at for
realist what's thrill is to ask you know
they've got that one friend looks you
have a cool new band before anyone else
ever heard of him junk watch do you have
a friend like that funny story well
actually well their loss is like that
but for fool new stuff to do in places
to go for example wanna know about a
star wars burlesque show and honestly
who doesn't can you imagine java hut up
there dancing on stage Bhutto that would
be kind of fun or a biergarten that
screams ed flicks no you can have a
drink and you can watch some of the brat
pack or a new restaurant the sushi robot
I'm sure sushi chefs aren't happy that a
robot Mike replacing them but if it
exists why would you want to know about
it then sign up for thrillist it's a
three-day week email at tips the role of
crap to find the best new bars
restaurants events and services oh
whatever it is they promise it won't
suck hit up throw a stock calm / Buffalo
and we'll start getting thrilla sweet
sweet knowledge right away into your
mind hole which is awesome and that's
thrillist th
I ll I st calm / Buffalo up that way /
Buffalo put a slide buckle in there and
go ahead and get started our last
question comes from a name that I can't
pronounce it comes from this guy says
what's the best budget tablet out there
the best budget tablet out there is
pretty damn powerful try and find an HP
TouchPad they had a fire sale at 99
bucks may flew off the shelves you can
still get some we're a little bit more
on craigslist or ebay 150 to 200 dollars
you are still getting a awesome tablet
some might say one of the best tablets
out there you're going to get one of the
best flash experiences on a mobile
browser you're getting all that
dual-core goodness you're getting an
awesome user interface on a much bigger
screen than say the HPV or 4G it's an
awesome tablet was actually one of my
favorite devices that I have reviewed
this year so try and find an HP TouchPad
out there if you can't find one there
are a ton of other Android options
actually if you go to your local
drugstore I know it sounds weird their
chances are they sell android tablets
we're gonna go to your local camera
store they'll sell an android tablet
probably running froyo maybe if you're
lucky awesome gingerbread on there but
it's Android on a big screen there are a
lot of you know import sites that sell
very cheap Android tablets go ahead and
try and find the best one for you hope
you guys enjoy this very eclectic ask
the buffalo i am your host jon rettinger
and i am using a new boom mic so boom
my phone on vibrate so don't ring
because nobody like that action alright
