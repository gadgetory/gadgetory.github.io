everybody out there is heard of dell
they make some of the best Windows
computers out there some of the best
netbooks and they also happen to make
some of the best monitors and that's
where the story begins
I've got an older HP external monitor
and the resolution on it is quite low
and it starting to hurt my eyes trying
to read emails and such so I thought it
was a good time for an upgrade I did a
ton of research and seeing that that
Dells monitors were the best at the most
reasonable prices I meant to order one
of their sort of top-of-the-line 23 inch
models and was getting a little bit late
and I accidentally ordered the wrong 24
inch model with a lower resolution when
I was looking for totally my fault in my
mistake like maybe you know what
tomorrow morning I'll call Dell and I'll
tell him I ordered the wrong one and you
know I'll probably be delayed a couple
days you know not a big deal what's
completely my mistake so I called Dell
and I got an order confirmation from my
monitor said if you have any questions
call this number so of course I called
that number and after about four or five
minutes on holes and strangely a
lollipop song I was put through to
somebody and before I sort of get into
the story everybody knows that that Dell
outsources their customer service I
don't have a problem with outsourced
customer service everybody needs to make
a living no matter where you are so this
isn't a tale about outsourcing and
insourcing whether you keep things in
America or another country this is just
a story about Dells customer service as
a whole so I got ahold of a gentleman
who told me that I had the wrong number
despite that being a number that was in
my email not a problem
he said anything transfer me so he did
and about seven or eight minutes later I
got a woman on the phone who told me
again I was in the wrong Department she
was gonna transfer me again
still a little bit annoyed but okay it
can happen
finally got to a third person who said
okay you've got the got the right person
that we're speaking to but we can't
process you go or return so well you
know I'd the owner hasn't shipped out
yet it's still in your warehouses is
there any way that we could sort of work
this out so it doesn't ship and arrive
and I have to pay
a restocking fee he said no no way it's
gonna arrive and you're gonna have to
pay a restocking fee regardless so you
know what it was my mistake and I
ordered the wrong monitor while I don't
agree with having to pay a restocking
fee for a completely unopened item I can
understand it you know it happens and
that's not part of reason that I'm upset
so I said okay that's fine so the
monitor arise this is a few days later
shows up I've got the Box still sealed I
call Dell again this time I called the
proper number that they gave me once
again I'm told I've got the wrong
Department
so I'm transferred yet again transferred
three more times later and 45 minutes
the time frame finally had somebody on
the line and this is sort of how the the
interaction goes it was a gentleman who
says understand that I understand that
you ordered the wrong monitor I
understand are you sure you don't want
to keep that monitor it's a great
monitor so no I really want to return it
he's like well I hear great things about
it are you sure you want to return it
yes yes I'm certain that I want to
return the monitor well you can't right
now our systems are down why don't you
try calling back in a few hours so I
very nice thing calmly said you know it
took quite a long time to get to you I
don't want to call back in a few hours I
want to get this resolved now so well I
can't help you our systems are down so
well user supervisor they're back to
help me
nope they can't help you either sorry so
a little bit annoyed I I let the guy go
and actually keep hung up on me
I called Dell back again what do the
same process and talk to a woman this
time who told me are you sure you want
to return the monitor it's a great
monitor yes I want to return it I want
to send it back so well there's gonna be
a 15% restocking fee you know that right
so yes I understand that it's a little
bit annoying but I'm going to take care
of it she said well I'm not so sure that
were gonna be able to return this
monitor for you this why I started to
get a little bit upset and I said you're
Dell your multi-million dollar
corporation I'm trying to return an
unopened product this should be similar
and easy process to go she tells me no
we're not gonna be able to turn the
monitor
it's a little bit upset with me no we're
not gonna be able to turn your monitor
our systems aren't functioning right now
I'll send you an email in a few hours I
said you know that's not acceptable it's
not gonna work I need to return this
monitor there should be a simple process
I just want to return this just like
well okay how about I process it and
we'll send you an order confirmation I
told her you know maybe things aren't
working I thought that your systems were
down well well they're they're back up
now so the moral of the story is don't
make fantastic products I never ever
ever want to deal with their customer
service again it is absolutely atrocious
it's awful they don't how to handle
simple return items I've had to return
things to Amazon Apple AT&amp;amp;T all those
are very large companies which have much
much much better customer service so
Delta to you your customer service is an
embarrassment to the industry if you
want to be a retail giant should be able
to handle simple things such as
returning unopened items that should be
line item one on your customer service
department I couldn't even imagine what
was gonna be like if I had a
troubleshoot my monitor if there was an
issue with it if it was broken or these
poor people that are trying to get
Windows 7 upgrades on computers there by
now
your customer service is an
embarrassment and I hope that you do
something about it and you just lost one
very big customer anyway I'll see you
guys in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
