to you by Netflix well hello there
what's going on gee what's up props man
John Q here from technobuffalo and
welcome to what's the app say a preview
show here in TechnoBuffalo and rev 3
where I check out some mobile
applications and usually I don't really
play a lot of games on my mobile
electronic play thingies but you know
sometimes I like to get my game on so
recently I got my iPad and I opened up
the app store and I saw this banner for
ipad game of the week so I decided to
check it out you know for what's the app
segments and so on but I got it and I
haven't stopped playing it until now but
I'm still playing so yeah I haven't
stopped playing it so for this episode
of what's the app's we're going to be
taking a look at the ipad game of the
week tiny towers to be honest guys i
forgot this game was called tiny towers
i only remembered when i started doing
this review this one that you're
watching right now because i refer to it
as that hotel game so my girlfriend
could ask Oh what you're doing right now
and I i I'd be saying I've planned that
hotel game that's about it I don't know
why it has nothing to do with hotels
maybe it's just the look of the game
reminds me of habbo hotels have habbo
habbo hotels this and anybody else
remember hypo hotels it still exists
today seriously I mean I love playing
habbo habbo habbo whatever I love
playing hi Bo hotels when I was a kid I
don't know what's that what that things
about I still have no idea let's have a
hotel about anyways anyways back to the
review of tiny towers tiny towers is an
RPG style game with fun pixelated
graphics and hip jazzy upbeat music the
goal of the game is to make as much
money's as you can by opening stores and
facilities and building rooms for rent
and with this money you can build more
stores and more rooms to make your tower
bigger and bigger mine is a little bit
pathetic right now but I just started
man no word so you're in charge of this
tower with the metropolis in it so it's
got stores apartments and these little
Tamagotchi looking guys called bitte
sins anyone else remember Tamagotchis
fun times wasted time
a fun times I think here's a list of all
my bitte seen so far each one of course
has their own personality disorder they
have a single purpose in their bit
filled lives to work the numbers on the
right signified their strengths in each
working sector such as entertainment
food service and so on and that faded
out text indicates their dream job you
as well bit god is to give them their
dream job which makes them happy like
denise rice over here having happy bitte
sins means happier work environments AKA
discounted stocking fees oh yeah you
gotta constantly stock inventory for
your shots darn bitte sins i don't even
know why i hired these guys can stock
inventory on top of all the inventory
that you got to do you can also work the
elevator to earn some extra tips this is
pretty tedious on mine on upgraded
elevator well if it sucks you get a tip
every single time and it's a good way to
earn some extra tower bucks yeah stupid
Benson didn't tip a bucks I I hope you
don't find the suit you like in men's
fashion like I said this game is about
making money you can try to tower bucks
for more monies which I don't recommend
because bucks are just so damn hard to
get unfortunately you can't do it the
other way around or you can also buy
bucks using real money personally I'm
not a big fan on paying for pixels but
hey everybody is different some extra
tower bucks would come in handy as you
need it to speed up the game whether
it's restocking inventory reducing build
time or upgrading your elevator waste of
money right there they can just use the
stairs there are also random side tasks
like helping random bitte sins find
another random business in for tip
usually it's a bucks usually wears that
stupid guy ah that's right I found Kyle
thank you very much for your Tower bucks
benasin once you get the hang that the
game it's very straightforward just a
little bit repetitive but oh man is it
addicting okay Angry Birds and cut the
rope ain't got nothing on tiny towers
even if you close the game it keeps on
going and while you're minding your own
business playing with your iPad you get
a random notification saying that frozen
yogurt on the third floor has to be
restocked so you go back into your game
and repeat the whole process of
restocking checking and elevator ring
it's so awesome really
of course you can always turn off the
notifications but why would you want to
okay you want to stay on top of your
business Ernest Aaron as much bling as
you can Ching you want to earn as much
Ching as you can to buy the blink okay
you want to earn as much Ching as you
can so that you can buy the blings slang
right there so you're unhappy with their
job huh well I'm a fire you right now
yeah take that stupid purple jumpsuit
wearing how does it feel to be
unemployed huh how purple well look at
that he likes it apparently well he's
smiling I should have Victor right now
to add another level of cleverness to
the game they've created something
called bit book which is of course their
version of Facebook it just has the
status updates of your medicines and
it's kind of pointless as you can't
really do anything with it but I guess
it's helpful if you want no no man it's
just pointless what am I saying what is
interesting you know what else is
interesting giving a shout out to our
friends at netflix netflix streams TV
episodes and movies directly to your
home saving you time and money a very
important principle in life and in tiny
towers you can instantly watch unlimited
TV episodes and movies streaming
directly to your PC Mac or right on to
your TV with your xbox 360 ps3 or your
nintendo wii console just go to
netflix.com slash Buffalo and sign up
for your free trial membership today
anyways overall this game it's cute
clever and colorful the gameplay is a
little bit repetitive but so are a lot
of other iOS games I guess is just a
little bit more obvious than this one
but men tiny towers is addictive beyond
comprehension for those reasons I give
it a solid 4 out of 5 so for those of
you who like the RPG style game
seriously check out tiny towers but I
warn you it is seriously addicting ok
warning you right now so I hope you guys
enjoyed this review this was john q from
technobuffalo and i'll see you guys next
time you gotta restock the ice cream
again
cool awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
