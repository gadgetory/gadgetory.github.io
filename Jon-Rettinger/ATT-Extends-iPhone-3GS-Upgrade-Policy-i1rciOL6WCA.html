since the iphone 3gs was announced last
week AT&amp;amp;T customers particularly 3g
owners have been outraged they're not
eligible for the new upgrade pricing for
the 3gs and are having to pay a couple
hundred bucks more than they would if
they were eligible for that upgrade or
were new customers and I can't tell you
that AT&amp;amp;T has been listening to your
concerns if you guys follow AT&amp;amp;T on
facebook where you follow them on
twitter you'll know that they're reading
your comments you know that they know
your concern and they know your outrage
i follow really all the major carriers
but a tease facebook and twitter really
in particular to see the update and see
where they're coming from because those
are people that's not just a faceless
company you can see what 80 employees
are saying and what the official stands
the company is and I got it say that
this time 18d is actually listened to
the complaints they've listened to your
out cries they've listened to the
bloggers they've listened to the tech
reviewers and they've listened to the
customers so I'm going to turn my head a
little bit and read you an official note
coming out of AT&amp;amp;T and if you're a
current 3g owner or you're not eligible
for an upgrade or your ordered your 3gs
you paid more for it than you would have
with an upgrade you're going to want to
pay attention to listen to this letter
so let's go ahead and get started excuse
me while I look away this is an update
to our customers some customers five
questions about our plans and policies
for the iphone 3gs we like to provide
you with answers we'd also like to
announce a change to the date when some
iphone customers are eligible for our
best upgrade pricing to the iphone 3gs
so right off the bat you know if they're
listening and they're trying to make
changes pricing importantly we want our
customers to better understand a
wireless device upgrade program like
most US carriers we offer a variety of
phones that we sell below the actual
cost where customers agree to sign for
new service agreements the subsidy in
general the more a customer spends with
us quicker they become eligible for the
price break on the new device so the
more you spend the quicker the AT&amp;amp;T can
recoup that extra lumps imma give you
for the discount
device for example iphone customers will
spend more than ninety nine dollars a
month per line with us generally are
eligible for an upgrade between 12 and
18 months into their contract we also
currently offer early upgrade pricing
only for the iphone 3gs and 3g all of
that said we've been listening to our
customers you know they're reading you
guys on Facebook and Twitter and since
many of our iphone 3g customers are
literally weeks shy of being upgrade
eligible due to the iphone 3gs launching
11 months after the iphone 3g we're
extending the window of the upgrade
eligibility for a limited time so things
the 3g came out 11 months and customers
eligible really a 12 they're making
accommodations so let's keep going we
are now pleased to offer the iphone now
pleased to offer our iphone 3g customers
who are a print eligible in july august
or September 2009 our best upgrade
pricing beginning friday jun 19th so
really they're extending that upgrade
window by three months which actually a
lot of customers any early iphone 3g
adopters who bought it during that
initial launch window of three months
are now eligible for the early upgrade
pricing which is really fantastic to see
18t listen to their customers so let's
keep going there's a little bit more
here if you are one of the many
customers will benefit from this change
please note that our upgrade eligibility
website reflect this change thursday jun
18 so that's tomorrow we invite you to
come to our storage beginning friday
during normal business hours although
please be aware that will have limited
supply of iphone 3gs is we also
pre-order your phone online at att.com /
iphone and your 3gs will arrive in 7 to
14 days if you're one of the customers
who benefits from this change you've
already pre-ordered from an AT&amp;amp;T store
well adjust the price your device when
you pick it up so you don't have to do
anything if you preorder from ATT when
you go to get your phone it's going to
be cheaper nice couple hundred bucks
your pocket never hurt if you pre-order
the iphone 3gs through apple's online
store your upgrade eligibility will be
reassessed based on a tMT's new upgrade
policy for the
3g owners if you are eligible for the
lower price and you did upgrade through
the apple website Apple will issue a
credit for a difference as applicable
which is really impressive so here's the
deal what if you still aren't eligible
and you still want a 3gs now here your
options you may qualify for the 3gs
early upgrade price of 399 a 499 or you
can pay full retail and not have to sign
a two-year contract although that's
going to run you 599 for the 16 or 699
for a 32 gig not cheap so in summary
atts listening to their customers and
hope our response helps answer your
questions and concerns we're incredibly
proud to be the US carrier after the
iphone 3gs and work around the clock to
be ready June I think server customers
who are interested so they have a few
frequently asked questions as well when
we run these through you guys how do I
know if eligible for an upgrade
customers can check the eligibility at
att.com / iPhone or visiting a retail
store what if I benefit from this change
I've already pre-ordered like we said if
you pre-order for big titi they're gonna
issue a discount when you go and pick up
your phone or when you buy it for me TT
or pre ordered from them they'll credit
back your card Apple will just issue a
credit if you pre-ordered from them as
well does this change only apply to
iphone 3g customers to expend $99 alive
4 month per month in most cases yes
iphone customers who spend more than the
nine dollars per month are generally
eligible fed upgrade earlier and i'll
hit that three month window that they've
changed to I what about customers who
bought in July August for September of
2008 but don't spend over ninety nine
dollars a month we value the business of
our customers the majority of iphone 3g
customers receive a significant discount
on their device and return for two years
service commitments during which we
recoup the device subsidy so essentially
what AT&amp;amp;T is doing here is giving you a
little bit of a break they've heard the
concerns I don't think they had to do
any of this be honest with you I think
that it's typical business practices to
offer a subsidy and wait until it's up
these been recouped 18t really is trying
to help the customers although there are
a lot of people that are going to fall
outside of those
don't spend enough it might be a little
bit upset that being said still is a
little bit better than nothing and it is
nice to see 18t listening to their
customers so what do you guys think is
this going to affect you are you happy
with these changes are you not happy
with these changes you think ATT should
have done something different what do
you guys think and I hope you enjoyed
for exclusive content sure to follow me
on twitter twitter.com / John for lakers
i'll see you guys in next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
