so funny what's up guys Ron Purdy here
from TechnoBuffalo and over the last
couple of months you guys have been
leaving us a lot of comments saying we
should shoot in 60fps or that are asking
why we don't shoot in 60fps so I wanted
to make this video today just to talk a
little bit about that some of the
technicals from the creative and some of
the intention as to why you may or may
not shooting 60fps let's go ahead and
get started
when film was first invented just over a
hundred years ago 16 frames per second
was dictated as to be the minimum number
of frames needed to make something look
like video rather than a series of still
images when optical audio came along I'd
say about twenty to thirty years later
they decided had to go up to 24 frames
per second and it kind of just stayed
there the reason they wanted to keep the
number minimum frames per second is
because film was expensive back then
obviously it's not now but they were
trying to keep production budgets down
so why is it that 60fps or higher frame
rates and general just don't seem to
work well it's a couple different
reasons and the first one being is just
what we're conditioned for so as
mentioned promised 100 years we have
been watching videos in film in 24 FPS
so our brains have gotten used to
processing the images we're looking at
in a certain way and the second you
changed it to a higher frame right the
style of motion change is complete and
it becomes very jarring very abrasive to
the viewer what ends up happening is a
lot of the time we end up getting pulled
out of the experience we pay less
attention to the story and the
characters and instead we're just
wondering why does this film look this
way one of the first times we saw high
frame rates make their way to big motion
picture screens was with the Hobbit
directed by Peter Jackson this decision
was influenced sort of twofold Peter
Jackson is part of the school of thought
that higher frame rates make a more
immersive experience it was also because
when shooting 3d when she was
stereoscopically you need more light you
lose about 65% of light with the
stereoscopic rig as well as the 3d
glasses so it's a an attempt to make the
experience more smooth and more fluid in
3d for the viewer so while the Hobbit
was an attempt to bring 48 frames per
second to mainstream it was a pretty big
failure in the eyes of most reason being
just higher frame rates made the
experience very jarring and really pull
the audience out of what they were
watching this is often referred to as
the uncanny valley we've seen this in
graphic design and 3d animation the idea
is that the closer you bring something a
character or
to reality the more the audience will
pick up on the imperfection I know it
sounds a little counterintuitive but as
mentioned this is a trend we've seen in
graphic design and 3d animation and now
we're seeing with higher framers in film
so it sound like I'm bashing on higher
frame rates period I do think they're
good for certain things they're supposed
to make the experience more immersive
and if that's the case then it's great
for video games things like sports I
just don't think it's that great for
film or video because these are passive
viewing experiences it might be great
for something like VR as well it's
really hard to say what's sort of the
right in the wrong a lot of this boils
down to taste and for us as a YouTube
channel to answer your guys's comment we
prefer 24 FPS we like to create a
relaxed cinematic viewing experience for
you guys that's why we stick to 24 but
for other channels it might be cool to
use higher frame rates if we're trying
to create more of a broad caste feel and
that kind of thing it's also gonna be
really interesting to see how this pans
out in the industry as a whole but I'm
really curious to hear what you guys
have to say let us know in the comments
below whether you like higher frame
rates or not what you would like to see
it in more of or less of give thumbs up
