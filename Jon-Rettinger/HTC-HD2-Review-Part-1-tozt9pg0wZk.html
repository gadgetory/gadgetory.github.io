driving force it has the largest market
share in the Windows Mobile Device arena
and in this review you'll find out why
that is its LP from TechnoBuffalo and
welcome to my review of the hd2 so in
this review I'll be taking HCC's new
flagship device through the same course
of tests and benchmark I recently put
the touch pro2 and Nokia n97 through
everything from multitasking tests to
gaming and video codecs benchmarking
using core player I'll also be taking
the hd2 on the road to see how its
built-in GPS works with the copilot
software included on the device we'll be
taking an in-depth look at the HTC's new
sense user interface that HTC has been
working on for a couple of years now
HTC Sense is a tightly knit UI with
extensive social network integration it
is something HTC is very proud of so
you'll be hearing my thoughts and
opinions about the new user interface
before we get started let's take a quick
look at what's included with the device
I should probably mention that the box
and all the packaging materials are
eco-friendly and disposable which is
kind of cool so inside the box we have
your operation metals and promotional
coupons a very firm feeling another
pouch for the device a 2gig micro SD
card and adapter your standard HTC
charger the USB sync cable and a set of
earphones with a 3.5 millimeter plug a
decent set of accessories but let's get
to the device itself the hd2 is a
successor to the touch HD which was a
relative of success from last year at
its launch the touch HD wielded the
largest screen of any smartphone and
it's nice to see that the HD 2 carries
on that tradition I mean look at this
thing it's huge the boxy caming was not
lying it's much larger than the screen
on the iPhone it Dwarfs both the screens
on the diamond 2 in the touch pro2 and
it's not only screen size that has been
upped the screen is now capacitive touch
screen meaning that is now registered
thermal and infrared signals instead of
physical pressure like cold resistive
screens positive screens don't need to
flex so they can be made out of harder
material select glass the 82 is a glass
screen that has been coated with an anti
smudge surface that has very little
friction when you run her finger across
it it gathers very little grease that is
easy to wipe off the difference in
friction is
very noticeable when comparing to the
plastic resistive screens on the diamond
- and touch pro2 so sliding your finger
on the screen feels a lot more natural
the glass also contributed to the
rigidness of the device the hd2 is one
of the more if not the most well built
devices I've had in my hands it's a bit
hefty but the weight contributes to the
feeling of quality and the device can
definitely take a good beating the
device is very streamlined and the back
cover of the device is a nice dark piece
of brushed metal and the rest of the
back is covered by a black hardened
rubber material which gives the device a
nice grip to it while we're here we
notice the five megapixel camera and I
have to point out that the lens is
actually raised quite high above the
frame and for some reason it has very
sharp edges minor design flaw but
nothing too serious best not to slide
the 82 on scratched prone surfaces and
if you for some reason wear spandex
pants I recommend not putting the 82 in
your pocket and I also recommend if
you're a guy don't wear pants made out
of spandex under the back cover is a
1230 milliamp battery and as you can see
the sim card slot is now in a place
where you don't have to detach the
battery which is a refreshing change the
microSD slot is also in a very
accessible place even though the hc2
looks massive from the front it's
actually very thin it's less than half
the width of the touch pro2
and it's significantly thinner than the
diamond - thanks to the thinness it
doesn't feel too big in the hand
but I'm pretty sure that this is as big
as mobile devices will get well unless
the old briefcase phones come back into
fashion you never know my old mobi R of
450 was pretty hot back in the day but
truthfully human hands ain't getting any
bigger so I'm pretty sure this is as big
as it gets
scratch that I just received the next
generation iPhone and is pretty big it
almost feels like it's made out of foam
anyway the device is very streamlined
and it has very few mechanical buttons
on the front the answer and end calls
and holding down the end call Keys acts
as a power button as well we also have
the home screen button windows button
and back buttons the buttons do feel
solid but they have a little shake to
them but it isn't too bad on the side we
have the up and down volume keys and
that's about it for the moving parts on
the device it's not only the screen that
has been given an update the chipset and
processor has been given a significant
update the 528 megahertz
processor on predeceasing HTC models has
been replaced by a one gigahertz
Snapdragon processor and if you ask me
the hardware running Windows Mobile
devices haven't always done justice to
the operating system but let's find out
if that has changed with almost double
the clock rate as you can see the hd2
blows away the touch pro2 in start-up
time so it's off to a good start
so here we are in the sense UI HTC Sense
is a custom user interface that runs on
top of windows mobile 6.5 the old
interface test for 3d 2 is now gone but
the new UI definitely bears a keen
resemblance to the old touchable 3d I am
glad that the new UI is the complete
redo because the touchflo 3d 2 was and
still is one of the most appealing
things about the previous series of
devices as you can see the home screen
has changed a bit on top we still have a
clock in the calendar new to the home
screen is the local weather icon we also
notice that the weather animations can
now be part of the home screen the new
animations are pretty impressive but if
you're annoyed by the weather animations
you can easily turn them off and just
take a look outside the window to see
that it's raining you can customize your
home screen with animated wallpapers or
just plain old JPEGs a very smart
addition to the home screen are the
Quick Links slots where you can add your
favorite programs contacts and links to
your favorite websites it's simply a
great addition to the home screen
because there's always going to be tasks
that need be done more often than others
adding and subtracting links is simple
and fast as you can see the capacitive
screen combined with a Snapdragon
processor translates into a much more
fluid user experience there's no drop in
framerate no screen tearing and no
sudden halt to experience on previous
models it can almost keep up with my
lightning fast fingers but not quite
moving through the UI is still
impressively fast and the capacitive
touch screen needs very little pressure
to register the actions you barely need
to touch the screen single hand
navigation is still very possible and
the large screen makes it very suitable
for flicking around even with fat thumbs
like mine
the sense UI is an evolution from the
touchable 3d to interface let's take a
quick look at the tabs so the people's
tab has now got a very functional update
you no longer need to flick through your
contacts which I too thought was a bit
unnecessary here you can see a list of
my closest buddies and when I for
example run my finger over Arnold here I
am shown all the previous interactions
calls messages and emails it's very
convenient to keep track of what's been
discussed the people's tab has a very
elegant but simple design and most
importantly it's very functional and if
there's something strange in the
neighborhood I know who to call there's
very little change in the message and
email taps pretty basic stuff and here's
another place where you can see the
Snapdragon processor doing its job
animations are smooth and flicking
between messages and emails is super
fast and while we're here let's type a
quick message to show off the typing
capabilities of the new capacitive
screen as I mentioned capacitive screens
register on thermal signals so you can't
use a stylus or your fingernails to
operate the device resistive screens are
a bit more accurate but the capacitive
screen on the HT 2 is very intuitive you
barely ever miss your mark even though
I'm a strictly keyboard guy I have to
say that the big screen combined with
capacitive technology and the xt9
predictive text software makes the HD 2
excellent for typing the xt 9 seems to
work so well that you barely need to
know how to spell to punch out your
words</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
