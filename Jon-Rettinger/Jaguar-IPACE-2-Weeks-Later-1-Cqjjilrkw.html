this video when people consider getting
an electric car I think the big
reservation is range and range anxiety
when I first went electric I had that
too you know it's very convenient for
the gas station to fill up and they're
everywhere you never really have to
worry about sort of running out of fuel
but with an electric car it's different
you have to wait for charging time so
there's a big kind of mental hurdle you
have to get past and I think that starts
with changing the perception of the car
so there are a lot of V's on the marked
in even more that are coming seemingly
every day some you might have heard of
some you might not this behind me is the
Jaguar ipace you may have seen us cover
in the past I never had a chance to
actually have the car in my garage and
uses my daily driver for the better part
of two weeks so driving in V's it's kind
of similar to driving an
internal-combustion car each experience
is different and this is a Jaguar so
performance is paramount so it's got a
90 kill at our battery pack it's gonna
give you about 234 miles of range which
I found to be really accurate but it's
gonna get you from 0 to 60 in four and a
half seconds and what's crazy with EVs
is that like zero to 30 time the instant
torque there's really like no curve it's
like a vertical line it is feels
incredibly fast to drive that's when the
favorite things about the I face the
performance and the handling were
absolutely incredible and you would
expect if now a car that looks like that
but also from a car in the Jaguar
portfolio the I face behind me is a
first edition it's a new car and first
dish we kind of comes loaded with pretty
much everything
it's stickered around $85,000 almost
every option box is checked so you can
price it down if you
order one but it says it everything on
it and it's got a lot of kit for built
into the car so there's a couple of cool
things about the design it was and they
did something like different with the
car it's not a big like package overall
but there's these nomads of space it's a
call to cab forward design so obviously
there's no engine in there so they kind
of pushed the front of the car up a
little bit sort of maximize a space that
you have in the back and it kind of
makes like a mean-looking car the tech
inside is stuff that we've seen from
Jaguar and Land Rover the past it's
they're in control touch pro duo and it
works it works well it's a widescreen
orientation it's a beautiful interior of
anyway until you slice it the seats are
more sport seats so if you're if you
like that sort of more sporty bolstered
on the side feel you're gonna dig it
here it's a good-looking car you expect
that from Jaguar upped end of the day it
doesn't matter how the cars being
propelled that matters how it's going to
drive how it's gonna feel everyday when
you're behind the wheel
it's a sporty feel inside of guys
becoming expected I guess my car that
looks like this it's a really tightly
tuned suspension does have air
suspension so it will automatically
adapt to stuff I'll but you definitely
feel like you are driving a sports car
and you feel serving every bump as you
go along with it but with that others a
pickup on camera you get that
like throw you back in your seat
acceleration and you also end up with
this on your face quite a bit I do
really like what they've done with the
display in front of the driver it's
adaptable it can change have any on how
big you want a map you have a map in
front of you you can see obviously your
range I've got it set instead of showing
car information to show me either the
media that I'm listening to you can
control it just with the steering wheel
it's been nice to have and if somebody
who's never really driven on anything
with a heads-up display I really like
having a HUD when you drive a car and
you in a floor it a normal internal
combustion car you think about your your
gas mileage and sort of how much gas
you've burned up it's like charge my car
every night I don't really think too
much about how I'm driving unless I have
to drive somewhere really far where I
got to be a little more conscious of
range I don't generally ever think about
like how I'm doing range wise I very
rarely even look at it driving electric
has actually changed how I Drive all
cars
so most EVs and the IPAs included has
something called regenerative braking
it's actually it takes the what would be
lost in like heat during the braking and
it sort of puts it back into the battery
pack what that means is when you take
your foot off the accelerator pedal and
see it the car brakes on its own it kind
of starts to come to a stop so you get
that electricity back into the battery
pack and it also saves your brakes and
saves your brake pads so I've gotten
really used to driving a car with
aggressive regen you can tweak it in
most cars in the ipace you can make it
sort of kind of coast like it wouldn't a
normal internal combustion car but I
really like the aggressive regen
passengers might not but even right now
coming up to a stoplight I'm coming up
to pretty much a complete stop and I
didn't touch the brake pedal at all and
I have to accelerate a little bit to
even make it to the light
if you haven't lived electric there's
sort of a perceived thought of range
anxiety you know this has a 234 mile
range what if I have to go farther what
if I can't find a charging station
there's a lot of like what-ifs and those
are real concerns I think they're
holding a lot of people back from
thinking about an e V or buying a TV or
maybe making people buy a plug-in hybrid
or something else all together but if
somebody who's driven electric vehicles
now for almost six years the range
anxiety tends to go away the more you
use and the more you drive a car and the
I face kind of perfect example of that
I'm driving to Claremont California most
days and that's a forty mile each way
commute so about eighty miles and that's
more than most people's average
commuting think about the car not like
you do a gas car you have to go and fill
up at a gas station once a week or every
other week almost to give it like a
cellphone you plug it in at night wake
up in the morning and you've got a full
charge all you need at home is a 240
outlet that's like what most dryers are
you plug it in and the car is full in
the morning and I've never really needed
to drive more than 240 miles in fact 240
is about 40 miles more than I'm used to
having on most EVs that I've had in the
past and I've never had that range issue
there are quick chargers that are coming
online this is capable with DC quick
charging will charge your car faster but
those are more exceptions than the rule
if you're driving to work you can leave
the car there and come back and I wanted
a test what's called phantom drain any V
so if you leave your car overnight so
you've got a hundred miles when you come
back the next day are you gonna be down
to 90 or 80 and that's a concern lot of
people have with v's if you just leave
it idle are you gonna lose a lot of
range answer the Phantom loss here was
not much at all it's maybe one or two
miles overnight so you're getting that
truth 230 ish miles you plug it in at
night and you are really good for those
times where you need more you can plan
accordingly if you have doing a road
trip you can plan to get to those
charging stations if you use the index
navigational
brought you to those the range isn't as
big a concern because I think people
have it in their heads once you dive in
and go electric becomes really easy so I
have most cars set to start charging
after peak hours at my house it's 11
cents a kilowatt I could send a charge
this car from what would be empty to
full for like under ten dollars and I've
got solar panels on my roof so now I'm
charging the car for free if I want to
do it during the day when it's sunny the
amount of money that you save with an
Eevee is really significant the benefit
of that outweighs any thought that I've
had about range anxiety and obviously
I'm in California so solar is an option
for me it might not be where you are but
there are a lot of ways to sort of get
around and get past at ranging that you
have to think more about how you use the
car so if you're going to a hotel or a
road trip you plan accordingly and like
an internal-combustion car's front to
improve your efficiency there are things
you can do to get a higher miles per
gallon
there's equivalent electric car most TVs
in the I phase included comes with an
eco mode it's gonna reduce a lot of the
heavy electric drains to increase your
range it could change how you drive you
can turn on regenerative braking there's
a lot of things you can do to sort of
improve that it just changes the way you
drive and after driving again electric
for so long I wouldn't even consider
going back to a gas car this would be
hard for me to consider it the cost
savings the fun of the instant
acceleration instant torque and the
performance you get from an e V makes it
really hard for me to consider going
back to standard gas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
