easier than previous generation I don't
have to spend half the video explaining
what it is is it a tablet replace your
desktop desktop that can go with you is
it a foldable dockable transformer
tablet top type device you already know
with the surface pro is its in its
fourth iteration it's gotten thinner
it's got lighter it's gotten faster it's
brought a few high tech friends with it
that make it a complete laptop or tablet
experience most importantly is it the
device that you want to buy I'm going to
do my best NFL coach impersonation and
show you everything there is to know
about the surface pro 4 I'm John render
from TechnoBuffalo if you haven't
guessed it yet this is our review of the
surface pro 4 as I do with all my
reviews let me start with a disclaimer I
use this as my daily computer at home
for 13 days I want to make sure I really
knew everything about it how it performs
especially how it performed versus the
previous generation surface pro 3 so
let's start with the design it's very
familiar design but Microsoft has
improved but already was a pretty
impressive look and feel it weighs very
little 1.73 pounds or 786 grams by
comparison the iPad pro weighs 1.5 seven
pounds or 713 grams so for not much
extra weight you're getting a full
fledge computer and that's what the
service is all about it's no compromises
you've a tablet when you want it and a
full computer when you want it using
Windows II was a little bit simpler I
think as a tablet you have that a large
Start menu it's changed a little bit
with Windows 10 but it's much easier for
actual everyday usage opposed to just
normal media consumption so if you want
to do anything that's not watching
Netflix or Hulu you're really going to
appreciate think with the surface pro
can do other than that it's thinner and
lighter than previous generation but
it's going to look very familiar
still a big fan of the kickstand you now
have infinite angles hello so you can
keep it on your lap really any way you
want you find a position that's
comfortable it goes relatively flat too
so if you want to kick up into the
surface pen and do some OneNote action
you can I'm not a graphic designer I can
barely draw a stick figure I don't never
been that into the OneNote ecosystem but
if you are you're going to appreciate
the redesigned surface pen as well one
simple click going to go ahead and
launch OneNote and if your student for
example go in scribble notes and it work
really well one thing I appreciate it
was a handwrite
condition I was very easily able to
translate my chicken scratch into actual
writing and save it on the device that's
important to you it'll work well and
also now can attach the aMAG Mnet's on
the side of the tablet and so what about
performance almost something this size
it's kind of tough to think what is good
for and what it's not good for but I've
boiled it down for you and who this
would be right for if you're the kind of
person sitting a lot of three rendering
where you do a lot of video editing or
heavy gaming this is not going to be the
device for you for the day at first it
does a lot of we're processing maybe a
place of light games you watch a lot of
YouTube videos if you do some
spreadsheet work where you're not doing
anything heavy 3d is going to be a
really capable computer and it's not to
say that it can't do some light gaming a
very easily able to get some Starcraft
going you could download Steam play some
Arkham Knight if you want to on average
settings you can do it but it's not
really what it's meant for and even when
I was playing games and those kicking up
the processor I really happen to many
heat issues either
there's vents all the way along the
sides of this which is a petite and also
I very rarely ever heard any sort of fan
noise this thing ran extremely cool
which is not the case in surface pro 3
one big difference versus surface pro 3
is in the screen Microsoft's calling the
new technology pixel sense which is just
Microsoft lingo for the screen looks
awesome and it does there is leashed of
27 36 by 18 24 and it's got a 2090 7 ppi
and it looks incredible I never thought
the surface pro 3 screen looks bad
looking at it next to this looks
incredible picture it like chopping for
a TV and you got two TVs up on the wall
in the store one is showing like a good
1080 picture one showing like a
ridiculously awesome 4k picture that's
it this looks like it looks like the 4k
screen it is absolutely incredible the
difference at is astounding colors are
rich blacks are really black even better
visibility in direct sunlight as well if
you're a student or you like to work
outside I think you're gonna appreciate
that I also like the three-point to
asset ratio on the surface pro 4 as well
something that's it in the light is
obviously concerned about battery life
how is it going to be I got a little
less battery life than advertised
I got about five to six hours of
battery-life out of here as opposed to
the eight or nine should get with video
usage but again that's going to vary on
your usage we set the screen brightness
at without your things running the
background or not so for that let's say
you've got a surface pro 3 or older you
might be like a birth sign out here
think your type covers so awesome but
you have not yet experienced the type
cover for its dinner
it's got new typing mechanism and the
trackpad actually feels good I suppose
you could say the only thing that's
changed is everything so it's not cheap
though 129 bucks it should probably be
rolled into the price and is even a more
expensive option that includes a
fingerprint sensor to unlock your
keyboard we don't have that one here but
everything you liked about the older
generations it's just better here typing
experience feels more traditional
keyboard new mechanism underneath can
gonna make it feel like an actual laptop
keyboard the improved trackpad from size
the multi-touch is just smooth the best
thing I can say about it he's not even
gonna notice that it's an external
accessory I will say though if you do
want to use it it's gonna be pretty
strong the magnet can hold it
so I'm too worried about dropping it I
was really always concerned about then I
was gonna drop it and in fact I was a
little nervous when I did this
demonstration but as you can see it's
pretty good it's supportive and it
clicks on with really satisfying and it
clicks off and puts a really satisfying
clicky noise which I like I like noises
if you're thinking about getting a
surface pro for the type cover is it
must-have accessory we didn't have the
one in though fingerprint sensor so I
can't verify how well that works but I
will say this coupled with the backlight
on it now makes for really enjoyable
typing experience so Microsoft's known
throwing in the buzzword or two the one
for this guy though is laughs ability
which is their made-up marketing term
for how else isn't gonna fit on your lap
because you look at it you wouldn't
think this is going to be overly like
economic on your on your lap will
friends so one way to test lap ability
and that's to put on your lap to the lap
ability 'mobile
what about value starting at about 900
bucks and going over well over 2,000
this is not the most reasonably priced
computer you can get it's not the
cheapest computer you can get it's
probably not even the best value that
you can get if you want a nice
touchscreen windows 10 convertible type
device who should get this if you want a
premium feeling high-performing device
the surface pro is still the king of
that pack the magnesium feel looks
absolutely incredible the screen is
gorgeous
getting device is going to wear well I
can attest for a generation to this
wearing extremely well over a lot of
travel I traveled all over my surface
pro 3 and it looks brand-new
you're going to appreciate what this can
do but again the caveat if you're doing
a lot of 3d rendering you want to do
heavy games on it then this is not going
to be the one you want to look for maybe
you want to look at the surface book or
another option but if you just want a
computer to do general computing things
on it that may don't involve gaming this
is going to be a great device so the
question asked the beginning would I buy
it this gets a very solid recommendation
to buy it's an incredible device
performed as well as expected it's
faster than the last generation screen
is gorgeous battery life was good enough
to last for a full day it does charge
quickly I should mention this is a great
computer one I would happily carry with
me for the next year or two years or
through four years if I was going to
university or college you can get a ton
of configurations I'd recommend getting
at least a core i5 model I think that's
going to give you the best performance
for value that's actually what we have
here that would test it core I thought
it gigs a ram and it worked very very
well
so what'd you guys think about the
surface pro 4 is it is it worthwhile is
it good for you I'll tear your thoughts
on it
I've been a big fan the surface line and
this one just continues that trend one
caveat dota considered tour by
recommendation is you might want to
consider now discount at surface pro 3
which is still a very solid a performing
computer and I think you guys for
watching hope you enjoyed until next
time I'm John render from TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
