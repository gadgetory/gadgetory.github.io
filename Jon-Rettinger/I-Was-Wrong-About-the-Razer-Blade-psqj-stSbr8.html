wholeheartedly recommend and love the
razorblade when I initially tested it
but there are a few things that just
stopped me from doing so mainly that
absolutely abysmal battery life I had
with my review unit but a few things
have changed on that and I've got an
update to that problem and after using
this thing extensively for the past two
months
my thoughts may have changed this time
really heal all wounds let's talk about
it before I begin for a more detailed
look at this new razor blade 2018 check
out our full review we published a few
weeks ago you're definitely gonna wanna
make sure you watch that video first
because I've got an update to a few the
problems I discussed in that original
review and in that video I was
admittedly pretty critical about the
blade specifically the battery life I
got because I only was able to get about
three and a half hours of use before the
machine just completely ran out of juice
it just wasn't acceptable and many of
you guys in the comments called me out
for that you said I was doing something
wrong others were a bit less harsh and
offered some suggestions and thank you
for that but in the end it looks like
some isolated software issues on my
review unit may have been the culprit
and the cause for that abnormally poor
battery life and interest a full
disclosure to you guys I want to tell
you guys I did work with razor directly
after that video went live we ran
additional tests I even sent the machine
back to them for their own testing and
in the end we still don't know exactly
what was the issue but it seems like
some weird software issues in the
machine were the cause for that poor
battery life in the meantime though
razor did want to send us another blade
to check out to put through the ringer
once again and tests and results are
much better this time around and the you
know I've been testing for the past few
weeks has the exact same processor
screen RAM and everything else about it
is the same only difference is it has a
gtx 1070 max-q instead of the 1060 mxu
we had in our other unit so when this
new unit came in the first thing of
course I wanted to test was the battery
life and I'm happy to say that after
using the battery a lot the results are
much better this time around I've ran
the same programs had the same setting
set on the machine even the screen set
at the higher 144th refresh rate and I
was able to get about five
five hours of battery-life while
browsing the web and watching videos
much better than the three and a half
hours I got the four and if you only
wanna squeeze just a bit more battery
life out of your blade you can drop that
refresh rate from 144 Hertz down to 60
and you get close to seven hours and I
ran a bunch of additional tests on this
laptop we're even starting to implement
a custom battery drainage test that
we're gonna put through the wringer on
all the laptops we care techni buffalo
and i'm happy to say that after running
up multiple times the tests were
consistent and the battery life on this
plate is much better something I suspect
for all the blades out there and I just
had some isolated abnormal issues with
the other unit that I tested battery
aside the machine still performs just as
well as ever there's no doubt that an
eighth gen i7 processor 16 gigs of ram
and a gtx 1070 max-q make for one
powerful machine and i've yet to find
anything that i do on a daily basis that
bogs this machine down or makes it
sluggish or slow in any way and this is
the gaming laptop after all and it runs
games on here just as well as before
again you can run pretty much any game
on this machine but the quality is gonna
depend on the game and how taxing it is
on that GPU and CPU and if you're
curious on how games like pub G and GTA
v play on the blade it check out our
full review we've got more coverage on
specific games in that video it is
revention again that the fans are gonna
get a bit loud when the machine is under
heavy workload I was running some
benchmarks for this video and I had the
blades sitting on my desk here in the
office and it did sound like a jet
engine was beginning to spin up and take
off from my desk when you're doing
things like playing games exporting
videos doing anything that's really
gonna push that CPU to its max
especially when the machine is in gaming
mode if the laptop is gonna do
everything that it can to cool itself
down which is going to result in some
fan noise though I will say if you're
just browsing the web and watching
videos it's gonna remain near silent and
speaking of running benchmarks we ran a
variety of different tests in both PC
Mark and 3d mark on the blade and if
you're curious about what those results
were and you love to compare spec sheets
and benchmarks here are the results up
on the screen right now you can look at
the results and you can see there's just
no doubt that this thing is a very
powerful laptop still really like the
15-inch display colors look really good
and vibrant I still would like the extra
resolution you're getting on that 4k
model but I don't want to give up that
144 Hertz refresh rate even if it's a 10
DP panel it's a nice feature to have is
100% srgb color
accurate and it's an excellent display
for both content consumption
and content creation also you may not
think of a touchscreen being a big deal
on a laptop specifically a gaming laptop
and it's by no means a deal-breaker but
I will say once you use a laptop that
has it it's hard to go back to one that
doesn't so the 4k touch model obviously
has that touchscreen built-in
would have loved to have seen it on this
one but that might be more of a
technical limitation more than a razor
decision my opinions on the speakers
have not changed at all they still get
really loud and they sound okay but
they're just not very good in fact the
Lenovo y50 mean laughs stuff that we
took a look at a couple weeks ago cost
less than half the starting price tag of
the baseline blade and has built-in
speakers that's I think sound much
better much more full much less tinny
and hollow than the blade take a listen
for yourself but an easy fix to this
problem is obviously just a good pair of
external speakers or headphones but I
did see some questions about this in the
review and I wanted to make sure I
addressed it here for you guys
I still think not having Windows hello
incorporated into some aspect of this
machine is a really big missed
opportunity especially for a high-end
premium laptop like the blade that cost
two grand though I will say the keyboard
on a trackpad on the blade are an almost
unbeatable combo razor sure knows how to
make a good keyboard and the trackpad is
only runner-up in my opinion into
Apple's MacBook Pro I think that this is
one of if not the best trackpad you can
get on a Windows laptop it's big it's
spacious it has windows precision
drivers and it's just very nice to use
the more time I spend with the blade the
more I can confirm my original thoughts
and conclusions things I like the first
time I still like just as much this time
and the shortcomings were just as
annoying the second time around with the
better battery performance my opinion
goes from being a little more on the
fence to much more willing to recommend
this to those who are looking for one
beastly gaming machine though that's
gonna come at a very premium price tag
and I know I know that there are better
spec systems out there for a similar
price maybe some even cheaper and there
are lots of other options for the money
you're gonna spend on display but for me
it's gonna come down to a couple of
things that are important
build performance battery life and just
how long and how well this computer will
stand up to the test of time for
starting price cycle almost $2,000 this
laptop better have the components the
build and the power to justify that kind
of investment especially for a gaming
laptop but I think the 2018 blade fits
the bill
it checks almost all the boxes and
certainly at least for me did not
disappoint
so I opinions on the blade I've changed
it but definitely the better battery
life is going to really make me want to
recommend this more to family friends
and you guys who really want a great
gaming rig on the go and what are your
thoughts on the blade I know a lot you
guys own this machine leave your comment
down below and let us know what you
think also are you more tempted or more
curious about upgrading to the new blade

are you using to play games these days
leave a comment and let us know I
appreciate you guys watching this video
thank you so much be sure to of course
to subscribe to the channel click that
bell to turn on notification so you're
