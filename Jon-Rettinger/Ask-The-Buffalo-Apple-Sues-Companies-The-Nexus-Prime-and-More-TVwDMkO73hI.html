to you by audible welcome to another
edition of ask the Buffalo on this
episode we're going to cover everything
from the world of technology we're going
to talk about NFC tech we're going to
talk about the iphone 5 we're going to
talk about Apple's suing everybody we're
going to talk about video game systems
and everything in between let's go ahead
and get started alright so welcome back
to another episode of ask the Buffalo
where you could ask me jon rettinger
anything you want from the world of
technology you can ask me questions one
of two ways either go check out to
TechnoBuffalo calm once a week we'll put
up a post you can go ahead and ask your
question or any time of the day keep it
if it's four in the morning you're
sitting in bed feeling lonely you can
send a question to me at john for lakers
on twitter or at TechnoBuffalo use the
hashtag ask the bee and i would check it
out every week i'll pick four or five
sometimes six if i get super rambling
and we will answer your questions
alright so without further ado let's go
ahead and get started the first question
comes from Hakim our Don who asks what
do you think about Apple suing every
company and it appears that Apple is
suing just about everyone out there we
put up a joke post on TechnoBuffalo
saying who is Apple gonna sue next are
they gonna sue Meeks I have an eye on my
name are they going to sue apple growers
for making a product that looks like
your logo are they going to sue the
person who took a bite out of their logo
they are suing absolutely everyone and
here's why Apple is saying for starters
Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 looks too much
like the iPad to what you actually do
look alike but their tablets then be
coolin I'm saying a laptop looks like
another laptop at the similar form
factor you know the ipad 2 also looks
like the touchpad and on the same note
doesn't the iphone 4 look like droid 2
or doesn't it look like the hd7 i mean
they all kind of look like they've got
screens so i don't necessarily buy that
so much Apple is also suing motorola I
understand protecting your intellectual
property I can wrap my head around that
I don't think if you read the comments
on any on any post on technobuffalo or
elsewhere it's all apples greedy apples
greedy apples greedy I don't think that
Apple degree to trying to protect
intellectual property up there going
about it completely the wrong way for a
company that values their public image
that values marketing and that PR sort
of buzz apple is doing an awful job
about demolishing that certainly you
can't argue at the end results they are
I believe now by time you're watching
this the most valuable country in the
world with more capital cash reserves in
the United States government themselves
so clearly they are sitting on just a
giant stockpile of moose law but are
they going about throw away these
lawsuits certainly not they can't
protect everyone for making a tablet
certainly Microsoft when the first
companies that sort of put their
emphasis behind tablet technology and
having a screen that you can interact
with the touch is nothing new so there
are certain sort of intricacies and
those patents and I can get to legal on
you i would do i agree with apple suing
certainly I do not it's putting
injunctions against selling the galaxy
tab 10.1 in Europe perhaps regionally
here in the US anytime that there's more
competition the consumers end up winning
it makes companies have to compete to
put out better products anytime that
innovation is being stifled consumers
tend to lose so I understand the
business decision understand the
protective intellectual property of
importance and that they do look alike
so Apple does definitely have a case I
surely don't agree with it what do you
guys think and try to leave the
fanboyism out look at it from
objectively from a business standpoint I
think apples got a right to do what
they're doing and should they do what
they're doing check guy can ask john
what is your favorite video game system
and this is a tough one I love the ps3
for being able to play netflix it's got
a voodoo on there can play blu-ray can
do a ton of awesome stuff and play video
games I love that it can do that I'm
just not a PlayStation guy I've got a
playstation downstairs right in my big
TV and uses my dedicated blu-ray player
when it comes to actual gaming for the
xbox that's definitely a personal
preference never anybody asks me what
they should buy and they don't know the
answer i always recommend the ps3 you
get a more well-rounded package you get
a better value but when it comes from me
for playing games I'm an Xbox guy what
do you guys play the most kind of
curious here we have to say
and are you looking forward to the wii u
is the wii u going to be your favorite
console or if you tell nintendo to go
take a hike our next question has to do
with NFC or near field communications
comes from Jeff Schapiro who asks hey
John do you think NFC technology will
take off and be the main way to buy
things in the near or far future NFC
technologies that just mentioned stands
for near-field communications and it's
being built into a lot of devices like
the blackberry bold 9000 the Nexus S has
it as well it's a way to transfer
information so you can use that for a
lot of different ways you could transfer
information Mike on a smart tag can put
on the back your phone it can launch a
website on here but it can also transfer
say credit card information so you're
going to your local store you're walking
in and you want to buy a laptop you can
just wave your phone in front of the
sensor or the back yonder of your NFC
radio is it something you can buy that
and then all honesty maybe it's sign of
me getting old that scares the crap out
of me the fact that someone could steal
my photos go wipe it and suddenly buy
something frightens me to the core now
doesn't mean it's not going to happen
and it's not coming it's certainly
coming very very very fast Google is
really pushing NFC technologies there's
been rumors that Apple is going to have
NFC built into their next iPhone 5 but
from a personal standpoint it frightens
me who's knows who's going to be out
there sort of snooping around trying to
get access to my NFC radio I remember
when passports started using RFID tags
there are folks if you got with that I
think it was 10 to 20 feet could
actually scoop out all your information
from your RFID tag and your passport and
just frightens me I don't know maybe
it's a sign of whatever it scares me
didn't scare you Adam maybe I was
rambling but it makes me scared curled
up in bed at night shade you know too
much stuff I couldn't think of a fun
segue to go into this but I want to take

question comes from tanner lynn who
asked john when you think we're going to
see the nexus prime the nexus prime and
my best optimus prime voice is the next
flagship in the nexus line so we had the
nexus one built by HTC the nexus s built
by samsung and this next one is going to
be called allegedly that x is prime also
being built by samsung and will be the
first phone to be running Android Ice
Cream Sandwich much like the nexus s the
first one to run gingerbread this will
finally run the version of Android that
unifies the forces it brings the Empire
and it brings the Rebel Alliance and the
tab of the phone world together anyone
at unified platform we saw some leaks
