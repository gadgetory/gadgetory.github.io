technobuffalo here android kitkat is
deliciously coming any day so I thought
it'd be a good time to put out my
android kitkat wish list what I hope
it's gonna have what I wish it might
have what I hope someday Android might
get let's go and get start so I know kit
kat is there's android 4.4 it's gonna be
iterative it's not a five-point Oh giant
update so whether or not kit kat gets
any of this it's things that I hope
Android gets eventually let's jump right
in with my giant one that I am fingers
crossed hoping we get a real backup
solution Google already has awesome
online sort of Google Drive give us a
few extra gigabytes of storage and let
us do real backup and restore perhaps
KitKat will be the first version of
Android that handles OEM skins
differently at somehow we'll set a
backup file that works for everything
would be really really helpful to have I
love a way to restore phones a matter if
it's from a samsung or HTC or an LG let
me just restore my phone like it looked
before I would love to have that Google
you got the resources please make it
happen number two a true SMS app that
doesn't involve people being online like
iMessage your BBM I know what hangouts
is there new message and probably never
gonna see this but I don't like always
being online people able to send me an I
am around my im's always showing up on
my phone I just want straight text I
want a desktop application that i can
send messages to i can see send or
receive I want it to be simple make it
like I messages make it like BBM don't
force me to be online the buddy lists I
just don't like it maybe I'm alone but I
find it a little on the knowing side
number three improved google wallet
integration with google now makes for a
perfectly synergized passbook like
solution with payments built right in
google wallet was built up to be awesome
and i love using google wallet I'd look
for places to actually use exciting it's
just crazy cool to tap and pay for
things but it's not an easy process you
could build it in with google now you
could see coupons that show up you could
see all your membership cards that show
up and walk up to a restaurant that
would be an awesome way to help not only
fight Isis coming at you from mobile
payment but also totally take Google
Wallet to the next level number 4 ez NFC
sharing right now you can open a photo
or some other piece of media
then tap it to another NFC naval Android
device to share that picture it's kind
of a tedious process that's kind of a
really just long way of doing it though
I really wish we could tap our phones to
another Android device and then choose
what we want to share nice and simple
like that maybe it's several photos at
once or an application or a book that we
just downloaded or a new album or a game
which should work really well and very
easily so it obviously require Google to
enable sharing of Google Play products
but amazon already offers kindle n
features and barnes &amp;amp; noble has
something similar with their lend me so
it shouldn't be totally out of the
question plus the friggin Google with
all those resources Samsung's done
already a pretty nice job of using Wi-Fi
direct to share larger files but I
really like to see something like this
become easier to use easier to initiate
and be built in by default all Android
devices including tablet and smartphone
so Google please make it happen number
five always listening and I know it
sounds super creepy but it's awesome on
the Moto X but I could just say ok
Google now tell me the weather and I'm
to take my phone out of my pocket it
just knows and is listening it doesn't
drain a ton of battery it's a really
cool feature i love it if you don't like
it the option to turn it off or you find
a little bit creepy and too much
listening to what you're doing i
understand the privacy concerns i really
like it i love for it to make its way
into qik at number six double tap the
screen to turn it on or off i first saw
this with the LG g2 and it is beyond
awesome not only because the buttons on
the back there kind of annoying and art
defined but it just makes sense you
double tap the screen turns on you
double tap the screen turns off
obviously if you've got a password on
there or some sort of lock code it's
gonna daven another step might not work
as well but it's just really intuitive
double tap the screen it opens up what
tap it turns off I can't believe this
wasn't a feature that was built into
other android phones LG just made it
work really really well I love it to be
built in to android kitkat obviously are
a ton of other things we can get ton of
other want and wish losses but I thought
if I made a top-six list give me a good
place to start what do you guys think
about my list or any other features that
you want to have built into android
