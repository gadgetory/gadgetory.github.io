protecting a buffalo and we're here at
the letv booth at CES 2016 and what I
have here in my hand is the very first
device in the world running a snapdragon
820 processor it's astoundingly fast as
you can probably see right in front of
you right now we ran a quick entry to
benchmark we're really really lucky to
be able to be holding one of these even
even more so to be putting it on an
Aston Martin for Christ's sakes
but letv does a lot of really really
cool stuff they're basically they
started as a content creation platform
and that's the bread butter that's
exactly what is on here letv is focusing
a lot on an ecosystem that's what we're
calling this the very first ecosystem
phone for China right now there's no
Play Store on it but we think maybe it
might be coming to it they're not
entirely sure and in terms of coming to
the u.s. we don't know about pricing and
availability just yet either but man how
cool is it can be holding a phone
running an Snapdragon 820 it's a
quad-core processor clocked at 2.2
gigahertz and I'll tell you right now
it's screams leave it or not the Le max
Pro has more going for it than just the
Snapdragon 820 four gigs of DDR four
Rams four gigs of DDR four RAM that's
the same kind of RAM that you're going
to throw in and high-end gaming or
editing rig that's inside this phone
that's inside of my hand we live in the
future the Le max pro is also sporting
802 11 AD Wi-Fi which means it's also
backwards compatible but is literally
the bleeding edge in terms of wireless
connectivity the Le max pro is probably
somewhere on the spectrum of a concept
phone as it sits right now we're not
exactly sure whether or not it's going
to have the Play Store on it if and when
it does come to the US but these models
don't so we haven't been able to test it
to we haven't been able to testing
testing you guys know what I mean the
screen on this thing is also incredibly
high resolution is an AMOLED display
it's got raised glass so it almost feels
like you're touching the pixels with
your fingers feels incredible in the
hand it's got kind of like an HTC ish
build
seen a lot of these antenna lines a lot
lately so that's not terribly terribly
surprising capacitive buttons down at
the bottom and a whole bunch more so
hopefully this is a really good quick
look at the very first phone running
these Snapdragon 820 in the world for
you thank you guys so much for watching
hope you enjoyed this quick look stick
it here for all the rest of the videos
from CES 2016 right here on
TechnoBuffalo thank you guys so much for
watching be kind to one another
and I'll catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
