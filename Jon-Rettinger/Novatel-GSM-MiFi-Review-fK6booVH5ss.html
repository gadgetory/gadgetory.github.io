TechnoBuffalo with a review for you of
the Novatel Wireless my 523 72 GSM
personal hotspot now these MiFi devices
aren't new they've been out on Sprint
and Verizon for well over a year now but
the GSM versions are kind of rare and
hard to find and this particular unit
will run you about 270 dollars but
because you're using your existing data
plan from your cell phone you're not
being charged the 50 or $60 per month
usage fee that you would have to pay on
Sprint or Verizon so there's a really
big cost savings there if you would find
yourself using a device like this for
internet wherever you are on your laptop
or your netbook or your iPad so let's
talk about how it works so my first take
off the back battery cover just show you
how I set it up I popped in my SIM card
here put in the battery it's a very
simple operation of course you have to
take the SIM card out of your phone in
order to use this and of course you
should have an unlimited data plan if
you're going to use this device I also
put in a micro SD card because this is a
very unique feature of this MiFi I can
actually access files from a micro SD
card and have up to five people that are
using the Wi-Fi connection off of this
also access those same files so a great
way if you're if you're trying to share
documents or you're working on a project
for school or for work really cool so
let's talk about how this works it
operates so easily I can't even believe
that you turn it on and you wait about
15 seconds and the lights going to cycle
through and when it turns blue we're on
3G when it turns purple we are on HSPA
so there's blue and we'll see a Wi-Fi
light turn on when it's ready and
there's a Wi-Fi light and if we wait
another couple of seconds we will get it
to turn purple which means we're on a
tMT's faster 3G connection there goes
purple and and we're good we're good
that's it so we are ready to connect on
the laptop here so I'm going to go down
here I'm on Windows 7 I'm going to click
on my Phi
so it's listed here in the in the
network list and I'm gonna hit connect
and of course you can have wireless
encryption but I figure that why you
know waste time spend typing in a
password when it's not likely someone's
going to latch on to this network unless
you're at a Starbucks or somewhere
public like that so I can see in the
bottom right corner it's connecting I
have an exclamation point so I'm going
to wait another five seconds and I will
head on over to the browser to give you
a speed test and some other
demonstrations okay we are connected
over the MiFi the light has turned a
solid purple to mean that the device is
connected so I can jump on into Google
and usually the first time you load a
webpage it's a little bit slow but after
that after that connection is made it's
fast so let's go to any gadget or any
gadget mobile and again where you are
running off of this modify and look how
fast it is it's quite impressive now
this device has a range of about 30 feet
and like I mentioned you can connect up
to five Wi-Fi devices this is perfect if
you're in the car if you ever in a long
trip and you want to get Wi-Fi you want
to get internet access just pull out
this guy and and you got it so let's
click on some links just to see how it
looks then we'll run a speed test at
speedtest.net so it almost feels as if
I'm sitting home on my broadband
connection from the cable company
because it's just everything's very very
snappy and let's see how video plays
back although I'm not sure if this is HD
video okay let's see if we can make it
HD no we can't so let's real quick jump
to John four Lakers channel and I'll
bump that up to 720p and let's see how
please
there goes 720p video it's not stopping
to buffer not bad at all let's go to
speedtest.net to see how fast the actual
speed is coming through we run two tests
just to get an average it's a very good
site to test your bandwidth so that's
latency is gonna be a little bit slow
but you can expect that from cellular
internet but the speeds let's see
alright looks like it wants to get to to
make up just hit 2 megabits per second
this is actually quite impressive 2.6
megabits per second down pretty darn
good speeds to get over the the cell
phone company let's do it one more time
just to to get an average here so we're
to test again so again we got 2.6 down
I'm mostly interested in the download
speed because I'm not going to be
uploading YouTube videos over am i fine
connection let's see what we get the
second time around see if we can beat
2.6 now looks like two point three eight
okay now I want to show you the file
sharing capability and I'm going to do
that on the iPad so let me switch gears
here be right back okay so here we are
on the iPad and I'm going to show you
the web interface which allows you to
access those files I'm going to go into
settings and show you that we are
already connected to the MiFi hotspot
there it's checked off and real quick
let's just see the speed that we're
getting through the iPad I'm sure it's
going to be very similar than we that we
got on the laptop so begin test and
let's see what we what we pull off maybe
a little bit slower so we're gonna do
about one point one point nine I saw
come up 1.9 megabits per second down and
on the iPad we're at about looks like we
peaked at about 960 kilobits per second
so still not very bad so let me show you
the web interface and you can do this
from any device that's connected to the
to the MiFi whether it's a laptop or
netbook or whatever else so the web
address is wwm IFI and without the
dot-com and it's going to take you into
a screen that shows you some statistics
about the MiFi you can see I'm over AT&amp;amp;T
HSUPA you can see the connection can't
even see how much battery I have left I
found that I can get the full four hours
that's advertised I'm sure over time
that will go down but you can also
connect it to your computer via USB so
you can charge it and use the
action at the same time which is quite
beneficial so here's some other
information you can see how much data
you've received how much you've sent so
that if you don't have an unlimited data
plan you can keep an eye on that now
let's go over here to micro SD files I
placed a few pictures on the my Fi and
here we have the folder structure and of
course on the iPad you're not going to
play avi videos which is a Windows file
format on a laptop running Windows you
could but standard files like pictures
you can so here are a bunch of
wallpapers let's try this one and so
here they are here are the pictures from
from the MiFi and if it's a known file
format it'll show up in the browser of
course that limits a lot on the iPad but
if you're on you know if you're
connected with your Mac or your Windows
computer it really lets you show a
variety of file formats very handy
function if you're sharing with people
or you just need a wireless way to
access a micro SD card maybe you're
taking pictures off of your smartphone
or just transferring files and over here
it shows you how much space you have
free so overall I recommend the MiFi
personal hotspot again I'll put a link
in the sidebar on how to get this from
Negri electronics comm it's about two
hundred seventy dollars if this is a
product that you would use a lot I think
this is a much better alternative than
getting the my five from Verizon or
Sprint when there is a monthly charge
you're already paying for a data plan
why not turn the data plan into a MiFi
using this device where it turns on very
fast you've got instant connection for
five computers that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
