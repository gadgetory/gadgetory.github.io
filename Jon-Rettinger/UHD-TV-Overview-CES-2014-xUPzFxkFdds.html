technobuffalo here you know the
brand-new gorgeous 1080p flat screen
that you just hung up on your wall I got
good news and I got some bad news for
you the good news it looks like the bad
news it is quickly becoming crazy
obsolete here at CES 2014 it's all about
4k and curves I do love things that have
those so 4k is coming whether you wanted
to or not it is going to be everywhere
and very soon and it's not just gonna be
flat like we've seen TVs since flat
screens came we are here to Samsung
booth and they're showing the world's
first UHD curved screen LG has curved
screens they even have screens that'll
go curbs and then go flat so you're
probably gonna ask him like I was what
do I get with the curved screen well the
good news if you buy like 80 of them you
could just surround yourself in like a
circle of TVs and you can start of make
your own kind of oculus rift style but
and you can only get one for I'm
assuming is going to be a very high
price you're going to get a more
immersive environment are going to be
able to see more now let me go to 4k so
you're getting sort of a wider canvas
but your eyes naturally are used to
seeing dimension then sort of providing
not 3d TV but Brad another dimension to
that 2d picture I will say it looks
really really immersive and it looks
gorgeous weather that's be worth the
prob astronomical price that is yet to
be as Ian's going to be many years for
the filters down to more affordable sets
but 4k flexible TVs are here and they do
look pretty awesome is it enough for you
to want to buy to rush to 4k I don't
know 4k is coming in
pretty fast actually there's not that
much content right now but Reed Hastings
the CEO of Netflix took stage at Sony's
don't tell the Samsung people that I
said Sony while I'm here and said that
all of netflix original programming will
be filmed in 4k and you can stream 4k at
some point in your future with the
connection of 15 mega bits or faster
either Wi-Fi or wired so there is going
to be 4k content that arguments kind of
going to go by the wayside but for now
it looks gorgeous it's more of just like
a jaw-dropping that looks badass kind of
thing hope you guys enjoy leave your
comments right down below let me know
you think of me for k is right for you
or not I'll hear your thoughts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
