Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo want to show
you a quick comparison here the galaxy
s5 in my left hand in the galaxy s6 in
my right hand a lot of big upgrades here
you can see the plastic borders on the
galaxy s5 there have been replaced by an
aluminium unibody design on the galaxy
s6 to the right the back now Gorilla
Glass 4 not this rubbery plastic some
people called it a band-aid I actually
thought it looked pretty cool the front
you have a quad HD display 5.1 inches
upgrade on the camera wide-angle lens a
better fingerprint reader this time you
just touch it to make payments or unlock
the phone I believe and this one you had
to swipe the bottom speakers now there
and obviously the port is no longer
covered because this is not IP resistant
for water and dust while the Galaxy s5
was 3.5 millimeter headphone jack moved
to the bottom and up top IR blaster is
still there big camera bump 16
megapixels now they said you know one of
the best cameras I guess they've ever
put in a phone but we'll have to test
that speaker by the way is 1.5 times
louder than it was on the galaxy s5
other features this is an acci notice
chip this time around x2 no seven
wireless charging built right into the
phone which wasn't the case with this 32
64 and 128 gigs of storage here but you
can't expand it as you could with the
galaxy s5 you also can't remove the
battery as you could with the galaxy s5
so that's just a couple of the ways
these phones differ pretty drastically
actually in a really really nice upgrade
on Samsung's hat from the galaxy s5 to
the galaxy s6 any case just wanted to
show you them this is Todd asel tin from
techno bubble up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
