John Breton jure from TechnoBuffalo here
at the hands-on demonstration is
something I'm super excited to show you
as a technique or we see a lot of new
stuff come through our offices but very
few things there is innovative than is
interesting to use as this libretto so
on first blush it looks just like any
other netbook a little bit on the fat
side it's small it's light but when you
open this thing up that's where the fun
starts
check that out dual touchscreens looks
like a giant Nintendo DS let me go ahead
and power this guy on and run through
some of the specs so as soon as I opened
up the libretto my geek alarms went off
I kept thinking how cool is this and
then I sort of start to get more
practically how can you actually use
this I'm gonna go ahead and show you
every button power it on here this is
running a full version of Windows 7 it
is the starter version but you can
upgrade it to home or business
professional whatever you would like it
does have a Pentium chip in it it's
actually 1.2 gigahertz dual-core pentium
u 5400 it's packin 2 gigs of ddr3 RAM
it's got a 62 gig serial ata hard drive
as well as an expansion card slot right
there on the top for microSD s you can
expand the storage space this guy's
booting up and does boot up rather
quickly so you have a full pentium
processor so you're gonna get much much
much better than netbook performance not
to show you guys when it comes to you
flash contents and streaming video so
here we are this is Windows 7 looks a
little strange asking me to update Adobe
Flash we'll go ahead and leave that for
just a minute let me go ahead and walk
you through it when I saw this thing I
understood the top panel okay it's
touchscreen Windows 7 kind of just like
a small tablet on top what the heck's
going on with the bottom let me show you
what we have here with the body because
this thing does all kinds of stuff that
I had never seen a laptop do before so
go ahead and tap tap it and open it up
so you have these things here called
boards you can go and scroll through and
have a ton of different boards down here
you can add notes
you can go ahead and make your own board
and add shortcuts for games and things
like that but what interested me most
was how was I going to input text on
something like this well there actually
is a keyboard to go ahead and tap that
button on the left that pulls up a very
full tactic tactile feedback keyboard
and typing is actually not that bad on
this and you get a few keyboard options
you've got sort of a larger one right
there I'm going to bring that back get
serve a larger keyboard you can go ahead
and make that even bigger go ahead and
shrink it if you want serve some more
number options you can also split it
which is a little bit weird and I'll
show a part of the screen and that'll be
useful and I'll show you in a minute we
actually turn this guy on the side look
at it like a book similar what we saw
with the old Microsoft courier or would
have been the courier there's another
split keyboard just a number pad and
then back to the keyboard so Windows 7
is certainly optimized for a four touch
but it's a very awkward to go ahead and
sort of touch around here on one of
these dual seven inch capacitive screens
which I should say have a resolution of
12 24 by 600 so you're not looking at
the highest resolution here in the world
but it will get the job done that's
actually a resolution of 124 by 600 so
the bottom screen here turns off and
you're just gonna pretty much use a
computer as you'd like let's talk about
navigation first certainly and go ahead
and use your finger and poke around on
these small icons and go where you want
to go if you want to check out control
panels you can go ahead and do that a
little bit cumbersome because the screen
is so small actually to shoot was
include something that makes this really
handy so button in the bottom right hand
corner opens up what looks like a full
trackpad you can go and navigate now
nice and easily
now Toshiba made this knowing they
weren't going to get a huge adoption
right it was actually just made it
because they could serve a show
innovation celebrate the 25th
anniversary it's gonna set you back just
about eleven twelve hundred bucks so
it's not a cheap proposition and they
made just a very limited supply so it's
sort of a wall supply the last kind of
thing so if you're interested in getting
one you probably should go ahead and
jump on it so as you go ahead and use
this virtual touchpad at the bottom I
actually get haptic feedback as you go
over menu options and I thought now
getting to be extremely
while using this so go remind me later
here for flash I took me a while to
actually find that touchpad option but
once I did things worked very well all
right let me go ahead and show you some
of the performance things we got here
let's go ahead and jump on into Windows
Explorer and this is a full computer so
don't be fooled the big penis is a
netbook and you might because of its
size one interesting sort of feature
while this page is loading up the bottom
of this stays very very very cool the
top part it's actually where all the
computer stuff are so the top parts
getting get very hot you're gonna hear
often a lot of fan noise you can see
there's a lot of fan vents there but
when you put this thing on your lap
you're not going to fry your business
off because the bottom part says not
where the computer components are and
will stay very cool something to kind of
keep in mind alright so let's take a
look at the web browser so you can go
ahead and scroll the feedback is pretty
these in here it does have pinch-to-zoom
so you can zoom in it's not the most
fluid thing i've seen in the world but
it does indeed work let me go ahead and
jump on over to let's go say my youtube
channel so i'll go ahead and navigate
over there and I will use the on-screen
keyboard to type this you can see how
effective or ineffective it is so now I
want to move that trackpad out of the
way I'm gonna go ahead and minimize it
now I can go ahead and just type like
normal so I can do www.youtube.com
getting used to to type on this thing
it's not awful but I wouldn't you're not
gonna go ahead and write your novel and
take this guy to Starbucks with you to
do that just sort of keep in mind so
let's go and jump right to YouTube and
we'll hit enter you saw it actually
moved that touchpad up to the top kind
of interesting alright so here is
YouTube let's go ahead and go to one of
the videos I'm I cannot we'll do a quick
search just so I can play it for not
very bad nature of copyright stuff you
can see what YouTube's performance is
going to be so let John for and there it
go it pulls one of them up go ahead and
select it hit enter and there is a video
there is around one of the Mac versus PC
series go ahead and click that
and it looks like pretty smoothly things
playback is really nice the speakers
aren't necessarily overly loud but it
does work go ahead and see if I got the
volume here turned down but it's very
smooth much smoother than general
Network performance and Hulu by the way
plays very well on this as well so I'm
looking for something to get a take on
the road this guy might actually work
out quite well for you when I go ahead
and close all this stuff when you bring
back my touchpad John reason is up there
there's all these options you'll have
buttons to sort of move them down and
move them up to see those arrows down or
arrows up that arrow down is going to
push it down there let me go ahead and
close this window here go ahead and see
Matt talking and let's talk about the
form factor here when I saw this form
factor first thing I thought it was
games and books am i calling it the
libretto clearly they had one of those
in mind and there is a built-in
ereader in here and supposedly you can
use all open epub and PDF formats a lot
of had a very hard time actually getting
context over to the device but there are
some books on here let me go ahead and
show you what we've got to work with I
should also mention that it does have an
accelerometer so you can turn it before
you get into the book side of it and
it'll actually reorient itself using
Windows 7 in this sort of book ish form
factor would necessary to say it's the
most user-friendly way to use a laptop
but you definitely can if you want to
sort of sit on the train or something
look at a website you know have part of
the website here and part of the website
here you definitely can or have two
sites one open on each side let me go
ahead and show you that books and we'll
use it in this form factor and I don't
turn the whole computer off here so the
accelerometer again it is as you can see
very sensitive so how you're how you're
using this take a little while to orient
itself so go ahead and hit the start
button there you go let's go ahead and
check out some of the books programs
we'll go to all programs my to Shuba
and there we have to achieve a book like
I can into a Shiva folder I can click on
it out using my fat thumb which is not
appear to be possible it's definitely
part of the issues with it it's got
bluetooth so if you want to use a
Bluetooth keyboard or mouse you
definitely can get either to 11 B G and
n built in here as well alright so the
book place is opened up you can sort of
see the reflective screen there once
again these are capacitive screens so
sort of these styluses that perhaps we
might have used on older touchscreen
devices is not going to function you
guys can get a whole view of my office
here in the reflection and it should it
be opening up with a book place now
although I am dubious that it's gonna do
that let's try that one more time there
programs
jump on into to Shuba all right now it's
there we go book place powered Babu Leo
and one of the things that keep
surprising me is I I keep expecting
netbook performance from this guy just
because of its size and really you end
up getting much much much better so
we'll go ahead and open up a book here
just pick one and this is sort of one of
the most natural ways to use a libretto
just actually use it like a book and I
will today I take this thing out and I
was sort of using and exploring it just
out in the bow I kept getting some very
odd stairs no one's ever seen anything
like this before and that includes this
tech reviewer so is very sort of
interesting and fun to learn how to use
so accelerometer kicked in again let's
go ahead and let that come back
hopefully we're gonna see a book open up
here alright so now we do actually have
a book opened up and you can go ahead
and turn the pages and just start
reading hit the arrows
I'll wait there's an easier way to do it
it's not the smoothest experience in the
world the program is a bit jumpy there's
a lot of reflection as you can see here
you're gonna get a decent amount of eye
strain trying to do any serious amount
of reading on this guy but if your
student you've gotta read a quick PDF
before class or do a case study it's
going to get the job done I'm gonna go
ahead and push this guy back let it
reorient itself and I should also
mention that it's got a relatively
decent web
built-in there it's a one megapixel
sensor so in case you want to do your
web chatting or skype chatting you've
got the option to do so let's go ahead
and close this up you know often times
you try and use your fingers it's hard
to navigate Windows 7 but it does work
they've made things a bit friendlier
easy to be used when you try and do a
larger scale items let me go ahead and
show you some of the large windows
that'll pop up here well go ahead and
back and open up Internet Explorer and
if I hit the back button you get a whole
bunch of options you can do to close or
move to make things a bit easier and
optimized for touch I hope you guys
enjoyed this overview and sort of review
of the Toshiba libretto it's one of
those things that's very fun to use
there's a huge novelty factor you think
something with the dual touch screens
from a practical standpoint I think I
would go crazy having to use this thing
on an everyday basis but it is fun it is
unique and certainly kind of kind of
cool to see something a bit different so
guys I am John Grainger from
TechnoBuffalo I'll have this for another
few days if there's something that you
want to see go ahead and leave it in the
comments and I will show you see you
guys in the next video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
