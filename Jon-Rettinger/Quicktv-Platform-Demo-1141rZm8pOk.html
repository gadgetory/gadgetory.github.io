lot of emails from people in companies
showing me some services and products
they think are really kind of cool and
helpful and if I think they're gonna be
useful to you guys I usually share them
with you and one such product kind of
came through my email and it's called
quick TV as you guys obviously know I do
a lot of work with YouTube you know I
edit my videos and using iMovie jelling
I'll post them online but one thing that
I wish I had was the ability to edit my
videos once they were online so for
example if I want to go ahead and add
some text to it not annotations I can't
do that with YouTube if I won't want to
change pictures or I made a mistake I
want to fix it you know again I can't do
that
or if I got a sponsor and I want to put
in a picture or a sponsored video you
know I can't do that as well or if a
sponsorship just and didn't I want to
remove that video you know I can't do
the head really once the content
uploaded to YouTube it really is as it
is even though they're making some
changes to try and help you really
you're limited to what you can do that's
kind of where quick dot TV comes in
they're currently in private beta and
they were cool enough to hook me up with
a beta code so it's actually what quick
TV does is it gives you all those
abilities that I just mentioned you can
create and edit your content after it's
been posted online so unfortunately you
can't post it online to YouTube but it
will give you an embed code that you can
use and post on your website or ever
will take an embed code it will work for
you so it's actually what you get is an
online version of iMovie you can edit
your clips you degrade your clips really
from any Mac or PC that internet
connection so that is very nice so let
me go ahead and show you a little bit
about it you can learn how to use quick
TV you go through and review all these
different videos that have you learn how
to edit and this guy will kind of walk
you through it one of the other cool
things that I really like about quick TV
is they have built-in analytics which
let you track publish productions in
real time which as a video producer is
quite handy you can
see who's viewing your videos what
demographic they are how long they're
watching at what point they're leaving
so to really give you a chance to help
tailor your content to suit your
audience and that's a feature that I
really wish YouTube would would build on
I do give you some demographic
information where it's coming from but
it's not really as complete as a quick
dot TV folks so that's one of the
features that I've really been enjoying
nothing around out there quite a bit
unfortunately since I do most of my
video editing on YouTube it's tough for
me to utilize a service to full of it to
the full extent of its capabilities
however I wouldn't wager that probably
some sort of integration that will be
coming all I don't have any concrete
proof of that it would just seem like a
natural evolution so guys this is quick
dot TV to want to tell you about it
they were also cool enough to hook you
guys up as well with beta codes if you
go to the website quick TV and use the
code John for Lakers you can start
playing around a bit yourself and
curious to know what you guys think you
know leave your comments in the sidebar
if you think your service like this is
very useful do not think it's useful
what features you which they had you
know I know they'll probably watch in
the comments so if you have some
feedback for them you know go ahead and
and leave it hey guys hope you enjoyed
for some exclusive content be sure to
follow me on Twitter twitter.com slash
John for Lakers hope you guys enjoyed
this introduction to quick TV I think
that if these guys continue down the
road they're going it really could be a
very very robust and complete platform
that really will rival some of the
bigger ones out there if not becoming
the big dog on the hill see you guys
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
