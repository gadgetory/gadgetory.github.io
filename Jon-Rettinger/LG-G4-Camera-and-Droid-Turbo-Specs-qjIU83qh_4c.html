from TechnoBuffalo and in today's rumor
roundup we'll be talking about a variety
of tech goodies that may interest your
wallet this is rumor roundup let's start
rounding up those rumors now the LG g3
has been out for about six months now
but already the g4 rumors are starting
to swirl now earlier this week a part
leaked suggested to follow up might
feature a 20 point 7 megapixel camera
would upgrade an optical image
stabilization that 20.7 megapixel camera
is a pretty big step up from the g3 s 13
megapixel shooter which already produces
some great results the upgrade would put
the LG g4 part with Sony's flagship
phones which offer some of the best
Android photography around we're still a
long way from the LG g4 and it's way too
soon to make any real predictions about
what else the rumored smartphones could
offer no I like the g3 scammer a lot and
I think that 20 megapixel sensor paired
with laser autofocus feature would be a
killer combination for the g4 second
let's talk about the Oppo and three last
month a pair of photos claiming to
reveal the device surface online
suggesting the company could take
upcoming devices design in a bold new
direction however the latest rumor
suggests we're getting a more familiar
looking phone instead the oppo n3 looks
really similar to last year's and one
since it features the same rotating
camera design up top but it looks a
little different too
Oppo also jammed its dual LED flash into
a single module and added some stitched
leather around the camera the oppo n3
could offer a bigger display thinner
bezels and even a new button layout
we're also guessing the new phone will
pack up great aspects and may even
increase the megapixel count on that
camera let's take a quick break from
this video and thank our friends over at

Verizon's droid tour boat looks a lot
like a souped up Droid Maxx and Moto X
according to the leaked info the device
will sport a 5.2 inch quad HD display a
build that subscribe is metalized
glass-fibre 2.7 gigahertz Snapdragon 805
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM and a 21
megapixel camera capable of doing 4
videos the device will also reportedly
sport a 3900 milliamp battery and if
true the droid turbo should be able to
get through a few days without worrying
about charging your phone every night
just like the Nexus 6 which was unveiled
earlier this week it also sport
Motorola's turbo charger which is
capable of giving a device eight hours
worth of power in just 15 minutes
thanks to Qualcomm is quick charge 2.0
technology the Droid turbo will also
supposedly include a wireless charging
back meaning you'll be able to charge
without the hassle wires now Verizon and
Motorola are definitely going all out
for this one and we can't wait to see
how it compares to the Nexus 6 anyways
