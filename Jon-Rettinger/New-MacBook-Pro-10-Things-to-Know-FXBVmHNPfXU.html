MacBook Pros there's a lot of highlights
of course the touch bar is the big one
it's multi-touch place the function keys
can be app specific you've got the
second-generation butterfly keys you've
got touch ID built right in to the
computers now as well but those aren't
things I want to talk about it figure
you guys already know about those there
are a lot of things beneath the surface
method new MacBook Pros maybe you guys
didn't know especially if you're
considering picking one up or debating
whether or not it's worth the price so
here are 10 things to know about the new
MacBook Pro coming at number 10 there's
still no dedicated GPU in the 13-inch
MacBook Pro so if you wanted the power
of the 15 in a smaller package you are
still out of luck if using the Intel
iris 550 and for number 9 let's say with
that 13-inch MacBook Pro dual-core only
you can get it all the way up to pretty
beastly
i7 clocked at 3.3 gigahertz before you
get any turbo boosting in there but it
is still dual-core if you want quad core
look at the bigger brother 15-inch and
coming in at number 8 the 15-inch
MacBook Pro comes with the Radeon Pro
455 with two gigs of ram but for an
extra 100 bucks you can upgrade that to
a 460 with four gigs of RAM got it makes
me wonder why Apple didn't do that out
of the box that's a big update doubling
the dedicated video ram for the GPU so
probably recommend you do that coming in
at number seven this is a big one Apple
finally updated the chips in their
MacBook Pros they are running now the
6th gen Intel I series of chips skylake
the 7 gen cab u leik is starting to come
out right now
Apple opted for probably the more
readily available skylake chips but
there are the 6th gen I'm not the newest
7 gen that's available in some computers
coming at number 6 way better displays
the resolution is the same but
everything else about that panel got
better it's now 67% brighter T 7% higher
contrast ratio and 25% more colors which
should mean things just going to look
better as your video editing browsing
websites looking at pictures of ever
other dirty thing you do with your
laptop coming in at number 5 we know
some color options a little I wish it
was just black Space Gray is now
available addition to the classic silver
and just as a bonus one no more glowy
Apple logo on the back number for the 13
and 15 inch MacBook Pros have four USB
see Thunderbolt through
reports to the same standards defuse
them for both which means a few things
first you can use any of those ports to
power your computer which is kind of
cool and also if you want to use a
standard or older generation USB a which
is sort of normal USB it's dongle time
coming in at number three got a
headphone jack which seems like a silly
thing to have to have to announce but
still headphone jack there isn't like a
lightning port in there which probably
would've been funny but headphone jack
is still here so you can still plug
headphones in
no no dongles needed they're coming at
number two oddly the MacBook Air still
exists Apple is still happy to sell it
to on their website but also existing is
a new 13-inch MacBook Pro not the one
we've been talking about with the OLED
strip and all the other touch ID stuff
that's been criminal to it there's a
less spectin that has physical function
keys like the last gen but Scott the
second generation butterfly switches
built into it but the positioning that
to replace the MacBook Air but they're
still selling the MacBook Air which
doesn't make much sense so there are two
versions of 30 inches what the boils
down to the one with the touch bar
without touch bars is kind of dancer and
also less ports it has it has less port
and number one and this is the big one
for a reason the flash door you can get
up to a hundred times faster than the
last gen that's gonna translate to just
way faster computing and it's startling
how big a difference faster flash
storage makes makes your whole computer
feel better you're thinking well the six
gen chips are so much better
flash storage and fast storage you can
get for read and write makes a giant
difference in everything you do on your
computer that is a nice upgrade for
Apple and obviously there's lot of other
things here and they certainly might not
be the big flagship features but I
figured you guys knew about those did
you know about these 10 things and most
importantly are you gonna be getting a
new MacBook Pro are you not interested
are you maybe jumping to a surface book
maybe either one of the razor blades or
blade stealth I don't know what you guys
are doing if you found anything else
that maybe Apple didn't announce you see
their product pages maybe you've gleaned
from another site let us know give it a
thumbs up we always appreciate it till
next time I'm Jai Rinder dekho Buffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
