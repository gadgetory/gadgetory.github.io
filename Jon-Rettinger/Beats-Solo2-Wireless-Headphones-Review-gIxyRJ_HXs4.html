TechnoBuffalo here's a full review for
you of the beats solo2 wireless we unbox
these guys about two weeks ago and
they've been sitting on my head for that
entire time I've got a lot to say about
a lot of impressions and thoughts let's
go and dig write it so let me give a few
caveats here I am by no means an
audiophile consider this review of
someone who just wanted a pair of
bluetooth headphones that sounded pretty
good if you've got impressions or
thoughts about Beats headphones and you
already know what you're gonna think
before you watch this review then don't
bother watch this if you're looking for
a genuine honest impression you're
looking for maybe pick up a pair of
bluetooth headphones you're curious what
the marketplace looks like alright let's
go ahead and get started first these
look exactly like the solo twos we've
got right here save for a micro USB cord
and power button on the bottom and some
hidden buttons that you can't really see
over the left ear cup design wise they
are absolutely identical the ear cups
are extremely cushy and very comfortable
they also articulate a little bit so I
can sit on your head depending on what
angle your ears might be at they sit on
your ear not over so some people might
have an issue with that and not find it
comfortable definitely took a little
while to get used to the feel but after
a while they start to feel very very
nice you could just a size whether you
got a big head or a little head also
it's got some cushion at the top so it's
not going to hurt the very top part of
you dome I will say they were a little
bit tight at first when I put these on I
don't have a giant head but after a few
days it started to feel fine and stretch
out there also seemed pretty durable you
can sort of bend them and move them how
you want so you got to throw them in a
bag it won't be an issue and if you are
Charlie you want to throw when you're
back just go ahead and fold them up and
you're good to go drop these suckers in
your backpack and you will be all set
it's got a few hidden buttons in the
left ear cups got a volume up and volume
down and also sort of button that
generally will control the music player
you are listening to it'll my case it
launches iTunes for me it also has a
built-in mic if you want to use this to
make phone calls in case you had got
this on your head you've got a pair to
your phone a phone call comes in since
these are Bluetooth you're going to want
to pair them to bluetooth within the
pairing with super easy
at least for me like any other Bluetooth
device that I've got it was like an
eight second process I set these up on
my iMac right before I updated my
software to 10-point 10.1 and on 10.10
audio was super crackly and not good at
all I upgraded the OS like an hour later
and it absolutely worked like a charm so
you pick these up you're having a pair
of bluetooth headphones don't sound so
good check your software updates see if
there's something new out there all
right so all that aside all design
business pushed away had these suckers
work their headphone they gotta be able
to play music right to be honest they
sound just like the solo twos as a
caveat though these do not support apdex
instead support SBC which isn't really a
big issue for me I think these sound
great if you use Apple Apple didn't
support app text anyway but audio
sounded pretty solid after these we'll
talk a bit more about that the original
beats were tuned for hip hop and we're
super bass heavy me though I'm not all
about that bass and modern beats though
have a way better sound signature and
are just super friendly other genres of
music like listen to classical music
when I work these sounded actually
really nice doing so no mid-range muffle
at all pretty good about eliminating
outside noise but not great they don't
have active noise-cancelling so sort of
bear that in mind
look the beats are kind of polarizing
it's a polarizing company owned by a
polarizing company and that's going to
be a personal preference they come in
red black blue and white in a time this
filming these really bright red ones are
Verizon exclusive personally I'd rather
not have a giant boots logo on my ear
and I'd wager that logo ended up costing
me about 100 hundred fifty bucks the art
Wireless still using a battery battery
life has been really awesome I use these
every day at work and they're always on
standby for nine plus hours and I've
only had to charge them once a week a
case you're wondering what can happen
when they die which is big concern of
mine they come with the cable and if you
plugged that cable in it's gonna turn
off the power and the work just like
regular solo2 wireless that same cable
case you're wondering also has a mic
audio controls built right in so it just
turns and centrally into so low twos so
as I mentioned these weren't overly
comfortable to wear at first I don't
have a giant head they felt kind of
tight but after about three days or so
they stretched out and now feel great
even with glasses
that was a question a lot of people
asked we did the unboxing I usually wear
glasses and this was not an issue with
those on so if you have a hard time
seeing like me and you want to have
headphones not gonna be a problem with
these so I really like these headphones
and I get that the beats name is
polarizing here the big issue for me is
the price premium that comes along with
it 300 bucks is a lot of money like I
said earlier I prefer to have same
headphones - that be logo for a Hyundai
250 dollars less if you don't mind
spending that kind of cash on headphones
these work really well but sure your
people are going to judge you for people
are going to judge you anyway when
you're out in the battle so don't let
that influence your decision sound
signature was really good Ike listened
to a variety of genres the bass isn't
going to overwhelm you you came here a
little bit of outside noise but you
might want that if you're commuting you
wanna be able to hear people around you
faintly it just felt nice on the head
Audio is good battery life for solid I
like that the battery dies a monologue
fight for example that I can just plug
him in overall I've liked the headphones
I'm not the biggest fan of the bright
look at me design on the red ones
doesn't mention other color options are
available ask yourself what you're
looking for in a pair of headphones do
you want a logo do you want good audio
do you want to save money if you want to
save money these are definitely not the
headphones to look at if you want
something though that's going to sort of
work well perform well have nice battery
life and you'll II don't care about
what's on the side of it the beats seem
to be a pretty good option I'm sure
they're way less expensive options out
there that do the same thing if you care
about the logo and you want headphones
that are going to work well again these
are pretty solid choice for you alright
