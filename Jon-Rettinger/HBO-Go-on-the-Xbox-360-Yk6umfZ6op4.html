with a look at the HBO Go app for the
Xbox 360 the HBO Go app is officially
available today on the Xbox 360 you'll
need to be a subscriber of HBO with a
cable provider that actually supports
the app currently so when you go to your
Xbox dashboard you'll need to navigate
to the apps marketplace which is what
I'm doing here don't make fun of my
Academy background you'll find HBO go
download it or as you see download again
download won't take long it's not a very
big file and once it finishes you'll
want to back out of the active downloads
window just like you normally would and
then navigate to the app from your
dashboard see you'll head into you won't
do this was just silliness you head into
apps my apps and you'll find HBO GO so
you'll launch the program and what's
gonna happen here is it's gonna have you
activated with your cable provider I
live in the mid-atlantic of the US and
my cable provider is Comcast or Xfinity
and as you'll see in a moment I was a
little perplexed with what was going on
here it authenticates you can either
preview the service or activate it and I
was going to activate it and then it
comes up with a full list of current
cable providers that are supporting the
HBO Go app for the Xbox 360 on that
first list he won't see Comcast or
Xfinity you'll see just about everything
else
unfortunately so I headed into more TV
providers and it was a bunch of stuff
that I had never heard of and this was
the point where I contact
did Sean Ani on the site and I was like
hey man what do I do
so Sean had me sign in using his DirecTV
account and what's gonna happen when you
do that you're gonna get an activation
code you follow the instructions on the
actual HBO Go app once those are
completed you'll be able to cycle
through and actually get the full HBO
app experience it was just what's
loading up right now it looks a lot like
the Xbox 360 Dashboard it's broken down
in the exact same fashion where the
Netflix app if you have any experience
there looks wildly different this one is
kind of very similar clearly I saw Robo
Cop immediately wanted to check that out
I think you have parental controls so
here I have the late-night stuff but you
can probably turn that off or control it
as per necessary if you have any young
kids that you don't want using the apps
and then launching a movie is is I mean
it's literally exactly like launching an
Xbox 360 game or a program or app or
whatever and it boots up quickly
once the movies up and running you have
Kinect controls which are pretty similar
to Netflix here I just said Xbox pause
and it paused and then saying Xbox
brings up your standard menu an Xbox
play brings it back and then you're on
control controls are exactly the same as
well so if you've used the Netflix app
before the in movie experience is pretty
similar the UI when you're out of the
movie looks exactly like that of the
Xbox Dashboard hopping in and out as
quick buffering looks pretty quick so
yeah and Here I am just checking out the
movie for a little bit just to kind of
see what it looks like and make sure
that the quality is pretty good top
story Pretoria the threat of nuclear
confrontation in South Africa escalated
today when the ruling white Miller so
that's the HBO go up for the Xbox 360 if
you use the Xbox 360 doll for other
entertainment stuff it probably is
pretty similar to that experience that
your already used to so this has been
