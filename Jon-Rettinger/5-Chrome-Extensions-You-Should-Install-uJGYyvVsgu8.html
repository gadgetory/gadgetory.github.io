it from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
taking a look at five Google Chrome
extensions that could potentially change
the way you use your browser so the
first one in our list is pushbullet now
pushbullet is one of the fastest and
easiest way to get links notes and files
from your computer to your mobile device
and vice versa one of the cool things
about the pushbullet extension on Chrome
is that you'll be able to send a link to
a website you're currently viewing to
your other devices and you can also
create a new message via SMS and reply
directly inside of Chrome however you
need to be using an Android device to
use the SMS function you can also check
out your miss notifications from your
other devices directly on Chrome under
the notifications tab now in order for
you to send links and notes from your
computer to your mobile device you have
to install the pushbullet app on your
smart phone but it's free making it that
much better if you're constantly
bouncing around from device to device
give pushbullet a look the second one on
our list is pocket now pocket extension
for Chrome is the best way to save
articles videos photos and more when you
find something in Chrome that you want
to view later you'll be able to save
that article or page in pocket and it
automatically sync that over to your
phone and tablet so you can view at any
time now the great thing about pocket
for Chrome is that you'll be able to
save pretty much everything by clicking
on a pocket icon once or by right
clicking on the page and adding that
site to your pocket if you're looking
and save a photo you can simply right
click on a photo and click on add to my
pocket the iOS and Android app are great
as well you can sync between your
computer and mobile devices and view
your save items instantly the third
point on our list is readability now
readability is an extensive ecosystem
that lets you read articles with a focus
on easy reading if you're constantly on
the web reading articles and you want a
more simplistic and distraction-free
view readability is a great tool that
will convert rich websites to give them
a bit more of a simplistic look for
example you're reading an article on a
website and you want to read the article
in a distraction-free environment well
you can simply click on the readability
icon and it'll open up a drop-down menu
giving you an option to read now read
later or sent a Kindle read now will
convert the article in a very simplistic
page that features rich text and images
now inside read mode you have the option
to change the text size spacing font and
switch from light mode to dark mode to
make it easier reading at night
readability is free and you can download
it now from Google's Chrome Web Store so
the fourth one on our list is Universal
Search tab now
reversal search tab is a neat little
extension that will essentially enhance
your new tab page giving you multiple
search engines to choose from in a
single page you can search from a couple
of websites such as Wikipedia YouTube
Twitter Amazon and DuckDuckGo without
the need to visit the individual sites
now to switch between search engines you
can simply hover over the Google logo
and you'll be able to choose a site
you'd like after clicking on the
preferred site for example I'm looking
for a specific YouTube video I just
click on a YouTube logo and it'll search
YouTube's database directly from the new
tab page Universal Search tab is an
awesome extension if you're constantly
opening new tabs and want to quickly
find the things you want to see and so
the last one on our list is sticky notes
just popped up if you want to be able to
quickly jot down notes when you're
browsing Chrome sticky notes is a
helpful extension that will allow you to
do that sure there are third-party apps
you can launch directly from your PC or
Mac but this is built right in Google
Chrome there's not a whole lots of this
extension other than the ability to
quickly write down your thoughts however
you can customize the interface just a
bit anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
