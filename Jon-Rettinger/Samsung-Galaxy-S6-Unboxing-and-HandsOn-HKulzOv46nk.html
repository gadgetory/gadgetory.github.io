from TechnoBuffalo here at that unboxing
I'm really looking forward to this is
the latest flagship from Samsung
it is the Samsung Galaxy s6 we've got
the t-mobile variant here and 32
gigabytes it also comes in 64 or 128
this is a completely redesigned phone
for Samsung you can see that stretching
all the way to the Box gone
his last gens relatively large wood
finish we now have a more modern smaller
box with a new Galaxy fonts go ahead and
slide this off
well Samsung branding right there we do
have a t-mobile unit but we'll be coming
to all major US carriers and probably
every carrier that you can think of or
that you might be on we are greeted with
the Samsung Galaxy s6 sitting right on
top first I've actually seen this phone
since it was announced before Congress
so I'm really excited to pick it up and
first impressions this feels really nice
let's forget that cold aluminum feel
from that all aluminum band around the
pressure top suicide for real quick ii
see what else you're going to have in
the box we're going to have booklets
lots and lots and lots of booklets in
case you want to get started terms of
conditions and some little features
about the device we've got a micro USB
charging port we don't have any USB 3.0
adapter here just standard USB a sim
removal tool we do have headphones you
go with a built-in inline mic in them
and some different size your gels if you
get big or small ears you've got a wall
work this does help with a quick charge
push all that stuff off the side that's
not why you're here
let's take a look at the galaxy s6 from
the front especially in the white color
it looks like every other Samsung until
you start to look at it from the back
and you realize you've probably seen
that before
but this is a first for Samsung so on
the bottom you've got a 3.5 milimeter
headset jack your charging port
microphone and now it's a speaker on the
bottom is supposed to a rephrasing
speaker on the left hand side we've got
volume up and down on the right that's
where your power button is going to live
and also where your SIM tray is going to
live go ahead and power this sucker I'm
going to continue my tour
the front and back are code with Gorilla
Glass 4 so you can throw this thing down
and supposedly it will be very safe
Samsung branding we don't have any
t-mobile brand new here but you have
that Galaxy s6 and that new font and
blazoned on the back a bit of a sheen to
it too in the white you can almost looks
like there's a pattern moving in it
alright so we got the phone I'll put it
up let me run through the specs you are
looking at a very familiar screen size
of 5.1 inches it's a quad HD Super
AMOLED panel this time around it which
means it's got a 2560 by 1440 resolution
and you can do math quickly that means
it's got a 577 PPI on the back living
under this very pronounced camera hump
with a 16 megapixel sensor which has a
point seven second activation if you
double tap the home button it'll launch
the camera relatively quickly as you
just saw right there it's got auto time
real HDR as well built-in front-facing
camera lives right there two five
megapixel sensor that's 120 degree wide
angle lens this thing is a beast on the
power front the first time that
Samsung's Exynos processor made it to us
phones at the XE no seven series
actually has two processors in it to
make it octa-core it's got a quad 2.1
and quad a 1.5 gigahertz so it's gonna
be plenty fast and also 64-bit as I
mentioned storage site is gonna be 32 64
128 but well you're not going to find on
here is your micro SD card slot sampling
has done away with that so make sure you
get internal storage size is going to
work for you power in this guy is a 2500
15 milliamp hour battery that can be
charged wirelessly really using any of
the wireless charging stand is available
right now all built in no need for an
extra case or back extremely thin device
at six point eight millimeters and as I
mentioned Gorilla Glass 4 on front and
back I've been a bit tough on samsung
devices in the past for packing a lot of
bloatware this guy is forty percent less
on the blower you can see that as you
move around and also you can delete any
of these samsung apps that you choose to
which is new for for samsung certainly
very nice and so we haven't seen
recently and if you want to add an
additional apps go ahead and download
them from the App Store familiar Samsung
buttons here you've got a home button to
talk more about in a second flanked by a
multitasking button and a back button
this home button is also a fingerprint
scanner but you don't have to serve to
do a swipe over you can just hold your
finger over it to unlock also coming
soon as support for Samsung pay which
will use either NFC or take advantage of
current magnetic strip readers to make
this work pretty much everywhere and
that will be launching relatively soon
other than that it looks like typical
TouchWiz built in here albeit much much
much lighter and now much more
customizable there's not much that's
carried over design-wise from previous
Samsung devices but one thing we do have
is that flash module which also can
double as a heartrate monitor so if you
want to see how anxious or nervous you
are you can go ahead and do that it's
hard to communicate what this phone
feels like in video but I will say this
feels unlike anything Samsung has ever
done that includes the note 4 the note 4
edge and really anything else up to this
point this feels premium it looks
premium and it's got a very nice weight
to it and for the sake of old versus new
let me bring in the galaxy s5 which
looks now like six generations old
compared to what we have here at the s6
but you can see these two at least from
the front don't look at that different
same 5.1 inch screen but the back and
the sides really where that story looks
extremely different flip those guys over
a different to your side from aesthetics
you've got support for micro SD card
slot and removable battery no removable
battery here at all on the galaxy s6
this was I believe IP 67 so you could
pick it in the water theoretically you
can splash resistant this does not have
any sort of waterproofing to it so bear
that in mind some other noticeable
things to know about the new version of
TouchWiz does have a theming engine and
supported right out of the box which is
a nice addition as well you can see that
right there and go ahead and download
different themes if you don't like the
way touch TouchWiz looks out of the box
go ahead and customize that without
having to install a third-party launcher
you're looking to get a new phone in
your future's might be one that you want
to check out of course will the ton more
