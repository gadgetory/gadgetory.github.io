to you by Full Sail University what's
going on guys a märklin sanger from
TechnoBuffalo and today we're gonna be
checking out pushbullet
it's an app an extension you can
download on your PC your Mac your iOS
device Android Windows Phone Safari in
Google Chrome now it essentially pushes
notifications from one device to the
other making it super easy to stay in
touch so let's go ahead and see what
it's all about
push ball it's not a new app whatsoever
but I've actually been meaning to see
what it's all about for a long time so I
finally decided to give it a try Apple
users have been able to enjoy features
like continuity between iOS and OS 10
making it really easy to take calls send
texts and exchange links between devices
but it hasn't really been easy for
Android users so that's why pushbullet
is such an important platform now in
this video I'm gonna focus more on how
the app works and operates on a Mac with
my Nexus 5 but it does work similarly on
other operating systems like Windows
Windows Phone and iOS now taking a
closer look at pushbullet for the Mac
there's really not much to look at on
here other than the notifications you'll
receive I don't have any notifications
at the moment so it looks pretty boring
but from here you can write a note copy
and paste a link from a site attach a
picture and send it off to any of your
devices and you'll get a notification on
whichever device you send it off to you
can even connect to a friend's device if
you'd like and send them a picture I
found this to be super helpful if I want
to grab a picture that's on my Mac and
send it off to my Nexus 5 that way I
won't need to send an email to myself
and wait for that email to be fetched
now you can do the same vice versa if
you have an image on your Nexus 5 for
example and you want to save it on your
Mac without plugging in your device or
emailing a photo you can push an image
over to your Mac as long as the files
are less than 25 megabytes now one of
the coolest features in iOS 8 and OS 10
Yosemite is continuity and the ability
to reply to text messages without the
need to pick up your iPhone now
pushbullet for Mac and Android you'll be
able to do the same but to a certain
extent you can reply to messages just
like on iOS but I noticed that you can't
reply to group messages which is a bit
of a letdown nonetheless ability to
reply back to someone using your
computer is a really neat feature and it
makes my life so much easier if my
phone's out of reach now aside from
sharing files between devices and
ability to detects from your computer
you'll be
able to check out notifications from any
app that's installed on your device
whether you get a Facebook message an
Instagram follow or a notification about
a game it'll send those notifications
over to your computer and let you know
which device it's coming from if you
don't want all of your apps constantly
pinging your computer you'll be able to
choose which apps can use pushbullet
service allowing you to tailor the
experience let me stop the video for
just a quick second and thank our
friends over at Full Sail University now

pushbullet also has channels which are
notification feeds that you can
subscribe to you can choose from a
variety of categories like tech gaming
business sports and more for example
you're subscribed to a channel and that
channel pushes out a new update you'll
see a notification on your computer with
a link to an article which you can then
view right away pushbullet is a really
awesome app and service especially if
you're looking to connect your device I
found it to be super convenient between
Android and Mac and ability to reply to
text messages and see all of my
notifications on my Mac is just really
helpful and makes my life so much easier
the best part about this app and service
is that it's free you can download the
app from the App Store Google Play Store
or you can even check out pushbullet
site for different download links for
different operating systems and web
browser extensions anyways that's it for
