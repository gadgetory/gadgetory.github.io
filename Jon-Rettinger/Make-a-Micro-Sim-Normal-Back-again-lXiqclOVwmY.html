from TechnoBuffalo here let's say you've
got your eye on a new iPhone 4 or an
ipad 3g but you're on t-mobile or
another GSM carrier what are you gonna
do the iPad and the iPhone use Micro SIM
cards and you want to use your existing
SIM how is that going to work well I'm
going to show you how
so the folks in Negri electronics have
once again come through big-time hooked
us up with something called the new ce
micro sim cutter and adapter so we're
going to put this sucker to use
something to show you how you can use
any sim card you want in an unlocked
iPhone 4 or any iPad a lot of people
don't know that the ipad 3g actually
shifts completely unlocked then you can
use it on any GSM carrier you want with
any SIM card you just need a SIM card to
work so let me show you what this means
so I've got an iPhone 4 here in front of
me I'm going to go ahead and use the sim
removal tool and pop out my micro SIM
card to show you the difference and
anything will work to pop in that hole
right there a paper clip or something to
go ahead and pop that out and here we
have a micro SIM card it is a very very
small SIM card
by comparison here is a normal sized
AT&amp;amp;T SIM card you can see the difference
it's quite big but if you'll notice the
contact point so the parts that are sort
of look gold are exactly the same on
each device so why did Apple decide to
go ahead and make these micro Sims
perhaps it's make it more difficult to
switch phones we're going to go ahead
and fix that for you let's say you just
bought an unlocked or iPhone 4 on eBay
or Craigslist and you want to use your
existing SIM card not having to go to
AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile wherever you might be
this is what you're going to need to do
so go ahead and push all this off the
side for a minute so go ahead and open
up the micro sim cutter here and I'll
put a link down below to the folks at
Negri in case you want to check this out
or pick one up for yourself so it looks
like a big hole punch they'll push that
in and we've got two SIM card adaptors
but you're going to need as well so I'll
show you how that works in just a moment
so push the packaging off so you need to
be careful so what sort of SIM card
you're going to use some kid SIM cards
are very easy to be cut so here's the
AT&amp;amp;T one let's take a look at a current
t-mobile SIM card and you'll notice that
they look different on the back the
contact points here are much larger than
they are on the 18 t version so you're
going to need to either find an older
SIM card that's smaller t-mobile seems
to have made their contact points a bit
larger so
have to hunt to find a SIM card even if
it's not activated you can call your
carrier and have them activate that sim
for you so assuming you found one that
works I'm going to go and show you how
to cut it pretty simple we're going to
go and take this handy sim cutter and it
looks relatively straightforward so
we're going to take this 18 T SIM card
right here and look at the bottom you
can sort of see how things are supposed
to go going to take this and slide it
right in and then you have pretty much
just punch and it pops out and I now
have a brand new Micro SIM card sort of
left the remnants in there this part
pushed right through it comes through a
quite a bit of aggression if you pull
that out there's the hole and you could
almost use this as an adapter sort of
try and fit it back in maybe a piece of
tape on the front but assuming you don't
want to do that or the tapes not going
to work here's what else is including
this package these are micro SIM card
adapters so all you do is you take your
new micro SIM or your existing micro SIM
from your iPhone 4 or iPad pop it right
in and go ahead and throw it into any
unlock device you want or any lock
device if it's secure that that supports
so I've got a nexus one right here if
you just pull off the battery you can
now pop the SIM card in to any phone
just as you would a normal sized SIM it
actually works really well which is kind
of cool so you sort of get around these
sort of micro sim limitations and that
would just pop right in you got to make
sure the SIM cards in there nice and
tight because it can as you just saw pop
out it's really got to sort of hold it
in as you're pushing it into the phone
so here is the just made micro sim that
we just created and here is the one that
came with my iPhone you can see that
they look almost identical a bit of a
difference there but the contact points
are just about the same so what if you
use a SIM card that's not going to be
supported so let's say here's that
t-mobile SIM when you're talking about
with the bit contact points what's going
to happen well just for the sake of it
I'm going to show you us we're going to
go ahead and punch this guy as well and
I want to show you so you can avoid this
problem time to go ahead and push it
right in
all right so there it is you can sort of
see that it's going to punch out some
areas so we'll go ahead may want to plug
your ears it gets a bit loud and we're
going to go ahead and punch and now we
are left with a micro-sim now you can
see that actually cut off a bit of the
side now in some instances it may still
work but more often not you're going to
be stuck with a non functioning SIM card
that's not going to work for you you
just need to be careful sometimes you're
going to work sometimes it might not but
you'll now be able to take your just cut
sim card and pop it into any unlocked
iPhone or any ipad 3g and use your data
plan with it so it's sort of a way to
get around those regulations are really
handy and sort of gives you the freedom
that you used to have with swapping SIM
cards as a tech reviewer like myself I
sort of have to have the ability to swap
SIM cards and now I have that once again
with these micro sim adapters very cool
and really easy to to use so anyway guys
