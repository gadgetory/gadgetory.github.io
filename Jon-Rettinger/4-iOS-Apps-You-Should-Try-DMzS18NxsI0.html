from TechnoBuffalo and I'm back with
more apps for you guys for apps this
time that I've been using that are
interesting new different and unique
let's go and get started so first we
have offer up and it's a very simple app
that fulfills a service that most of you
including myself could probably use and
you can just basically sell and buy
stuff used items new items whatever it
may be I'm a hoarder and I've been
cleaning out my house recently so this
app is my best friend for the next month
or so in short it's basically an app
version of Craigslist however they're
happy to brag that it's very safe and
that every seller and buyer is verified
and is a trusted source next we have
Google spaces which is essentially a way
for you to connect with friends and
family or just people you work with
whatever it may be essentially by
creating a space you create a subject
based sort of chat room and chat box
that integrates features from Google
such as Google search YouTube
integration all sorts of things it's a
quick efficient way to chat and talk
about certain topics and segment
conversations based on context next we
have a very interesting app it's called
stock X and emerges the worlds of Wall
Street and sneaker culture as a semi
sneakerhead I find this after really
interesting you get real-time values of
all sorts of rare authentic shoes you
can bid on shoes you can sell shoes all
sorts of things and while I haven't
bought a pair through them yet stock
except they verify each pair by hand so
that there's no fakes or no lying or
cheating or stealing going on I would
also recommend this app to someone who's
looking to get into sneaker culture but
feels a little bit insecure about
whether they're overpaying for a certain
shoe or they don't really know the
necessary information stock experts all
of that information up front so it might
be a little intimidating but if you're
gonna get into it this is a great way to
gain that knowledge off the top and last
but not least we have probably one of my
favorite apps that is gonna be for a
very niche audience it's called ink
hunter try tattoo designs in real life
and that's basically what it is so you
pick a tattoo and then by using the
camera it'll augment your arm and show
you an image of how a tattoo would look
on your arm or any body part for that
matter you can also actually enter your
own sketches so if you're an artist and
want to see for example how a tattoo
might look on a real person tattoos
just a little bit permanent so I think
this is very useful a pin to someone who
has tattoos and wants more I am
definitely going to be using this and so
that's it for this video guys let me
know what you think in the comments down
below do you like these apps are you
guys a fan are you gonna download them
