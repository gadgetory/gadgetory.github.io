technobuffalo here this is a fantastic
time of the year to be in the market for
a new smartphone because there are so
many great options available probably
two of the hottest that are out right
now are the palm pre plus for verizon
wireless and the Old Faithful the iphone
3gs for AT&amp;amp;T so we're going to put these
two Bohemia's head-to-head in a series
of tests in the issue of time we can't
cover every category but we are going to
cover at least in this round browser and
speed text entry customization scrolling
navigation apps device integration and
notifications also go over some of the
general specs of the devices as well so
from a price standpoint the iphone 3gs
or run you anywhere from 1 99 299 and
all these prices of course with a new
two-year contract the palm pre is going
to run you 100 to forty-nine dollars for
storage standpoint the iphone 3gs can
have either 16 or 32 gigabyte sizes and
the palm pre plus has only 16 games a
wait for the iphone were looking at 4.7
6 ounces compared to 4.89 on the pre and
from a displaced in point the iphones
got a 3.5 inch that's diagonal this
flight with a 320 x 480 resolution the
palm pre is a 3.1 inch display with a
320 x 480 resolution to the same
resolution bit smaller display so it
also sort of the boring tech stuff let's
get into the important things of really
one of the things that I look at most in
a smartphone is browsing I do a lot of
work on a mobile browser and it's
paramount for me that my device can keep
up and in terms of modern browsing
experience so both these are multi touch
enabled we're going to do speed tests
and sort of show you how the browsers
work we're going to test this feet first
on Wi-Fi and then on 3g of course on
verizon wireless is EV geo and 18 keys
3g networks so Wi-Fi is connected to
both let's go ahead and get started
we're going to load up technobuffalo
calm
get them cued up and ready to go okay
they're hitting almost exactly the same
time you can track the progress on the
iPhone by the blue bar across the top or
by the sort of filling blue circle on
the right-hand corner of the pre the
iphone is the first device to show
content the palm pre plus the close
behind looks like both are almost done
the pre just finished and the iphone is
still running was like it should be done
in just a minute so the pre was a bit
faster on the same Wi-Fi network let's
take a look at browsing experience
sometimes on lower processor power
devices when you scroll very quickly you
get sort of a checkerboard pattern below
let's see if it happens on either of
these devices so the processor on the
iphone 3gs can keep up you don't see
that checkerboard pattern and it goes
fast as I scroll and has a very nice
physics engine meeting as I scroll
slowly it's go slowly or if I go fast
and I'll go as fast as my finger take a
look pretty so you did see a little bit
of a checkerboard pattern get to look
very quickly goes away but it is there
it's definitely something to keep in
mind so let's go ahead and check out
multi-touch since both of these are
multi touch enabled devices will start
with the iphone so the two finger pinch
and zoom is sort of the Old Faithful
very smooth and I can pan around
anywhere I want I can double tap and
zoom out let's try this on the palm pre
plus relatively smooth as well you do
see the scroll and when you go back and
forth that checkerboard pattern it
doesn't last for very long but it is
there and see eventually see it when i
zoom in first on a new area of text zoom
in and zoom out so it's smooth and it's
a pretty good implementation link the
iphone defa guys a little bit smoother
but the palm pre does a fantastic job
with multi-touch implementation and you
can do the same double tap to zoom in
and double tap to zoom out well again
you do see that checkerboard pattern
there just a little bit the palm pre is
probably the second best browser that
I've seen on mobile device second behind
the iphone i do want to preface this by
saying i am an iphone
user but i am very objective I've been a
big fan of webos and the palm pre in
general but are comparing browser to
browser the pre is pretty well featured
but the iphone seems to have just a bit
of an edge let's go ahead and try speed
we're going to load up on my youtube
channel youtube.com slash John for
lakers and we're going to turn off Wi-Fi
and rely just on the 3g networks of both
devices okay so why if I has been turned
off we've got anywhere from say two to
three bars of a video signal with the
palm pre and we've got about now we've
got four or five bars of signal it just
jumped up and we've got five bars of 3g
signal on the iphone 3gs so it should be
a pretty fair comparison five bars 25
bars certainly this speeds going depends
on where you are I'm in Southern
California so it's you're the only
representative of my area but least you
can get a sense of how the 3g networks
stand up on both devices so we'll load
up my youtube page open up bookmarks
let's see what that looks like here and
we'll do the same thing i'll go to
youtube I hit them both the same time
and let's check out the speed and again
this is not Wi-Fi this is a 3g 2 3g
network so the pre was the first one to
show content where it was opposite on
we're testing it over Wi-Fi and again
you can see the progress down there and
right over there so now the iphone is
trying to contact the pre's got nothing
is showing pre looked just about done
and the iphone is still processing up
the iphone finished and the pre is still
going through my neck and neck race here
and i do have five bars of 3g service on
each 12 this testing was underway the
pre is still loading now you can use a
browser while it's still loading but
it's not completely done yet will let it
finish you can get a sense of how long
it's going to take and in real world
testing i have noticed that EMTs network
as far as data has been relatively
faster than four
aizen's for daily web usage and the pre
is done they can do the same service
scrolling test and see if we get that
pattern again maybe was just an anomaly
on TechnoBuffalo so very quickly it
shows up there but not much zoom in
pinch and zoom and of course both will
rotate as you move around that will
check out the iphone so the palm pre has
a very nice browsing experience I've
really enjoyed using it I'm certainly
the iphone is my preferred for browsing
but if you were sort of worried about
the prius browsing experience definitely
don't worry at all it's a probably
second to only one as far as I'm
concerned I think the palm has really
done a fantastic job so one of the big
differentiators about these two devices
is text entry the pre has a very nice
design sort of looks like a pond rock
the text entry is done via slide-out
QWERTY keyboard the iphone is without
keyboard and relies on text entry by an
on-screen keyboard the pre plus at least
as of this filming does not have any
sort of native on-screen keyboard
options so the only way to get in text
is through this and the iphone certainly
doesn't have any sort of attachment for
an external keyboard so you're limited
to just be on screen let's go ahead and
give this a shot and saying again i want
to say that i am an iphone users so I'm
probably more used to the iphone
keyboard but i have been using the palm
pre plus is my dedicated device for the
past two weeks so I have become
relatively familiar with how it works
let's go ahead and open up the notes
application you get a chance to see what
that looks like on here as well there's
so many different things that we can
test and show and unfortunately the
really going to time considerations
we're sort of limited will do other
rounds to show how all they stack up so
got a new memo here and the keys are
raised and gone from the initial palm
pre keyboard that launched on sprint
orange button is no longer there it's
now sort of grey the keys have a little
bit more quickie field to them in the
sliding mechanism feels
a bit better so I'm going to go ahead
and type this is a test and we'll see
how it works and also as i type notice
that there won't be any auto correction
which is an issue that will discuss in
just a minute let's go ahead and start
typing
so this is a test so it was close it did
it did autocorrect a bit but it's not
entirely accurate let me try that one
more time I'll type on the palm pre so
on the palm pro it's not the most
accurate but I have found that with
practice I'm getting better the keys are
small you can see we're sort of one of
my finger goes over it I don't have the
fattest fingers in the world but I do
cover almost four keys with one finger
link the keyboard lot of people that
rely on a physical QWERTY keyboard may
be disappointed with the speeded they
can type on the palm pre looking at the
device like a blackberry the keyboard is
really well laid out it serves crunched
and small on the palm pre plus I have
not been a fan of the physical keyboard
here on the pre oftentimes it is nice to
have an actual keyboard for buttons and
gaming as such so we'll talk about a
little later on the video but it can
tend to get a little fat thumb and the
auto correction is I don't think that
good let's take a look at the notes
application here for the iphone going to
open up a new note and we'll try typing
in both ways in landscape and keyboard
and we'll type this is a test again so
not accurate this is a teat that's how
it autocorrected let's try it in
landscape
the incorrect answer either kind of goes
fast as I can so the moral here is that
probably I'm not a very accurate I / on
anything I prefer the experience on the
iPhone actually to the palm pre but I do
appreciate having a physical keyboard I
think the autocorrect on the iphone is
probably as good as out there android is
a very close second or even better some
people may argue that auto correction
again is not really so there on the palm
pre so text entries is probably going to
come down to personal preference I
recommend that you go to a verizon store
and you try out the keyboard on the palm
pre plus your experience may be very
different than mine you may have smaller
fingers and think that it works
perfectly for you definitely something
to keep in mind so the next thing we're
going to talk about is customization and
what you can do to make sort of the
device yours so the palm pre could
minimize all this stuff here has a
limited customization options you can
change the background you can change
these icons that are here in the dock
and you can change the order of
applications in your launcher but that's
about it you can you can pick ringtones
but you don't have any customizations
over a text tones or anything like that
you're relatively limited to what you
can do and customize on the pomp reading
and speaking of limited customization
customization options let's talk about
the iphone it is perhaps as much if not
more limited than the palm pre plus now
it's been one of the big knocks on the
iPhone from day one so you really can't
do much with it to make it yours
certainly without jailbreaking you're
stuck with the black background you can
reorganize any icons that you want from
the dock or on the icon screens and
that's really the extent of it you could
pick your ringtone but as far as further
customization goes you're quite limited
one other thing that I saw would be
remiss to not mention is that the palm
pre plus does have the option for a
mobile hotspot additional forty dollars
per month that i did a video showing
what this is essentially it lets you
turn this device into a mifi meeting
it's going to suck in verizon's evdo
signal and kick out Wi-Fi that you and
four
can hook up to and as of now in the US
the iphone 18t offer no sort of
tethering or mobile hotspot options so
if that's important to you if your
mobile traveler and your need something
that you can hook up out the internet
the iphone is not going to be for you if
you want to use one device for
everything definitely something to keep
in mind the palm pre plus it's going to
be where you're going to want to look so
where the iphone really shined in the
capital in general is the App Store
certainly you've all seen now
demonstrating countless videos it is
just a well-designed oiled machine with
hundreds of credit of thousands of apps
nothing with up to 130 140 apps I mean
they're just an app for just about
everything and it really is true
categories feature you can view the most
popular out there there are a ton of
apps inserting these from the
commercials really you can find an
application I'll do just about
everything now the palm pre also has an
app catalog and just launched and just
sort of redone at CES 2010 to give
developers a little more access to the
code it's really not as robust as
Apple's offering but there are still
some good applications and there it's
growing certainly not nearly as fast a
fraction of the size of the iphone i
found a lot of the applications in there
actually religious applications I'm
sitting go ahead and pick popular for
example you can see it gets rid of a
moving icon across the top and from a
horsepower standpoint both of these
pretty much have the same processor and
just about same amount of RAM so they're
capable of relatively similar graphs
capabilities we can view all these some
of them are free something costs but
when i first tested the palm pre when it
launched on sprint they were limited to
i believe 12 applications there now are
many many more clearly the edge goes to
the iphone but if that patients are
important to you don't look away from
the palm pre because it's growing every
day the fact that's now on two carriers
and four devices it's only going to be
getting better and palm is doing an
excellent job about incentivizing
developers to create new app so i think
the really app store here is going to be
growing up by leaps and bounds so i
found a lot of apps i'd like to use a
lot of fun ones you don't have a lot of
sort of the fluffy them apps you may
find
app store in the iphone if you want to
look for a twitter application on the
iphone you might have 10 or 20 or 30
options you know on the palm pre you
might only have three four or five that
really stays true through all categories
something to keep in mind so the next
thing we're talking about apps I want to
talk about multitasking that's really
one of the big big things that the palm
pre plus does well the iphone really
doesn't have any multitasking to speak
of you can be on a phone call and access
your applications up that's about it the
palm pre plus has true multitasking and
probably is the best implementation
multitasking that I have ever seen so
right now I've got the app catalog open
let's go back to sail on open a browser
and open that up I'm using what's called
a deck of cards feature and I'm
accessing that by hitting this home
button which is really a backlit LED
that I can gesture with and I can open
up Twitter application you can see that
I can open up really just a myriad of
applications here and scroll through
them as quickly or slowly as i like it
to close them it's kind of fun you just
swipe it up now one of the knocks on the
palm pre has been the speed in which it
loads applications let me give you an
example so let's do a speed test and
I'll close everything of opening up the
calendar app and serve as a double-edged
sword here and I'll show you why where
is calendar
calendar there it is to open up calendar
on each the same time you can check out
the speed so clearly the iphone launched
that much faster but now let's say i
want to launch my notes program again
well i got it exit out and I got to go
to notes and I wait for notes to launch
now on the pre if I want to open notes
go the notes up asian or memos that it's
called here and it takes longer on the
pre definite takes lauren open
applications now here's the thing let's
say i want to go back and open up
calendar on the iphone i got close it I
open up calendar on the palm pre plus
it's already been opened I can go ahead
and do that and opens up almost
instantaneously so the first time you
open it the iphone is going to be
quicker however once you have it open
and leave it opened its really very very
fast today I got some notifications
popping up there really quick
multitasking is very impressive
definitely something to keep in mind you
can open up really almost 50 cards here
and the device will slow down a little
bit but really will keep working so next
thing I want to talk about is
notifications and it's one of the things
that the palm pre does really well you
can see right down there I've got well a
notification if I have an email on the
iphone I get a Hello icon vector that
shows up little red bubble how many
emails I have my facebook messages or
things I have to do palm pre has this
notification dairy across the bottom see
right there I've got an envelope if I
tap it that an email here from from a
friend and I can go ahead and click it
and go right to the email or if I want
to go up in a my gmail in general I can
tap it and I'll open it up if I wanna
get rid of it I can just swipe it away
so notifications why is the palm pre
plus definitely handles and webos in
general he knows notifications very well
so the moral is which one do i recommend
well I like them both and I can't pick
one it's going to come down to again
personal preference i think the webos
the palm pre plus does a lot of things
really well multi
tasking probably being its crown jewel
the iphone is only the crown jewels are
probably the browsing experience that
you're going to get and the massive app
store so if you get reception on both
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon I can't tell you which
to pick recommend going and trying both
I'd be equally happy using these as my
daily driver those do that follow my
videos you know that I am very very
demanding on my phones I don't say that
I could pick one very often but these
two are things that I could be very
happy using and it's really going to
come down to which one you decide so
stay tuned to the channel and
technobuffalo com for further rounds of
versus videos we've got the palm pre vs
nexus one coming up and some more
head-to-head so definitely stick around
for all that at technobuffalo com for
