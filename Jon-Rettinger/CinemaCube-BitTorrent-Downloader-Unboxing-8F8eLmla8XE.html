TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing that
I'm really excited about it's the cinema
cube by a bright view it's an HD media
player and bit torrent downloader think
of it sort of like the Apple TV without
the format restrictions let's go ahead
and get to the unboxing it as i unbox it
and show you the product i'll talk to
you a little bit more about what it does
so use the obligatory unboxing back here
and we will cut through the tape so you
quit it thick amount of paved over here
enough to dig it pull it apart cut some
tape over there hey package is sing very
tightly alright and we are in okay so
some PR stuff here is the right view
internet multi-format media player so
let me tell you a little bit about what
it does it's a multi-format audio/video
media player with resolution up to 720p
it supports RM RM v 8 MP to a VI h.264
and are really a ton of other audio
formats and video formats and it can
play media from a plugged in USB storage
or from computers on the same network
also with a built-in BitTorrent p2p
file-sharing engine you can share or
download files on the internet legal
file is obviously legal video content
and you can play it right on here so you
take a external hard drive with a movie
on it plug it in and just play it so
really no restrictions which are pretty
cool you can see some of the stuff that
it's got on earth there throw the Box
aside let's take a look at what else we
have so internet multi-format media
player land USB all kinds of other stuff
that it's got on it the backs got a
picture of the device but we will show
you the device itself looks like it's
got a ton of ports and audio
Oh options which is pretty cool so it's
got a lot of interfaces pretty neat so
let's go ahead and open her up cut the
tape and if you're interested in one of
these it'll run you 89 bucks and I'll
put a link up in the sidebar to a bride
views webpage in case you are interested
so let's take the top off huh and let's
see what we got we've got some setup
instructions home theater connections
and a user manual we've got the actual
unit itself which let's go usually I put
the big unit off to the side but we'll
go ahead and dig right in now it's very
light actually it doesn't feel like much
but it's a pretty decent size so let's
see what we've got on the front of the
device it's like there's a little door
there with the two USB ports that plugs
back in power button just some vents on
the side on the back is really where the
action happens you've got an SPDIF HDMI
outs you've got your audio video s-video
land and you have was that dcn I assume
for power and they got the bright view
logo on the top so really you can I
guess any video file that you've got on
a bit torrent site you can download
right on this without really needing a
computer so here is just the power
supply not too big just a pretty
standard power supply let's see what
kind of cabling they give us in the box
let me give you a pretty nice suite of
cables so your standard they give you a
ethernet cable and it looks like just a
stand so let's say bring your own hdmi
cable here but not too bad so I do want
to clarify did a little bit more
research this is actually not have built
in Wi-Fi need to connect much like the
xbox 360 with the built-in ethernet port
right there but this is a really neat
product i'm excited to use it and review
it and just see how it works and see if
it works as advertised so if it does
it's very promising and it's a really
nice alternative to some of the more
standard common media streaming devices
out there like the Apple TV so guys hope
