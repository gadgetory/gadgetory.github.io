up on my phone they make it a lot easier
for me to use a lot funner for me to use
a lot safer for me to use and I know
that you guys love videos like that so I
thought I would share with you of five
of my favorite things about Android some
of these are specific to marshmallow
some of them are not but important stuff
that you need to know about your phone
and things that you can do today just to
make your life a little bit easier and
better so first off do yourself a huge
huge favor put your personal information
on the lockscreen in case your phone
gets lost its underneath the security
settings you just put a phone number
someone else's went your spouse's phone
number and the email address that you
know that you can access from any of the
computer just do yourself that little
favor get that peace of mind in case you
lose your phone if it winds up in the
hands of a Good Samaritan they can get
in touch with you ASAP while you're in
the security settings though you can
also take a look at smart lock and if
you haven't used smart lock goodness
gracious what have you even been doing
smart lock is crazy easy to use okay
don't worry all it does is it pays
attention to what devices are connected
to your to your phone whether it's a
Bluetooth SmartWatch or Bluetooth
headphones whatever it is that pays
attention to bluetooth it also pays
attention to your actual GPS location so
if you're near home you're near work
smart lock will make sure that your
phone stays unlocked and easy to access
mode the best thing about it is that as
of Marshmallow it actually works even
better than it used to now you can
actually use your fingerprint reader
that works on the back even when smart
lock has your actual lock turned off
it's really really easy and super
convenient you'd be silly not to turn it
on all right let's talk convenience for
a second here let's say you're at home
you're on the couch you're under a bunch
of blankets it's pretty chilly you don't
want to get up you're watching a movie
and you've got your hot cocoa right on
your belly well thank goodness for
Google now because believe it or not it
works really really well with your voice
actions with a number of different apps
and services and devices cheaply I want
to tell you about nest if you just say
ok Google set the temperature to 75 nest
will do that for you so long as you're
logged in and your nest is connected to
the Internet it's really really cool and
insanely convenient second the last
thing before I let you guys go the
system UI tuner is
really easy to turn on and it gets you
quite a bit of new customization options
it's also fairly new to Android if you
open up your quick settings pane which
is right inside of your notifications
pane that gear that you would normally
push to take you into the settings just
hold your finger on it it'll start
spinning and then once it starts
spinning wait about 10 seconds and then
let go with your finger and it should
dump you right into the settings and let
you know that the UI tuner has been
turned on that's gonna let you do a
couple of things first and most
importantly you're gonna be able to see
your battery percentage up in the status
bar at all times but you can also change
what you can see in the status bar and
change what you can see in your quick
settings it's pretty helpful lastly but
not leastly I only just realized how
good Android actually is at handling
Bluetooth controllers go grab yourself a
really sweet emulator for whatever
platform it is that you miss the most or
even just your favorite first-person
shooter or whatever game it is that you
play and then just grab whatever old
Bluetooth controller you can find online
you can find some really dope deals on
them I just bought one for $30 that
supports all kinds of retro stuff and
even has an analog stick pair Bluetooth
controllers aside that's a few of my
favorite things that you can do in
android here these days go ahead and
leave a subscribe or push a like or do a
thing to watch a video I'm gonna fall
over on this bike anyway thank you guys
so much for watching and I'm gonna crash
now
