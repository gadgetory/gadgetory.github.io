Francisco to get my hands on this the
all-new LG v 40 thank you and as that
mouthful of a name suggests this phone
is kind of a combination of the V 30 and
the g7 thin cube and LG has gone all out
on their latest and greatest flagship
phone it's got five cameras and OLED
display while still retaining fan
favorites like the headphone jack and
expandable storage but is all this
enough to finally get more people to pay
attention and break away from that LG
smartphone Sigma
I'm Robert Rosenthal from TechnoBuffalo
and this is our review of the brand-new
LG v40 thin queue Before we jump into
this review if you guys want to see how
the v40 thin queue stacks up against
other flagships like the no 9 the iphone
tennis max or the upcoming pixel three
in three XL be sure to click that button
and subscribe to the channel and also
hit that Bell so you're notified about
upcoming videos and give this video a
thumbs up we appreciate it and it lets
us know you guys want to see more like
this LG phones have been kind of stuck
in this weird place for the past few
years they're always bring a lot of
features versatility and even come with
ports you don't see on all of their
flagship phones these days but there's
always been one or two caveats holding
it back from really being taken
seriously from smartphone shoppers and
LG's trying to change that yet again
with the LG v 40 think you are let's
just call it the v40 to keep things
simple LG stress that this phone is
lighter than comparable e size flat
chips like the iPhone 10s Max and the no
9 and I will say that picking up the 10s
max after using the v40 is a bit jarring
this phone is incredibly light and
coupled with excellent build quality
with the glass and aluminum body it
feels incredibly premium and super
lightweight and comfortable to hold as
well on the front of that lightweight
body is a downright gorgeous six point
four inch OLED panel and LG supply's
OLED panels for some of your favorite
flagships out there right now so it was
a very welcome addition to see them
finally put it on their own flagship
phone
nearly bezel as display has a bit of a
chin and a notch
but both things do not take away at all
from this screen it gets bright colors
look vibrant text is sharp and consuming
content on it is very enjoyable the v40
also retains that second screen
functionality similar to what we saw in
the g7 meaning you can hide that notch
through software or even make the area
stand out with different colors or
different effects but I mainly just left
it off I was pretty unbothered by the
notch during my time with the phone
speaking of the g7 the v40 brings two of
its fan favorite features on the new
phone it's got the dedicated google
assistant button and that single boombox
speaker this phone not only has a
headphone jack
but it's got a 32 bit - quad DAC
built-in as well so you can plug in your
headphones whatever headphones you want
and enjoy one of the highest quality
audio experiences you can get on a smart
phone today
besides the display the big story with
this phone is the cameras this one is
one of the few on the market right now
to sport five cameras three on the back
and two on the front the two front
facing cameras are certainly nice to
have but they're not necessarily
game-changing inside that notch is an 8
megapixel standard lens and a wide-angle
5 megapixel lens that only gives you
that option to shoot GoPro esque wide
angle selfies but LG says that those two
sensors allow for improved portrait mode
which looks a little bit softer a little
bit too harsh depending on the condition
for my taste those standard selfies are
gonna look just fine those 2 lenses also
provide for a fairly fast but less
secure face unlock feature which I
actually thought worked quite well and
was much more convenient than that rear
mounted fingerprint reader but the real
star of the show here is that camera
setup on the back the v40 packs 3 rear
shooters you've got a 12 megapixel
standard lens a 12 megapixel telephoto
lens and a 16 megapixel wide-angle lens
with a 107 degree field of view that LG
has really become known for on their
smartphones these three lenses offer a
lot of versatility and in full auto mode
this phone can take surprisingly really
good shots and the fun and creativity I
had shooting these photos made that
boring old smartphone photography seem a
little bit more fun I am NOT a huge fan
of LG's processing some of these photos
looked a little bit over sharpened and a
little over processed also low light
mode is improved but LG still has a long
way to go
but all in all I was really happy with
the photos this phone could take with
little to no effort on my part and I
think the processing and a little things
could be fixed in future software
updates the company gives you full
manual controls and software for those
who really want to get in there and get
the very most out of these onboard
cameras you also do get a portrait mode
effect here on this phone which looks
way better on the rear cameras and they
do on the front facing cameras and also
this kind of stage lighting esque
effect built-in as well which I didn't
use all that much because the results
were honestly just pretty bad but they
are available on this phone on the front
and rear cameras if you want to try your
luck with them the software also has
some neat tricks in there to take
advantage of those three lenses there's
a triple preview that allows you to long
press and get a live view of each of the
three lenses before you snap a photo and
there's also a triple shot load that
will take one shot from each of the
three lenses and it combines them into a
gif though I didn't use this feature all
that much same goes for the cinah shot
mode that allows you to kind of make a
combination of a video and a still with
only selected parts of the frame moving
it was a bit buggy and a bit rough to
get going but I guess it's a cool party
trick to have having three different
lenses with different focal lengths
offers a lot of different versatility
and flexibility and replaces the price
and the hassle of carrying around one of
those extra lens kits for your phone if
you're looking for a way to make your
mobile photography game a bit more
interesting these three lenses may just
do the trick
powering this phone is everything you'd
expect in a flagship these days it's got
a snapdragon 845 processor 6 gigs of RAM
it's got wireless charging ip68 water
and dust resistance 64 gigs of internal
storage and other features that you
don't see on other flagships these days
mainly the ability to have expandable
storage and the Afro mention headphone
jack on the bottom it does not sport a
removable battery but the built-in 3300
milliamp hours supports quick charging
and easily lasted me a full day of heavy
use with some juice left to spare when I
put it on the charger at night and I
just want to say on the topic of
performance while using this phone I
never experienced any performance
hiccups or app crashes or any kind of
slowdown everything ran incredibly
smooth on software I'm told is finalized
and will be shipping with this phone
there's no doubt the v40 Hardware inside
and out is very premium but there's
still some work to be done on the
built-in software this is a brand-new
phone releasing in the latter part of
2018
it's running Android 8.1 Oreo out of the
box with a typical LG flavor of android
running on top of that andrew 9pi has
been publicly released for almost two
months and accessible to developers and
manufacturers well before that so it is
very disappointing not to see it on this
phone especially when this phone could
really take advantage of those Android 9
features the company's done a better job
to eliminate duplicate apps and
bloatware but I'm still just not a fan
of the built-in skin and keyboard and
the software LG puts on here can just be
a little bit heavy can certainly use
some leaning out also the artificial
intelligence and machine learning LG is
pushing in their phones and their
software fell kind of flat for me and
also there is still a lot of work that
needs to be done to the portrait mode
and more specifically that stage
lighting mode for the different light
presets it just did not work well at all
and can definitely use a little bit of
attention many of my gripes with this
phone can be fixed with software updates
but I do have one final issue to talk
about and that is the price retail price
for the v40 thinkyou is going to be
north of 900 dollars depending on the
carrier you go with for that price there
is some fierce competition from Apple
Samsung and Google so this is a decision
I definitely suggest you make very
carefully I think whether or not this
phone is really worth that premium price
tag or not really comes down to how much
you value that five camera set up there
are usually pretty good discounts to
come to LG phones in time so it's quite
possible that nine hundred dollar price
tag can be a lot less if you wait for
the right promotion if you've been a fan
of the V 30 or the g7 I think you're
really gonna love the improvements and
refinements made to this phone and if
you haven't taken a good long look at
what LG has to offer these days maybe
it's time you finally do so what do you
guys think of the v40 think you are you
a fan of that super long and kind of
confusing name what about that five
camera setup or maybe you're all about
that high five or that built-in Google
assistant button whatever your thoughts
are leave them in the comments down
below we'd love to know I am Robert
Rosenthal from TechnoBuffalo thank you
guys for watching I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
