Cyber Monday Mulligan Steve's newest
milestone huge playstation 4 sales
numbers and a new release date for the
warcraft movie it's about flippin time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin we recap five major
stories from our site technobuffalo calm
every tuesday and friday if you're
interested in reading more about any
story i mentioned on the show check the
description for links or click on the
graphics for every story if you have
annotations available and toggled on i'm
ashley sceva harry top stories amazon
CEO Jeff Bezos told 60 minutes reporter
Charlie Rose that his vision for the
future of fast amazon delivery would be
called prime air and it would utilize
autonomous drones to deliver packages
within 30 minutes of purchase before
everyone goes nuts which I guess it's
already too late for based on the
internet it's important to note will be
waiting years minimum for these delivery
copters as amazon has to not only jump
through a ton of regulatory hoops with
multiple authorities but also workout
legal insurance and safety guidelines
motorola CEO dennis woodside also in the
news today as their moto x cyber monday
sale yesterday didn't quite go as
planned in fact the planned $150
discount on any unlocked moto x may have
gone too well as motorola site couldn't
stay online to process orders and ended
in the deal being pulled woodside penned
a public letter of apology this morning
and said that motorola would offer the
same deal again tomorrow december fourth
at nine a.m. pacific time and again on
monday december ninth while supplies
last in gaming steam hit a pretty sweet
milestone this past weekend the holiday
here in the US gave more gamers than
usual a chance to maybe log into their
steam accounts check out the autumn
steam sale and play a few games now if
you have those gamers to all the other
gamers around the globe steam enjoyed a
record 7.1 million users logged in at
the same time that's a huge number and
it lends a lot of credence to the
potential success of steam machines
Congrats team sony also hit a milestone
yesterday announcing
they'd sold more than 2 million
PlayStation 4 consoles as of today the
North America launched on November 14th
saw over 1 million consoles sold which
was a sales record and now with the
addition of 30 more countries it looks
like the ps4 is selling like hotcakes
most companies like to tout how many
units they've shipped as opposed to
actually sold to buyers at retail so
this is an honest nice number and lastly
our wild card story today is an update
on the warcraft movie unfortunately it
appears its release date has been pushed
back to march 11 2016 the reason for the
change darth JJ abrams well i guess more
specifically Star Wars because episode 7
was recently given a December eighteenth
2015 release date which also happened to
be when Warcraft was supposed to drop so
I don't think anybody really wants to
compete with the new Star Wars trilogy
at theaters so I can't say I blame them
for moving a date but it is still a
bummer for warcraft fans that's the
buffalo bulletin for today if you
enjoyed the show a thumbs up would be
super awesome of you and if you want
