to you by shutterstock.com welcome back
another episode of retina schrantz at
the show i read didn't rave and give
opinions on anything one technology and
sometimes a little bit outside of it up
this week we're gonna talk about trade
shows i just got back from CES as you
can tell from my voice i didn't make it
back unscathed so we're talking about
trade shows and they're winning
influence what can be done try and boost
them back up to the glorious spectacles
of technology they once were this is
rettinger rants it's gonna get started
so if those you guys have been living
under a tech rock for the past few weeks
last week with the consumer electronic
show or CES held every year in Las Vegas
course technobuffalo crew was there
covering it usually CES is where we see
giant product announcements new phones
new tablets new televisions the
refrigerator sometimes even new cars are
announced this year though it was a much
tamer event last year we saw AT&amp;amp;T unveil
for new phones this year 18 teaches
talked about the connected house last
year we saw Samsung debut some hot new
handsets and tablets this year we saw
the Galaxy Note 10.1 with 4G LTE on it
really has been a huge difference of the
tradeshow influence over the past few
years quite honestly I think it's the
Apple influence that we're seeing
companies are starting to really love
these one-off events where they can be
the focus of all the media attention for
that day Apple hoster keynotes and the
whole world is fixated on what Apple is
going announced Samsung is now doing the
same thing the whole world's fixated on
what Samsung is going to announce HTC's
aren't do the same thing Google is doing
the same thing with their next devices
and everything that used to get
announced at CES it's no longer being
announced at the trade show so what's
happening to the tradeshow world well CS
2013 actually had a record number of
attendees which is kind of interesting
cuz it wasn't really any flagship
products we did see it some awesome TVs
get unveiled on some new appliances but
nothing that really screamed out this is
the awesome product of the year so my
concern is what's gonna happen trade
shows we look back at e3 does the
Electronic Entertainment Expo the big
gaming show and that show almost went
away a few years ago it grew and grew
and grew
got bigger and bigger and bigger and it
got more and more expensive and suddenly
they hit diminishing returns they
weren't getting what they want out of
the show and III was pretty much
cancelled for a little while and got
teeny teeny tiny until it was brought
back a few years ago I think so yes I
gonna have to undergo the same type of
transfer makes you look at a show like
ctia which now just merged another
organization it's the big wireless show
in the u.s. that show got smaller and
smaller and smaller it was super sad and
went to the San Diego show last year
there was nobody there then we was
showing anything the importance of trade
shows really becoming less important
companies want more and more attention
so think about it if you were a company
you had a big product twin avail you
could take the stage at CES you could
proudly show doohickey X and say boom
here's do a key x everybody loved it and
for the hour or so your trade shows
going on we're going to be talking about
it but then somebody else holds a press
event a few hours later and suddenly
doohickey x is doohickey yesterday and
the influence and all the writing that
would have been done about it video that
would've been done about it it's now
being spent on other products so it
makes sense for a business standpoint
also trade shows are super expensive
these boost costs hundreds of thousands
of dollars to build to maintain the
show's take place in Las Vegas of course
they are paying union wages don't get
very very very expensive to probably
straight just I'm not sure the companies
are getting their full value out of it
so I think so yes again is going to get
smaller and smaller and eventually be
reserved for a few big announcements and
a few select company that's really sad
to say I CES is one of the great things
that are industry I look forward to it
every year even though I get sick every
year after the trade show but I think
it's bound to happen at industry is
changing so let me stop this analyzation
