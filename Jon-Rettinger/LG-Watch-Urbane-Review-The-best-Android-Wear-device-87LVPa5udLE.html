from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
giving you guys our full review of LG's
latest Android wear device the LG watch
urbane it was the very first Android
wear device I was shipping with android
5.1.1 and it's also the most
sophisticated looking one I've used my
fair share of smartwatches over the past
couple of months including the Moto 360
the LG G watch R and even the Apple
watch over the past three weeks however
I've been using the watch urbane as my
primary wearable and I have plenty to
say about it there's a premium design
and latest software I justify that $349
price tag let's go ahead and find out
first we'll start off with their brain
specs the LG watch urbane features a 1.3
and circle plastic OLED display with a
pixel resolution of 320 by 320 it also
features a Snapdragon 400 processor
clocked in at 1.2 gigahertz one gigabyte
of RAM and 4 gigabytes of internal
storage for offline music playback the
urbane also features a 410 million
battery a heart rate monitor on the back
in a water-resistant rating of ip67 so
as far as specs are concerned it's
pretty similar to the LG G watch our I'm
personally not a watch guy and only wear
one if I'm at a nice event or for work
but based on design I can see myself
wearing their Bane OGIS wearable is a
really beautiful looking SmartWatch it
has a clean stainless steel body that
looks really high-end I have a decent
sized wrist so the watch doesn't look
too gargantuan on me but for people who
have smaller wrists you may find a watch
a bit too big when I first put the
urbane on it was super uncomfortable due
to the leather strap it came with but
after a few days of wearing it in it now
fits much better on my wrist now if
you're not a fan of the leather strap it
came with you'll be able to replace the
band with any other regular 22
millimeter strap whether it's silicon
metal or just another leather band that
you like more so when it comes to the
display the 1.3 inch display on the
watch urbane is beautiful it's nice to
look at and it's bright with inky blacks
while the display is sharp for a
SmartWatch it's still a little more
pixelated than I'd like the remains
bezel is noticeably thinner when
compared to the G watch R and it
definitely looks much better swiping
through the watch face feels more
comfortable and more fluid thanks to the
slimmer bezels before I was using the
watch urbane as my daily wearable I was
using the Moto 360 which I found to be
very slow with the watch urbane I'm
happy to say that there weren't a lot of
hiccups swiping through menus and
prompting google now it was fast fluid
and very responsive could be the
difference in processor but it could
also be the
updated software swiping through my
notifications going in it out of the app
menu it all felt really smooth almost as
smooth there's a smartphone running
Android lollipop speaking of Android
lollipop the LG watch urbane was the
very first Android wear device to sport
the latest software from google android
5.1.1 it introduced a lot of cool things
like sending emojis a dedicated app menu
UI changes in activated Wi-Fi support
you did a separate video showcasing the
newer features in Android wear 5.1.1
which will link down below this video
you'll still be able to check out all of
your notifications activate Google now
and there's also an always-on feature
which essentially turns the screen black
and white when the watch is idle to help
save battery the addition of Wi-Fi is
probably the coolest feature though not
every Android wear device will have
Wi-Fi support having Wi-Fi means even if
you're not within Bluetooth range of
your Android device you'll still be able
to get notifications and whatnot most
Android wear devices we've tried in the
past usually lasts a full day but with
the watch urbane we got more than a
day's worth of usage I would put it on
with a hundred percent charge around
7:30 in the morning and have it back in
its charger by 10:30 p.m. now around
that time I still have about 40% left
which would be plenty of charge to get
through the night and into the next day
you should probably charge every night
but in case you forget to charge you'll
still have enough juice to get you
through some of the following day for a
wearable device that costs over $300 we
were hoping to see the watch urbane
feature qi wireless charging like the
Moto 360 but unfortunately it's stuck
with the same old plastic dock like
charger similar to previous wearable
devices from LG it's not a complete
deal-breaker but it still would have
been nice to have wireless charging the
LG watch urbane is beautiful and a great
Android wear watch but it's by no means
the best SmartWatch out there sure it
looks more like an actual timepiece
compared to the Moto 360 but it also
comes at a much higher price tag at $350
as an alternative to the G watch art
it's not perfect either it's still cost
more than the G watch our despite it
having the same internals from the
display technology to the processor and
battery it's exact same watch in a
different body and although Android wear
has made some improvements it still
needs a lot of work so with that being
said I'm giving the watch urbane a
TechnoBuffalo score of 7 out of 10 the
battery and performance of the watch
urbane is great though that $350 price
tag is a bit too much for a device with
the same internals as its predecessor
and although Android wear has been
updated it's still really Wallace alas
I'd rather save that extra hundred
and by the LGG watch our instead anyways
thank you guys so much for watching and
if you guys enjoyed this video make sure
to give it a thumbs up and we will see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
