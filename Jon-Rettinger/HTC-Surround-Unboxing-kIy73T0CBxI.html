TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing of the
HTC surround the windows phone 7 power
device for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless let's go ahead
and dig in so for those you they're
looking to pick up the HTC surround be
available early in November for 18 teens
gonna set you back just about two
hundred dollars on a two-year contract
so here is the box you have a picture of
the device on the front serve your array
of standard things letting you know what
the phones god it's a world phone does
email Wi-Fi 5 megapixel camera some
stuff that's in the box there but we'll
go ahead and take ok open the box and
see what we have from a spec standpoint
it's always a good place to review what
you're going to get with your phone you
are going to get a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor so a decent amount
of speed 512 megabytes of flash rom and
448 megabytes of sdram 16 gigs of
internal storage you're going to get
four hours talktime 11 hours of standby
time 5 megapixel camera with autofocus
and LED flash and it can also record
video in 720p and excused a little bit
of shaky camerawork here we are without
a tripod and we've got Wi-Fi a/b/g/n
alright let's go ahead and open up the
box if you can peel off the sticker here
and see what you're going to get when
you pick up your HTC surround this
one-handed unboxing haven't done one of
these in a while go ahead i can pull
that off apart from the bottom there we
go sticker removes all right open up the
box and hear that you're going to get
quick start guide letting you know how
to start quickly a uverse mobile
application this is kind of one of the
cool things that Windows Phone 7 has if
you have eighteen t u-verse you not have
to pay an extra fee but if you don't
have uverse and you can pay it believe
it's going to be about 10 bucks a month
I get access to a ton of online content
you can actually download right to your
device so go ahead and push that off to
the side take the show on the road
here is the HTC surround this has
virtual BB digital mobile surround take
a look at that in later video and
demonstrate it but we'll push it off to
the side for just a moment you are also
going to get inside box the usual things
I suppose limited warranty you've got a
safety and regulatory information got
your micro USB charging cable your wall
port which is a pretty small actually
well ports plugs right in got the
battery i discussed top time let's see
what milliamp hours it is typical HTC
looking battery and this is going to be
of size but i pulled off to the camera
see if I can see here three point seven
volts 1230 milliamp hours there it is
and that is all you're going to get in
the box actually the last thing I'm
going to get is a pair of stereo
headphones with mic alright so push that
off to the side and let's take a look at
the device so this does have a 3.8 inch
screen the resolution of 480 x 800 of
course capacitive touchscreen peel off
texting and driving it can wait which of
course it can and here it is guy typical
array now of Windows Phone 7 button that
are actually mandated by Microsoft
you've got your back button your windows
essentially your home button and a
search button got on the left hand side
of the device absolutely nothing on the
right hand side device we have a volume
rocker right there and a dedicated
camera key one of the neat things about
the device and i'll show you in just a
minute we can also have the 5 megapixel
camera with flash one of the cool things
about the device actually slide it out
you get this Dolby Digital virtual
surround sound which clearly you can't
have a surround sound with the phone but
it really just makes things sound a lot
crisper it might be saying why would
somebody want this well if you're
playing games on a device or watching
movie you're going to get better sound
where I see the most utility is using
speakerphone on conference call I had a
chance to demo this in New York and the
speaker it sounds much less teeny than
standard of smartphones so while the
virtual surround sound
you know it's questionable usage using
this for conference calls are going to
be fantastic and we slide it out you're
also going to get access to this little
kickstand so you can now stand it up
while you're on your conference call or
watching a movie or even playing a game
with some sort of external accessory
it's going to stand up nice and easily
for you push it off to the side when the
phone is slid down you don't have access
to it sort of a new design the bottom
you got your micro USB charging port and
that is about it course you have your
3.5 millimeter headset jack and your
lock and power button on top let's do a
quick size comparison here with some of
its friends here we've got the samsung
focus also windows phone 7 powered and
see the difference there instead the
thickness test so the surround is a
little bit thicker but it's probably
taken up by that speaker let's go ahead
and bring in an android phone of course
this is the evo 4g 4.3 inch screen you
can see a little bit of the difference
right there and lastly let's bring in
the iphone 4 for comparison purposes and
see that they look relatively similar a
slight design phones and we will do the
stack and science compare here we'll
make a big fat cell phone sandwich and
see if we see any difference so there
are all the sizes right there is the
last one if i can fan it out is the
surround and we guys be sure to stay
tuned to the channel for a ton of
coverage on all the windows phone 7
devices including the HTC surround i'll
demonstrate how this virtual surround
sound thing works and whether or not it
lives up to its name that button right
there in case you're wondering will turn
that surround sound on or off hi guys
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i will see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
