there but finding a good pair is super
tough I've got an answer for you meet
the Optima NuForce be free eights
these little suckers come in a pretty
sleek black little carrying case so John
you say what's new unique about these
well I want to give you guys a chance to
create some for yourselves we're also
gonna be given a pair of these suckers
away as well as a chance to win the
smartphone of your dreams up to a
thousand bucks we'll link to all the
information down below there's a couple
reasons that I think these headphones
are pretty cool first I kinda like the
black case really sell a battery life I
think that's important for something
that's this small you're gonna get about
16 hours between the battery life built
into the earbuds and also into the case
so that's nice what's been a big deal
for me and this is a legit concern on if
you guys have had this issue but I must
have put weird ear canals and weird gear
holes because most wireless earbuds or
headphones that go inside of the year
aren't comfortable for me
things like ear pods that can only wear
for maybe 20 30 minutes at a time before
my ears start to hurt and also they fall
out so the fact that things were
comfortable for like an hour
the longer at a time was super nice to
have there's also a lot of a lot of tech
they crammed in here things I'm gonna
make things useful there's a button to
launch Google assistant which is built
in there supposedly the only true
wireless headphones that support AAC and
aptX low latency technologies right out
of the box that's gonna mean you're
getting high fidelity audio it's any
device whether it's an iPhone Android or
even Windows Phone and also PC and Macs
got a built in dynamic micro driver with
new forces sonic coating all that's
gonna mean it you're gonna get get
awesome sound out of headphones that are
that are really small they're also sweat
and water resistant with IP x5 if you
get gross and sweaty when you worked out
or happen to get like some rain hits
them they're gonna be good to go got a
built-in CVC noise cancelling microphone
for calls which is awesome for something
that's small usually you've got a kind
of background noise that's been really
helpful to have so another bit of cool
tech is NF M I miss me it seems for near
field magnetic induction so this is tech
that produces the best quality between
earpieces
there's no need to receive and resend
Bluetooth signals even maintain two
separate Bluetooth connections between
the source and the earpiece it's kind of
cool you could just
the left one if you want share with
someone so if it sounds like something
you want to check out and I think you
guys probably should hundred fifty bucks
is a really killer deal for something
like this we'll link to it down below we
also want to give you a chance to win a
pair and pair it with the smartphone of
your dreams any smartphone under a
thousand bucks will will send you open
to anyone in the world on these dates
all you gotta set the link down below
the article on TechnoBuffalo comm enter
there and we will pick one lucky winner
to win the headphones and the smartphone
of your dreams you guys should really
check these out folks it out to a
Ralston and send it to us they spawned
to this video they're legitimately
really good headphones and if looking
for something Wireless that's maybe not
white stupid looking these are really
good options I hope you guys enjoy
giveaways we love doing it until next
time John right and your protective
buckle Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
