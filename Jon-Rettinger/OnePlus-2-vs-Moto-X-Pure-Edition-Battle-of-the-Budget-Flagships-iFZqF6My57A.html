range right now so who's it gonna be huh
Motorola's new flagship or the one that
started at all I'm our first time we're
TechnoBuffalo and it's time to throw
down this is the oneplus 2 versus the
Moto X pure edition all right I'm going
to be taking a look at these bad boys in
8 separate categories we're gonna look
at the build the device in the hand
specs in performance obviously the
internals we're gonna look at the other
hardware features like fingerprint
scanners front facing speaker stuff like
that the screen the display itself the
camera the battery the software and
we're gonna call it bang because I don't
want to just talking about price we're
gonna talk about the bang for your buck
for each of these devices this is gonna
be my model for all of the vs. videos
moving forward so I just wanted to
detail that for you really quickly right
here so let's get into it first up let's
take a look at the build of these two
devices the oneplus 2 certainly feels a
whole lot more premium it's got a bit of
a 1/2 to it that the Moto X lacks the
Moto X hasn't really changed all that
much from last year's model so it's
still got the curved back that dimpled
around the back as well but this one
lays much flatter on the table which is
really nice less Rocking plus with all
the sensors on the front if it's got a
white panel on the front it just looks a
little bit too busy so overall I think I
kind of give this one to the oneplus 2
all right let's break down the specs in
the performance the oneplus 2 famously
sports the Snapdragon 810 and the
performance does show it you know me I'm
not a benchmark guy if it can handle
what we throw at it in the real world
then we're golden the oneplus 2
certainly does hit that mark well I did
experience some lag as in my previous
tests nothing really stood out to me is
particularly egregious the Snapdragon
808 in the Moto X pure is definitely a
workhorse though it's closer to
tried-and-true than the 8 10 is which is
why a lot of the devices are going with
the 808 as opposed to the 810 that are
in the kind of value minded range
options while the expir comes in at just
under last year's Nexus 6 on antutu
benchmark I haven't had any problems
with day to day use between the two of
these I experienced less lag on the Moto
X and turning on GPU rendering on the
device definitely backs that anecdotal
data up
but despite actually scoring lower than
the Moto X the oneplus 2 just feels much
snappier
on everything from webpages to pulling
at my Twitter feed I just think it's a
faster device I gotta give this one to
the 1+2 let's talk about the other
hardware for just a second both devices
have their fair share of bells and
whistles I really appreciated the
oneplus two's profile switch on the left
side of the device something that I
didn't realize that I was missing a lot
from iOS the off screen drawing gestures
are also super certainly convenient but
when it comes to bells and whistles I
think it's really tough to top motos X
and with gestures that have come in so
so much handy for me everything from
waving over the device for active
display to turning on the flashlight
with a chop to finally reliably being
able to open the camera with a twist of
the device it all works perfectly and
I'm definitely gonna miss them a lot
when I move on from the X with the soso
fingerprint scanner on the oneplus 2 and
no marshmallow support for it I'd rather
have the gestures and the helpful tweaks
that moto packs into the X peer so I
think I got a chalk one more up for the
Moto X pure alright let's talk about the
display while the oneplus two's display
is certainly no slouch it's hard not to
be impressed by the panel in the Moto X
sure diminishing returns but the higher
resolution and density the display does
come through in the information density
that I am huge on being able to see more
texts more icons more all that stuff on
the display really makes a difference
for me in my day to day usage that's to
say nothing of the fact that they packed
a quad HD display into a $400 device
with excellent battery life and very few
compromises even though I tend to prefer
the cooler color balance on the oneplus
2 I did feel the color reproduction was
a little bit truer on the photos that I
took on the Moto X and just day-to-day
stuff in Instagram the oneplus 2 also
feels like it has sharpening turned up
much higher which you might remember I
am NOT a fan of so for me this one's a
pretty clear win for the Moto X all
right well what about that camera
well the oneplus two's camera did a
great job in our test shots but it's not
lauded as one of the best ones on the
market the Moto X pure on the other hand
has its work cut out for it moto hasn't
been on their game in terms of cameras
so it's delightful to see that the
camera on the X pier is finally
fantastic again it's not the industry
leader but it's a strong offering and
it's certainly much better than anything
they
put out to date both devices support 4k
slo-mo video and a host of other
features to their respective apps at
first I thought that motos new camera
app put it at a really strong
disadvantage but after getting used to
it I kind of liked the ability to tap
anywhere to trigger the shutter the
comparison shots are pretty close almost
too close to call I think each sensor
definitely has their own strong suits
the oneplus 2 had a much easier time
finding focus thanks to the autofocus on
the back that's a laser that's right we
live in the future
but the Moto X is shots were much much
more natural and less noisy you can
check out all the shots for yourself in
the galleries on the article but I've
got to give this into the Moto X pure
alright battery time well the Moto X is
short 300 milliamp hours from the
oneplus 2 it had a much easier time
making it through days in standby mode
and occasional usage the X hasn't been
plugged in in a well over two days when
I was writing the script for this and it
made it all the way into the evening
with 30 percent battery left granted
this is less than two hours screen on
time but it's still impressive the
oneplus 2 on the other hand is on the
other end of that spectrum more often
than not I'm concerned about what I'm
gonna need to plug it in again and the
fact that it uses USB see it just
exacerbates that issue I can't hold USB
C against it though because that's gonna
be the standard very very soon either
way the uptime on the oneplus 2 was just
not nearly as good as the Moto X I have
a sneaking suspicion that this has
something to do with the 810 under the
hood but obviously I can't confirm that
at the end of the day the device with
more juice wins and at the end of every
day the Moto X is the device with more
juice on the software front both devices
have thankfully light takes on Android
but Moto has a much lighter touch
motorola isn't running a total fork of
android like oxygen OS is so the changes
that moto makes to the devices these
days are largely relegated to apps that
you can grab from the Play Store and you
can uninstall if you don't want to use
them that means faster updates and
performance all the way across the board
so while there isn't anything terribly
wrong with oxygen OS it still means that
it's further from stock so this one's
got to go to mother finally let's talk
about the all-important price tag I
don't want to talk about price in a
vacuum like I said so we're gonna call
this bang for your buck the oneplus 2
comes in at 3
89 for the 64 gig 4 gig of RAM model
which is the only one that they
currently have in stock now that invites
are no longer required for purchase the
Moto X comes in at $4.99 for a 64 gig
storage model so comparing these two it
seems like oneplus has the edge but I'm
not convinced that that's true well it's
a huge boon that the device is finally
available without an invite the Moto X
has never needed one in the first place
and it comes with the added bonus of
being able to make it your own with moto
maker for this category I gotta ask
myself which device I would be more
likely to buy based on the price and how
long that device would last me based on
the offerings on each end this one has
got to go to the Moto X pure despite the
higher price tag the customization
options and excellent across-the-board
performance makes me feel way more
comfortable that this is the device
that's gonna ride out a year or two with
me as my daily driver as opposed to the
oneplus 2 alright let's tally up that
score aside from the build and
performance it's a clean sweep for the
Moto X pure I really think that this is
a fantastic device and the more time I
spend with oneplus 2 the less I like it
the expir has grown on me really really
quickly and the last device that I used
before it was a galaxy note 5 so I think
that's really saying something let me
know what you guys think in the comments
is there anything that I missed that you
would have liked to have seen me covered
in a versus video I'll definitely make
sure that it gets covered in the next
one while you're heading down to the
comments make sure you slap that like
button there's also a subscribe button

always thank you so much for watching be
kind of one another and I'll catch you
