to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of Rhett
enters riffs I'm rostrata Rangers to
show her I can talk about anything it's
going on in the world of technology up
this week it's all about the HTC One or
the HTC m8 at HTC two or ever HC decides
to call their next flagship device let's
go and get started we've been seeing
leaks and rumors of the next HTC One for
the better part of almost six months HTC
one was my favorite device of last year
so needless to say I'm kind of excited
about what they have next thing HTC's
got some of the best build going in all
smartphones and especially in the
Android world so earlier this week HTC
finally said enough is enough here's
when you're going to see the latest
hotness sent out invites for an event on
March 25th in London and New York City
which as a side note we will be at
covering it showing you all the latest
stuff let me refresh your mind on what
might be coming from HTC so we're going
to have on-screen buttons so gone are
the very annoying capacitive buttons
here don't have a home button happy
it'll be going on screen that home
button will make a return kind of one of
the cool things OC dual cameras on the
back you're probably saying hey John
well I dual cameras is it for 3d you saw
those a few years back the answer is
please no not for 3d supposedly we're
gonna have some sort of after focusing
sort of a light field type technology we
saw on the lytro camo essentially means
you can focus after the fact so if
you're chasing around your pet so they
can other or your kid you just snap a
picture look at it on your phone tap it
and it will automatically come into
focus after you took the picture which
is a really really cool thing these
modules are pretty brand-new that's sort
of the two lenses and HTC One or seek
whatever they call it pulls it off will
be the first phone that actually has
that so kind of cool hopefully that'll
make its way to video as well we should
see 4.4 kitkat out of the box hopefully
4.4 point2 but the very least we'll have
some Kit Kat delectable deliciousness
coming right out of the box and improved
sent six sense has been one of the skins
that I really liked actually in the
Andrew
world hopefully sent six will improve on
that improved blinkfeed improved native
applications like their and their mail
app and such should just give a better
seamless experience improved boom sound
as well boom Santa the front facing
speakers five HTC One sort of makes
sense to locate your phone a lot you
want the sound coming right at your face
hopefully that will be improved kind of
cool to have a wide angle camera on the
front so we want to take your selfies
you can now get you and your bestie
right next to you you know it's making
just some killer killer duck faces we
should also have you know the HTC design
I wouldn't hold your breath for any sort
removable back like we saw I'm HTC One
max we should have that sort of aluminum
build a unibody feel that great
construction respect standpoint should
have improved processor qualcomm
snapdragon 800 possibly an 805 I'd
expect three gigs of ram and there's
well you want to take just normal
pictures it should also be an improved
ultrapixel camera as well we're getting
probably a bigger 5-inch green 1080p and
it should look super duper nice and see
how it stacks up the biggest competition
the as yet announced galaxy s5 from they
should be going head-to-head I hope
HTC's got plenty of juice left in the
tank I think they make great smartphones
and I'm just here to see what they have
next but we all know very very soon on
