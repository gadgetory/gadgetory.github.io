event a new design for the PlayStation
Vita the Vita TV and thoughts on the
Galaxy gear Buffalo bulletin time hello
internet and welcome to the Buffalo
bulletin where we recap five major
stories from our site TechnoBuffalo calm
a couple of times a week if you're
interested in reading more about any
story we talked about on the show check
the description for the links or you can
click on the graphics in every story if
you have annotations available I'm
Ashley sceva and I'm back from Aoife in
Berlin here are your top stories Apple
held their annual iphone event today and
announced two phones we kind of already
knew a whole lot about the iphone 5c and
the iphone 5s the 5c will come in five
colorful variants and will replace the
iphone 5 while the 5s has a new a7 chip
touch ID and an improved camera you'll
be able to pick up either device
starting September 20th and we have all
the details on our site Microsoft mailed
out invitations to a new event where
they're expected to unveil new surfaces
on the twenty-third of September no word
yet on device sizes that we might be
seeing since we've heard rumors of maybe
a smaller surface but it's likely we'll
see at least one of these devices
running Windows 8.1 oh if anything I'm
just hoping they've realized how
ridiculous the surface RT is and go
forward with just full Windows products
from here on out Sony dominated gaming
news yesterday with their first
announcement introducing us to an
updated PlayStation Vita the new model
replaces the 5 inch oled screen with an
LCD screen it's fifteen percent lighter
twenty percent thinner and will be
available in five colorful options the
new Vita launches on October 10th in
Japan and will cost just shy of nineteen
thousand yen unfortunately there aren't
any official plans at this point to
launch anywhere else in the world so
that's a bummer sony also announced a
bit of a surprise product via the
playstation vita TV the little console
that plugs into your TV's HDMI port
allows you to play Vita and available
PSP and PSone games lots of 1300 games
at launch which is pretty solid and
you'll also be able to stream via
services like Hulu the launch date is
November 14th in Japan
will cost about $95 us but like the new
Vita here's the problem there's no
official word on other countries getting
vita TV but we're still intrigued and
we'll keep our fingers crossed that
it'll make its way across the globe and
our wild card for the week comes from
our own brandon russell who has a lot of
things to say about the Samsung Galaxy
gear well mostly he believes the Samsung
watch isn't the future wearable tech and
gives a lengthy rant about why he feels
that way lots of folks arguing in the
comments about this one on both sides so
it's definitely worth checking out
regardless of how you feel about the
galaxy gear that's the Buffalo bulletin
for today if you enjoyed the show a
thumbs up would be super awesome of you
