to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back the pursuit of rumor
roundup i'm yours jon rettinger the
title should give it away this to show
we take all the tech rumors from the
week the things that seem plausible not
plausible might happen could happen
might someday potentially happen I
served them up to you in one video so
you know exactly what you might have
missed of this week the galaxy s5 looks
like it's getting a google play edition
which ties in nicely to perhaps Google
killing off the Nexus line the iphone 6
is going to get some crazy new camera
tech and it looks like the iWatch it's a
production this from a roundup let's
start rounding them up so I've been
pretty honest about it I love my android
naked and unadulterated in the way
Google intended and I've loved in Google
is gone Google Play devices could get
the best of the flagships but you also
get sort of naked and unskinny Android
and looked like the latest from Samsung
might be getting some google play action
as well so when samsung first announced
the galaxy s5 we heard nothing of a
google play edition not even a peep not
even a rumor not even a little birdy
landed on your shoulder whispering about
a google play edition but we do have is
a google play edition of the galaxy s4
available in the Google Play Store well
earlier in the week that same galaxy s4
post in the image of the google play
galaxy s4 would replace with the galaxy
s5 picture but no other mention of a
galaxy s5 at all leading us to believe
that perhaps Google is getting ready to
unleash a galaxy s5 with Google Play
caswell so they have that picture there
again though nothing to be confirmed by
Samsung by Google or by my mom because
she tends to know things we know nothing
else about it but if you're looking to
get a google play edition you might want
to wait another couple days or a week
and speaking of Google Play editions
they might be the new Nexus phone so to
speak rumors and I'm very sad to say
this out loud that Google might be
killing off the Nexus line we just do a
moment of silence for what could be the
final Nexus phone out or perhaps one
more might be coming gonna miss you guys
pour one out so we're in the week on
Tuesday a publication called the
information
published new details on a program
inside of Google called Android silver
that says they're planning to develop
high end products represent the Android
platform and if you thinkin that's the
Nexus device does you would be correct
these devices would supposedly me place
Nexus devices which originally just
intended for developers anyway right now
focused a lot towards consumers the
google play edition devices typically
our premium flagships are targeted at
developers you know instead you got the
new HTC One and the galaxy s5 supposedly
coming very soon Sony's got a few out
there as well the information not the
information that I'm sharing the
publication the information I said
Google's plan is to kill half the Nexus
phones entirely which is super big
bummer for not only me but also i'm sure
a ton of other next fans out there the
Google server devices will be
manufactured by OEMs and then sold
through carriers that outlet suggested
perhaps replacing Google's Durrett the
consumer model that we've got right now
available through google play this like
did say that OEMs and carriers will
effectively be paid to produce and sell
high-end devices that closely adhere to
google specifications and that the goal
is to target Apple so the sounds kind of
similar to the existing Google Play
portfolio since all of these phones are
high in flat crypt anyway but they're
not sold by the carriers of perhaps
Google want specifically custom-made
products for its silver lining devices
so maybe like a galaxy s5 silver or HTC
One silver we don't know if the silver
name supposed to involve metal or that's
just sort of just part of the name to
make it sound cool so don't know much
information about it right now but we're
getting rumors the galaxy s5 Prime you
know that kind of fits in nicely but
perhaps that's sort of another device
entirely no word well us to come to
fruition I'm hoping it's a fake rumor
but my gut told her you're gonna hear
more drink Google i/o and June I'm
hoping all well here's the rumors are
fake it's not gonna happen don't hold
your breath we've already heard some
grumblings about a nexus 6 that perhaps
could be the swan song for the nexus
line but i'm i'm hopeful that's not
gonna happen the rumor is that the nexus
6 we based on the upcoming new LG
flagship so i don't know please don't be
true let's jump over from google and
samsung talk a bit about apple and the
iphone 6 it looks like they might be
getting some cool new camera tech so the
iphone 5s i think still offers when the
best cameras on the
market but it does lack a pretty
important feature that photographers and
photo heads I just made that word up
have really been clamoring for and that
is choice or just stands for optical
image stabilization or OS anyhow you
want I think always it sounds better for
short other hardware the hardware
technology which was in use on ton of
other smartphones including HTC one m7
and the LG g2 allows you to shoot clear
photos even when moving against the
image stabilization thing and while
riding around to the bumpy cars you can
take those selfies while your friends
driving so the rumors have suggested
that Apple was going to add Oh is on its
iPhone 6 but now a brand new report out
of China so it's going to take
technology it's a totally different way
apple instead allegedly opted for yes or
electronic image stabilization for sure
according to analyst at a China posted
the rumor on Weibo electronic image
stabilization will rely on software to
clean up any blurring in an image
instead of hardware technology o is
relies on to create better photos that
might raise some concern for folks
before to rely on a harder for image
stabilization since software typically
doesn't always work as well still Apple
hasn't let anyone down with with cameras
I don't think recently so they've been
pretty good so if it adds oh is it
should be pretty seen if it's eis
hopefully love a reason for it maybe
it's got a really solid algorithm that
allows for quicker shooting I don't know
but an analyst is saying it and if
analysts are saying it it's always got
to be true I'm this is I'm gonna like a
mustache on my finger and be like I have
an analyst and my analytical head says
apples gonna do a hologram phone and
like boom analyst says hologram foam
coming take with a gigantic grain of
salt step away from the rumors for a
quick second to thank the good peeps at

again that's ly ND a calm / check go
buffalo and while you are eating your
gigantic grain of salt let's talk about
the iWatch a new report from you guess
the china x claims early production for
the rumored iWatch already kicked off
supporting the rumors that the
smartwatch could launch this fall the
article which cites anonymous sources
those are the best kind an apple supply
chain also claimed the device we use a
different type of processor chip for the
miniaturization purposes the iWatch cpu
will reportedly use system in package
modules or sips like to call them said
standard printed circuit boards or
pickups which isn't as fun to say
allowing apple to pack multiple sensors
inside a single chip set this rumor does
prove to be true the iWatch could come
in a much smaller size compared to the
bulky devices from samsung other
competitors the inclusion of sensors in
the device also suggested it could work
pretty closely with apple's upcoming
health book app which is point still a
rumor and leaked earlier this year so
the rumored SmartWatch expected to
feature a curved display possibly
provided by LG we don't know much about
the i watch both production is
supposedly getting underway and already
we're going it's possible start seeing
leaked parts and photos turn up in the
very near future and you know WTC is not
the far away perhaps they want to check
the time on the fancy new i watch and
Tim Cook could be like well as even this
presentation I took 47 steps I know that
because of my I'll watch but that's
probably not gonna happen you can tell I
Jeff technology pipe dream so please
google don't kill the nexus line Apple
come out with your i watch i can stop
talking about it that would just be my
hopeful wishes for the week and I guys
hope you enjoyed it what you think about
these rumors leave your comments down
below if you want to save the Nexus line
we should create a white house petition
so that they can't get rid of it and the
president have to review it that could
be kind of fun anyway I want to hear
