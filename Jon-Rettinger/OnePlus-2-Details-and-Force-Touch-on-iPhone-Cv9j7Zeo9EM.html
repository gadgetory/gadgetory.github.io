hanging here from technobuffalo and in
today's episode of rumor roundup we're
talking about apple's next iPhones
Sony's Xperia z4 and the oneplus 2 this
is rumor roundup so let's go ahead and
get started the Sony Xperia z4 probably
won't launch until fall of 2015 but a
new benchmark for sony z4 was recently
spotted in gfxbench which shows what we
can expect once it's announced later
this year if the benchmark is true we're
learning the Xperia z4 runs on the
Snapdragon 810 processor though it's
still packing a 1080p screen similar to
the z3 we're also seeing that it has two
point eight gigabytes of RAM which will
likely be three gigabytes at launch and
23 gigabytes of usable storage as the
base option finally Sony's including a
19 megapixel camera along with an
upgraded four point eight megapixel
front-facing camera now overall it seems
like Sony's making some minor
improvements making it pretty tough to
stand out next to Samsung's Galaxy s6
and s6 edge or LG's upcoming g4 now if
you remember last week's rumor roundup
we talked about Apple's iPhone 6c and
how Apple is planning to reintroduce the
line up later this year well today we're
getting a first look at the alleged
device which features a completely
different design than your typical
iPhone see lineup pictures posted by the
custom is seemingly presents an iphone
6c shelled it looks a lot like an iphone
6 gone is the plastic and instead Apple
has opted for an aluminum shell just
with a smaller 4-inch screen now that
means Apple could have three different
aluminium options come this fall ulta
Mac points out the site that leaked
these images has a non-existent track
record when it comes to leaked Apple
products so there's no telling if they
are legit or not if they are real it
essentially looks like the iPhone see
line is all grown up I'm hoping this
rumor Israel but it is weird that not
too long ago there was another leak
which showed off a supposed iPhone 6
seashell and plastic now what do you
guys think is this real or is it not let
us know in the comments down below 1
plus officially announced its drone not
too long ago but we're still waiting for
the oneplus two new reports from gizmo
China claims that the oneplus 2 may
feature laser focus fingerprint
identification the biometric scanner
will apparently come built into a new
physical home button that's flanked by
capacitive buttons on either side now it
is possible this could drive up the
price though we're still hoping for an
affordable price range for the oneplus 2
we've heard rumors that the company
could opt in for a slightly smaller or
bigger display though we thought the 5.5
inch screen of the original one was a
good size the 1+2 probably won't get an
official launch until later this summer
or later leaving plenty of time to work
out the final details it may not be too
long before the company starts teasing
its new phone last but not least a new
report from Taiwan's economic Daily News
claims that Apple's forced touch
technology which we first saw on the
Apple watch and more recently on a few
track pads it's going to be an iphone 6s
plus exclusive no multiple reports
claimed that the new feature is primed
to make the transition over to mobile
becoming a headlining feature in Apple's
s line up this fall sorry iphone 6s
users iphone 6s plus we'll get the
cooler tech as usual so when I iphone 6
and iphone 6 plus were released last
year the two are essentially identical
although the 6 plus came with an optical
image stabilization camera and a 1080p
screen you have to entice people to your
more expensive model somehow right yeah
if the 4.7 inch iphone 6s simply gets
more RAM a faster chip and nothing else
that would be a pretty measly update so
what do you guys think do you think for
such is only going to be an iphone 6s
plus exclusive let us know in the
comments down below we would love to
hear your thoughts about it anyways this
it for this episode of rumor roundup
