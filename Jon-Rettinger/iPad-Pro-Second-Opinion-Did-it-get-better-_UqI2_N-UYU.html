German TechnoBuffalo here it's been
about three months since this guy came
out and we did our European review when
Ron and I took this guy as my only
computer on a trip to Munich Germany but
since then I'll be using it every day so
I thought it sort of revisit the iPad
pro our initial review
I guess spoiler alert was and ain't all
that and it's certainly not all that
plus plus like a side delicious bag of
chips it was just a giant iPad in a lot
of ways that opinion is still the same I
found myself using this exactly as I've
used the iPad Mini and the iPad air
before it no difference at all on this
size isn't really adding much for me so
my use cases are pretty simple mostly I
use this guy to get material to eat
dinner well watch Little Nemo and I'll
just shove food in his mouth while he's
distracted
I'll watch videos at night with it I
find myself not using it to type emails
not using it as a work device at all
despite the type cover which I still
find expensive and still find hard to
use hard to navigate and makes me mad
that it does not have a home button on
it cannot figure out why Apple do that
and not to mention the design on it and
how it folds is asinine and ridiculous
few things that I do like about it
though
I think the speakers are still
absolutely awesome I think it's bigger
some of the best I've heard on a tablet
respect standpoint it's still very quick
for an iPad it's a big caveat it boots
up fast and multitask well but no real
difference when you're actually using it
versus the current gen iPad air or even
the current gen iPad Mini all of you are
getting with the pro is a better screen
and a bigger iPad nothing else there's
no added utility here I didn't find
myself using multitasking all that often
in fact they easily just forgot that it
was there if I had a multitask much
usually just go them sitting from a
normal computer I still just and my my
conclusion initial review that I don't
know who this is for I don't know who
would buy this I don't know why you
would buy it and I cannot for the life
we figure out why F would even call it
an iPad pro there's very little pro
about it
granted you can get pencil and the
pencil does work well it's probably the
best iOS device I've ever used
but caveat here and I found myself
hardly ever using
at all sometimes it's a companion device
at home what I'm sitting in front of my
surface pro for doing work and I'll use
this to maybe put some notes down next
to me but that's really it if you use a
tablet passively for just watching
movies and consuming content I don't
know why you want to spend the money on
an iPad pro versus a much as expensive
either iPad or just plethora Android
options what do I think they'll have you
picked up and I've had probably been
looking I wanted to store and check it
out your friends I would like to know
who this is for this is for you
I'm not trying to be judgey tell me why
tell me what about this is for you and
why the perfect tablet and maybe we
could have a discussion on it maybe you
can help change my mind the video a
thumbs up we always appreciate it the
button that looks looks like this down
below until next time Jean render from
TechnoBuffalo doc connects video can you
say John Rhett injure from TechnoBuffalo
here
okay good buzz well here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
