to good to go this is our inaugural
episode and I'm very excited for it I'm
Noah Kravitz from technobuffalo here in
oakland california high and I've changed
kittrick with ZDNet mobile news here in
euston Texas now i gotta say since it's
our first episode james i'm just going
to say it straight off the bat been a
fan ears for a long time I can hear the
audience crying foul already knew fanboy
allegations for me Bell take a mess okay
but I've been a fan of yours for a long
time before we got to know each other a
little so I'm thrilled to be doing this
I'm just like to get a chance to talk
with you on a regular basis well I have
the same way I've been following your
stuff forever and I was excited recently
when we finally met you know and we did
so I guess we oh we oh HP a debt of
gratitude for a pull us together cuz I
think that's where we met in person at
their event now I've got them probably
more sales than anybody that's all they
want is the money so so speaking of that
event and to get past the the niceties
here and get on to it I think we're
talking tablets this week how could we
not with you know the big news out of
San Francisco is that was that just
yesterday it feels like weeks ago
already well that's because they
probably apples probably gathered
another ten percent market share since
yesterday I think I think John from our
site was actually on TV and they uh this
morning and instead of talking about the
gadgets they roped him into talking
about stock prices so i will stay away
from that one but but you know i wish i
bought the stock long ago anyway ipad2
what do you think what do you make of
the news well i think it's exactly what
I expected it needed to be a you know a
good improvement but not revolutionary
in any way but the important thing I
think was Keith the price to say so you
increase the value they've already set
an aggressive price bar with the
original iPad and then their competitors
have got to just be shaky today you know
what are we gonna do yeah you know I
would agree with you I think it's an
interesting thing I find that the people
who is sort of the vocal followers sites
like ours and
imagine you know your blog as well the
tech enthusiast we talked a lot about
specs and we look at spec sheets and you
know you can point to Apple isn't talked
about how much Rams and the thing dual
core right exactly right quad core has
already been announced and but when you
when you look at you know the the sales
figures and the profit margins and the
people buying these things in the way
that they market the products you know I
found really telling yesterday was the
emphasis that jobs put on talking about
how you know we just don't understand
how the competitors are approaching this
and for us it's got to be simpler than a
pc and they talked a lot about the
applications and you know I'm a big
video guy so I'm psyched to try I movie
you know I don't know if it'll be any
good i've got to zoom and zoom came
preloaded with a video editing
application here we go let's plot the
guns right have you tried that at all
the movie studio on zoom no I well I've
opened it but I don't have any movies on
it so I know I haven't tried it yet it's
fine I mean I'm psyched that there's a
video editing app that came pre-loaded
because I've been wanting you know
there's something you can mess around
with on iOS and stuff but uh you know
it's fine but then you see we could have
done this call we could have just done a
gtalk video call amna oh that's right I
forgot about gtalk on this thing yeah we
could do that for next time and that's
because you know they don't they don't
market it that's I mean that's the other
thing you know kind of getting back to
the way that that Apple and jobs
yesterday and and you know apples
advertising agency certainly position
this stuff and talk about they're
talking about apps and experiences and
the way people use the thing and not you
know dual cores and spec sheets and all
that stuff the way that guys like us and
you know the people who who read and
talk about us do and I don't know what
do you see from from the competition
that's out there you said they're
shaking in their boots do you see
anybody who's you know maybe shaking a
little bit less than the others well I I
think personally the the company that's
excited me most from what I've seen
personally is HP with the touchpad webos
I I think it's it
radically different from everything else
out there with Android and all the stuff
and it looked I mean I spent a couple
hours as did you I know out and that
they HP at web wasn't rent right and I
was really improving it looked ready to
me yeah it looked ready it looked like
you could pick it up and really use you
know then that's what we say about the
ipad that's the advantage they always
have over there you can pick it up and
just do stuff right right that's the
thing you this slew of Android 30
devices coming out I I did a little bit
of uh we were talking before we hit the
record button i did a little little bit
of i knew what i was doing yesterday I
made some comments on Twitter because I
wanted to see what the Android army
would come back at me with you know and
that's the thing to me about about
Android I actually like three dot oh I
like the zoom more than i thought i
would but right out of the box how much
can you do with it and and that's sort
of the you know it's a double-edged
thing because i think that um people who
like android would say well you can
customize it so much you can do anything
you want with it it's there are no
boundaries and you know the flip side
saying you know well apple just sort of
ropes you into exactly the experience
they want you to have and that's not
what i want and you know it's an
interesting thing two ways of doing
business but that i think is part of
what maids what's made ipad so
successful and i agree with you on the
touchpad i was also really impressed i
thought webos kind of felt like it was
meant to be on a bigger screen almost or
you know at least it seems to work
really well the developer part of that
that event was was lacking a little bit
though no disrespect to the 14 year old
kid who made the game but that's not
really i think what people were hoping
to see yeah I think you're right but it
always comes down to the apps and again
that's another reason why the apple with
the ipad is in such a strong position on
me and and like you were just saying i
actually look at a little bit
differently i think what makes apples
marketing so brilliant quite frankly
no matter what you think of Apple I mean
I don't think that like with the ipad
that they're dictating how you have to
use it I think they're masters that
identify how all of the millions of
regular people in the street not you and
me techy guy you wanna you know i wanna
i wanna mod i wanted i want to do custom
rom on on my tablet which i've done you
know we don't buy enough to make any
money they want the billions of dollars
they can get from the people on the
street and so they identify how they're
gonna use it yeah and that's the
experience they perfect you i can i call
it the 90 10 rule quite frankly right
explicit explain that's what that means
for people who might not know well i
mean in my experience ninety percent of
the people well most all of mainstream
consumers not technically sheís they
spend ninety percent of their time using
a given device and they only use ten
percent of the functionality i right
like like my brain somebody once told ya
yeah mar 2 yeah but and and that's what
Apple does so well they identify that
ten percent that that people can spend
all their time doing and they make it
bulletproof simple intuitive drop dead
easy you know what always boggles my
mind you remember remember I mean set
that long ago remember that the evo 4g
android phone HTC on sprint and that
phone came out i say remember he's going
to pull it advised that there you go
great device yeah one of the first thing
in your first 4g so-called 4g phone in
America front-facing camera video chat
before facetime exam yeah I can't
remember an ad a TV spot for that phone
that showed video calling happening I
might be wrong here I probably am wrong
but that's not what I remember from that
they got to it eventually but the first
series of ads I remember kind of an
animated thing with what look like
dominoes falling in the back
yeah talking about first is this first
is that first is whatever iphone 4 comes
along and you see an ad immediately
based on FaceTime right and it's like
you know grandfather talking two
grandkids and people far away and just
that exactly what you're just saying
this is how ninety percent of the people
you know we're going to use this and
it's always boggled my mind that that
other companies don't necessarily go for
that with their advertising of the
especially as things like smartphones
and tablets are going so mainstream they
market the stuff to people like you and
I and like I said we don't have the big
but we don't in the numbers Yeah right
they need to they need to market it to
my aunt's salad you know who who's not
even sure she wants a tablet yeah but
she can sure tell you what an ipad is
right you know and that's that's whole
thing its awareness yeah yeah real quick
cuz we don't want to our hidden are are
we set a time limit out before we get
this off we were joking you know you get
you get two geeks in a room alone talk
and you know suddenly it's next tuesday
so yeah what do you what do you think
about we you know we touch real real
briefly on HP blackberry and you know
this is sort of a longer more reading
tea leaves thing but microsoft and the
tablet markets you know we know we've
seen playbook have an idea when it might
be coming out some rumors that i might
run android apps that kind of thing but
not not anything concrete from Microsoft
or you know the windows phone nokia
partnership what are your thoughts on
either of those well I think the
PlayBook will probably do well in the
enterprise and I think that's where
they're aiming it and knocked at the
consumer and I think that's probably
smart i don't see consumers flocking to
the playbook but I mean you never can
tell Microsoft as far as the the windows
with of its arm-based windows tablets or
whatever they're there in an odd
situation they don't make hardware I
mean I
all they're gonna do is put something
out there and hope companies grab it up
and they they're gonna be so far behind
I don't know if they're gonna get a lot
of people to to jump yeah you know yeah
yeah I have I have a little bit of that
concern for the webos stuff but you know
they have more of you know especially
now with the muscle of HP behind them
you know they have that top to bottom
hardware software marketing all in one
spot thing happening and then HP's huge
distribution reach that you know palm
didn't have that during that kind of
their first resurrection so their second
resurrection this time around yeah
they're better position so but i agree
with you i think i think windows phone 7
is a separate conversation there's a lot
of things i really like about it and GDC
the game developers conference is going
on in San Francisco this week i was
there briefly the other day I'm gonna
head back tomorrow and they have an area
set up with all the windows phone
devices out and some evangelists talking
to developers and that kind of thing but
but similar feeling you know I don't
know if it's too late for uh for them to
to really get back into mobile you just
don't know but you know you mentioned
the GDC d know that it's some of the yet
to be at the at the right sessions that
were giving zooms to every attendee I
heard about that yeah you know that
that's the kind of stuff these guys need
to do I mean get people on board and and
try to cause apps is every-everything
and that's I know that's got to be your
your response your experience with the
zoom to dad there's just a lot of things
I go to do that I I just can't now yeah
I wish it was an app for that right
right right and that makes me you know i
actually i have a barnes &amp;amp; noble nook
color on loan from those guys and
relative to what it is and i tend to get
all excited about you know that's a $42
computer I don't care if it crashes
every 10 minutes is 40 bucks but the nut
color i think is actually pretty
interesting you know for 200 bucks
especially if you read a lot you know
and it's got the store built right in
there it's so easy to just you know
spend money on magazines as well not
just the books but then it's got a
decent its android-based so it's got a
decent web browser I can keep wanting to
pinch and zoom on it I can't do it yeah
and supposedly an app store coming soon
and I really like that size that 7 inch
size i think is pretty nu rooted it I'd
I'm sure and and you probably reading
kindle books on it you know I'm sure
they'd love that you you I you give me
more credit than I deserve I didn't even
have to root it I just somebody compiled
a honeycomb port that you can boot right
off of the microSD oh that's even easier
she's even easier because that way when
you're done messing around with it turn
it off pop the SD card you're done turn
it back on your right back to reading
you know yeah whatever it is you're
reading on the nuke OS so and and let's
face it this is the kind of stuff that
we like about Android because you can do
all the stuff right mr. all right well
we should wrap it up to stick to that
yeah you know I think we're a couple
minutes over our early limit but first
show surprised if people want more more
review James where can they find it I
met ZDNet the mobile news blog at zdnet
