TechnoBuffalo here yesterday we hit a
huge milestone we uploaded our mm of
video on the John four Lakers YouTube
channel first video went up in June of
2007 it's been almost five and a half
years and my life and my world has been
forever rocked for the better because of
YouTube I think going back to first
video that I ever did the unboxing of
the MacBook Pro I was so nervous I
watched every video that was out there
on technology so I knew how to present
stuff if you look in the video in the
background you'll see an Xbox and a Wii
that we had just come out I positioned
everything just right so it was visible
try and give myself a little bit of tech
cred even though I knew nothing I was so
nervous in the follow-up videos talking
about the he was the Mighty Mouse at the
time my wife still makes fun of me for
that I remember looking at the camera
looking around like hey guys I just got
back from dinner here's the mouse hey
guys just got back from dinner it's John
here and I saw that I had a request from
one of my subscribers just seeing how
I've changed over the past five years in
front of the camera as a person the
confidence that you guys have given me I
say this all the time in giveaway videos
and in general you guys changed my life
you guys given the opportunity to live
my dream those that don't know my story
back in 2007 I was running a marketing
department for a software development
company it was a fine job but I
absolutely hated going in everyday it
was miserable experience the the people
what I was doing was monotonous got to
the point where I hope did I get in a
minor car accident each day so I
wouldn't have to go in not where to hurt
anybody but it's maybe like you to stop
sign and I have excuse to not go in I
started making YouTube videos for fun I
was looking to get a new computer I had
a giant HP at the time it was broken and
I wanted to get a math but I didn't know
anything about the operating system when
I started searching online for how to
use Mac OS there really weren't any
videos out there really at the time in
2007 YouTube was mostly guys getting
kicked in the nuts and cat videos so in
a lot of ways things haven't changed all
that much so it was an excuse for me to
get a new laptop research to get a
camera
and start filming if we're gonna
document my experiences from switching
to math actually how this whole thing
got started and I fell in love with it
my first videos were films with an old
tape camera then I moved to use the
webcam on the old MacBook Pro there was
a Santa Rosa
MacBook Pro I was so proud that I had
that I had saved up for months and
months and months to finally afford it I
was so excited and then when the YouTube
Partner Program came around I wrote a
2-page the letter to the head of the
partner program saying why I should be
submit and I couldn't believe that I got
accepted I'm actually gonna make money
from doing these videos it was a dream
come true I got to talk about technology
my passion I used to and still do I just
walk around Best Buy just to relax there
I had a stressful day at work and that's
still what I do I love technology and
then one day I was almost had income
parity with what I was doing a job I
hated with making videos that I loved
and it was a very easy decision to leave
my job and focus on making videos and
eventually start TechnoBuffalo I'll
never forget sitting I was at a Thai
restaurant with my girlfriend at the
time who was is now my wife and telling
her you know we're starting to talk
about marriage that this is 2009 and
when the economy was like really at its
worst that I was leaving my job in a bad
economy to make videos for a living I
would have paid money to have seen the
look on my mother-in-law face when my
wife told her what I was doing but she
had faith in me she had confidence and
she knew that I had to give it a shot
and my life has forever been changed
because of it and it's something that I
will never take for granted I promise
you you guys give me the opportunity the
TechnoBuffalo staff the opportunity to
live our dreams I wake up every day to
smile on my face even on the worst day
possible when things are going awful I
still get a play with technology I still
get to talk about phones tablets laptops
it is a dream come true even a bad day
at work is a good day anywhere else in
life and you guys give us an opportunity
and I just want to say thank you from
the bottom of my heart I'm a tech
consumer just like you I love technology
when I used to work in my old job I
would spend probably four or five hours
a day just reading tech sites and now I
get to read and write and contribute the
tech sites for a living and it's it's
incredible I never could've been
pageants my life going this way back
five and a half years ago or longer
never in a million years could I imagine
I've had the opportunity to do what I do
today and it's all because of you guys
for watching for your feedback for your
constructive criticism and overall just
for your incredible awesomeness guys
from the bottom of my heart the entire
TechnoBuffalo staffs heart thank you

videos thank you guys for watching for
reading and just for for being
