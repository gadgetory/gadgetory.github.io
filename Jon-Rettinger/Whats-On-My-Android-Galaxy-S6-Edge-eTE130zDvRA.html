her from TechnoBuffalo here every few
months I'd like to show you guys what's
on my device whether it's iOS or Android
so I've been using the galaxy s6 edge
for quite a while thought I'd show you
what's on my phone what amps I'm using
what customizations I've made what
tweaks I've done you guys can share what
you've done and we've got on your phone
and it's actually really helped me
previous videos to see what you guys do
so that's my son Nate he's my wallpaper
hi buddy so here is my homescreen it's
pretty simple sometimes I'll get rid of
these four apps on the side and I'll put
some traffic stats on there sometimes
I'll put apps shortcuts it really
depends so right now I've got my setup
and it's essentially three major home
screens this is my home screen that I
use all the time the one that comes back
when I hit the home button when I see
most of anything on the left I've got
Google now I do not have the Google now
launcher on here on the galaxy s6 and 6
edge with the icons a little too big for
me and I also couldn't have my full row
of 5 so I have nova launcher on here
i've tried to make as look as stock
android lollipop as I possibly could
I do miss swiping left to get to Google
now but just holding down the home
button will launch the form which is
button to be pretty easy and almost now
second nature's opposed to just doing a
very simple swipe on this side sometimes
I'll have live traffic stats here as
well that's why that's a little bit
blank I like to keep things relatively
simple I don't want to be just
overwhelmed by icons and widgets so let
me show you what I've got I am a news
hound I always like to know what's going
on and what's going on serve at the
minute so front and center on my phone
is always news I've got the New York
Times would you hear now you can refresh
it whenever you want and you can jump
right into stories including the Orioles
playing in an empty stadium which is
super bizarre but the Oakland A's have
been doing it for years no waivers
anything
I'm an Angels fan so you'll have to deal
with it if you're in a is fan listen
your time zappa - or i go to get all of
my news you go ahead and jump right in
there you can see it's broken out by
category the magazine the business they
are sports sports are primarily New York
Bay so if you are a New York fan you can
jump in and see those sports they also
have global sports stories as well one
of the things I really like about the
New York Times I've always loved ever
since I was in school are the editorials
I've never read a New York Times
editorial you're really missing out I
love to yell at them mostly I yell to
myself why would you say that author I
disagree with you and I guess that's a
point of an editorial so if your new
title and be sure to check out the New
York Times app they'll give you ten
articles for free and their other
subscription options so check it out
dropcam's would we use all the time
we've got a few in the office I got a
few at homeless we check in on my son to
see what he's doing or sleeping and or
just generally causing trouble other
stuff you probably expect ESPN app I get
alerts whenever my teens are done door -
really like that at least it's in
Southern California delivers food to
your house which really handy I've got
some quick dials - my wife and home some
of the YouTube apps that I use a lot
studio and you've ever used the studio
app that gives you sort of real-time
updates what's happening with your
videos you don't get you don't just see
you get 300 views or 303 you actually
see what that real number is it's way
helpful you mail I use for visual
voicemail Android doesn't have a good
built-in digital voice mail client so
I've got that their camera I have turned
off a DoubleTap to launch a camera here
cuz it was doing it all the time backs
it in my pocket and just my social media
stuff continuing our tour widget that
lets me change it from ring to vibrate
just a lot easier for me some site
things I use vid stats X tells me our
subscription growth and what we've been
doing that day and Charpy does sort of
real-time monitoring
storage what I use for all of my cloud
storage Drive Dropbox wonder I've been
using a lot actually I'm using a way
more than Dropbox mostly because they
give you a ton more storage and it works
on almost every platform and sugarsync
is another backup solution that I use
for all of my desktop files Quick Pick
is one that I use for gallery because
lets me pull in all of my onedrive and
dropbox pictures which the default app
has a little bit of trouble do
so if we want something I can pull in
all of your cloud storage track Quick
Pick mobile hotspot that's pretty
self-explanatory all the messaging
services that are used in for managing
my stock portfolio also see what I've
got here Amazon music Amazon App Store I
don't know why I download that I never
used it I just figured it might be a day
when I need it some of the built-in
Verizon stuff I'm using this on Verizon
1password
is probably the best password storage
app out there do you you should buy that
for if use a Mac use it if you have it
just for your phone use it I forget
passwords all the time and that has been
one of the best things that I have ever
bought I tried the hello dialer it's
Facebook's own dialer I turn it off I
just want to see what it looked like so
I'm gonna give a shot if you want I
prefer the messages app before texting
it's both Hangouts I don't really like
Hangouts or use it all that much other
than that nothing else that exciting
here the rest of riding stuff that comes
with it the samsung apps of course to
New York Times app they talked about
earlier all the Google Play stuff that
you would expect the S health stuff here
pushbullet is absolutely awesome it's
almost like continuity for Android you
can go ahead and text from your browser
from your desktop get alerts
notifications it just makes things way
easier actually did a full video marked
it on pushbullet so you should check
that out
VLC make sure I can play all my video
files I'm a 3s fanatic and redfin just
to check out what's going on in the real
estate market I'm United Airlines flyer
so I've got that on there and the Resta
kind of the variety and stuff the other
things that I talked about and again
this is what my Nova Launcher looks like
you can just see it try to make you look
at stock Android as possible nothing
nothing fancy I'm a simple man with
simple phone needs but I would love to
hear what you guys use on your phone
what would its do you I have I learned a
lot actually by seeing what you guys put
in a comment so please leave it down
below of what you guys use what launcher
you use do you care that you can't have
your row of five you prefer the Google
now launcher and why you know it's have
a discussion super can help each other
get the best out of our Android phone
experiences and I think you guys for
watching hope you enjoyed until next
time I'm jad render from techno Buffy
look the big subscribe button here the
latest TechnoBuffalo videos as they
happen see you guys next video
