TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing of the
new earth Kindle this is the guy that
was just announced earlier this week
doesn't quite have the fire or sizzle of
the Kindle Touch or the Kindle Fire
this is the regular non touchscreen
Kindle that has lost a keyboard it
maintains its same six inch screen size
but it's 30% lighter 18% smaller and
it's got that same crazy long battery
life so let's go ahead and dig on it
alright so here is the box that the
kinloch comes in looks pretty familiar
I've torn off the shipping label and all
that business it's gonna cost you either
$79 or $109 a pending whether or not you
want the version with special offers but
essentially means if you want the ads or
not so go ahead and pull this off and
this is of course shipping right now so
if you want to order one go to Amazon
and you can do that and boom there's the
Kindle so go ahead and pull it out holy
this thing is incredibly light I never
held the Kindle 3 and thought wow this
thing is big and heavy but I mean this
thing feels like a sheet of paper almost
in so light batteries already in there
too which is pretty cool
Wi-Fi only here so make sure you're near
a connection we've got the Kindle cord
which i think is just micro USB we've
got the sunrays coming in here and I
think that's it no power cable nothing
this is all you're gonna get so I will
go ahead power this guy on and it'll do
a full review here let's go ahead and
walk through some of the hardware take
off the screen protector come here
screen hi there you go alright so it is
an e-ink display it's not touchscreen so
you don't have that sort of infrared ass
touch screen of the other Kindles a
similar five way a joystick that we see
in the past up down left right and
middle makes it five ways you've got a
back button you've got a home button so
it looks like Android and you've got a
mini button it's probably no no surprise
that button right there you're gonna
bring up an on-screen keyboard out to
control by and moving the
dile over you've got your page buttons
left and right or forward and back and
the reverse on top big ones and little
ones and it looks like that's about it
there's a charging port there's a power
button I don't see a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack on here so that's not gonna
happen
soft touch on the back actually feels
pretty nice it's a little bit of a
medallist plastic feel right there so
I'm gonna go and charge this guy up
we've got a little charge for a few
hours and I will give you guys a full
demonstration of the new Kindle and how
it works
Sam's keyboard so your guys gonna miss
the keyboard I don't really use the
keyboard that much I mean you search for
a book and then you're you know you're
pretty much done so I'm think I'm gonna
miss it it certainly makes for an
incredibly small package I mean this guy
can just completely fit in your pocket
really really tiny and really really
light I think of you guys the size
comparison so you can appreciate how
small this guy is so here is the
BlackBerry Bold 9900 a pretty small
phone in its own right see already this
thing quite small and from a thinness
standpoint
go ahead and see how thin it is so this
is the Kindle are you interested in the
version my shadows blocking your hair i
interested in the version with the abs
without the ads kind of curiously you
guys have to say I'm trying to read in
German TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
