sang in from technobuffalo and this is
the LG watch urbane rocking the latest
Android wear 1.3 update which is based
off of android 5.1 point one Android
where's main focus is to keep users in a
loop with information at a glance and
Google is trying to extend this concept
through interactive watch faces which
makes it easier than ever to stay
connected right from your wrist the
update comes with a new pre-installed
watch face called together which lets
you and another person stay close
throughout the day by turning the entire
watch face into a space for sharing for
example if I link up with a friend
through that together watch face will be
able to send photos emoji and more with
just a tap of a button it's very similar
to the Apple watch which allows users to
send heartbeats and doodles to other
Apple watch users as part of the Android
wear update there are a ton of
third-party watch faces that take
advantage of the interactive concept and
they're all available through the google
play store a few of the bigger examples
include bits and under armour which have
complications for things like the
weather your agenda unread emails or how
many steps you take in and how many
calories you burn all right from your
watch face with bits you'll be able to
see a ton of information at a glance
such as your events battery life and
weather tapping on each individual icon
will bring up more information about
that specific complication with the
weather tapping on icon will bring up
the current temperature and the weather
a couple hours from now tapping on the
battery will show you how much juice you
have left on your watch and tapping on a
steps complication will show you how
many steps you've taken with the
underarmor watch face you'll be able to
see how many steps you take in how many
calories you burn and how many miles
you've walked it's a convenient way to
track your progress without having to
jump into an app like Google fit
unfortunately you won't be able to
customize this watch face but it still
provides a lot of great information at a
glance what's cool is that users have
complete control over what complication
shows up in a watch face that supports
the new interactive functionality
allowing you to make your experience as
information rich or as minimal as you
want four bits if all you want is
weather and your agenda just click those
options and you'll see them on your
watch face along with a time you can
also change the setting for each
individual complication tailoring it
exactly how you want alongside the big
update to watch faces Android wear has
also been given support for google
translate that makes it super easy for
two people who speak different languages
to converse with one another if I'm
abroad end I want to find the nearest
starbucks i can simply ask a local
where's the nearest starbucks and it'll
translate what i asked right for my
wrist
after it's done translating I can simply
turn my wrist towards the other person
and show them the translated text as a
right now translates conversation
feature supports 44 languages but google
says more are on the way the app also
requires an internet connection to work
properly so keep that in mind lastly if
you own an LG G watch our this new
update will finally enable Wi-Fi
capability which was left out in the
previous five point 1.1 update and
that's about it if you want to see more
of Android wear in action make sure to
check this video out over here anyways
thank you guys so much for watching and
if you guys enjoy this video make sure
to give it a thumbs up and we will see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
