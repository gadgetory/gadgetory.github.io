to you by netflix welcome back to
another episode of retina schrantz i'm
your host John wrenches to show her a
rant and rave on anything for all the
technology and sometimes a little bit
outside if you watch my videos you know
I got very strong opinions and I'm
bringing I'm each week of this week
windows phone 8 the things that are
really pissing me off I've been pretty
happily for the most part using Windows
Phone 8 for the better part of three ish
weeks first with HTC 8x now with the
Lumia 920 and there are a lot of things
that I love about Windows Phone 8 but
all the things that I'm finding
infuriating stick around me tell you
what I got let me preface this by saying
the mobile experience on Windows Phone 8
has overall been very enjoyable it's
been in a minus as experience but I
wanted to get to a plus and there are a
few things that I am finding freaking
infuriating so let's start with number
one and maybe you guys disagree with me
but this is the way I feel I like to
turn my phone off at night when I go to
bed I get a calendar alerts text coming
in email dings I just like turn my phone
off i know i can set profiles witches
put it to vibrate put an airplane mode
all that kind of business but very
cathartic meet the end of the day switch
my phone off it almost be shut down my
brain and get ready for sleep because
you guys don't know I've got crazy bad
insomnia something that I found actually
helps me sort of segment when I go to
sleep and I always be thinking about
emails not kind of stuff so I love
flicking my phone off windows phone 8 of
course you can turn it off one thing you
can't do is turn it off and charge it
let me say repeat that again on every
other phone on the planet except for
webos you could plug your phone in once
it's plugged in and charging turn it off
it'll keep charging turn it on in the
morning eleven hundred percent battery
life and all is well with the world
microsoft says this is a feature the
feature that is freaking annoying so
when i go to bed now i got put my phone
on airplane mode i got to put the volume
all the way down in case calendar alerts
start digging I just want to turn it off
and I want to charge it it's been like
this since Windows Phone 7 just 18 I
figured yes finally I'll turn my phone
off when I go to bed not true here I
don't there's gonna be one smartass half
its gonna be like hey John would have
fun ones out of bed or do you plug
what's gonna happen then that's pretty
simple it stays off two is enough
battery like turn the phone on and then
it stays on like every other phone out
there and it is pissing me off so one of
the things I love that Windows Phone 8
are those gorgeous live tiles they're
showing information news what people are
doing on social media everything is sort
of coming up right on the home screen
and it makes for a really enjoyable
experience but if you don't have a live
tile for an application as an alert so
you don't have a live tile for facebook
twitter or your email or text messaging
for some reason you're never know you
have something new in there if you don't
have a live tile for an application
you're never gonna know that you've got
an alert waiting for you you can put a
few alerts on your home screen but it's
very limited difficult ones are there
email text message calendar facebook and
a few others but if you have another
application few something like whatsapp
for example you don't have a pin to your
home screen you're never gonna know if
you have alert waiting for you windows
phone needs is a dedicated and message
center something like Android has iOS
has like every other operating system
has windows 28 just doesn't have it yet
it displays notifications wonderfully if
you got a live tile it pops up it shows
you what you've got who called who
tagged messages from all kinds of other
awesomeness there's no central how we
can go to see all of notifications if
let's say you have five missed emails
and some point you open up emails and
you see the other inbox and their length
you don't check it that's going to reset
back to zero and not go know you had
those emails to you go into that inbox
it's just been very very annoying now
these are all minor quips and quips
quibids it's I get that and this is
overall a very refined easy to use
intuitive very comprehensive operating
system these are two things that seem
like an absolute no-brainer to me if I
were designing my own operating system
there's probably two places I would
start with why Microsoft why do you give
and take it the way you're giving us
such an awesome OS such incredible
hardware your partners are making but
why is the software just limited in a
few ways so we take a minute from a rant
in about Windows Phone to thank our
friends and sponsors and netflix netflix

hassle the netflix member you can watch

me windows phone 8 would be an absolute
a plus slam dunk my go-to OS of choice
but for right now I gotta deal with
bings and boobs when I go to bed and I
feel like I wake up in the middle of
night to go the bathroom or something I
gotta check my phone to see what's there
cuz the phone is on and I know it I'm
weird I'm the first one to admit it my
wife will tell you two something that I
would just love to see change from
