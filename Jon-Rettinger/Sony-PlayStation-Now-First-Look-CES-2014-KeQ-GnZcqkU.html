to you by Toyota hey guys Ashley
technobuffalo here in the 360 degree in
the round sony booth at CES 2014
checking out one of the more exciting
announcements or gaming here at the show
PlayStation now it's a really
interesting service that is going to
allow you to use multiple devices to
stream your games on those devices so
let's say for example you have a
PlayStation Vita and you're a subscriber
you want to rent a game like last of us
on your Vita you can do that now is
PlayStation now this seems to be the
evolution of Sony's purchase of guy last
year just a really exciting thing
because even if you have for example
select models of bravia TV sony bravia
tvs if your subscriber or if you use
playstation now service all you have to
do is repair a dualshock controller up
and you're ready to go you don't need a
playstation 4 you don't need a ps3 you
don't need to beat a pretty freaking
pool games do only stream in 720p but
after a little while of playing you
don't really notice it anymore and I
think for that awesome experience of
being able to bring some of your ps3
games over into the PlayStation Vita and
also the PlayStation 4 and even your
sony TV it's a really good trade off the
boat rental &amp;amp; subscription plans are
going to be available and also ps3 games
will be supported at lunch but they
don't have anything to announce quite
yet on those PlayStation 1 and ps2 games
you're going to be able to save your
games in the cloud and then pick up that
same game on a different device so let's
say you save your last of us play on
your ps3 and then you pick up your
PlayStation Vita at some point you can
actually open up that game and you can
play it so that is a
really awesome thing for any gamer to be
able to continue playing any there you
know high-resolution amazing games like
the last of us on any device that's
compatible PlayStation now we're not
really sure exactly when PlayStation now
is going to come to all these different
devices but we are really excited about
the technology and it's still not also
yet known whether or not you're going to
need a PlayStation Plus subscription
however I would imagine with a
PlayStation 4 just about requiring you
to have it seems like a no-brainer that
they might ask you to have a PlayStation
Plus subscription but either way you
slice it we're really excited about
Playstation now I think it's going to be
a great year for gamers especially ones
who love Sony games and want to sort of
ease the transition between playstation
3 and ps4 you want to play your
playstation 3 games you only have a ps4
now or you only have a vita you're going
to be able to do that so it's really
really cool I'm excited to see what Sony
comes up with this year in terms of
PlayStation now that's it for this
particular video thank you so much to
Toyota for sponsoring all of our content
we really appreciate that and for more
great CES coverage plz subscribe to our
