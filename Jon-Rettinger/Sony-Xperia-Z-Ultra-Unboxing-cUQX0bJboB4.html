TechnoBuffalo here if Samsung's Galaxy
mega wasn't big enough for you Sony's
got your answer we are looking at the
experience the ultra this behemoth is
available now thanks to our friends at
Negri electronics
let's get opening up so here's the box
housing these 6.4 4-inch behemoths this
is the biggest phone I have ever seen in
my life and I feel like I just said that
a few months ago with the Galaxy mega so
a lot of cool stuff here to run through
all the specs let me thank our friends
at Negri electronics broken us up with
this awesome phone check them out for
all of your unlocked device needs this
guy's available in black or white we
have the black version this is a just a
larger version essentially of the Xperia
Z which means it's got that sort of
waterproof splash resistant Ness in it
which I wasn't a big fan of with the
Xperia Z and all kinds of other
beautiful things supposedly on this
phone but don't take my word for it
let's go ahead and take a look ourselves
and of course we will now use our old
friend the obligatory unboxing knife
I'll try not slice off any appendage and
I might need in the near future and
we'll see if this guy looks like I'm
really curious to see what it feels like
in the hand and I already hear you guys
making the jokes in the comments
go ahead peel off all this plastic here
we go I would not hold out any sort of
hope it's is ever going to come to the
United States so your best bet if you
ever want this would be to unlock that
is ridiculous looking really didn't
though that's just crazy there aren't
many things that make me speechless
things I talk for a living but I think
that just did it so what else we going
to have in the box we've got a whole
bunch of paperwork startup guide I guess
that sort of guide in Japanese perhaps
and some other stuff we've got a wall
warts but of course whatever country
you're in you might need an adapter for
it we've got some ear buds with a noise
cancelling mic and we've got a sync and
charge port and other earbud size if you
want to see more detail the ear buds
check out the post on TechnoBuffalo com
I'll have images of all that stuff but
this ridiculously large phone is reason
we are here let me take this out as I
mentioned it is a six point four four
inch screen the good news though it's
1920 by 1080 meaning it's got a 342 PPI
gonna peel this off here so get a nice
swooshing noise
I almost said whizzing noise that's a
totally different video
it's shipping with Android 4.2.2 at
launch being powered by a 2.2 gigahertz
Qualcomm chip its quad core 2 gigs ram
16 gigs of storage we can expand that
with micro sd 8 megapixel camera living
right there on the back 2 megapixel
shooter up front of course it's got
Wi-Fi built-in Bluetooth 4.0 it really
beefy 3000 milliamp hour battery in a
really thin I'm actually so really
surprised how thin this is it's got NFC
when I say sort of size and weight and
such
it weighs 212 grams or 7.48 ounces it's
a hundred and seventy nine millimeters
or 7.5 inches which is just crazy I'm
kind of dying to turn it on the battery
is not removable so let's go ahead and
check our honors heat it looks like and
I will continue to do our tour and find
all the buttons that are that are on
here so there is your power button
that's a single button on the side I've
got a presume that's a volume rocker up
and down that's where your SD card slots
gonna go I think you can remove that yep
that is a replaceable on the side also
where your SIM cards going to live under
that one door sort of an oddly placed
3.5 millimeter headset jack living in
the upper right hand corner nothing
doesn't appear to be anything on top
down below doesn't appear to be anything
either also that is a whist or some sort
of dock that'll go with it and perhaps
this is where the SIM card goes in the
other slot no this is where urs taking
and tried to ports gonna live a lot of
hidden ports on this thing and here is
the ginormous
phone we'll do a whole hands-on and
first impression this guy because
they're gonna be a lot of person bretons
I feel like but let's just do a size
comparison here let's say okay what's
one of the more popular phones out right
now it's pretty nicely sized galaxy s4
it looks just like a little child on
next to this guy let's begin oh it's a
large
brother this is the Galaxy Note 2 and
this is by no means a small phone it
looks like it belongs in Munchkinland
and just for fun here is the brand new
Nexus 7 not looking so big next to this
guy so this has been just a really first
look and we'll walk through all the
software and stuff in another video
