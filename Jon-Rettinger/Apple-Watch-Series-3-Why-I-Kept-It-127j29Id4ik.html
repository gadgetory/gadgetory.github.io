watch series three hit and it's either
been this on my wrist or my second-gen
mode 360 depending on what phone I'm
testing and it's been two months since I
last really filmed my thoughts on it I
started using it a lot more and my use
case has changed in the past two months
I started working out a lot more to talk
a lot about it from that perspective and
also software updates have come so LTE
and the uses of LTE are now a little bit
more than they were even just eight
weeks ago so if you're thinking about
getting an Apple watch Series three or
maybe you're debating I'm not returning
yours or selling yours stick around so
I'm like general thoughts on
smartwatches is still the same I am like
a ball of conflicted emotions about it
and I feel like a hypocrite on what
hands I can't articulate the use of a
SmartWatch even I can't even say why
somebody needs a SmartWatch the other
games when I'm not wearing one
I really missed our vacations and you
know things like knowing who's calling
have been very helpful to have so it
seriously you can tell it's a series
three at least with LTE buy the red dot
on and that LT is a big difference
versus the series - the price entry here
is high at 400 bucks before your
cellular plan to get an LTE model
they're getting a lot of watch for your
dollar so the good battery life has
still been incredible I can easily get
through now almost four to five days on
battery life when I travel I'm not gone
for a week on every map and watch
charger with me the caveat there is if
you're using LTE my life is going to
drain relatively fast two months ago
when I made an hour-long phone call only
LTE it went from 1% to zero so now
there's been a few iterative software
updates that have come and that one hour
that extended to about an hour and 20
minutes which is a big percentage-wise
increase so I'm gonna be honest I don't
use apps on a SmartWatch I think they
are clunky I still think they load slow
even though now they're kind of native
on the watch and they're credibly and
useful especially just to pull out my
phone and open the app but they're there
there if apps are important to generally
my app usage is limited to checking
sports scores and generally I just ask
Siri what the score is and she'll now
talks back to you it's still slow it's
not nearly as fast as asking
phone so oftentimes I'm just asking my
phone to do stuff and that's really the
case with the Apple watch so I've been
trying to get this this tub of fun into
shape which is kind of what made me
think to do a four month later video at
the Apple watch I've been using it as my
workout companion it's kind of
interesting so first after being
relatively sedentary for like pretty
much at rest the time I used to watch my
first real heavy cardio the watch asked
me if I was okay I thought I was having
a heart attack which like which hurt me
and also served as motivation but it's
been useful to have you sort of track
how many calories I burned how long I've
been running if I'm staying at home
doing like a Beachbody workout which is
which is what I'm trying to do don't
laugh it's been helpful to see how long
I've been going for how much I've moved
it's also really motive good motivations
try to close the rings so I've used an
Apple watch it's what they use to
measure your movement your standing and
your exercise so being able to try to
close those has been helpless but also
been helpful for me to measure my heart
rate and we give you a range of what
your heart rate was at the lowest and
the highest what I buy the Apple watch
series here again yeah probably I would
probably feel like a jerk for doing it
but again I still like having that
SmartWatch on my wrist
it is by no means a must-have by no
means a must-have companion even for an
iPhone it's nice you can stream Apple
music now via LTE all those things are
there but there's not a compelling
reason why you should buy it
but a lot of you guys are so if you're
buying an Apple watch what's your reason
why you did it and I think most
importantly to that question I'm
actually using it for that reason I told
myself I was gonna work out a lot when I
first bought it and it took me four
months to actually start doing it maybe
I'm alone even the comments down below
and let me know works give the video a
thumbs up we appreciate it hit subscribe
button that little bell notification
experts let you know we got new videos
coming up we got a ton of awesome vs.
videos coming your way
until next time I'm John render
