this is your first time you just happen
to stumble across this video let me
welcome you to the series that's
breaking down the top stories of the
tech world every Tuesday and every
Thursday and it seems like a 1 plus 6
just came out and it did just back at
the end of May but the 60 is on the
horizon it is coming soon and it's
shaping up to be one pretty big upgrade
let me tell you why here's the lowdown
the next one plus six smartphone is
right around the corner with just a few
months to go before the phone is
expected to launch we're starting to get
a good idea and a good look at what this
phone is really shaping up to be from
information we're hearing so far it
looks like the 60 isn't going to be just
a regular small update the changes look
pretty significant with this model
alleged photos of the phone's retail box
seemingly confirm a few of the phone's
biggest standout features the two
probably biggest ones being the small
notch and the under display fingerprint
reader let's start with that super small
water-drop notch at the top with a notch
this small the 60 would be among a
number of phones that are really doing
their best to cut down on that notch and
make it as unintrusive as possible and
this made me kind of a compromise that
many are watching between a totally
Nacho's phone and a notch on something
like the iPhone 10 or the dreaded notch
on the pixel 3xl a does work with face
and lock and will give you a little bit
more screen real estate to take
advantage of on the rumored 6 point 4
inch OLED display that's supposed to
come with a resolution of 23 40 by 1080
making that display just a bit more
impressive is the fact that the oneplus
sixty's fingerprint reader is
essentially going to be built in under
the display or at least that's the rumor
allowing you basically to unlock your
phone by simply placing your finger on a
portion of that screen and the check is
definitely still a work in progress and
we've seen this on other phones and
oneplus as parent company Oppo is known
to be working on it as well in the idea
of a large screen small notch and under
display fingerprint reader seems to be
the crowd favorite right now and does
sound pretty exciting and I know many of
you guys have commented before that this
would be your dream combo so this may be
the phone for you and reports are pretty
confident on what the front of this
phone is going to look like but the back
is where things get a little bit murky
there's a heavy speculation right now
that the Oppo r17 smartphone is the
reference design for the 60 which makes
a whole lot of sense if you just take a
look at that phone one special feature
though that that phone has that the 16
may or may not have is a triple camera
setup on the back but we're hearing
conflicting reports that if this will
actually happen or not but there are two
different versions of the r17 and one
does have a three camera setup while the
other one has a traditional
camera setup so we don't know if oneplus
we'll go with that triple camera setup
or not but it would be very cool to see
if they do end up doing so the sixties
rumor to have a 12 megapixel main
shooter with a variable aperture ranging
from f1 point 5 2 F to point 4 and a
second 20 megapixel camera on there as
well and the third sensor if it is on
there may be used for better depth data
but again it's still really unclear at
this point if it's gonna be on there and
if so what it would be really used for 1
+ 60 is expected to come packed with a
snapdragon 845 processor 6 or 8 gigs of
ram depending on your model just like
the current one +6 configuration options
we have now and we could see potentially
a big jump in battery life from the
current 3300 milliamp hour battery do
something a bit bigger maybe one plus
taking a page from samsung's playbook
but we don't know if that's gonna happen
just yet what we do know right now is it
looks like t-mobile will be carrying the
unannounced 60 officially several
sources have confirmed that t-mobile
will be the exclusive US carrier for
this new oneplus phone and there may
even be a specific model of the 60
optimised just for t-mobile's network
price for the 60 is a little bit up in
the air it may be a little bit more
expensive than the 1 + 6 so it could
range from 529 to $5.99
but we should know more when the phone
is officially announced sometime in
November so what are you guys's thoughts
on the 1 + 60 is the idea of a super
small notch a pretty large bezel list
display and an under display fingerprint
reader a killer combo you guys have long
been waiting for do you care if it has 3
cameras or 2 and will it have wireless
charging maybe maybe not we sure hope it
does here we have a comment down below
and let us know and you could be
featured if you leave a comment on the
next episode of the lowdown in the last
episode of the lowdown from Tuesday it
was a pretty clear consensus among you
guys in the comments that the nachos
pixel 3 is the way to go and it's a much
better looking phone than the rumored
three XL again these phones haven't even
been announced yet but people have
already made up their mind Joshua Powell
was among many who said simply this
pixel 3 knotch
equals deal breaker totally gets and
understand what you guys are saying in
the three XL really has a notch that
large the pixel 3 the regular smaller
one would look like a much better
alternative or maybe Google is just
trolling us all and there's going to be
some new pic
so launched at this event that looks
completely different let's hope for that
probably not gonna happen though alright
