to you by Harry's hey what's going on
guys a mark in Sangin from TechnoBuffalo
and in today's episode of rumor roundup
we'll be talking a bit about the LG g4
Sony's Xperia z4 Apple's iPad pro and
are we going to see two smartphones from
one plus this year this is rumor roundup
so let's go ahead and get started
reports have varied on when Sony will
release a z4 some reports are saying
Sony will launch it around IFA in
September while others have suggested it
might come sooner twitter user at visi
leak said that sony will go all metal
with xperia z for suggesting it will
feature an aluminum body similar to what
we've seen on the one m7 m8 and m9 while
it sounds cool in all it doesn't really
match up with leaked renders that we've
shown you guys in previous episodes of
rumor roundup that is until today a new
leaked this week shows plenty of photos
of a concept of ice which could
potentially be the Xperia z4 the images
do have the Xperia braining on them but
whether it's the real deal or not it's
nice to see Sony potentially trying
something new for the Xperia z4 busy
leaks also tweeted that the Xperia z4
will launch around September which
brings us back to earlier rumors that
suggested the same release date it's
kind of a long wait but at least it
gives Sony some breathing room ah LG
Samsung and HTC push out their latest
flagship devices last month we gotta
look at the leak ipad pro dummy with an
interesting addition a USBC port now a
leak case for the long rumored tablet
seems to suggest apple me go through
with a new feature both dummy and a case
which comes from Sonny Dickson reveals
what looks like two separate ports on
the same device that could mean one for
lightning and a second for us bc
potentially offering faster data
transfers either that or we could be
getting a pair of lightning ports design
for easy use in either landscape or
portrait mode either way it's an
interesting design we're also expecting
Apple to offer a display size that
measures between 12 and 13 inches along
with stereo speakers at the top and
bottom of device we're still not sure
when expect an official ipad pro
announcement but it probably won't
arrive until later this year it's
possible we could see in early debut
sometime around WWDC in june the LG g4
is set to pack some seriously impressive
hardware but it may be a disappointment
in one key department a new leak shows
that the LG g4 is running a slight
the outdated Snapdragon 808 processor
rather than Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon
810 processor the Snapdragon 808 is
still a decent chip packing six cores
and 64-bit architecture it's still
unclear why LG would switch to a less
powerful processor for its flagship
device though it may have something to
do with persistent overheating rumors
surrounding the Snapdragon 810 otherwise
we're expecting some real power from the
g4 LG has already confirmed a 5.5 inch
qhd display a 16 megapixel rear camera
with an f1 pointing aperture an 8
megapixel front facing camera and a
leather back panel for its new flagship
device LG is set to unveil the g4 later
this month so it won't be too long
before everything about the device is
review while we're waiting for the
official announcement don't forget to
shave your face lucky for you our
friends at harrys are here to help now
shaving your face can be pretty
expensive nowadays especially if you
want to buy top-notch razors at the
stores well this is where Harry's comes
in they care about the shaving
experience so much that they bought a
German blade factory to build some of
the world's highest quality blades their
starter kit starts at just fifteen
dollars and that includes a razor three
blades and your choice of Harry shave
cream or foaming shave gel now as an
added bonus you can get five dollars off
your first purchase by using the code
TechnoBuffalo and you can get the entire
month's worth of Shaving for just ten
dollars again use a code technobuffalo
to save five dollars off your first
purchase at Harry soccer lastly the one
plus two is one of the most anticipated
devices of 2015 but it may not be the
only new phone coming from one plus this
year a rumor for from Bloomberg suggests
that one plus could also be working on a
cheaper option as well reports are
saying that the one plus two is set to
launch in the third quarter of 2015
adding that a budget-friendly
alternative is due for release by the
end of the year now we're not sure who
what 1 plus confirmed the news but the
fact that Bloomberg filmed the video in
1 pluses headquarters suggested this may
be more than just a rumor the 1 plus 2
is expected to feature a similar design
to the one while adding an updated
processor a 5.5 inch 2k display and a
bigger battery we've also heard rumors
that we could expect a high-tech
biometric scanner potentially driving up
the price compared to last year's one
either way it could be a while before 1
plus announces its next smartphone the
oneplus 2 may not arrive until fall and
the cheaper
alternative could take even longer so
what do you guys think do you think one
plus is going to release two devices let
us know in the comments down below and
