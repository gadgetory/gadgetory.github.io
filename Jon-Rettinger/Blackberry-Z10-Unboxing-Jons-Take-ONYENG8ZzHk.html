TechnoBuffalo with an unboxing of the
BlackBerry z10 I know what you're saying
you guys already unboxed and that's true
Todd was at the event in New York and it
just got shipped out and arrived here
and I didn't feel right open it up
without sharing it with you guys so it's
the second unboxing of the z10 I'll
share my impression about what it feels
like to hold the phone it has not been
opened by me I've not seen the z10 so
I'm really curious what the phone feels
like y'all purchasing behaves and all
that kind of goodness so if you want
some more blackberry action stick around
so I just felt weird opening up a new
phone box and not sharing it with you
guys so here is the box the BlackBerry
experience redesigned reimagined
reinvented they should say it's small
print is the last hope for blackberry
you can also play a game count the
amount of times I probably say rim
instead of blackberry this is my first
time seeing the phone you know we've
seen blackberry 10 on alpha device and
beta devices but never actually seen the
fool myself so I'm kind of excited
here is the box says z10 z10 however you
want to call it turban glossy on the box
side that soft touch feel we will open
this guy up see what's got Todd Hazleton
fingerprints all over it boom boom again
boom there is the blackberry z10 sitting
in a fake velvet little thing there push
it off to the side first blush it feels
pretty good in the hands but we'll spend
much more time on that guy in just a
minute as much as it pains me I hope I
push it off to the side for just a
moment it's obviously not going to be
the retail package and you get whenever
it comes to your carrier or your country
um so if you're a blackberry fan it's
gonna be a welcome sight you got a
blackberry pouch but no belt hook on
this so dads are gonna have to look
elsewhere we've got some blackberry card
phone numbers z10 smartphone booklets
we've got some headphones so that'll be
a welcome addition with the noise
cancelling mic in there and volume
controls we also have a micro USB port
for charging
blackberry z10 start here
a cloth for cleaning and a little wall
wart for charging but that's not why
you're here let's take a look at this
guy I'm very excited to see this I've
been looking forward to this for quite a
while so let me go ahead and run through
the specs and all powered on so if it's
got enough juice to run so you're
looking at a 4.2 inch diagonal screen
with a pretty chunky bezel and chanted
down here below by suppose you need that
little bit of an area for gesture it's
got a resolution of a 768 by 1280 that's
good for 355 PPI and what I haven't
heard many people say about the
BlackBerry 10 aren't ly mentioning on
the spec sheets is that beneath the
glass actually a heat sensor and as you
type it'll learn where your touch points
are and if you accidentally hit the oak
you hit the P key it'll learn actually
I'll move that over virtually which is
pretty neat so I'm excited to use the
keyboard on here looks like we don't
have enough juice to turn it on what's
powering this is a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon processor augmented
with 2 gigs of RAM and augmented my big
vocabulary word of the day 16 gigs of
internal storage but you can expand that
with microSD we've got a 8 megapixel
camera on the back with an LED flash 2
megapixel sensor moving right there on
the front from a dimension standpoint
five point one two inches by two point
five eight by 0.35 weighing up pretty
nice four point eight three ounces it's
got an 1800 milliamp hour battery that
Blackberry claims and I almost said rim
there it's gonna give you three hundred
twelve hours of standby or ten hours of
talktime but I'm super dubious alright
so let's do a tour of the devices show
it on the left-hand side are tell which
ones which one of these is micro HDMI
and one of those is going to be your
charging and syncing port well I could
probably guess which ones which on the
bottom we've got a noise cancelling mic
right there and a little bit of an
outlet pull the plastic back look at
that in just a second continuing our
tour we got a volume rocker up and down
and you've got a soft key in the middle
I which I believe by default is for
music control to stop the music please
if I remember from previous blackberries
top and noise cancelling mic there is
your power in lock button sort of
located kind of in conveniently right in
the middle 3.5 millimeter headset jack
the back we've got the BlackBerry logo
awesome a soft touch textured feel to it
despite having an all plastic back it
seems to be sitting pretty flush with
the battery so you don't sort of have a
sort of push when you push it in so it
feels almost like the battery sealed and
but of course as we can see right here
and this flimsy plastic back it is not
but we can't see on that flimsy plastic
back is NFC radio also a very oddly
shaped battery through long and narrow
you can see where the micro SD card is
gonna go this guy that we have here is a
mock that I believe has support for 18
T's LTE radios the battery in case
you're wondering is the LS one but not
sure it's gonna work in any other
BlackBerry's quite yet we'll put this
back on so I'm really excited to try
this to use it to learn to operate
system and sanso can't get a chance to
do very often I've been looking forward
to this for a while I'm hoping that
BlackBerry's got some juice left in
DeBary
I'm gonna knock that joke until it
doesn't have any juice left and this
could be the savior that the Waterloo
based company is looking for so any guys
think about blackberry 10 what do you
want to see us cover not cover and all
that kind of stuff and as we usually do
with phones we're not going to rush our
review we'll put the review out and I
feel like I know the phone well enough
not to put it out quickly just to get to
get the views so hopefully I'll get a
chance to use this and learn it and get
the review out sooner rather than later
but stay tuned anything you want to see
feature wise be sure to let us know I'm
John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see you the next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
