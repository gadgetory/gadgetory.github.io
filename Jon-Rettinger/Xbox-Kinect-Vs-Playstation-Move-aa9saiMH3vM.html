TechnoBuffalo here we're going a bit
old-school on the camera angle I am in a
hotel room in Austin on the road for a
few days but I wanted to talk about
Microsoft's Kinect and Sony's
PlayStation Move sort of been all the
buzz and all the talk about it at e3 the
circum very divergent motion controls
for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 so
let me recap what both these are and if
you haven't seen the full III keynote
recap video I'll put them down below
which evidently is right in my pants so
you can check them out but Microsoft's
Kinect began its life as project natal
it essentially is a motion capture
system it uses a series of cameras and
lenses to track your motion which
initially translates into you be enough
controller so we're talking complete
controllers gaming when you see somebody
do it it looks very Minority Report s
you're waving at the camera moving
things around actually there stands and
recognizes your whole body and from the
videos that I've seen does it quite well
and I can have up to four people that
can come in and play so what does this
mean well for right now in sort of the
short term it's gonna be mostly those
sort of gimmicky sports games so you can
you know you can box and you can punch
they've got some dancing games where you
can dance and the motion seems to be
very one to want it quite true so as you
move your finger just one inch to the
left or right it's gonna recognize that
and it's a very cool way to interact
with your console so what Microsoft
talked about one of these I really liked
was imagine watching a DVD certainly not
a blu-ray on the Xbox and you want to
hit pause you know it's a fumble other
control or a fumble with a remote
anymore you just say Xbox let it know
you're talking to it pause and it pauses
you can actually move your finger around
and scan and sort of go forwards where
you want to be which is sort of a neat
addition but it's not gonna sell a
console for me I think that we're not
going to see the potential of Kinect
previously product and tall for for a
good another year and a half that
developers start using it I think we're
gonna see you store some we asked party
games for a while and it's going to be I
think a bit gimmicky but until we see
how Call of Duty or how halo is going to
work with the Kinect you know I'm not so
sure it's going to really achieve that
mainstream adoption
Microsoft did show off Halo Reach they
showed off the new Gears of War and all
of which were shown using traditional
Xbox 360 consoles not connect a sort of
a separate thing so I'm not sure how
that's going to work and how it's going
to implement moving forward
certainly you're going to look wholly
ridiculous I mean playing a games
imagine sitting in front of your console
and you're sitting upon your TV here's
your shoot things around but your
neighbors are coming by and seeing you
and doing a little dance
you're gonna look totally insane but
that may be one of those things that
look crazy now and I'm going to seem
completely mainstream in a few years
with the next generation of consoles but
at least for the time being it seems
very weird and very niche in pricing is
rumored to be $150 so it's a very
expensive add-on to an already expensive
console so you're looking if you want to
get the new Xbox and ones a bigger hard
drive and the built-in wireless you're
looking at about 300 bucks another 150
on top of that $450 gets you a console
which is very powerful and can handle
graphics and everything very
impressively but it's not really that
forward-looking now it doesn't have the
blu-ray capabilities but you are getting
sort of a lot more in the package I'm a
big Xbox 360 fan I have one that loved
the console but I'm very curious to how
connected when it integrates work in
that whole ecosystem I will say that
I've been extremely impressed with xbox
alive I think for me that's what sells
the console so let's move off of Xbox
now and let's talk about Sony's new
PlayStation Move it essentially looks
like a Wii MotionPlus a little bulb on
the top this is a traditional controller
motion sensor so you've got a controller
you've got a little add-on which is sort
of like a nunchuck and you can control
your games that way this is very
familiar to people we've seen it with
the Wii you know for four years now it's
more exact motion so you get more true
one to one and also conserve ax work in
a sixaxis motion so not just left and
right forward and back in quarters can
sense all of your proximity this is sort
of a more traditional approach is
probably a bit more safe on Sony's part
I think Microsoft is taking you very big
risk either Kinect is going to catch on
and be the next big thing and define
console games as we know it or it's
going to completely fizzle out the Sony
PlayStation Move
is more of a more of a sure thing people
are used to we they see people hold our
Wii Remote some people hold the Nunchuk
we've got those backwards and people are
more familiar interface the gaming is
dect I could expect their peripherals we
can plug it in use it as a gun there be
I'm sure the lightsaber games not kind
of stuff or we can use in Motion Plus
and it's a much less expensive
proposition coming in at just about 30
bucks for the Move controller although
the evil add-ons going to be a bit extra
so why on one hand I think Microsoft is
experimenting with a perhaps a paradigm
shift in how video games are consumed on
the other hand I think Sony is going
with the more traditional consumer
approach and I think this sort of
reversed and what we saw with the
consoles launched I think when the
PlayStation 3 launched it was first with
a blu-ray player at removable hard drive
it's all out there operating systems on
it it was a really true next-generation
console and it was more than what people
are looking for at the time I think
that's why its initial sales numbers
were a bit low and it served as the
console involved and sort of thing that
the PlayStation 3 had became more
mainstream sort of the adoption rate we
don't went from very flat to going
straight up IV Xbox on there on the
other hand it was a more traditional
console used the DVD format people were
used to developers already knew how to
use it it was a little bit less
expensive you didn't get necessarily all
the features that you could get with the
PlayStation 3 but what people were used
to and now we've sort of seen those
things completely switch on their heads
so for my money I'm certainly going to
try Kinect although I am very very very
skeptical that maybe I'm buying $150 of
you know remote list access to my
television I don't have to sort of what
things if I want to watch a DVD place
you can move some games seems a bit more
sure you know how it's going to work you
want that or picking one up you know how
it's going to function you know it's
going to work well it's going to be true
one to one and it's gonna be able to you
know point a tennis game with it
so you know that's my take on I'm
curious to what you guys think you agree
or disagree am i way off do you think
that Kinect is going to be the next big
thing are you willing to shout they
actually hundred fifty bucks for it you
know really just kind of interested to
hear you know your guys take on
everything anyway
