folks at LastPass what's going on
Internet I am John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo
wherever you are you are having a nice
day Apple watch series for my thoughts
and opinions have changed as I continue
to use it so if you didn't see our for
you the Apple watch will link it down
below in up top I'm not gonna recap the
full review but just for an update I'm
rockin the Space Gray aluminum case with
the black sport band so the Apple watch
series for it got thinner and Apple
Shrunk the battery life and their
initial review I said battery life
wasn't as good as series 3 since
software updates have hit actually pair
life has gotten awesome for me I can get
almost 2 to 3 days on the Apple watch
series 4 which is been absolutely
awesome I do have the LTE version I was
super pumped initially about the raise
to talk to Siri kind of thing as it
turns out in practice it is spotty and
hasn't worked as well as I'd expect
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
work sometimes it turns itself on for no
reason that I found to be a little bit
on the annoying side with the screen
being 30% bigger here I had hoped it
could be used for more than
notifications I thought that maybe when
links came in I could look at them I
could maybe view pictures that is not
really been the case here it is still
essentially a notification machine but
it is the best notification machine that
I've used but do you think Apple is
missing a huge opportunity to have an
app store for watch faces be able to
customize it how you want and all
fairness apples got a lot of awesome
ones but I haven't found a watch face
that gives me everything that I want
that is one area where I think where OS
has definitely has the advantage and not
really negatives but there are still
some things I wish the Apple watch would
have I've talked really publicly about
battling insomnia this morning alone I
was up at 3:30 in the morning I would
love to have some sort of first party
sleep tracking built into the watch it
also since it displays OLED and battery
life has improved I would like to see
some sort of always-on display the race
to waken all fairness does work well and
it usually works pretty quickly but
having the option to turn it on or off I
think would be really nice to have the
last kind of knock on the Apple watch so
I get to all the positive has been
serious shortcoming on tennis Mac
I set up a ton of them but using them on
the watch is totally useless so for
example when I'm leaving work I have one
set up to tell my wife I'm leaving work
it sends your text message and it makes
it a lot easier for me if I try to do it
from my Apple watch it's not a seamless
process I wish there was more
integration between series shortcuts and
the Apple those are really the only
negatives that I've had I love the Apple
watch it is not coming off my wrist
Apple made some other changes too they
move the speaker to the other side of
the watch from where it was and that is
made the speaker really loud in fact I
can use it people might look at me weird
but I can make phone calls when I'm out
in public and I can clearly hear the
person whereas before I couldn't hear it
that always cancelling mics also do a
really good job people sometimes can't
even tell that I'm talking to them on my
watch another kind of gimmicky feature
this is just software not exclusive to
the series for that I'm using way more
than I thought
is walkie talkie essentially it sets up
a FaceTime audio call from watch to
watch I love using it my wife uses an
Apple watch I can talk to really quickly
if I'm upstairs and she's downstairs
it is absolutely unnecessary it's
gratuitous but it's a feature that I'm
finding myself using more and more
almost on a daily basis and I'm really
happy that it's there watch miss of the
hole hasn't changed that much it's still
the same weird grid of icons that you
scroll through it has changed is the s4
chip and the s4 chip is really fast it
is a really snappy improvement it's the
biggest improvement I've seen a
processor in any generation of Apple
watch so if you saw the beginning of the
videos but this parts probably not gonna
be a surprise but what app that I do
legitimately use is LastPass and again I
want to give a big THANK YOU to LastPass
for sponsoring this video
LastPass just takes away all the trouble
of looking for passwords remembering
passwords and if somebody has publicly
suffered a bit of anxiety the anxiety of
like getting locked out of accounts or
forgetting things all together it really
just takes the headache out of passwords
but if you been thinking about maybe
signing up there are some new things
that the weren't there before things
like a limited password storage free
cross device Inc which makes it really
handy to switch phones like like I do a
lot and also pass for breach alert and
again I want to thank LastPass for not
only sponsoring this video
but all
so making content possible that we can
put up on the channel it's an awesome
service it's secure it's safe to make
your life easier
check him out so the initial review I
mentioned that I thought the series four
is kind of a stopgap design until the
Apple watch went round I'm gonna
backtrack on that I've actually really
come to appreciate the new rounded
design the way that watch looks I think
it also gives more functionality to the
complications being able to put things
in the corners that you would lose if
the watch went round and I've used a lot
of round watches the Moto 360 second
generation is still one of my favorite
watches that I've had but when it came
to functionality
it was definitely limited because those
were the awesome round design probably
the biggest feature though of the Apple
watch series for was the ECG you might
have heard it called
EKG feature essentially you put your
finger over the crown makes a circuit
and it can detect things in your heart
like regular heart rhythm if you have
afib and all kinds of other sort of
heart deficiencies that you might have
and is somebody whose family has heart
disease in its that's a really nice
feature to have LTE debuted on the Apple
watch series 3 I decided to go for it on
the Apple watch series for it's probably
my only regret with the series for LTE
at least for me has been totally
unnecessary actually when I switch
phones going from my 10 our review back
to my tennis max I forgot to restore the
Apple watch so I'd even realized it for
almost two days that I was just using
LTE on the watch and in all fairness it
worked exactly as advertised the calls
would come through to the watch in fact
battery life was able to get through a
full day on LTE something that I
couldn't do with the Apple watch Series
three so if you're doing a lot of
running and you want to have music or
you want to have the call forwarding to
your watch it's nice to have I probably
would have saved the money if I could
have gone back and just got me out the
watch and it wouldn't have changed my
experience at all with it so what's
changed since the initial review battery
life for me has gotten way better I'm
using walkie talkie a lot more than I
ever did the raise to talk feature for
Siri has been much spottier than it was
in the past and I'm generally what I
want to use through end up just holding
down the crown to activate it if I could
go back I would skip LTE and I would
save that hundred bucks and keep it
my wallet it hasn't been necessary for
me but the moral I don't regret
purchasing the Apple watch series for
and I had an Apple watch series three
and generally I say skip a generation
but if you're coming from an Apple watch
Series three you want the bigger screen
you want the new design and despite 20%
smaller battery you want better battery
life this is one of the few outlet
products I say go for the upgrade you
are not going to regret it and you're
also gonna know exactly what you're
getting here
the Apple watch age 4 still gets two
thumbs up just wish I would have saved
100 bucks on LP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
