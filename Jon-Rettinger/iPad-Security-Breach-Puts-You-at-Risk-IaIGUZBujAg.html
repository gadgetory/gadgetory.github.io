late this afternoon gawker media
reported on a huge iPad security breach
that is going to affect probably you and
I think most definitely going affected
me as well so I wanted to share with you
guys to let you know what you can do and
at least you know what you may be a
victim of so let's go ahead and get
started here I've got some notes in
front of you seen you look down a little
bit so today Gawker revealed that a
group of hackers from the group goatse
which may sound very familiar to some of
you for for naughty reasons goatee
security were recently able to
completely breach ATT servers and get
some confidential information on a
significant amount of a teensy ipad 3g
owners which is huge and certainly a
number of growing and growing on a daily
basis ATT is patched up the issue and
pet dep't security systems and they've
been informed of his existence by the
goatse security folks that was already
after always confidential information
such as email addresses personal
information estimated 104 outside
114,000 ipad 3g users including
top-level government officials
high-ranking military officers and
fortune 500 ceos including everyday
people like you and me we're also
exposed so i want to read you guys a bit
from Gawker gets a bit technical but
it's important to understand what
happened so when provided with an icc ID
is part of an HTTP request the script
essentially when you were trying to
activate your ipad 3g descriptive return
the associated email address and what
was it apparently indeed to be an ajax
I'll response within a web application
security researchers were able to guess
a large swath of IC IDs by looking at
known ipad 3g icc IDs some of which are
shown in pictures and posted by gadget
enthusiasts to flickr and other internet
sites which can also be obtained through
friendly associates whose ipads they're
willing to share with friends and
available information within the ipad
and in the settings application to make
18 theory respond the security group
we had to send an iPad style user agent
header to the web request such headed
identify users browser types of the
websites so serve to continue the web
group to sort of get installous
information wrote a PHP script to
automate harvesting the data it's a
member of the group tells us a script we
shared third parties prior to 18th d
clothing security gold it's not known
exactly whose hands fell and whose hands
are most guilty and his exploit and who
got their hands on exploit as well they
also tell us that it's likely accounts
or maybe we'll beyond 114,000 that have
been compromised AT&amp;amp;T and apple have
been reached out for comment but really
they haven't responded yet this is a
huge and egregious breach of security so
to sort of break down all of that mumbo
jumbo when you get an ipad 3g you go
ahead and activate it for the first time
you have to put your personal
information sign up at information is
set to through at Apple to ATT servers
to verify the account then it gets sent
back with actually a thumbs up go ahead
and turn on the 3g data on this device
such as hackers were able to do was
smooth that and get that information
everything that you said when you signed
up for ipad 3g so for all you out there
who've just got a Wi-Fi version it looks
like you not only saved 100 bucks but
also save some personal information
getting out there i have a 3g model and
odds are my informations most definitely
compromised something I'm definitely not
happy about so i'm very curious what you
guys think about this where is the fault
line is it 18 t is apple ultimately i
think this does lie with apple AT&amp;amp;T just
validates the information at Apple sends
them apples responsibility to make sure
the information is secure and encrypted
she's extremely disappointing and you
guys want to get this ups like you guys
know immediately what's going on if
you're looking to get a new ipad 3g
you're going to be okay security holes
already been fixed with those of us that
got it on launch day earlier you're in a
world of potential hurt nothing's been
reported on whether not suspecting
international 3g owners or if it's just
us and i want to let you guys know this
as soon
that could anyway i'm jon rettinger
protecting a buffalo and i'll see you
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
