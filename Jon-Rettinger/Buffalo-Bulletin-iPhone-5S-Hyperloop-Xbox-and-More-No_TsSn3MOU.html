Buffalo bulletin where we recap a
handful of stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm a couple times a week
I'm Ashley sceva let's go to the board
our first story went live over the
weekend and it's the likely date for
apples next event it looks like
September 10th will be the day we get
our first official look at the new
iphone 5s and the all but official
iphone 5c no official invite to the
event itself has gone out but we're
guessing it will definitely not go out
on September 4th which happens to be the
same day as Samsung's Galaxy Note 3
event because Apple would never try to
steal Samsung's Thunder would they Elon
Musk or real life Tony Stark is I like
to refer to him unveiled his plans for
his futuristic Hyperloop technology on
Monday answering questions about how the
technology itself would work it combines
many existing technologies and it
matches them on a grand scale shooting
passengers inside a pod down an enclosed
steel tube at up to 800 miles per hour
unfortunately Elon Musk won't be
building it himself as he's occupied
with other businesses that he's running
so we'll have to hope some other
eccentric rich guy picks up the check
somebody called bill gates in gaming
Microsoft continues to remove every
bullet point from its Xbox one III
presentation first removing their
controversial online drm policy in July
and now they've announced that connect
will not be required to use the xbox one
originally you wouldn't have been able
to use the console if Kinect wasn't
plugged in but citing privacy concerns
and worries about accidental connect
damage rendering your Xbox one useless
Microsoft decided to reverse their
policy so if we're doing the math Xbox
180 plus x box 1 80 is xbox 360 pokemon
x and y are coming soon to the nintendo
3ds and nintendo is ramping up the
excitement by introducing mega
evolutions for some of your favorite
pokemon mewtwo
ampharos blaziken and other pokemon will
have access to this new evolution and
we'll obviously boast better stats and
stronger attacks will be learning more
about the mega evolution as pokemon x
and y's October twelfth release date
approaches but I think until then you
could look for our very own pokemon
obsessed gaming editor joey davidson to
evolve into mega Joey's guard the wild
card story this week came up after
blackberry announced it would be forming
a special team of executive crack
commandos from their board to evaluate
possibilities for the company's future
Todd Hazleton's got a great write-up on
a site about a potential sale of
blackberry and what various companies
like Microsoft Amazon and others would
gain if they were to pick up the
beleaguered business but it's also
possible blackberry will just ask a
magic 8-ball what to do that's the
