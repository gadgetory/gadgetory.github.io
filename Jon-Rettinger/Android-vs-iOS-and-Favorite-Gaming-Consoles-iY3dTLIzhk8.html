to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone John Rangers and technobuffalo
here welcome back there pisode of ask
the Buffaloes to show we could ask me
any question you've gone from the world
of technology and sometimes outside gas
or what smartphone you should get donor
what tablet to come up not you a game
console you should pick up not your
wines a new piece is to show where you
can ask of this week we talked about
game consoles smartwatches what's next
for TechnoBuffalo and is Apple losing
their edge you might even argue if they
ever had it that's the Buffalo start
asking the Buffalo first question comes
from our friend Josh us hey John which
of the current generation of consoles do
you own if you own more than one which
one to use the most I own all three of
them so that's the ps4 wii u and xbox
one now the sad truth is I got a kid at
home I don't have that much time to play
video games usually I get like an hour
to an hour and a half at night after you
put the baby to bed where it's sort of
just able to be me and my wife we could
just have dinner so honestly I use the
game consoles a lot but not for games I
use the xbox one to mostly stream
netflix download movies and watch TV
shows and I might be in the minority
here but I use connect all the time I
just talked to it in fact and I love
doing this to people xbox on xbox select
xbox video and that's what I do every
day and I launch my xbox video and we
just stream all kinds of stuff so I
think it's great i just connect all the
time if i was gonna play games i
probably game on the ps4 but don't get
that much time so xbox one's by go to
console next question comes from at i am
fam 143 us at john for laker your
SmartWatch is worth having right now so
that's kind of a double-edged answer so
I'm wearing a pebble steel outside of
the pebble steel I really don't think so
we gave the Android wear watches some of
our Louis should use we've given almost
anything ever not say it's watches
themselves or bad up the software it's
just nothing that it does right now a
few months that might improve so if you
want to sort of bet on the future yet
pick up Android wear but right now I
don't think they do that much at all i
like the pebble steel for notifications
but i could very easily live without it
for thinking about a way
spend your money and just kind of
itching to buy something I'd say it for
a few more months neither see what
happens to Android wear or see what
Apple does we stopped the questions for
a quick second thank our friends at
Dollar Shave Club look at this face
obviously hate shaving for a multitude
of reasons but mostly because I don't
like going places you gotta go to the
store you gotta ask the pimply guy for
the key to the plastic raise your thing
and you shell out just a crazy amount of
money for razors that do things you
don't need like they got Dyson style
roll the balls on it later put it on the
other end my razor worked fine before
any of that but fortunately there's a
company it's making it way easier for
dudes like me get away all that
ridiculousness and it's called dollar
shape up and they make it stupid simple
there's a few bucks a month Dollar Shave
Club ships pretty awesome polity razors
and other bathrooms stuff right to your
door and the blades are just as good as
a big shaved companies at a fraction of
the price so you can save time but you
could save money we've also got cool
other shaving stuff like dr. covered
easy shea butter to make your shave even
more buttery smooth but also develop you
shape it out if you want and grew like a
cool a chinstrap make it look like got a
helmet on anyway shave time shave money
join now at Dollar Shave Club calm /
technobuffalo the question comes from
underscore n la rue 2000 underscore a
lot of underscores at John for lakers
what is key to development of the
business or channel or to any channel
for that matter ashtag ask the Buffalo
so for our channel we are moving to a
new office middle of sep tember ish
early October we will have a full
functioning studio which would make life
way easier though it's not going to be
probably full and functioning until like
probably close to November hoping
that'll sort of up our quality thanks
for the videos look I'm a professional
be able to put out more content just
makes it like way way easier for us for
any channel for that matter it's always
putting out fresh content doesn't have
to be the most overproduced stuff out
there was putting out fresh stuff
interacting with your audience talking
to them being active in the comments let
them know that you are sort of reading
what they're saying and taking it to
heart even if it's sort of negative
feedback so sometimes can be very
helpful to go but up danger questions
our last question comes from at Leo the
Lion 96 who asked at John for lakers
with Android overtaking iOS and usage
according to some reports do you think
apple is starting to slowly lose its
touch so here's an interesting question
think about from business perspective
take all the the fanboy us out of it
apple sucks Android suck so ever you
might think from an average consumer
they don't care about the os's most
consumers don't have any lead into one
way or another walking into a carrier
which is where most phones are bought
and a lot of people are very price
conscious so there's a lot of variety in
price on the Android side you've got
stuff that ranges from free all the way
up to a couple hundred dollars and some
even higher if you want to go
unsubsidized there's a huge huge huge
variance in the Android world and if
you're not price conscious than your
feature conscious maybe you want a
bigger size phone then you've got served
again Android offers those options Apple
sufficiently offered one phone now they
offer to same screen size and relatively
similar specs a for some design of the
hardware and in touch ID and some camera
changes it hasn't been that much advance
I think people that go in and buy an
iphone already know that they wanted to
go in and get an iphone a lot of point
of sale stuff is sort of forcing people
or serve giving them suggestion maybe
they should try android and got two
degrees we're seeing Apple sort of offer
size variants the iphone 6 release
presumably off Versailles variants a
iphone 6 4.7 and 5.5 so recapture some
of that marked it also wouldn't be
surprised to see the iphone 5s to ground
at a very very low price points or walk
into an apple store now and say we have
phones on the cheap and that our iOS
we've blown expensive and that our iOS
we have a variant screen sizes too but
the experience is still going to be the
same across those devices I think that's
really accounted for why Apple a service
mark the church slowly start q2 client I
think when it first launched 2007
everybody wants for one it was new
touchy was on screen keyboard android
wasn't quite up to par yet and you saw
android sort of come up to even with iOS
and then a lot of ways start to pass it
and consumers are starting to realize
now that ok movie started to pass it
coming off to your contracts and they're
seeing sort of what android can't offer
now and that's why we're trying to see
the sort of tides turn a little bit i
will see the apples got tricks up their
sleeve for iOS 8 that we don't know yet
new hardware hopefully should be nice
but that's sort of going to be answered
over the next probably 6ish weeks I'm
excited one of you guys are to leave the
questions and comments right down below
if you guys want to see anything else
then ask the Buffalo you want a question
feature though in next week's episode
every Tuesday we put up a call to
questions on technobuffalo com just
leave
your question in the comments although I
send it to us on twitter there at
technobuffalo or at john for lakers
until next time i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo i'll see you guys next
