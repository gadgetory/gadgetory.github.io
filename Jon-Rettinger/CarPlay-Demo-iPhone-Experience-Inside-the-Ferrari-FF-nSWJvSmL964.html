to you by go daddy what's up everyone
John renter from TechnoBuffalo here it
was last year that Apple unveiled iOS in
the car is now finally here production
ready and dubbed carplay the idea is
that it's going to be an intuitive
interface that iOS users are going to
easily recognize to help increase safety
and reduce distractions we are at
Ferrari of all places taking a look at
car poi and a gorgeous FF we are with
Curt from Apple who's going to give us a
demonstration of car play Curt thank you
very much absolutely so we have the
Ferrari FF which is an 8 been enabled
for car play underneath here we have an
iPhone which is plugged into the Ferrari
FF I'll go and turn this on and so this
is what's going to be powering the car
play experience do you need to separate
application or just plug in the iPhone
just plug in the iPhone ok so - right
now you're seeing the Ferrari navigation
of the Ferrari experience I can press
this button here this is apple carplay
and that's going to switch me to the
apple carplay experience and so what you
see here are very easy to use icons can
be instantly familiar to any iPhone user
you'll see phone music maps and messages
up along the top I can navigate any of
these by lots of different ways so I can
use the the knobs that are built into
the system I can use the buttons so if I
want to click on the navigation button
or if I want to click on the phone
button it works with touch so I can
press the home button there I can launch
an app simply with touch you'll see
everything's been optimized for the car
so very easy to use nice large buttons
the my favorite way to use this I was
using voice and a serie so Ferrari has a
button on the back of the steering wheel
here if I press that that's going to
launch Siri call John Appleseed same
voice and everything yep so he's gonna
be instantly familiar to anyone who's
using Siri John apparently is tired of
me calling him all the time but that's
the phone interface let me actually show
you really quickly again if you're an
iPhone user this is your favorites your
recent calls your contacts
can you show scrolling on it absolutely
so lots of different ways you can just
scroll if you want to you can tap the
arrows again you can use the knob to
scroll through we also have this
alphabet button so you can do a quick
jump to certain part of the alphabet if
you want to as well in addition to just
saying hey I want to call and sing the
name of a person music application we'll
go back to the main interface here you
can scroll through there's options use
iTunes radio your genius playlists all
of your custom created playlists so you
can tap in here and start one of these
as well as searching by artists again
with that same interface that you just
saw using meals scroll and all the
different ways of interacting with that
if you use a different music application
on your phone that maybe you want to
stream via Bluetooth that isn't a car
play app you can still do that you get
the same interface with any music app or
just
i'mso carplay supports or the icons you
see here as well as a number of 3rd play
audio applications so you'll see we have
loaded here we have Spotify I Heart
Radio and stitcher and we've worked with
all these companies to make sure that
they have a great smart fun safe
interface for the car all right so if
you launched one of these this is
iHeartRadio and launching one of their
stations
really quick yeah it's the whole
system's very responsive it's what you'd
expect from sir I owe s will show you
MIPS so showing current location and
when you tap destinations the first
thing you're gonna see our recent
destinations so I've been doing a lot of
demo so you see a lot of locations here
but for a typical user you would see
maybe your home address your work
address places you go to all the time so
one tap and you can get directions to
that we also are really smart and since
it's your phone we look at if have you
received emails text messages with
addresses in them or maybe if you have
calendar events with an address in them
and we'll display those here so if
someone says hey let's go get dinner at
and says an address or meet me at my
place says an address those will show up
here very easy to get to of course you
can type if you want to type in a
destination or just search with Siri
where would you like to go find a museum
once you know where you want to go it's
really easy to get started just press
the start button so then you get
turn-by-turn directions we stop the car

applications like apples podcast app or
these third-party audio apps these will
show up as well right and again very
familiar very intuitive interface you
can just tap on these again I think
voice is my favorite way to do these are
the application it's able to be or the
icons able to be moved no so it's a
you're going to see by default all of
your top applications here right on the
home screen it's a really clean
interface certainly very intuitive as
