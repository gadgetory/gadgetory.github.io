knowing from TechnoBuffalo I've got a
barnes &amp;amp; noble nook color e-reader
android-based tablet I've got a 8
gigabyte microSD card class 6 and I've
got a cup of espresso to drink while I'm
waiting in the background you can't see
but I've got a computer with an internet
connection that's all I need to get a
little SDK preview port style Android 30
honeycomb action going on on the new
crater let's do it alright so in a
nutshell here's the story the nut color
which actually think is a really cool
device in and of itself for ereading
it's got a web browser its android-based
you can do some neat stuff with it
especially for the price and the size
some folks figured out since
android-based you know how to root it
and how to put run froyo off it and that
kind of stuff and when Google released
the honeycomb SDK the Android 30 SDK kit
a developer who goes by the handle
deeper blue a gentleman named where is
his name Rafael brune right here
probably pronouncing that wrong I
apologize I figured out how to how to
port the SDK and do a semi working or
mostly working build of android 30 to
run on nook central or under central end
of color I said next central because the
the thread here is on I Android
Central's forums I saw it on engadget
kind of the same time I said a couple
days ago jon rettinger hit me with a
text message mentioning it because he
knew i have the new color and we decided
to give it a go I at first tried to
install this running off of a class for
micro SD card did not work not fast
enough so I got a class 6 card yesterday
I got it running I was surprised
pleasantly surprised how smoothly I you
know work more smoothly than I was
expecting but now there's an update and
if we go over here to the xda-developers
forum there's an update now the version
2 of the image that has some graphics
improvements and as sound it has SD card
storage which is cool and it can play
some videos from the mobile YouTube site
so I'm going to download the disk image
and we're downloading it to 596 megabyte
disk image so that will take
while and then I'm going to install it
the directions are all over here if we
go back to the thread on Android Central
it's pretty easy to do they've got
directions for mac and pc users i'm
going to max i'll do it you on the back
it's basically just a matter of burning
the disk image on your microSD card and
then what's really cool about this is
that it doesn't you don't have to root
your your nut color it doesn't mess the
new color up at all because it boots off
of the SD card so you can pop the SD
card in and mess around with the three
dot o build and then you can take it out
and go back to using your nook color you
know as you're used to doing it so I'm
going to hit the I'm going to hit the
button on the camera turn it off wait
for the download to finish enjoy some
coffee and we'll be right back alright
so literally like an hour later the
files download took a long time to
download today it's a disk image got it
right here nook honey 02 4.29 gigabyte
disk image I was a zip file about a six
hundred mega zip file that unpack into a
4 plus gigabyte disk image and so now
basically just have to burn it on to the
SD card so here's the thread back on
androidcentral com so it's got
instructions for PC users and mac users
I'm a Mac user so go to terminal and
here's terminal so first step is to
identify the card so we use the disk
oops sorry the dispute illest command
and so here it is the fat32 formatted 8
gigabyte SD card on disc 2 so now we're
going to go disc util unmount disc adds
unmounted and now we are going to burn
the image onto the SG drive so you just
need to make sure I'm not you know I'm
not a UNIX user really but you just have
to make sure you understand and
following these directions doing this at
your own risk if you do it but follow
these directions and make sure that you
know where you know you've got the right
disk your unmounted the right this
you're burning to whoops and also you
know the location you know the right
path to the file so for me I made sure
that the file look honey 02 that image
is in my root folder my home folder on
the mac and that which is you know
basically just the same folder that I'm
pointed out right now or directory i
should say i'm using mac talk folder
same directory let'em pointed out now is
which is the NK directory which is my
home directory for this account and then
that I'm burning to the right disc disc
2 and that's it hit return go and now
this process will take a long time to
burn the file to burn the image file to
the SD card so we'll be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
