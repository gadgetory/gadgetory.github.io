technobuffalo here and I'm back from my
Mediterranean honeymoon let me tell you
what's in store so flows you that don't
know where maybe in care I got married
on august first and august 3rd the day
after i went on my honeymoon to the
Mediterranean we had an absolutely
fantastic time respect a few days
actually two nights in Rome and then we
boarded the gorgeous celebrity equinox
ship it was the first cruise for both of
us this ship is awesome we had a terrace
room the balcony overlooking the water
obviously I was absolutely beautiful so
we went from Rome which is the boring
city is Shiva the Vecchia from
pronouncing that correctly the Italian
folks out there are probably correct me
we sailed to Naples which is where Capri
was actually we went to go see Pompeii
which is super cool we had another day
at sea and then we went to I believe
Santorini next which was absolutely
gorgeous we saw that hilltop town of
ghia which was really kind of cool just
beautiful beautiful to see I brought the
next five which is actually awesome to
have uh so I could not be carrying a big
DSLR but the picture quality is
fantastic i'll put up some of those
pictures at a later date but it really
was just a great thing to have and then
from santorini we went to leave the
island of Corfu in Greece which was
awesome very pretty to see quaint I
really fun to sort of walk around we had
another day at sea which is a great time
if you guys interviewed on a cruise we
sat out by the pool fell asleep and just
sort of read I went through three books
on the on the cruise Rebecca went
through three books as well just a lot
of reading relaxing was really what we
needed after sort of the stress of the
wedding planning of the wedding it was
nice to sort of just get away and then
we went to kusadasi Turkey which is
really cool the turkey was absolutely
gorgeous there the waterfront was
beautiful we went and saw the ancient
town city of Ephesus he has never had a
chance to do that totally worth going
then we had another
day at sea and we went to check out
actually Croatia okay ever thought would
ever go to Eastern Europe we went to
Dubrovnik which is absolutely beautiful
I was floored by the brother Nick it's
one of the Ancients or a protected City
still in the world surrounded by walls I
have to walk around the walls and get
gorgeous almost panorama 360-degree
views of the water just totally gorgeous
and we had a really good time although
in all these locations it was balls hot
I'm really really really hot you can see
I got a little bit of a tan I'm wearing
a hat ran out of time got a haircut
since the wedding you can see it looks a
little bit on a crazy side but um and I
need to have a good shave want to say
tell you guys listen I was I was back
and then after Grubnic we went to our
last stop which was Venice which is
absolutely gorgeous we were actually the
biggest ship to ever go into Venice and
sort of the sale on the riot into this
is really cool to go through the entire
city through the Grand Canal was awesome
I've been to Venice before but they had
an absolutely amazing time shipped off
to Venice per night then we had a
disembark we had a two nights actually
extra in Venice we had a canal d room
overlooking the grand canal right by st.
Mark's Square is absolutely beautiful it
was a great way to wrap up the honeymoon
we were really happy to come home as
well though honeymoon was great to relax
but since we left so was going after the
wedding I thought didn't get a chance to
talk to people about the wedding hear
what they thought I'm sort of talked to
all our friends and family so it's nice
to be able to get back to do that but
enough about that business what's got
the tech stuff I have so many videos and
door a few guys it is swelling up so
your inbox you're going to be
overflowing with tech content we've got
giveaways I have a lot of giveaways in
here ready to be given away I have a lot
of tech reviews coming up I've been gone
time had a chance to review some that
cell phones have come out lock brake
torque for example xperia x10 ton of
phone you is coming also have a new
computer unboxing the imac behind me
it's just about four years old and for
what I needed for or slowing down so
ordered a new computer all is gone so if

when that shows up there's a lot of
unboxing reviews a lot of talking

camera
