buffalo gears up for its launch tomorrow
Tuesday September 15th I wanted to fill
you guys in on some of the changes that
you're going to see to my channel and
sort of what you can expect from
TechnoBuffalo first I am obviously super
nervous about the site watching it's
been so long development and it's been
so long building it that you know I
wishing it to the world it's very
nerve-wracking thing it's like giving
birth to this new site I'm real worried
about being a new daddy I'm sure we're
gonna have some issues and some things
you got to work out but just if you
don't be patient with the site if you
come across anything it's not working
properly drop me a line there's some
contact information that you'll see on
the site it's going to take a while to
get all the kinks ironed out but I'm
really confident in the platform
confident what we're offering and
confident with the group that the site
is going to see so I really think you
guys are going to enjoy it i think it's
going to give the tech audience a voice
i think it's going to give you a sort of
a new platform to get your tech news
sort of get your news in a new way so i
think that it really is going to be
everything that i hope it would be
obviously you know i'm a bit nervous as
far as my channel is concerned youtube
com watch John for lakers things are
going to change a little bit you're
going to see other people put videos on
my channel primarily you're going to see
Brandon LP put some videos up there
ninety percent of time is going to be
just me and things are going to be
exactly how they've been except it's
going to say a technobuffalo intro
instead of anything else but it's wrong
on that you know that occasionally we'll
see other content on my channel that's
the sort of as we give you a wider
spectrum of technology related content
now we can do some other opinions in the
French of fresh approaches I know my
voice can get a little monotone and
annoying at times so now you can listen
to Brandon and LP like I said mostly
it's always going to be me but you are
going to see some other people on there
as well and I hope that you guys
understand and won't understand hope you
enjoy the other pins that these guys
bring brandon is an awesome tech month
it has a lot of good insight and a lot
of expertise that I don't NLP is videos
mando speak for themselves they are
absolutely fantastic and I'm so happy to
have him be a part of
Buffalo so wanted just to talk to you
guys sort of informally give you a heads
up about what was going on and to look
for TechnoBuffalo launching tomorrow
morning we've got a launch sort of
window out of spec decide to go live
somewhere around 530am pacific standard
time so around 83 in the morning on the
east you know give or take a half hour
either way but that's what we're
expecting us to decide is alive of
course i'll make a video and let you
guys know that's sort of the window that
we're looking at I want to just just
talk to you guys it's gonna face to face
is lisa stasi basis we can get staring
at a camera lens and again I want to
thank you for all your support with the
site we've got a ton of launch items
lined up and giveaways we got things
like zune 8ds xbox ps3 dsi is all kinds
of good stuff lined up for giveaways and
stuff so definitely check out the
channel you're going to get a lot of
cool things I promise you with the site
in addition to all the cool things that
we're going to be giving away so guys
technobuffalo calm upset so I'm blue in
the face and now it's time to open our
virtual doors and unleash it to the
world anyway I will see you tomorrow
when I'm gonna do gay with technobuffalo
nothing else I promise bully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
