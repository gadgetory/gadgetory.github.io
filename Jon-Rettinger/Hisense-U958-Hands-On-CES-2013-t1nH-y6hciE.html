go further how's it going guys I'm Aaron
Baker from TechnoBuffalo any be followed
the Hisense videos that I've done on the
site to date I was talking about all the
ones having Android 4.0 well this is a
high sense device it has Android 4.1
also known as jellybean this is the high
sense you 958 it's packin some awesome
specs all around the most case you guys
see this is being kind of a mid-range to
low high-end device in the u.s. not to
say that it would ever come to the US
but that's what I would see if this
device were slated for launch and our
native lands here it's got Android 4.1
here you can see little customization so
compare to see other high sense devices
that we've taken a look at you can see
that the customizations have kind of
gone down a little bit on the Hisense
device with Android 4.1 you do get dual
SIM card support on this device and then
you've got some buttons down here menu
home them back as well the typical
Android look and feel with five home
screens on this device and of course
Google now integration and project
butter integration as well
out-of-the-box applications Angry Birds
let's take a look down through fruit
ninja you going down their profile
managers you can see some very minor
customizations weather and then within
the widgets I imagine we'll see some
custom widgets for the Hisense you 9:58
let's see what we've got
looks like pretty stock in terms of the
widgets I don't really see any custom
widgets there that are specific to
heists it's really a cool-looking device
here a nice blue color
you got an aside volume rocker what
looks like a power button which actually
on the left side which is really
interesting given what we're used to
slot 1 slot 2 no sim card so again dual
sim support and there's your Google now
integration along with your lock screen
and your camera keep it locked on
