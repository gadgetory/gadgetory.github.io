Ritter from TechnoBuffalo we did a video
earlier where I listed my favorite apps
for iOS and I am back with the follow-up
to that my favorite apps for Android
before I jump in I want to thank our
sponsor LastPass making videos like this
and content on the channel possible I
hope you support them like you support
us chances are you're probably already
familiar with LastPass they are the best
password management options available
anywhere on the internet with apps
across desktop for mobile for iOS and
Android and an awesome Chrome extension
as well if you got a password like stuck
to your monitor or using password one
two three four you are in serious danger
and it's time to modernize and LastPass
can make everything just a lot easier
for you they've totally gotten rid of
the trouble of looking for passwords and
kind of anxiety around getting locked
out of accounts with LastPass didn't
have to write or remember or even worry
about resetting any passwords every time
you want to log in they keep track of
all your passwords so you can just like
stay normal and sane to focus on
whatever it is you want to do and
because it's your passwords you want to
make sure they're safe the vault is safe
LastPass themselves never have access to
any of your password information you can
also set up a two-factor authentication
on your account as well which I use
think it's probably just a good rule of
thumb let's say at the end of the day it
boils down to making your life easier
and making your information safer two
things that I am all about easier and
safer if you're not using LastPass if
you're still remembering your passwords
using the same password for everything
it's time to get smart it's time to
modernize check out LastPass you're
really gonna like it there's a free and
a premium version as well so I want to
give a big THANK YOU to LastPass for
supporting TechnoBuffalo supporting the
channel and sponsoring this video
allowing us to make good content if you
care about security and keeping your
passwords and info safe and you should
check out LastPass link to them down
below let you download the apps anywhere
you want so most the time in my car I
spent either listening to audiobooks or
podcasts I like I like my talk radio and
I'm always looking for a new and better
podcast app but I keep coming back to
the classic especially on Android and
it's just it's Google's podcast app this
might seem like an obvious thing but a
lot of people are in love with their
third-party podcasts
she tried what Google has to offer it's
got a really clean design you can
subscribe to podcast you want to stay up
to date on all from in the app and also
it'll sync between devices you don't
really lose your place at all and
probably my favorite things like give me
recommendations so I can pick up new
podcasts maybe I didn't know before so
tell us different date on my sports
teams which is sadly mostly all that I
listen to we get a lot of packages here
a TechnoBuffalo and keeping track of
what I've got coming what I've got going
and when it's arriving is important so a
good like package tracking app something
that I always have on my phone and I
started liking parcel track more
recently there's a free version there's
a $2.99 premium version as well so you
can try it aside if you want to pay for
the premium features but it does exactly
we'd expect except it does it really
well so first it worked with all major
carriers obviously you need that to
function you get push notifications for
status updates a dedicated email address
so you can forward the livery email so
they're always automatically added to
the app that's really helping them to
manually put in track numbers just
forward an email and you're good to go
and listen this next one you guys might
make fun of me for it but I use it all
the time and you should chew if you're
not it's Android auto perhaps the best
feature of Android auto is you don't
need an Android auto capable head unit
you can use it right on your phone and
it makes life way easier ways is my BAE
and I love the fact that I can use it
anywhere I go in a way that's easy for
me in the car I see information at a
glance if you have a head unit that
works with Android auto then this is
gonna be even better
for you I think one of the coolest
features probably is that you can set it
to launch when it pairs with your car's
Bluetooth automatically will go in to
Android auto give you big buttons big
strike points not kind of like fiddling
with your phone and making driving
unsafe reply to messages get access
school assistant it's really helpful and
I'm using it much more than I thought
and I love Android auto so much that's
one of the reasons I've been using an
Android devices and much more reasonable
when it comes to Twitter there aren't
that many third-party apps that are
still working but Talon Talon about Jam
and I've been loving talent for for a
real long time and it boils down to two
words and I'm a sucker for night mode
it's got it
it works well I like the UI it's easy to
use you get custom pages for what you
want to see so you on track different
topics which is kind of why I like I
could track entertainment I got tracked
sports I can track tech just makes
things easy for me to use so talyn's
what I go to work
so perhaps the best icon of all these
apps is Boost for reddit if you're big
into reddit and you know what time the
narwhal Bacon's this is the app that you
want to try and like all of these it's a
really clean design
I like the customizable interface with
different themes or colors get different
subreddit view modes content filters and
it makes browsing reddit easy and I find
myself wasting way more time on the
reddit edge of threads and perhaps is
good for me and good for my wife now I
tell jokes my kids just look at me and
go which is sadly not a joke but if your
bigoted to read it it's an app you
should absolutely check out so this is a
bit awkward I want to put a weather app
in here and I picked weather timeline
because I love it and then what we're
editing the developer was like peace out
we're not gonna be developing and
supporting in fact are gonna pull it
from Google Play so let me tell you
about dark sky so there is a free
version which is pretty full-featured
I've opted to pay $2.99 a year for the
full complete versions I like to support
the developer and I get the panga for a
weather app you know maybe not your jam
but if you decide that you want to opt
for it you're gonna get some really
incredible awesome features it's
obviously a lot of weather apps will
give you local weather in your city but
dark skies getting even the weather like
down to your streets which is pretty
awesome sometimes there are micro
climates and if you move temperatures
change now you know if you should wear a
t-shirt or a sweatshirt it also gives
you all the other information you'd
expect and want like rain humidity in
the heat index you get notifications too
it's gonna rain so that's helpful you
can't temperature cure status bar it's
got some pretty awesome widgets and it
looks really good so can you want to
support the developer you can there's a
free version if you choose not to it's
all pretty good I like my weather apps
they're important to me and I think that
you should give a shot so what they pick
my favorite apps I've got a ton more
flashy apps like if a visually absent I
use day in and day out chances are you
probably know about a lot of these maybe
they're already on your phone perhaps
you're not using them as often as as you
should and I think these are my favorite
apps and I I just use all the time so I
wanted to share them with you but what
are your favorite apps you got to pick
your five apps that you go to all the
time even if it's things like messages
or Chrome it can be simple there's no
harm in those apps that you use all the
time I like to know leave in the
comments down below to let us know until
next time I'm John R Ettinger and
TechnoBuffalo
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
