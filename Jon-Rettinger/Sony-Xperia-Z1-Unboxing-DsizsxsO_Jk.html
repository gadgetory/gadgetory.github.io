TechnoBuffalo here at the full unboxing
for you of these Sony's e1 into the
latest flagship I really couldn't take a
look at this guy I love the Z ultra that
giant phablet iPhone I'm hoping design
keeps filter down to this phone right
here it's go ahead open it up take a
first look so here is the box for the
Xperia z1 looking all snazzy and black
and white you could say it's formal it's
available in several colors though we
got black white and purple I want to
thank our friends at Negri electronics
hooking us up with the Xperia z1
definitely check them out for all your
unlocked phone needs actually where we
get all of our unlocked phones alright
so let's go ahead and bring in senior
stabby and let's cut this box open and
see what we've got inside I'm guessing
that there'll be a phone in there based
I'm hoping there will be a phone in
there and I assume that we've got the
black one here judging by the picture on
the box pull that off and we got more
stuff to cut which is good for my knife
but perhaps dangerous form of fingers
slice that open every go alright let's
see what we've got inside not sure the
Excite take a look at this I mentioned
in the intro I really liked the Z ultra
I'm hoping this keeps the same design
cues of that guy on it certainly was on
first blush feels like it does but push
it off this side for just real quick
second I'll come back to you buddy don't
feel sad inside of the box we've got a
wall wart if you could guess this is not
intended for the US market but
presumably it will come to us Shores
we've got some headphones pretty
actually nice looking headphones with
inline mics and volume controls and call
controls and that kind of stuff and soft
little ear gels and if your ears are odd
sizes you've got extra adapters for you
we've got instructions looks like this
is meant for Germany and then just a
micro USB sync cord push all that off to
the side let's take a look at this guy
that's slide it out of its package go
ahead and power it on it will run
through these specs good P let's
cryptograph boom the phone feels really
nice a hands Sony's if I had that really
premium feel for a while now so hats off
to them are you looking at a five
inch display it's triluminos all right
so Neal likes to call it that translates
to a 1920 by 1080 pixel resolution for a
pretty baller 441 PPI Android 4.2
launched with Sony's custom skin on it
which is not as heavy as Timescape a
media scape he used to be in years past
this is definitely in German because I
do not understand any of that
although I do recognize them as letters
at least most of them loads just quickly
over there though so and running Android
running Android 4.2 it launches I
mentioned being powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 chip so pretty beastly a
2.2 gigahertz clock speed it does have
16 gigs of storage inside but that's
expandable so don't worry it's got a
pretty beastly 20.7 megapixel camera on
the back and it's got a 2 megapixel
shooter living right up front Bluetooth
4.0 and I've really awesomely sized 3000
milliamp hour battery here it does have
NFC as well as well as DLNA and it comes
in at 170 grams or exactly 6 ounces I
will say I love dizzy Ultra cuz the
screen looked awesome on here in the
screen here usually stop first blush to
look really solid go ahead and see what
kind of apps we're going to have on
board well that looks new I just sort of
popped out what it's known if you slide
that over well look at that search apps
alphabetical most use uninstalled or
installed on the device well that's kind
of a handy new feature I'll go ahead and
scroll Thurman's gels we've got here
we've got Walkman album movies anything
with that round icon it's probably a
Sony custom thing except for the chrome
we love chrome browsers around here
track ID Diagnostics it comes with
McAfee security it still seems odd to me
that phones in security but there you
have it on a ton of other sort of
bundled stuff and some games here as
well including gangster Rio City of
maybe that's a short name for something
but it's on here I make sure you want to
slide over your uncle all the way over
we're gonna get that menu I was going to
pop up what's jumping to settings let's
go and scroll to the bottom about phone
we'll go and take a look at what got
here so it is indeed running Android
4.2.2
at search with those buttons on the
bottom that are on-screen so they'll
adapt depending on what you want
do it's a quick tour of the device we've
got micro-sd here and we've got your SIM
card slot this has our metal feeling
accents too and it feels really nice a
dock connector there presumably for time
third-party accessories or first product
acessories depending on swimming license
is that out on the right hand side
you've got a power button kind of nicely
located and very easy to find below that
dough sort of oddly plays volume rocker
up and down even below that we've got
the camera button I looked at there's a
dedicated camera button not many phones
have that nowadays that aren't running a
Windows Phone 3.5 millimeter headset
jack on top noise cancelling mic and the
rest of that business that you'd find on
the bottom of the device it's going peel
off the back at C this feels like it
looks like we're dealing with a glass I
finally feel as nice as what letting you
know that there is NFC here onboard get
the little N logo is a really nice
feeling premium phone I stood in this
will at some form make its way to the US
market I've already heard rumors oh the
z2 coming but the upgrades don't look to
be that much if you agree with those
rumors so if you're looking to get the
latest Sony phone Xperia z1 looks to be
a pretty solid option thank you guys for
