are checking out the leap motion
controller here in my office welcome to
my humble humble office abode but
without further ado let's take a
hands-on look at the leap motion
controller
okay so we have plugged in our leap so
it's very small we'll have some pictures
you can check out a gallery of that and
we've headed over to leap motion comm
slash setup where you can download the
Windows or Mac version of the leap
motion software it's very easy download
very quick doesn't take that long easy
to set up and once you set this up and
you sign up for an airspace account you
can actually go into airspace so this is
sort of the home based / hub of leap
motion controller so it has all these
great apps games and different things
that you can use with leap I'm going to
show you guys the orientation first so
you can see sort of how it works
so this is where it sees begin we're
going to wave our hand over the leap
motion controller and you can see we
have the screen and it's going to see
our hand and we're going to be able to
move all of these lovely things around
which is very cool so I'm going to put
my hand down so that it knows that I'm
done with this particular scene and it's
going to move on so now we have this
sort of three-dimensional space that
we're going to move our hand in we can
move forward we can move backwards and
we can move our hands around again like
I said if we want to add a second hand
we can do that we can play around with
all these great things
and this is actually with the leap C's
which i think is really cool leap motion
controller will allow you to sort of see
how it views your hand so here's my hand
right here just kind of amazing like
this is such a cool cool thing so you
can see what it's seeing as I'm moving
my hand obviously there's a little bit
of drop-off in here and I'm guessing
that's probably because of the devices
size I probably can't capture as much in
terms of range of sight as something
like say the Kinect would be able to but
still really cool to see it sort of
capturing your hand and its motion
so now leaps going to teach us how to
draw so we're going to we're going to
draw hopefully a TV so what you end up
doing in leap is there's a hover zone so
you can see there are these circles and
once you get close enough to the leap it
registers that as a point so now it
knows we want to touch the screen and
I've got close enough to where I can
have all five of my fingers drawing at
the same time if I only wanted one I
could easily do that um and I'm not even
gonna bother drawing a TV because well
quite frankly it's kind of difficult to
do so you would draw pull and then push
again and you have no idea where your
finger is going to show up on the screen
and that is orientation for leap motion
control so now we're in our space home
and I'm going to show you guys touch
list for Mac so this is a program that
leap motion has put together to allow
you to control your Mac or Windows
computer I use it a little bit earlier
and it's it's a little squirrely I'll be
honest but let's check out touchless for
Mac so we open up the app and once it
installs it will actually give you some
options up here where you can choose
your interaction if you want to disable
it you can if you want to go intro basic
or advanced you can also do that I will
click on the getting started guide so
that we can sort of see how exactly it
works so it can be used to create a
virtual touch surface in the air and
it's going to tell us exactly how we can
use this to control our computer so it
wants
to sort of test out different touch
things so we can see here's hover so it
says I'm in the hover zone and as I get
closer
there's the touch zone right there so
here's hover and touch hover touch so
scrolling is really interesting they
actually are controlled by circular
movements that go between hover and
touch so let's test this out so here's
our hand okay and we have to get into
the touch zone and then we can move the
screen so we move forward and down so
here we are scrolling if we want to go
sideways throw this way and throw that
way so that is how you can move in 2d
space with the leap motion controller
we're going to go to our site and we're
going to try - let's try - let's try to
scroll so on this we actually have to
scroll up and set it down but you can
see it does work so it's it's
interesting it's such a weird thing to
be able to sort of control your computer
this way I'll show you a little bit of
airspace really quick before we go
here's the airspace store which i think
is awesome because there are some things
in there that can be used for
educational purposes like frog
dissection it's very very bizarre but
also a really good use of the technology
and there's of course photo effects
where you can sketch cut the rope
they've got games in here and also
things like air beats where you can play
the drums but generally speaking a very
interesting product not necessarily
something I'm going to be switching to
for daily use but certainly maybe a
glimpse at the future of motion and
gesture controlled computers we've
already seen so many technology advances
with things like the Kinect so I think
this is just a logical extension or
logical progression of that technology
it's not quite ready for primetime
hands-on wise I would say it's not quite
ready for someone to make this their
full-time control on their computer but
overall a really cool piece of
technology lots of fun to play with and
definitely the future in terms of our PC
control and
things that we do so guys it's not far
off it's definitely not far off to have
this sort of Minority Report in her face
like Tom Cruise had and he was throwing
stuff around and it was amazing but it's
now just still on our computer screens
so that is leap motion controller if you
want to learn more about it you can go
to leap motion comm and of course always
go to TechnoBuffalo comm for all of your
