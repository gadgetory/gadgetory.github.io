brought to you by Squarespace
oh hello there cameraman that I asked to
stand there and film me I didn't see you
there let's go ahead and do another
episode of ask to Buffalo this is the
show where you can ask me John Rhett
injure any question you have from the
wide world of Technology
this Thanksgiving episode's gonna be a
bit of a tour TechnoBuffalo office and
that's just wandering around asking your
questions if you want to ask questions
you can send them in in one of two ways
on Tuesday you can go to TechnoBuffalo
comm well the posts up there asking
people to submit their questions you can
go ahead and ask your question in the
comments or if you're more social
network ly inclined you could send your
question to twitter using the hashtag
ask the bee on this episode of
TechnoBuffalo we're gonna talk xbox next
rubric to be xbox 720 we're gonna talk
cellphones we're gonna talk about what
your next device should be I'm going to
talk a little bit about tablets let's go
ahead and get started
all right so welcome to the
TechnoBuffalo offices we're gonna be
doing a full more in-depth tour that
goes through everything but for right
now let's just unlock the door come on
in mr. cameraman all right so our first
question comes from Twitter and user
froggie tech who wants to talk the
next-generation Xbox he's asking do you
think the xbox 720 will be released and
if so when so yeah of course the Xbox
720 is going to be released it might not
be called the Xbox 720 it might be
called the Xbox 4 or even though it's
not technically the fourth console but
definitely we're gonna see a next
generation Xbox
there have been rumors though that we
might see this next generation console
as early as e3 2012 although Microsoft
and Sony have actually both said that
their current generation consoles the
Xbox 360 and the ps3 we're gonna have a
10 year lifespan so we're still about
two years away from that 10 year
lifespan so do I think we're gonna see
it this year probably not
I think III 2013 we'll probably see it
with them maybe late 2013 early 2014
launched at least that would be my guess
the next question comes from user
logically tech who wants to talk about
carriers camping your data
he asks John where do you see the future
of cloud computing moving as carriers
been to restrict users with more and
more limiting data caps that's a great
question
so as data caps data caps get lower and
lower we go from unlimited 5 10
gigabytes 5 gigabytes and lower it's
getting harder and harder to get your
information and cloud computing is a
great example
cloud computing while not taking local
storage does use a ton of data look at
things like iTunes Match or Google Music
yeah you can stream all your stuff you
don't have to have a giant phone or a
giant tablet with you know 100 gigs or
120 gigs of storage but you do need a
huge amount of data in order to get that
string to come
down so it's gonna be tough I think what
we might see in 18 t may have laid the
foundation for this his carrier is
actually starting to put out their own
Wi-Fi networks not only will the end
users get the same data experience that
they've get if they had Wi-Fi or if they
had 3G or 4G connection
Dolph's can get access to all the same
stuff they can do before so you could
stream ken's are you consume it faster
than you could on your 3G connection in
the past so the answer I think is
unfortunately going to have to be Wi-Fi
or care you're going to invest billions
and billions and billions of dollars to
upgrade to network support which is the
massive amounts of data hungry devices
better outfit our next question comes
from Clinton Bishop and he wants to talk
holidays he asks John should I get the
iPad 2 for Christmas or hold out see if
I see an iPad 3 in March hashtag ask the
bee ah
that's a great question and if I knew
the answer to that if I could pin down
the exact date that Apple is gonna
release the iPad 3 I would be a jillion
air with a capital G but unfortunately
we don't know so we could only go by
past history past release dates and
alleged supply orders that we've seen
and we are starting to hear rumors now
of iPad 3 Retina displays of being
ordered by Apple we keep hearing March
and keep hearing March for a release
date and generally where there's a
little bit of smoke with Apple there's
always a little bit of fire so do I
think you should get the iPad 2 or wait
for the iPad 3 well as this is the case
with most Apple products there's always
something new coming out and that's
really true with technology if you don't
like the current generation Android
phone wait for days there'll be a new
flagship there's always something new
coming out there's always something
around the corner if the iPad 2 right
now suits your needs or will suit your
needs next month for the holidays then
get it you're gonna get a great tablet
if you're the kind of person though and
you know yourself
has to have the latest and greatest than
yet wait and get the product right at
release but who knows what it's going to
be feels what the price is going to be
what carriers might have it the general
rule that I tell people is if you're
happy with the current device then go
ahead and get it when you need it
because you just never know what might
be coming out refreshing our next
question comes from user amp to 206 who
also wants a sort of talk iPad he asked
John what do you feel is the best
alternative to the iPad well what I feel
is the best alternative to the iPad it's
been a very little bit depending on your
price tolerance you asked me a few
months ago what is a bit $99 touch pad
for sure is not only a great alternative
but in a lot of ways better than the
iPad and nowadays your products are
released it would be the Samsung Galaxy
Tab 10.1 or the a suti Pad Transformer
if you want to wait a few weeks probably
a few months or so we're gonna have
Tegra 3 coming out with quad cores
actually have v core in the transformer
prime so it's really going to depend on
how long you can wait to get the tablet
of your choice if you want quad core you
want that awesome performance and you
want the better battery life for that
fifth core companion core is going to
give you then you're gonna want to wait
until December
we're also on the dawn of Ice Cream
Sandwich coming out for tablets which
we've heard rumors we'll be seeing you
know sometime in the December January
time frame so you know that might be
something worth waiting for if you have
to get something now the Asus
Transformer or the Galaxy Tab 10.1 are
the best truest competitors to the iPad
especially if you need mobile flash and
get mobile flash while you still can
you're not gonna be able to get it for
that much longer I want to take a minute

the tour and the questions so our next
question comes from user Adam ticker 11
and he wants to talk LTE like a lot of
you guys want to talk about he says
I'm getting a new smartphone that is 4G
or 4G LTE capabilities on AT&amp;amp;T at
Christmas time
what phone should I get that's a very
good question and by coincidence look
what I have in front of me I've got the
Samsung Galaxy s2 skyrocket for AT&amp;amp;T
that happens to be 4G LTE this was a
phone that we reviewed actually earlier
on in the week it's a larger variants of
Samsung's very popular galaxy s2 using a
little bit of different chipset than
most galaxy s2 SR it's like Qualcomm
device so it's not gonna be as fast but
you're still getting ready
performance and you're getting a really
great phone the only downside of this
guy it certainly it's not running Ice
Cream Sandwich screen resolutions the
same as its 4.3 inch brother at 480 by
800 but you're still getting a ton of
stuff packed into one device so if we
can let the Box tell us anything here
you're getting 4G LTE speeds you're also
gonna get HSPA+ for 4G fallback if
you're not in one of the very limited 4G
LTE areas right now but the lights on
here you're also gonna get that 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon processor
we discussed and gig of ram of course
it's got the Wi-Fi as Android is
Gingerbread and dual cameras and the
rest of that exciting stuff you'd expect
from a modern device if you're on AT&amp;amp;T a
1 LTE and you want it today this is
gonna be the phone for you to pick up so
if you guys enjoyed this episode of ask
the buffalo it's a bit of a random walk
