any more galaxy tabs for some unnamed
company to sue Samsung into not selling
anymore here comes another what's going
on everybody I'm Noah from TechnoBuffalo
and I would like to thank the good folks
at Samsung's PR agency for sending us a
Galaxy Tab 8.9 metallic grey 16 gigabyte
edition Wi-Fi only to review this is the
latest in the Samsung Galaxy Tab line of
tablets it's like the galaxy tab 10 1
but smaller hence the name 89 it's
available now through best buy in the US
and other retailers who has got the
reflection of my a light working from
home today the dining room light above
um bill will from Best Buy and others
for 69 99 is your retail for the 16 gig
version and it is much like the hailer
am what's up river much like the tab 10
one fingerprint magnet and everything
except smaller it runs Android Honeycomb
it's got an HD splay display dual
cameras and it's remarkably thin also in
the box you get your health safety and
warranty guide your other information
you get a charger with the proprietary
USB dock connector your AC adapter and
then your us that birds modular here so
if you're a world traveler you can just
get a bunch of different adapters snap
them in and out and then you also get a
headset equal to the sampling headset
with a couple sizes of ear tips but
here's the device itself eight point
nine millimeters thin just incredibly
thin incredibly lightweight it's got a 2
megapixel camera on the front 3
megapixel with flash on the back it
supports video chat you've got a tegra
two chip inside the display like I said
8.9 inch woods w x.g I should tell you
that's a TFT LCD wxga 1212 hundred
eighty by 800 that is not the correct
but uh well we'll skip that for now
we'll sign in later and Android 31
pre-installed it supports full 1080p
playback a video with the tegra two chip
inside its got TouchWiz on it so the
TouchWiz panels here pre-installed these
are still loading up waiting on the
bottom you've got your dual speaker
grilles and then your dock connector
nothing on the left side nothing on the
right side nothing on my sleeve on top
you've got a rocker switch power switch
and the audio out jack and if you rotate
the phone into portrait mode the top
becomes the right or I suppose it could
become the left if you were so inclined
such as the magic of accelerometers so
you're going to touch with display or
you TouchWiz UX rather with your touch
with apps Social Hub little finance
widget all that stuff five home screens
off the top going to apps here those
settings and so about device android
version three at one and so officially
this thing weighs in at 447 grams it
feels just incredibly light I've said
for a while that I really like the form
factor of these slightly smaller tablets
HTC Flyer the LG optimus pad you know
these seven eight inch devices and the
tab 10 one was the first you know 10
inch device that I really like the
hardware on because I like the the 69
aspect ratio I thought it was great for
using in portrait mode like this for
reading documents that kind of thing and
lighter weight a little bit easier to
hold then throwing them the first iPad
second iPad a little bit later but I
like this form factor more than apples
for three form factor just out of the
box the 7.9 inch Galaxy Tab even even
nicer to hold I mean even just better
suited to one-handed use and because
it's still an HD widescreen it could
work out very well for viewing video as
well let's uh
oh it's a family channel I think we can
show Charlie Sheen's roast let's take a
look at x-men first class that now let's
go to transformers and get a preview so
Samsung of media hub obviously installed
social hub as well a lot of Samsung
add-ons here oops a little bit of glare
I know in the video here that you're
watching reflection of my tripod
obviously but the screen looks nice oops
I don't mean a copy and yes I did that
everything you would snow of our planet
we were told had been shared
five but the response is pretty good
haptic feedback on on in there as well
you got the quirks of oh no actually
that's fine nirman so all in all you
know seems very responsible all the
Tegra devices have been solid performers
and you know more honeycomb optimized
apps in the app store every day although
we're waiting on Ice Cream Sandwich see
what that does to the marketplace but in
the meantime you know if you're looking
for an android-based tablet based on my
experience with the tab 10 one I I
definitely recommend checking it out and
based on a first experience here with
the 89 even lighter a little bit smaller
and maybe that's more your cup of tea so
definitely excited to check this one out
in more depth it's the Galaxy Tab 8.9 is
the 16 gigabyte version again it's
selling right now for about four hundred
and seventy bucks at us reading
retailers perhaps cheaper online have to
look around check or two on the inside
16 gigs of storage camera on the front
camera on the back party on the inside I
just say that what's wrong with me
anyway thanks for the folks to stay at
Samsung for sending this one out we'll
have much more it's like it's like a
device a day keeps well it keeps the
lights on if you're running a tech blog
that's for sure so we'll have more on
all this stuff including whatever
Samsung is unpacking at ctia on october
eleventh san diego jon rettinger will be
there we're pretty sure it's going to be
the nexus prime or galaxy nexus or droid
prime or whatever they call it the first
Ice Cream Sandwich phone because the
invitation says samsung and google
whatever it is John will be there to
check it out in october eleventh in the
meantime we'll put the tab 89 through
its paces till next time thanks again to
samsung we're loaning it to me i say
they're already like five times i mean
it thanks appreciate it buh-bye
