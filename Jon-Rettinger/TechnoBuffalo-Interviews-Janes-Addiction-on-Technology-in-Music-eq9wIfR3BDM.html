here were two rock legends perry farrell
and steven Perkins I'm more than honored
right now and I think I just wet myself
a little bit smells good though real
nice thanks to start this yeah how did
you as an F I wanted to know how you
feel about the digital influence on
music today well I I don't I don't rest
on creativity you know constantly always
thinking what we can do how we can
record I would sound better what new
textures and tones that we can
incorporate in our sound and as far as
I'm concerned having the digital around
has really increased our library of
sound immersing with uses of filters and
delays it's just getting better and
better and better
the drummer today is messing with you
know those sounds it used to be like
that you had a synthesizer then you had
a drummer you know guitar player well
now everybody's messing around with
digital equipment and sound so I love it
Stephen I and I were talking about how
we we missed you know the tangible CDs
and that kind of attachment that we had
I mean you guys feel like there's
something lost when your download the
song digitally compared to going to a
store and having this CD that Jane's
Addiction CD so I could look through the
lyrics I like the romance of holding on
to something a man-made knowing I'm kind
of connecting own only with the music
but the Liard reading the lyrics and
seen the photos and artwork and who work
on the record and you know that kind of
stuff but at the same time if it's just
a song you want and saw me should feel
good you need all that other nonsense
really looking awful music so the music
stands and other music speaks for itself
what they need to do the talking but
there is a certain romance that I miss
getting in there and reading about the
guys and see what they're presented
visually I would agree with the artwork
the album cover artwork is a long rough
start I would say but you know you can
always go and see the group and that's
where you make the real real real kind
as far as getting the music i like the
idea that i can just hear something that
i like it then i can just have it right
then they're gone it's nice but I would
like to get a little money from within
sorry but I'm excited that there's this
new company called Spotify by right a
Spotify is going to be I think it's
going to return music the music industry
it's going to really kind of prop it up
and raise it I don't know if we don't
necessarily go back to exactly what it
was because it's more it's working like
a netflix where it's a subscription but
if you like it then you can own it
that's a really fantastic inside you can
ask you feel that way about Pandora
things like that I like Spotify right
now that's what I'm talking about
craziest Jane's Addiction story in 30
seconds probably gonna unfold tonight in
3d let's make let's make history tonight
what about the girl who slept on high
school hell the Boxster 14 we can't
tell you sorry that's okay sopa de pollo
it has been censored
and last thing your favorite phone
applications what are you what's on your
phone's right now well right now I've
actually downloaded a bunch of like
xylophone and rimba apps on my phone and
totally would and it's a lot of fun for
me in a quiet moment and bring up the
xylophone and kind of the gamelan Devils
etc so for me it's about you know
instruments but you know what those
things are very frustrating to me
because I want to be able to record them
and use them and until they allow you to
kind of you know if you create something
be able to download it I'm not that
interested because it's frustrating to
me is I want to be able to kind of use
it again de semana de my children play
games and they play games all all the
time in fact so much that my wife
doesn't even allow any more they still
play them other than that believe it or
not I just use my phone for communicated
emails and i'm not a big appetite at all
that's okay neither are mine yeah that's
why i download the music instruments
because that was exciting to me oh yeah
nothing changed my friends fear I'm
making fat yeah I don't know but I'm
doing stuff all day but I just don't do
that stuff yeah okay you're making
awesome music which we're going to see
ya I'm making sure yeah I got it we're
going to see tonight and I'm so
privileged to see Jane's Addiction
tonight here
