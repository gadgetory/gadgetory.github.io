to you by dragon what's up everyone
welcome back there episode of rumor
roundup I'm Rose jon rettinger and the
show title should probably give it away
this is we take all the crazy tech
rumors from the week and I tell you the
four that are most important so you can
keep up on what's happening in the very
quickly evolving world of consumer
electronics of this week Samsung's
looking to launch a 10-inch ml a tablet
Google's we're going to get into the
smart appliance game and we might have a
surface mini with kind of cool connected
like features coming very soon from
around up let's start to rounding them
up like Pokemon Samsung's getting ready
to release another tablet and then
probably four more variants of that same
tablet Samsung's rumor 10 inch amoled
device will supposedly launched early as
next month according to Korea's etn news
and what's happening next month you
guessed it CES is it early January and
Samsung will most definitely have a nice
opportunity to announce the device on a
very big stage no Little Giant it just
it goes all the way there to hear that
doesn't mean however that we will see an
announcement CES just do some nice
opportunity perhaps do it then other
companies do lease now like to kind of
have special press events for the big
products aren't using CES as a launching
pad that once was sources those speaking
to eat en mousse cleanser device will
compete directly at apple's ipad air and
sporting high resolution imola display I
think Samsung makes for the best
displays out there so I'm sure it will
look absolutely gorgeous it isn't clear
that what big hardware advancements the
device is going to feature but if it's
competing with the air in a likely sport
a super thin design and probably very
minimal bezel and you know maybe some
sort of pen support built-in we don't
know much more about what's going to be
coming from this 10 inch AMOLED tablet
but expected to launch Lee see it
sometime in the next month so my house
Ivan nested Learning Thermostat it's
probably one of my favorite gadgets out
there it seems weird to say like I'm
super excited about a thermostat but
it's really cool looking it's kind of
the few haven't seen one it's this
beautiful round device and lets you
control you know the
heat in your home control remotely from
any Wi-Fi enabled device or a web
browser it looks really cool and help
save you cash and energy it looks like
google also has been admiring the nest
thermostat and perhaps want to get in
the game earlier in the week information
is reported that Google was developing
its own nest style thermostat called not
the very sexy name energy sends an
effort to help users save energy and
money on tuesday though we got a first
look at the rumor product in the form of
a series of android screen shots Seth
android police by trusted tipster in
front of the site of leaks who also said
this is a photo of the energy sense app
on display in the google play store so
right now the empty sense a Pierce offer
some pretty straightforward options
including the ability to manually
regulate the temperature in your home
wherever the thing is located it also
offers some self regulating auto mode
our friends android police though
claimed the app may offer google now
integration as well as you can just kind
of talk to it they didn't say that i'm
just gonna be a nap the apps got to talk
to something rather not google is gonna
release their own thermostat perhaps
they're really software that thermostat
makers can put on their devices you know
has yet to be seen but there are other
smart thermostats out there honeywell's
got a few so ness isn't the only game in
town but it looks like the battle for
your wall might be coming very soon so
if you've been loving your xbox one's
connect with your new thought you know
what i really like that on my tablet you
might not have to wait all that long
according to the chinese site WP dang
microsoft was working cut an 8-inch
surface mini with intel bake tale
processor full 1080p screen and even
sensors that consumers to interact with
the device by gesture some wonder what
microsoft's kinect already does on the
xbox 360 and xbox one how was also
supposedly going to run windows are key
although WP dang warns it may have a new
name by the time the surface mini hits
the market because we're hearing that
Microsoft is poised to merge Windows
Phone and Windows RT systems into one
beautifully organic synergistic own
tablet OS hybrid so in practice let me
to launch them or something like that i
would say probably to see the so
students and later is just an educated
guess but let's say q2 q3 of next year
take a minute to think our friends and
sponsors add to drag
they're the world's best-selling
recognition software it turns your talk
into text it makes it really any
computer task SuperDuper easy dragon can
also learn your accent and speech
patterns every time I use it just gets
better and better and better so a fun
side note I used to use drag them to
write all of my term papers in college
if you couldn't guess already I prefer
to talk those able to sit there and talk
out my paper and it was just almost like
magic show up on my screen so it's
pretty awesome for students if you
really hate typing emails and you want
to just talk them out is there just a
really simple elegant system to use I
think dragon is the best food
recognition software on the market
dragon usually sells the software for
9999 but for a limited time we steam
dragon for just 59 99 and forty percent
off also by being a fan of TechnoBuffalo
you will get a free USB headset a free
trial of password gene that says all our
usernames and passwords in one secure
locations don't worry about forgetting
what you set your passwords at
essentially you get over one hundred
forty dollars value for only 59 99 to
try it go to give dragon calm /
TechnoBuffalo again have to give dragon
calm so I checking a buffalo and again
for me as a college student it was worth
its weight in gold so give a shot you
