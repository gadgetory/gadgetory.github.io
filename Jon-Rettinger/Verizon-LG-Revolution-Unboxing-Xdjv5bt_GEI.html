they're all from verizon guys slow down
what's going on I'm not from
TechnoBuffalo com I got the trophy we'll
do that one later it's the LG revolution
alright so for new smoke smart phones
from verizon this week crazy week droid
x2 xperia play the playstation phone HTC
trophy windows phone 7 handset and then
the LG revolution this guy right here to
52-49 on contract available may 26 so
it's available now and we saw this is
another 4G LTE handset we saw this one
first debuted back at CES in January but
available now to 49 on contract so we'll
get this fired up battery twist battery
life we turn it on usually they ship
with enough battery to at least you know
power it up and say hello there we go I
felt a little little tickle so while
that's turning on also in the box you
get a notice telling you some stuff you
need to do you get it's pretty typical
verizon you get your USB cable you get
your charger you get your manuals and
that's it that's generally how verizon
devices go i'm liking the new black and
red kind of stealthy box though i think
that's a i like that look so the phone
itself while it's booting up it's a 4.3
inch display wvga 800 x 480 so not quite
as high res is the new queue HD displays
on some of those motorola phones like
the droid x2 but 4.3 inch 800 x 480 on
the back you've got a 5 megapixel camera
with flash autofocus 720p HD video
capture on the left side you've got an
hdmi port you've got a rocker switch
with that little piece of plastic there
we'll take that off phones got a nice
feel to it nice kind of luxurious kind
of soft grip feel not the
not the thinnest phone around so you
know feels a little bit not bulky but a
little bit thick and heavy I guess
relative to some of the other newer
devices not too bad though on top you've
got your power lock switch which is kind
of it's flush mounted so I had a false
press the first time but you know it's
fine three half millimeter headphone
jack for audio on the other side you've
got you aah and then your standard
Android buttons on the bottom there your
capacitive touch buttons front-facing
1.3 megapixel camera the big news here
it's a 4g LTE phone so like the HTC
Thunderbolt it's powered by a 1
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
it's got Bing as the default search
engine not google so that's kind of
interesting Bing Maps being searched you
know the whole thing you've got you know
some looks like some custom LG widgets
so we'll scroll down here we've got the
multimedia galleries here music and
photos and all that kind of stuff 16
gigabytes of storage out-of-the-box
Wi-Fi of course mobile hotspot
compatible as well some more widgets
here there's a weather widget we've got
a friend's widget for facebook and
twitter and all that stuff a news widget
powered by Yahoo that's kind of nice
with your news and stock and all that
you know everything kind of all in one
place and there you go we'll go to the
apps here and see what's pre-installed
so communication you've got an LG
facebook app you've got mobile IM
Twitter for LG kind of nice actually how
they you know took a little little care
here differentiate a little tiny bit and
put these put your apps into categories
of communication news and search media
you've got kindle pre-installed bitbop
blockbuster you know is this value add
or is this bloatware i don't know but
netflix pre-installed nice to see a an
android handset out of the box with
netflix netflix and that everybody uses
netflix obviously but if you do that's
good stuff desk home Polaris Office
setup wizard so lots of stuff going on
there and you're
preinstalled thing and then I think you
can you can change to list mode you can
manage categories kind of things around
or you know customize the way you view
things so you know people who like the
stock Android are already it probably
turned off the video discussed but you
know kind of nice to see to see LG doing
some some minor kind of subtle of
differentiation there so let's go to
let's get into a website here we'll go
to true hoop this has been my go-to
lately and to last two games rough stuff
with both Oklahoma City and then at
Chicago last night blowing
fourth-quarter leads to to lose
themselves on home out of the playoff
series we've got a Miami Dallas final
which you know frankly I think they are
the two best teams but not necessarily
what I wanted to see anyway so there you
go you know off the bat hard to tell cuz
i'm running a web page i'm not you know
doing anything its network dependent as
well as processor dependent you know i
think the performance i'm just guessing
here educated guess i think the
performance is going to be just fine i
think it's not going to be as blazing as
the dual core phones we're still waiting
for a snapdragon qualcomm to push out a
dual-core phone so the droid x2 with a
dual core and video tag or two I think
it's going to outperform the single core
Snapdragon processor even though it's
the latest version of Snapdragon just in
terms of raw performance I don't think
that's going to matter a whole lot to
most people but in terms of future
proofing that kind of stuff let's do
some tests see how it handles 1080p
video and you know run the benchmarks
all that kind of business but the big
news here is the 4g of course the 4g
performance on verizon has largely been
quite impressive if you have it as i do
out here in the san francisco bay area
so we'll have to check that out maybe do
some head to heads with the Thunderbolt
or maybe send it off I don't know Mabel
something off to John or maybe even off
to Mike you guys might be meeting Mike
pretty soon which i think is going to be
fun nice addition to technical fo
psyched about Mike Perlman joining the
heard recently
anyway there you go it's just an
unboxing so let's let's call it here
it's a first look at the LG revolution
again this came out was introduced back
at CES in January but it's officially
available now on verizon $249 is you're
on contract price available right now
there I am hello and 4g dual cameras
single core processor not not dual core
but you know all the other goodies
mobile hotspot all that good stuff is

with all those other ones i got to get
to the to get to the next one we still
got one more to go here till next time
