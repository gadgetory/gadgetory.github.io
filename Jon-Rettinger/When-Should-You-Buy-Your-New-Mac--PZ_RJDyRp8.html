like me you love apple but you can come
a little bit frustrated with their
product updates you don't know when
they're gonna come and they do come
generally it's relatively sudden twice a
year I make these videos telling you
whether or not I think you should wait
to buy a new mac or what I think you
should buy one right now and this video
sort of falls into that category
primarily with Apple where there's smoke
there's usually some fire in the rumor
mills let's go ahead and fan the flames
and talk about what's coming out of
Cupertino so the rumor mill this year
swirling around two models the imac and
the macbook line not the macbook pro if
you're looking to purchase either in one
of those models i definitely recommend
you wait at least four to five weeks
i'll bring it till the end of october
november to see what comes out on the
imac front there have been rumors about
a full case redesign and generally a
full aesthetic redesign and reimaging of
what the product looks like is
accompanied by a keynote and i would
expect us to have a keynote coming so i
don't think we're going to see a full
redo of the imac look like we're going
to see a redo of the inside of the imac
i think we're finally going to see
quad-core processors which are great
those quad cores have primarily been
reserved for the macbook pro line so
you're going to see a much much much
more powerful imac thought can be a
gorgeous case redesign it's not going to
mirror the LED cinema display quite yet
but you are going to get probably twice
the processing power so i think that's
definitely a worthwhile upgrade to wig
for it's also sort of been the specter
of blu-rays for a floating around so we
very well may see blu-ray we might not
sort of following apples systematic
updates we did with the macbook pro i
think we may see finally SD card slots
built into the back of the imac other
updates that have sort of been swirling
possibly USB 3.1 and the USB cable
what's got faster transfer time sort of
along the lines of fire water so that's
great sort of a faster up and down speed
faster transfer time in the same USB
format that you're used to second be a
welcome upgrade like i said i don't
think we're going to see a full redesign
I think eventually we're going to see
imac mirror the LED cinema display but i
don't think that's coming quite yet so
if you're looking for an imac wait a
little bit and these all these updates
may very well be accompanied by a price
drop which is always woke up and that's
sort of an apples trend in the past few
months is updating specs and drop the
price so everybody wins on that front on
the mobile end looking at updates to the
macbook line and we're not talking about
the macbook pro aluminum models we're
talking about the old white
polycarbonate models and we're going to
see improved processor i think we're
going to see it stay at the 999 price
point like we're going to see faster
dual-core processors and i don't think
we're going to see the mobile core i7s
leasing the map the book line we're
going to see updates to to that I think
we're going to see a more durable
polycarbonate shell and rumor has it
that the black plastic macbook may sort
of come back from the dead this plastic
macbook has really an unexpected
lifespan no one expected this to last
this long seems like Apple is intent on
keeping it around for a little while
longer so if you're looking to get sort
of the lower end macbook definitely wait
a little bit and if you can why even a
little bit longer I think we're going to
see more updates to the map the book
line sort of come January February March
possibly with the tablets were slated in
there there's a real big hole with the
macbook name right now everything is
macbook pro and i think it would be
foolish of Apple to leave that macbook
sort of hanging out in the ether
definitely stick around and wait if you
can see something for the macbook so the
mortal up this whole video if you're
looking to get a macbook or an imac wait
don't buy it right now looking to get a
mac pro or a macbook pro think you're
okay to go ahead and jump on that right
now that models were updated just a few
months ago and there's still really fast
very powerful machines another question
I'm getting quite a bit as regards to
the ipod touch should i wait to buy an
ipod touch should i buy it now they were
just updated so i wouldn't expect output
uh suddenly throw a camera in there just
a few months after i updated the line so
i think you're safe to buy a ipod touch
and a lot of disappointed didn't have a
camera but Apple never promised that it
will do is just rumors like all of this
it's just speculation but it's kind of
fun to talk about so are you excited
about
potential upgrades are you going to wait
to buy a new computer have you been sort
of counting your money and see if you
have enough and you're going to hold off
until you can can get the new updated
fastest latest greatest model or do you
say screw it I'm gonna buy it now i'm
sick a waitin for apple who knows when
we're going to do anything leave text or
video response and curious what you guys
have to say anyway i'm jon rettinger for
