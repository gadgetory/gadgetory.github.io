with a slow dramatic zoom on the
blackberry torch 9850 for Sprint will
this phone illuminate your path to
smartphone salvation find out in our
full review vo comma and Bienvenue
welcome to my blackberry torch 9850
review this is a sprint phone as
BlackBerry's all touchscreen phone
except for this little thing right there
and that's an optical trackpad for you
blackberry diehards this is available
through Sprint for $150 with a two-year
contract and that's the online pricing
after you use your $50 reward card I
think in the store it's 200 with the
two-year contract let's light the torch
with calling this phone runs on Sprint's
3G video network I did a series of
calling tests roaming and in the regular
3G territory what I found was that I
never had a dropped call and that's very
good at certain times some calls would
exhibit a kind of crackly sound or a
muffled tone but I think that was
definitely dependent on the area I was
in or the other person's phone it's a
very loud phone I mean this thing you
can crank the volume up the phone also
has Wi-Fi 802 and be GNN but anything on
the 3G network was actually faster than
my iPhone and that is due to Sprint's 3G
network so let's also talk about the
speed inside what's going on inside who
are the little elves turning all the
gears it's a 1.2 gigahertz processor and
it has 768 megabytes of RAM to me this
is the fastest smoothest blackberry yet
this thing is just a snappy little
Snapdragon and I'm just really really
impressed with it blackberries come a
long way so congratulations to
blackberry that's to you here's to you
rim
single clap single single tear okay so I
didn't have any hiccups the only hiccups
I had was Facebook crashed on me once
and I got this strange venetian blind
effect with the contacts so basically I
went into my contacts and they all
started to kind of give me this venetian
blind mumbo-jumbo but it went away
after I restarted the phone so I haven't
had any problems at all we'll talk about
the screen to you notice how beautiful
the icons are it's a three point seven
inch capacitive touchscreen with the 480
by 800 WVGA resolution congratulations
to blackberry I could finally watch
YouTube videos and not feel like I'm
watching 8-bit NES games I think is a
big improvement those this screen is not
a super ammo LED it's not a Retina
display so don't expect look at that
sorry this review has been rudely
interrupted by a mercedes-benz
commercial overall I love the design
it's very aesthetically pleasing its
sleek its slender its sexy and I really
like the metal backing on this phone you
don't find that on many phones these
days very nice so when I take the back
panel off here I am exposing you to a
1230 milliamp hour battery this battery
is slated for six hours a six hour
continuous talk time what I found was it
was closer to the five closer to the
four hour 50 minute mark it's still very
good battery life and it lasted longer
than the iPhone inside for memory this
phone has eight gigabytes it has a four
gigabyte microSD card and it also has
four gigabytes of internal storage at
this price range honestly I would have
expected to have seen 16 gigabytes the
camera button and the volume rocker are
fairly diminutive on this phone and
they're hard to press they're just not
fun buttons to press
they don't love to be touched and we
want buttons that love to be touched and
now it's the moment you've all been
waiting for the black
very 7os shakedown we're taking it down
to shake down Street okay so first of
all I want to say this is a step in the
right direction I'm really impressed
this is the best blackberry operating
system so far today okay I like the
universal search option and let's just
go ahead and test it out here for you
TechnoBuffalo
okay and look at that John our pops
right up the ambassador of all things
Buffalo all things techno okay so I also
have a TechnoBuffalo shortcut here we're
taking it to the Internet now the
Internet is finally usable I'm really
impressed with it
pinching and zooming fantastic there's
no flash however and I think that's
that's an important factor no flat so
we're kind of in iOS territory but I
will say that Facebook and Twitter
applications and aggregation is
fantastic I'll just give you a little
taste of Facebook here okay and here's
my awesome profile okay it's just so
easy you can see this phone is just the
hardware and the software are optimized
they play with each other very well it's
like this the hardware is the peanut
butter the software is the jelly and
together they make a gourmet peanut
butter and jelly sandwich of smartphone
goodness Wow that was lame okay
and there's also social feeds obviously
aggregates everything together here all
of our Facebook Twitter everything that
you're signed into all into one that's
great okay so this BlackBerry is
actually highly capable as far as
internet standards go as far as social
networking
it also has wicked cool google talk here
okay let's chat up Noah right now
you are lame whoops and okay we're
getting a taste of the keyboard the
keyboard for me was very difficult
it takes a lot of getting used to but
let's see what his response is going to
be I can't wait for this it might take a
while alright we might have to cut wait
for his response and then not come back
you're mean oh I heard his feel meds I
got to go make that better the one thing
that I wish blackberry would migrate
away from is the the antiquated menu
system so for instance if I go into
ringtones you know and I make selections
here I mean and look how anti-glue vien
that is I mean that can you talk about
before the flood I mean that's it right
there say I change a ringtone
okay let's go into evolving aspiration
ooh that sounds so mellifluous alright
let's let's try it
mmm nice okay so now I go back save it's
an extra thing that I have to I can't
just tap save on the screen and that's
classic blackberry though the other
thing is I mean I like the application
tray here the the different trays
divvied up into frequent all favorites
media etc the only thing is look at all
this open space this unused space here I
think widgets could easily camp out
there if they wanted to and you know
maybe that's something that we're going
to get down the line with Q and X I
don't know but to me it just looks like
a lot of open space here when it comes
to applications this phone is severely
lacking and I think that's one of its
main Achilles heels here we go let's go
into app world and this is the new app
world that's really exciting that it's
new
the only problem though is I mean the
application
there's no Pandora there are no Angry
Birds there there are no mainstream
big-time applications here and any of
the games that I did download were they
would have been great in 1995 if I was
into like minesweeper so that I'm not
really excited about i blackberry reason
really needs to do a lot better with
their application selection we do get
brickbreaker right out of here and i
know i'm starting this game over but i
beat this game over and while it was
pretty lame we have a Maps program here
it's just really lacking compared
Google all right now it's time for one
of my favorite parts of the review it's
the camera and BlackBerry's in my
experience and I've compared them to
hundreds of other phones on the market
have one of the best cameras on the
market the blackberry torch 9850 is no
different okay
this is a really great camera I was very
impressed with its clarity with its
detail and its color its low-light
sensitivity was also fairly impressive
so this phone definitely deserves
accolades it has 720p video HD video at
30 frames a second and the bright bright
light is phenomenal low light is noisy
and the one thing that I didn't like
about this phone was that you couldn't
toggle the video light while you were
shooting video and that's just that's
just the main thing the other main thing
is the fact that I had to go through all
of these submenus again to make
adjustments on the camera one last thing
with the camera is that if you slip it
over to landscape mode you get this bar
it's kind of a translucent bar but it
makes it seem as though this is your
frame when in fact your frame goes edge
to edge so that's something that kind of
needs to go away basically what's going
to happen here is I'm going to give you
my pros and my cons pros fast this is
one of the fastest blackberry phones to
date I'm very excited with this phone
it's the first BlackBerry I've used that
actually was not glitchy it has a pretty
screen I love the 3.7 inch screen I love
the fact that it's a little bit bigger
than an iPhone take that and also it has
good calling very good calling reliable
calling in my experiences and my testing
okay great style I love the style of
this phone overall excellent
communication one of the best phones to
email on to text message to to use
blackberry messenger one of the best
messaging systems in my opinion in the
mobile world however here are the cons
blackberry 7 Oh
nice but as I stated earlier anti de
lluvia and too many manual steps on you
space here we could use some widgets so
that is something to consider we could
use more memory it has 8 gigabytes out
of the box I'd like to see 16 minimum
for this price camera interface needs
improvement we just went over that and
maybe a bigger battery for better
battery life overall I think what we're
seeing here is a fantastic phone a good
effort for RIM a couple years ago this
phone would have been very popular
however I think based on the competition
from Android iOS the blackberry torch
9850 is kind of behind the time slightly
so this has been my blackberry torch
9850 review I hope you enjoyed it and
like I said wait for Q and X to come out
code name cult it's galloping across the
screen right now okay so wait for it who
knows what's going to happen for any
other BlackBerry news tech related news
be sure to go to TechnoBuffalo comm and
I will see you guys on the flipside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
