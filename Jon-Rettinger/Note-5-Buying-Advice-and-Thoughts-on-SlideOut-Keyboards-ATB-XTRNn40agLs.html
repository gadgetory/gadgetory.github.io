technobuffalo and I am sandwich between
these two pillows do another episode of
ask the Buffalo this is my favorite show
that I do the chance for us to get to
Chad asked questions you could ask me
about my life technology whatever else
is in between this week there we got a
nice mix of some personal stuff and some
tech questions let's jump right in first
question comes from Matt blamer who asks
at John for lakers my question is what
would you choose note 5 over the s6
edge+ and why to figure out which one to
get ha ha ha Matt when I first did the
reviews I thought all right I would go
the note I would be S Pen is handy to
have least you have the option to use it
but the more I stared at the gold s6
edge+ the more just like I guess the
Impractical timing was just like so
pretty so pretty and I think that side
eventually won out I would get the gold
s6 edge+ that's probably right now my
favorite phone out I think it's the best
looking color of a phone that's ever
come out I think the screen on both the
phones are the best screens that are out
on devices so I guess you could probably
say the best screen has ever been put
out really though it's a personal choice
you think you would use the S Pen then
go for the note you're getting a great
phone unfortunately not available in
gold in the u.s. behavior outside the US
you can get it in gold which case then
do that but I just personally loved way
the s6 edge+ looks and I never use any
of the edge features so ask yourself
that question would you use the note
features if your answer is yes and get
it if your answer is yeah for the first
week then probably I forget that it's
there or I put the pen in backwards and
go the edge plus so I apologize advanced
appreciation of this next Twitter handle
saket said shadi asks at john for lakers
what course did you opt in college I
went to college in the upstate New York
went to University of Rochester I was a
liberal arts major I'm age in religion
classics I was prepared for nothing I've
always been fascinated by what motivated
people and there's never been a greater
motivator in history than religion so
I've always just found it very
fascinating to study yeah the Western
religions Eastern religions to study the
classics and philosophy I just I've
always been drawn to it my time I
realized I was getting in my junior year
I was like you
away from the clearing of majors though
I did that while I loved it it prepared
me for like between zero and like next
to zero so you had to figure out
whatever you want to major in each one
is something like I'm doing anything
it's writing intensive will be fine I
did however go back to school and get my
master's degree I got an MBA so I was
able to sort of learn how to better run
business hope it helped and your
question next comes from this is kyle i
john for lakers what inspired you to
start YouTube tell you the short version
back when YouTube was mostly cat videos
and God you can kick in the balls i was
looking to get new computer I hadn't
used a mac at the time this is back in
like 2006 i think i figured i would make
videos to learn how to use it to force
myself to learn how to use it but I
started to do technology videos because
I've always loved technology I used to
go just walk around best buy to relax
I'm I had a stressful day at work I
would just go and walk around best buy
yeah before I started this I was
browsing all the tech sites i was on
cnet and gagging his moto i was running
a marketing apartment for software
development company at the time I just
technology's always been a passion well
anything ever thought about doing i just
always just loved it never in a million
years i think i could make a career out
of it youtube started to grow there
weren't that many people are making
videos and kind of one thing led to
another and i was able to see a an
avenue to make a business and i ran
through full steam ahead and happened to
get very very lucky i think i was in the
right place at the right time and ninety
ninety-five percent just dumped up last
but not least Cooper kupp underscore be
at John for lakers is the android phone
a good thing for blackberry with a
physical keyboard be enough to set them
apart from other android devices so
black pretty interesting now the rumor
blackberry Venice which at this point is
I mean pretty much confirmed we had a
two minute video some guy using actually
using the phone it is a slider from
blackberry all the blackberry torch but
instead of running a version of
blackberry OS thing's freaking running
Android and it looks like a relatively
unskilled version of Android 5.4 inch
screen pretty close to next-gen specs
probably Snapdragon 10 under the hood 3
to 4 gigabytes of ram and a slide out
keyboard I haven't been this excited for
a phone in a really long time I used to
love blackberry so you get the power and
customization options of Android not to
mention the App Store of android yet
with the puts up play get security of
blackberry so you have blackberries apps
sitting on top you'll have blackberry PQ
blackberry hub obviously bbm you can get
an android anyway plus a physical
keyboard you know you don't have to use
you so a five point four inch one you
could type on screen slide it out and
you can type there but let's say you
don't want to type of that physical
keyboard it's got the same cool sort of
touch sensitive keys they've gotten a
blackberry passport to just use a qwerty
keypad to scroll up and down text never
type a letter on it almost like a
trackpad I'm really excited I hope it
comes to fruition I would use that phone
and I would excitedly and happily use
that runabouts that have soft spot in my
heart for blackberry blackberries had a
rough road and I think they acknowledged
that going the path with their own
software and their own hardware was not
going to success so using Android and
having the black raining behind them I
think if you get a lot of new customers
people that maybe wouldn't consider
blackberry before I think we'll consider
it now but what you guys think you would
you buy the Venice or wherever they
typed all the time I love to hear your
thoughts on it I'll lead the comments
here in this general region be nice to
each other down there until next time
John render from techno buffo see you
next one goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
