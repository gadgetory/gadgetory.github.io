technobuffalo here at a full review for
you under seven minutes of the new
tmobile g2x let's get started so this is
the American cousin of the LG optimus 2x
of course being LG built the highlights
from a spec CM points being powered by a
dual-core Tegra 2 processor with one
gigahertz power on each core android 2.2
relatively stock 4 inch screen diagonal
the resolution of 480 x 800 3d graphics
hardware accelerator 8 megapixel camera
on the back capable of shooting 1080p
and a front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera
scott eight gigs of built-in storage in
DLNA support those highlights alright so
let's talk about call quality the call
quality is not going to be good no
matter what the phone can do or not do
it's not going to work out very well for
you so in my 20 call test I had to drop
calls and I had two incidents of colors
not on the same call asking if I was on
a cell phone the rest of it was crystal
clear and speakerphone quality was quite
loud it hasn't been the best t mobile
phone i've tested but it's certainly
very usable as a phone one qualms i did
have with it is with the 4g radio you
notice right here i'm not pulling in 4g
service with other t-mobile 4g devices
for example the sidekick 4g i was able
to pull in 4g no matter where i was so
if you are any fringe 4g area you're
going to want to try this out before you
buy at least try it out in the store
near you if you are blanketed in 4G you
won't have any problem with something to
keep in mind alright so let's talk about
the screen this is what you're going to
be looking at when you do everything
with the device because it is a slate
form factor it's got a really nice
viewing angle which is one of the things
that I notice immediately about the
device really anywhere you view it
you're going to be able to see the
screen notice that there is a bit of
direct sunlight glare but you can still
see what is on the display which is
quite nice for a big touchscreen like
this build quality feels very nice i was
a bit dubious with some of LG's previous
owns this one feels really nice one
things i like that the battery actually
comes very close to touching the back so
while this might be soft
touch plastic with a little bit of a
metal strip that's not a kickstand by
the way it does have that nice solid
feel to it because there isn't a gap
between the back and the battery that
would sort of make it feel hollow it's
got a really nice feel to it it's not
overly heavy it's not too light it sort
of that right happy medium for design
and it looks good about we'd expect from
an Android slight phone if you were to
think of one in your head I'd have a
screen that the buttons and have a front
facing camera and that's pretty much
what you're going to have here you are
looking at almost one hundred percent
native android 2.2 with no skin here
with very little skin and very little
bundled apps that makes you wonder why
gingerbread it wasn't put on board the
are a few bundle t mobile applications
here you've got the app pack you have
tmobile TV quick is pre-installed for
using the front-facing camera and you
also have something really cool you've
got TegraZone and the 2x here has
invidious dual core tegra 2 chipset but
all the applications in android market
aren't often might take advantage of all
the power so and videos put out their
own mini App Store you can get some
really powerful Nvidia game so our
applications in general so if you're
going to pick up any NVIDIA Tegra 2
device you definitely want to check out
the NVIDIA Tegra zone let's go ahead and
jump back the browser is excellent about
what you'd expect from a modern
smartphone it's quick its responsive
this does support flash and sports a
quite well pinch-to-zoom does work very
nice oftentimes I found on sites that
have Flash content that pinch-to-zoom
tend to get a little laggy this is one
instance where i think the Tegra 2 does
a really nice job there's no noticeable
lag with flash on or off with this
device it is very very very quick to go
ahead and exit headless I was not able
to test the hdmi out unfortunately I
didn't have an HDMI accord but will
presume that that will function quite
well one of my concerns is 4g devices is
always battery life in even with screen
on pretty high brightness and using a
live wallpaper I was easily able to get
through a full day of usage I talked
probably about two and a half to three
hours in the phone email actually two
separate email accounts
that's about every 15 minutes and a lot
of internet browsing it's actually one
of the best uses of battery that I've
seen and it's only a fifteen hundred
million power pack in here so pretty
impressive with what LG has done I like
the DLNA support so if you've got a deal
on a capable device you'd be able to
stream all of your content wirelessly
right from your phone which is really
nice thing to help the quadrant score on
this was extremely high bringing in a
score of 2379 and this is a completely
stopped device this hasn't been rooted
or had any custom roms on it this is
just stock android 2.2 it's put on the
phone as you buy it in the score the
quadrant score of 2379 is really very
high overall I've been very impressed
with the 2g 2x it's a nice phone with a
solid phone it's got decent call quality
it brings in modern features in a very
nice package this is differentiates
itself from the rest of the Android pack
probably not interestingly enough though
what makes this stand out to me is its
lack of customization out of the box I
like stock Android I like the way it
looks well on the great things about
androids you can customize it didn't
have to work against the phone so you
don't have to try and get rid of
motoblur you didn't have to try and hide
HTC Sense if you're inclined you can do
what you want with this if you want to
put in tweaks from the marketplace
you've got the option to doing that put
on your own app so you can make this
look how you like without having to
fight against a built-in skin especially
if you don't want to go the routing way
so you guys I can definitely recommend
the g2x it's going to be available on
the twentieth of April for 199 dollars
and if you're a t-mobile customer
looking for a really solid 4G device
assuming you are in a blanketed 4G area
you really need to look no further than
t-mobile g2x i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you the next
