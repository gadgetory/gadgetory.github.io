to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here we are
at the LG booth at CES 2015 there's a
ton of stuff to show you here from TV is
that curve and flattened the phones that
are bent on two sides two monitors
they're just a ton of new technology
here at CES so let me show you what's
new in the LG boo so there's obviously a
ton of stuff that we can cover but i'll
show you the highlight some of the
coolest things that I thought we can see
here one of the first things is 3d and
4k I know a lot of you like me probably
your opinions on sanity but sing it in
4k with passive glasses it's actually
really cool they got a humongous display
i looks better than 3d has ever looked
for me though the highlight was the
curved TV actually curves and goes flat
taking advantage of LG's OLED technology
if you don't know what oullette is the
technical term is organic light-emitting
diode what that allows the pixels on the
screen to do is turn each one of them
off and on individually so like LED or
LCD you don't need any sort of backlight
already sort of fake dimming like local
dimming the pickles and go completely
blocked what that's going to mean to you
are much much more vivid colors and much
darker darker black to more importantly
which all translates the pictures just
looking stupid awesome hadn't had a
chance to take a look at a no LED TV you
definitely should a curved TVs are also
a big thing here at CES LG's got several
curved models but one in particular I
think is the most exciting you can mount
the sucker in your wall keep trying to
stand it I'll give you that curve for
the immersive experience with the push
of a button also flattened look like a
traditional a flat panel television set
it's really cool to see it in action and
it happens very very very quickly it's
hard to get a sense of what Oh LED looks
like watching it through video and then
whatever you're watching this on youtube
get a chance to check one out for
yourself go
store see what LED TV actually looks
like I've got like a three year old TV
set at home it's LCD and now I kind of
feel like I want punched in the face
hole come along walk this way no no
little walk this way sorry I never
promised to be funny we've got TVs they
designed with Barsky crystals for you
extra fancy folks right over here
because I know you so fancy surrounded
by monitors surrounded by beautiful
screens a ton of LG G flex 2 stuff here
at a booth we got some very early
hands-on with the device to check out
those videos we'll put a link down below
in my pants region here's something
maybe you never thought I would say
let's talk about washing machines and
LG's been watching some pit my ride
they're putting washing machines on top
of washing machines super not kidding
there's a washing machine can City on
top of a mini washing machine we sat
down to their press conference they can
do your normal washing machine stuff on
top and down below see you got a kid at
home that somehow manages to poop up his
back I'm not sure how he does it I just
want to watch this little shirt or some
of your delicate business I could throw
them Nathan do a really quick wash goes
right into the pedestal gesture
compatible with older LG washing
machines so cool i will show smart
enough to understand what that meant but
stocks so i'm a geek too and i get
excited about crazy nerdy things but i'm
also practical i had to sit and look at
a monitor more hours and i would ever
choose to last year we had a chance take
a look at LG's gigantic monitor with a
21 by 9 aspect ratio they've updated
this year for now it's got some curves
on it like me after a good dinner at the
excalibur buffet this is a 34 inch
curved IPS panel and curb for a monitor
this size makes a lot of sense it's
great for gaming you can almost emulate
three separate monitors up here is LG's
got sort of set up a couple cool things
about it at first it's qHD resolution so
it's 34 40 x 1440 it's compatible with
Thunderbolt 2 so it'll work with your
max or if it's money traditional inputs
where your PC like listen I get that
just a monitor put that big and curves
kind of means that I can bake oh look
it's practical I could do a lot of work
on it but the nerd me could be like it's
curved so sweet you guys remember webOS
I remember waiting in line to Sprint's
towards get the original palm pre webOS
is back it was back last year but now
it's even backer and better with webos
2.0 in LG Smart TV so that's going to
may not get the old Carter face used to
see you're going to get very very quick
interaction television sets going to
boot up twice as fast as last year
interacting out the ribbon down below
and set your own custom tiles you can
kind of do multitasking true on your TV
you can pull up interactive menus that
having to go away from your picture just
really nice guys just LG's
video-on-demand service and it's all
that TV stuff you want to do all while
just moving your remote around like a
wand expecto patronum that's super nerdy
super thin laptops fat jon close the
shake i'm gonna try this at home and
then what about when you got to keep
your vegetables cold you can do that and
your fridge can tell you when you need
more wifis because vacuuming yourself is
for chumps lecture robots do it for you
