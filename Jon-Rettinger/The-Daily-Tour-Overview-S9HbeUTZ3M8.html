technobuffalo here and i want to give
you an overview of news corp's just
launched the daily it is the first
newspaper dedicated just to the ipad
there is an impression of this in
existence this is made just for the
mobile platform and was launched today
februari second so let's go ahead and
get started so first the app is a free
download after that you're going to get
two weeks free courtesy of verizon
wireless and if you'd like to continue
the service it's gonna cost you just
about a dollar for a week and you can
continue that for as long as you'd like
with new content being delivered just
like a newspaper would during the
evening would be very content heavy
during the day and the early mornings
but more content as a breaks would be
pushed out to it throughout the day so
let's go ahead and open it up here it is
the daily you get a pretty cool splash
screen and you are off and i'm showing
this right now in landscape mode but of
course you can rotate it into portrait
as well so here is your daily home
screen and it's sort of interesting i
think of this as an actual newspaper
made digital we have sort of the same
digital features so walk you through the
basic UI of course it pulls in your area
and your weather so that's 66 degrees
where i am right now my apologies to
those you that are watching this on the
east coast with feet and feet and feet
of snow or foot feets foot of snow
whatever that might be so you can see
your weather right there that daily
button in the daily logo is going to be
your home button it's gonna take you
back to content I'll take a look at that
in just a minute you've got a carousel
of content right here you can go ahead
and scroll through these are just
articles almost like you'd see as you
flip through the pages in a newspaper
and you can tap on any of those and
bring your right children will show that
in just a minute on the bottom you've
got a navigation page essentially the
sections of your newspaper broken down
by news gossip opinions arts and life's
apps and games and sports you've got a
little arrow down there in the bottom
right hand corner you go ahead and pull
that up and this is going to open up
even more mini so you've got those same
actions we just talked about so where
you can watch some of the video it's
going to be embedded into the article if
you just want to watch some video you
actually have some stories read to you
that's what that headphones going to be
and go ahead and fast-forward if you're
not watching what you want and if you
want to just randomly go to an article
or shuffle 21 I can go ahead and do that
i'll just pick one at random for you pit
stop and that's what you can watch there
are a decent amount of saving options as
well of course a paper clip go ahead and
hit that you can save it right to your
safe pages and come back and rate it
another day if you like go ahead and hit
done got some settings as well it's
going to pull in your zip code
automatically you can set it push
notifications for breaking news and sort
of general overview stuff let me show
you what article looks like here this is
the home page of the daily I just
launched today looks like Egypt is the
cover story so go ahead and open it up
and I should say that when you open up
the applications you have your ipad off
for example i will take a minute to
download the issue if you've used the
wall street journal app or anything like
that may be familiar to sort of those
download times so here it is the
following Pharaoh and you go ahead and
sort of scroll through it see your table
of contents a lot of stuff to look at of
course you can just tap and go right to
one or you can go ahead and sort of keep
scrolling down here if you'd like so you
can see what else we have then keep
going this is an overview of the daily
they're going to walk you through the
stuff that I'm sure I can go ahead and
hit play obviously and I'll play the
video you've got some sharing options
here as well if you want to let's go to
another one so here's a picture I can go
ahead and share it you can send it to
facebook twitter email it or whatever
you like go ahead and exit that thistle
icon right here is going to bring down a
carousel if you select that it's going
to bring it right back to where you were
let's go ahead and keep playing now
let's say you're reading something you
want to keep browsing through a
newspaper one of my favorite things to
do with the physical newspaper which is
sort of thumb through the pages and see
if I see anything interesting well it's
actually a digital way to do that now I
with the daily which is kind of neat see
this little bar across the top if you
tap that bar it's going to pull up
essentially from browsing through all
the pages so you can see what there is a
thumbnail virgins needs anything that
you want to see so the picture the dog
looks kind of cute woof there it is you
can go ahead and start reading about
this looks like the french bulldog you
can read about New York's doggy disco
and so
to scroll through now you're probably
saying what's different between what we
see in to Wall Street Journal online and
other newspapers online this is kind of
immersive content so you've got some
pictures here and sort of things are
standard oftentimes articles that give
you 360-degree pictures images you can
actually scroll through them video is
going to be embedded into the send the
images and it's optimized just for the
ipass here's a video you're also going
to get commercials go ahead and scroll
out of that you can go ahead and open up
in these pictures here are some videos
that's embedded an article for time well
spent things like that so go ahead and
hit the top button up here and continue
to scroll through you can all see the
progress bar to show you where you are
and if you want to get back to that main
home screen in that original carousel as
I mentioned earlier just go ahead and
tap the daily and you are going to be
right back there and you can go ahead
and browse or ever sections we want so
say gossip go ahead and tap that yet
article here on Natalie Portman having a
baby girl evidently or pregnant with a
baby perhaps a girl fifty percent chance
oh that it's going to be a girl I didn't
go ahead and sort of scroll through like
you would on a normal paper um can't me
speak much to content first daily
content looks to be pretty decent it's
on par with you know most other
newspapers but certainly times going to
tell whether or not this is going to be
a successful platform or not if the
audience is going to react well to a
completely digital newspaper that have
any option for a print physical copy and
without the quality of the articles
whether it's editorials or news is going
to be unbiased present the news and sort
of a educated way you know has yet to be
seen at least right now it's a very
intriguing platform with a really easy
delivery method and it brings the news
with you wherever you go so right now
i'm watching it very close them to
continue to watch it looking forward to
my free to eat subscription and getting
a chance to feel the content give jen
snows from the writers and see if the
daily is indeed the game changer that
news corp is saying it might be somebody
