future I do want to give a fist bump and
a thank you to Bosh for for sponsoring
this video so what's your future you
don't necessarily need like a magic
8-ball to tell you for me it's my
daughter coming in June and I'm gonna
have a lot of humans to move and
mobility is a big deal and it's also one
of the main themes at CES 2019 and I'm
here at the Bosch booth where they're
showing what the future for mobility
could look like using a bunch of
existing technologies it's kind of put
it together into this IOT shuttle to
show you how autonomous driving can
happen and Holle services kind of come
together so let me give you a glimpse
into what your future might look like
at this point it's obviously no surprise
autonomous vehicles are coming it's just
really a matter of when they're going to
be here and a lot of Bosch technology is
going to be powering this autonomous
feature so that's why I'm here and they
sort of put all of their tech into this
thing this is the IOT shuttle so I
wanted to talk to somebody who kind of
understood the technology that could
walk me through it
so bashed me up with Vern Heinrichs he's
a company CTO for mobility topics he
kind of walked me through the vision for
the IOT shuttle and sort of Bosh's
vision for the autonomous future so in
the center of all of that what we're
doing is a human being but think about
that first about the human being what
what does a human being one wants to get
as a service many things about mobility
so it starts with that but then there
are probably two or three things which
are important for the person but it's
it's about stress-free it's about
emission-free
and it's about accident-free many things
about mobility and it's about time spent
in a reasonable way and not overdoing it
so this is not like a thing you're gonna
see on the road it's more of an idea of
what kind of the autonomous shuttle can
do so it can be whatever you want it
could pick you up from the bars at night
and bring you home safely you could call
it to take you to work you could go on a
road trip with your kids I like to see
it as something I go on vacation with my
family
I can play with the kids in the car when
I'm driving well when the car driving I
don't have to do it we can sleep in this
type of environment and so we can use it
not only as a shuttles sharing with with
others but also with us as a family
I like to think about it so I'm like a
bit of a personal story Mike my
grandfather turned 89 years old and this
year we're gonna have to take his car
keys away from him something like this
IOT shuttle or the autonomous future is
going to enable like an older generation
to have their autonomy for lack of a
better word they can live farther away
they could call a car and get to where
they want to be without endangering
others are injuring themselves by
getting me on the wheel cos you know the
wheel we were never good cars that is
not all and yes and but even though we
could but but it's about really
contributing all aspects to it and
making it a really a living room making
it a totally different environment
making it maybe a hospital making it
whatever either
that's what we can do and drive the main
idea here is that in the future every
vehicle on the roads gonna make use
somehow of bashas digital services there
in everything so being able to see their
vision of what the autonomous feature
might look like it's probably a closer
view of what that's really going to be
than just another manufacturer so
obviously the IOT shuttle is a big
playing catch in mobility but there's
also a lot more when it comes to
mobility and also micro mobility so they
got things like the connected bicycle
making motorcycles safer using bluetooth
as the key for your car straight up
getting rid of mirrors on your truck and
giving you screens we got making
charging smarter and also things like
just automated driving in cities so like
as a whole mobility as a giant deal here
at CES 2019 Vashta pretty a giant player
in them so that's an overview of the IOT
shuttle here at the Bosch booth at CES
2019 but there's a lot of other awesome
stuff that is tearing if you guys want
to check it out we did a whole video of
a tour of the booth we'll link to that
down below and when I checked out a
really awesome campaign that Bosch is
done it's called like a Bosch you should
watch it I'll also link to that down
below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
