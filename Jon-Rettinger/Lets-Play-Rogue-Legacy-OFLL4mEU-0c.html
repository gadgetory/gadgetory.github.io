TechnoBuffalo calm and i'm here with a
quick look at rogue legacy rogue lacy
released for the pc on jun 27th we
snagged it on steam for 15 bucks but you
can get it directly from the developers
website at the same price and they'll
even include a free steam key which i
wish we knew when we purchased this came
last week but will include a link for
you guys to head directly to their
website in order to snag it the title is
only for the pc right now but it is
being developed for mac and linux as
well that will come later according to
the devs so real quickly rogue legacy is
a 2d dungeon crawler with procedurally
generated levels you're seeing me kind
of select characters and upgrade my keep
right now and i'll get to explaining
more that in just a second it features
permanent death sort of but I'll get to
that later to an upgrade system and your
characters even have disabilities
seriously I believe that this character
has dyslexia so every time you die you
get if you pick a descendant to start a
new game with and that the Senate might
be dyslexic like this guy gigantic
really fast really small colorblind
stereo blind whatever you get the point
they all have disabilities that make
them more interesting to play and it
gives the game kind of a new twist every
single time you start it up so I'll talk
more specifically about rogue legacy
here in a second but I did want to touch
on its genre first it belongs to the
sub-genre of roguelikes so while rogue
legacy is actually a semi roguelike or I
believe the developers are calling it a
rogue light as in like light soda
roguelikes are basically a sub-genre of
gaming that typically features a
standard list of mechanics they're
insanely hard what you're seeing here in
just a second they feature permanent
death and most of their encounters are
randomly generated this is a really old
genre of gaming that sort of seen some
new love with recent years one of my
favorite games from last year I don't
know time abandons me when I try to talk
about these things one of my favorite
games from the last couple years is FTL
fast and light that is a roguelike as
well but the genres way old the first
game rogue which
is where rogue light comes from was
released for the UNIX platform way back
in nineteen eighty so and and that's
pretty much what started this trend and
in recent years has become more and more
popular to do this so what makes rogue
legacy a rogue light instead of a rogue
like when you die you grow stronger so
rather than a new game starting
completely from scratch you'll upgrade
your manner and weaponry you'll unlock
new characters and you'll basically have
a bigger strong point because your guy
grows as you die and upgrade new
features so it's not like you're gonna
spend all this money on upgrades and
then all of a sudden you won't have
access to them anymore because you're
dead those upgrades carry across
generations so I guess in the lore of
the game the weapons the metals the
armor everything that you unlock it's
passed down but so the genetics of being
stronger and faster and bigger and
whatever else so you're gonna die a lot
in rogue RN rogue legacy which I do as
well I med this is actually one of my
longer runs which isn't really a
testament to how good or bad I am at
this game I'm terrible at it for them
for the record I'm just gonna uh sir
Gordon has been slain by a skeleton and
then you'll see me jump back into the
main menu and I'll pick a new descendant
so this was the guy that I just had this
is our new guy I could be a barbarian
who they all have special traits this
guy's a giant the guy above him is
really tiny the guy below him is
talented i don't know he's a savant my
name is sure what that means yet this
guy would also be stereo blind which
means that the 3d aspects of the game
are gone but I'm gonna go with Lady
Priscilla the Barbarian who is also a
giant this is the aforementioned manner
so I do have some bucks to spend and I
could just upgrade my sword here with
the blacksmith which is what I think I'm
going to do and the weird thing about
rogue legacy is that when you go to
approach this castle at the beginning of
every round you're greeted by this
phantom and you have to give all your
money to get it in basically start
playing basically you want to spend all
of your money on upgrades before you
enter the castle every single time so
every single time you play you're going
to
flying upgrades so tough scheme does
work with a controller which is really
nice if you're someone who likes to play
in big picture mode on steam which I do
so that's great and it actually controls
really really well it's hard I mean this
is this is a precision platformer with
like hack and slash mechanics your sword
swings are super slow so you're gonna
have to balance out when you're fighting
and when you're dodging and running for
your life and being a giant as you're
seeing here with Lady Priscilla makes it
even harder one also pretty cool thing
that I wanted to mention about rogue
legacy is the game's soundtrack so I'm
actually going to kind of fade out here
for just a minute just so you guys can
listen to the music and watch me dodge
all of these fireballs or not dodge them
I get distracted like a turkey leg pops
out I'm like I get that turkey leg see
and then I get hit turkey leg useless so
anyway pay attention to music and I'll
be back on the other side
okay so like I said at the very
beginning in this game one of the big
staples of the roguelike genre is its
intense brutal difficulty and I think
you guys are probably getting a pretty
good taste of what that's like in play
I'm not good at this game i'm not gonna
suggest i'm good at this game i'm not
i'm terrible at it but to my defense i
think i have a whopping 30 minutes of
play under my belt before recording this
video so I'm gonna get much better guys
I promise probably not huh it's it's
meant to be tough you see me here I'm
going to take a lot of sacrifice that
chess is clearly gonna have so much gold
into it so I'm just gonna jump down here
take the hit look at all that phat loot
getting hit harder and I split this is a
roguelike and and rogue legacy is a
blast for 15 bucks kind of in love with
it already I can really wholeheartedly
recommend it to anybody who kind of
wants more challenge out of the games if
you like the really tough stuff this
one's going to be for you I'm gonna die
here pretty soon this is probably this
here is probably my longest running this
game and I'm really proud of it I didn't
do anything I'm terrible at it thank you
guys for watching so much we'll be back
again with another episode of let's play
for now this has been joey davidson i'm
joey davidson with rogue like it's out
now 15 bucks check the link below for
the developers website snag the game for
yourself and until next week lady
priscilla is out stupid grey night
