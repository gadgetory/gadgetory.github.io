TechnoBuffalo here a few months ago I
had the chance to check out one of the
few in the world
Microsoft retail stores and just a few
days ago I actually went back see if the
story change and they redid it a little
bit it's very reminiscent of some of the
other retail experiences you might have
had it's very interesting to see how
these stores are arranged what they look
like
so enjoy the updated tour and stay tuned
for a serve hands-on experience of
Microsoft's Kinect which I was able to
get some hands on and legs on and body
on time with I would should be coming up
later on in the month and I hope you
enjoy John right here from TechnoBuffalo
see you the next one
so let's take another quick tour to
Microsoft Store I was here a few months
ago when they first opened you can sort
of get a sense that it looks like right
now you can see some of the employees
and the colored shirts the Xbox is on
this boy will connect the Kinect demo
that we saw is actually outside sort of
suit I got these screens all the way in
the back we've got some Xbox game to
highlight at the new Xbox is clearly on
display with lots of stock inventory
I've got sort of desktops lined up on
the side each of these tables that you
see right now are all notebooks I've
gots are broken up by a school notebooks
gaming notebooks and netbooks in the
back there you can see that there is the
Xbox section where all the games and if
you display it's actually kind of cool
go ahead and take a look back there and
I'll show you all the laptops here
and these are some of the the netbook
options the desktop we got some Windows
Phone options here as well including the
Kin which has certainly been killed got
the Xbox section here you can see the
controllers the games are actually up in
there you can go ahead and play they got
some games they're sort of the employees
giving some the training in the back
take a look here I've got sort of a
bunch of different laptops there are
some Microsoft Surface units all around
the store we'll take a look at those a
bit later what we have here is kind of
neat this is actually a software
printing station when I first did my
Microsoft Store tour I sort of even
Oviatt what this does it's a sort of
pick whatever sort of soft replication
you want and it's early coincide at the
screen up there to go through and touch
it and you can pick whatever you want
it's actually gets printed in the back
I'm actually generate your serial key
and they bring it after you take sort of
just a few minutes to do certainly
Microsoft has many many many software
choices out they don't have that many
display here so this machine actually
lets you make whatever software you want
the old printer for you they got some
games and accessories here as well sort
of see some of the employees different
colors designate different
responsibilities so some are the
greeters some identical support some are
general questions that's for the desktop
section over here
Xboxes are these custom skins are
displayed commonly you can sort of make
your own 3m skins for the xbox or for
the back of your laptop serve another
360 you this is sort of a quick overview
of the Microsoft Store initially out
californee one sort of interesting thing
about all of these laptops they have
here you're actually going to notice
there are no stickers you don't see
Intel Inside or a core i7 any sort of
stickers on these at all it's part of
sort of the retail experience here at
Microsoft they don't put any the
stickers on here it's totally brand free
which is kind of neat as well actually
Microsoft supposedly negotiated a little
bit cheaper prices and office of these
computers so here's some of the HP's see
they got some of the gaming computers
over here on all them are our brand free
which is kind of neat anyway I am John
Rhett interpret TechnoBuffalo with
another quick overview for you of the
Microsoft Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
