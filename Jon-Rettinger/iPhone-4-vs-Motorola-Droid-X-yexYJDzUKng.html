TechnoBuffalo here with a smartphone
Smackdown in one corner we have the
contender Verizon is newest king of the
hill the Droid X on the other we have
AT&amp;amp;T and Apple's ruler the iPhone 4 so
we're going to put these two in a
10-round smackdown you see who comes out
on top so they're obviously a ton of
rounds and things we can cover about
these but I picked the 10 most pertinent
I think summarize the phone's the best
so we are going to cover display
processor storage text entry browser
still camera a video camera speed
operating system and a few other
intangibles so let's go ahead and jump
right into the display you completely
see a difference here the iPhone has a
3.5 inch capacitive screen with the
resolution of 960 by 640 something Apple
is calling Retina display you may have
heard on the other we have the Droid X
with a very large 4.3 inch screen
capacitive as well with the resolution
of 854 by 480 so even though you have a
larger screen and with the larger screen
you are probably going to get less eye
strain the display has to go to the
iPhone and you're gonna ask why am i
prioritizing this in that way well from
a pixel standpoint we're gonna get six
hundred and fourteen thousand pixels on
the iPhone and we're gonna get four
hundred nine thousand twenty on the
Droid X as I mentioned certainly will
get less I shred on a larger screen but
of more pixel density means crisper
graphics sharper text more screen real
estate which are going to mean less
scrolling only looking at text and
browsing so from a display standpoint
despite the larger screen this edge has
to go to Apple's iPhone 4 so one round
for Apple an X let's talk about
processor what sort of driving these two
things well there's the 8 for
system-on-a-chip that thinking that's
powering the iPad put in the iPhone 4
it's often about 1 gigahertz on the
other hand a really Motorola shocked
many people in the shuns Qualcomm's 1
gigahertz Snapdragon chip and have said
went to T
Oh map processor which is the same sort
of family of chips I found that a lot of
phones including the original Droid but
they ramped up the clock speed to 1
gigahertz it ordinarily I was a bit
worried that maybe just an overclock
slower chip but as you'll see this thing
is a screamer very fast really capable
and very uh very well rounded so from
the processor standpoint this one's
gotta be a drought one get here and
someone getting hurt sometimes doesn't
equal the same speed but as you'll see
these are both very capable processors
that do things a bit differently do them
both very very well so we're gonna call
processor age raw so next let's move on
to storage and value
well the iPhone 4 it's gonna come in two
capacities either 16 or 32 for a $1.99
at communion and respectively and that
is internal storage it's on a sort of
flash drive inside you can't remove it
or even stuff with the storage size that
you get the dry X you can actually get
storage size from 24 gigs all the way up
to 40 you're 199 entry price point will
be available at July 15th by the way I
was getting gave 8 gigabytes of internal
memory and 16 on a micro SD card it's
going to come standard already installed
on the phone so out of the box you're
getting 24 gigs
you can also replace those swap magic go
all the way up to 40 if you take out
your 16 gig card including the 32 so if
you're a photographer you need to be
able to remove storage to take things
elsewhere you have the option to remove
the cards as I mentioned and also you
can go all the way up to 40 gigs of
storage and you can tailor the phone
storage size for what's best for you so
from a storage standpoint and a value in
that aspect the Droid X is clearly the
winner here so next let's talk about
keyboard both of these lacked physical
spirt QWERTY keyboards so you input text
would be very important I've got a
records I'm an iPhone user and I found
that the iPhone keyboards has been very
hard to beat let's see how the Droid X
stacks up to it so I'm gonna go ahead
and open up a new notes application here
on the iPhone and I'm going to go ahead
and input some text and see how it works
so we'll go ahead and get this ready so
you can input text in two ways you've
got either a portrait or landscape
keyboard
we'll go ahead and try the portrait here
and both feature a very nice and really
well-done autocorrect so I'll go ahead
and type just simple text message
Winnie the Pooh's sounds gross because
it does I was able to type that very
quickly and easily will go ahead and hop
on over to landscape and try the same
thing so mess that one up a little bit
and as I mentioned I'm a big fan of the
keyboard on the iPhone let's take a look
at the keyboard here on the Droid X and
I should mention that the Droid X is not
running a standard build of Android 2.1
it's actually running a brand-new
version of Motorola's motoblur clicks
they've made much less obtrusive from
the original motoblur and really have
done a very nice job sort of having it
run in the background and just augments
and the things that you used regularly
so we'll go into tech messages here
switch back I will open up a new text
message and I'll go ahead and start
typing you can see the keyboard
immediately is going to look different
I don't you see on normal Android
devices or even on Sense UI devices so
I'll try and try and type here so we
need to prove Seoul's gross I'll go
ahead and push them to landscape and try
it one more time
so I made a few errors there but you
know it's going to happen when you
contact as quickly as possible so errors
on each so I'm just gonna compare
keyboard to keyboard here I gotta say
the cupid on the Droid X really
impressed me I think that Motorola is
the keyboard recommendation here is
actually better than HTC s they've used
with sense I think it's better than what
Google puts on a standard Android build
it's nice easy to use it's well laid out
was surprisingly a very quick fan of the
Droid X keyboard
however entering text just from keyboard
to keyboard if I was we were going a
keyboard keyboard comparison here it
would probably be a very close closer I
made side with the Droid X because the
screen the keys are a little bit easier
to type on but that's not the only way
to input text you've got a fantastic
text option here so imma go ahead and
try this and see what it looks like go
ahead and go to the end and tap right
there and I'm gonna go ahead and hit
this microphone and I'm gonna talk into
it and see how it translate into text
this is a test of a keyboard on the
droid this is a test of the keyboard on
the droid and it did it perfectly and I
found that it does it very perfectly so
it's a great way if you were in the car
you don't want to type out a long
message this really does a very nice job
of doing it so if we're comparing text
answering keyboards this clearly has to
go to the Droid X which is saying a lot
setting to keyboard on the iPhone is
fantastic but the ways you can input
text and things that you can do with the
Droid X really beat out the iPhone here
so we will go ahead and Chuck this round
up to the Droid X alright so next let's
go ahead and move on to browser and how
each browser works and how it functions
and sort of the features that you're
going to get with each and we'll do a
browser speed test coming up so don't
worry if that's what you're looking for
let's go ahead and launch the browsers
we're going launch it here on the Droid
X jumped on into landscape and we'll do
the same thing here and we'll go ahead
and jump to we'll jump to my youtube
channel seems like a good enough site so
while that is loading let's look at the
browser here on the iPhone that's
something that probably most of you are
from
at least I've seen somehow in passing
very smooth browsing it's very smooth
scrolling you can pinch and zoom if you
get multi-touch to pinch and zoom and
the text now as far as zoomed out as I
can go
it's still legible you can still buy
zoomed in a little you can sort of read
the text that's on there and you still
read it actually relatively clearly no
flash here on either device actually the
iPhone certain doesn't support flash it
supports html5 and a few other sort of
video formats you can double tap to zoom
and it just things just work well on the
browser you've looked at the browser on
the Droid X it works very well as well
however the text on star the standard
zoom you can't read a little bit lower
resolutions if i zoom in there you can
see the text is almost illegible it's
not nearly as clear and easy to read as
it is here on the iPhone you can see you
can read the text on the iPhone you
can't read it here on the Droid X I you
do get me touch you can certainly pinch
to zoom and it works well it's not as
fluid I don't think as what you get on
the iPhone but it's very very usable
again no flash support yet for the Droid
X that is saying that's going to be
coming sometime in late of 2010 so we
get flash 10.1 support but without flash
and for comparing certain browsers to
browsers
I think the iPhone just offers a
smoother experience scrolling as a bit
more fluid it's a little bit jerky on
the Motorola Droid X although the Droid
X is a very capable browser I think
browsing is one thing that the iPhone
really does well and excels at so this
round I think definitely has to go back
into Apple's camp and going to the
iPhone so next let's go ahead and talk
about speed and how fast both of these
are and both of these devices will
mention a little bit support
multitasking so I want to go ahead and
close all running programs in the
background
we've got sort of a fair test let's go
ahead and do that first on the Droid X I
want to do this on camera so you know
there's no funny business going on I'm
go ahead open up this task ill and I
will kill all selected apps and I'm
going to go back home I'm gonna do the
same thing here on the iPhone I'm gonna
close everything that was running the
background
so then everything is now closed okay so
now we're dealing with sort of apples -
let us say the droids oranges let's go
ahead and launch the browser so this is
going to be a speed test now we're
connected over the same Wi-Fi network so
we'll go ahead and load up the YouTube
page on each and we'll do a simple
refresh test and this is gonna test
pages that you visited on a regular
basis so pages that already been loaded
on here to see really how quickly or how
slowly both of these load so you can see
if they're both on here Lemaitre go
ahead and do the simple refresh test and
we'll see which one comes out on top
same Wi-Fi network although I will say
it looks like I'm getting full Wi-Fi
reception here looks like I'm only
getting half of the Wi-Fi reception on
the Droid X something to keep in mind
I'll go ahead and hit go on each let go
there go there and we're off and let's
see who comes out on top
looks like the iPhones got a bit of an
early edge but the Droid X finished that
noticeably faster than the iPhone 4 did
very quickly and that's despite what
appears to be a degraded Wi-Fi signal
string so maybe that was an anomaly
maybe not let's go ahead and try loading
TechnoBuffalo comm on each and see if we
have a winner we have TechnoBuffalo
ready to go there and we'll do the same
thing here okay and we will see which
one comes out on top and again
TechnoBuffalo has been loaded on each of
these as well so we clearly saw an edge
with the Droid X and actually in all of
my iPhone vs. droid phones we've seen
the Android phone to be much quicker in
the browsing standpoint and it looks
like that is no exception here as the
Droid X once again handily beats the
iPhone 4 in a browser speed test very
clearly the browser and perhaps the
processor Network sort of coming
together from a browsing standpoint
creates a little bit quicker experience
both one and a half to two seconds
faster let me go ahead and close both of
these and both of these now are just
gonna be running the browser in the
background now we'll try some other sort
of non-scientific speed test
and we'll launch applications that are
similar and see if we have any sort of
difference let's go ahead and open up
settings
so again non-scientific operand systems
handle settings opening in very
different ways but just to see if we can
check check for Speed let's go ahead and
give it a very simple world so open up
settings on each so a little bit faster
on the droid let's try opening up let's
say Cameron can get a sneak peek here to
it what the new motoblur looks like I'll
be doing a full overview as well on sort
of how the new motoblur works let's go
ahead and open up about the camera
functions on each this does have a
dedicated camera button by the way on
the right hand side as I mentioned in my
unboxing so we'll go camera to camera
and see which one opened them quicker
here as well that's oftentimes
application that began to dismount of
lag what didn't quite well I did open up
at the same time it was a little bit
quicker on the iPhone actually thought
that I didn't even hit it on the droid
but it just took a second to load so
speak to speed application why is kind
of close but that quote missed closeness
is definitely outweighed by the Droid X
is feeding when it comes to web browsing
surely it's yet to be seen how speed is
going to be affected once flash X's are
once flash 10.1 is on here however right
now as the phones are clearly from the
speed standpoint the Droid X beats the
iPhone again that's something that we've
seen with all of the head technobear
things I've done including the
incredible and the Evo 4G the Droid X
appears to not be any different alright
so now let's talk about still camera and
I broke up still in video because they
do very different things and both these
are very capable devices I thought they
should be handled a little bit
differently so from a camera standpoint
we are looking at a five megapixel
sensor on the iPhone it's got a 4.3
image capture it does have LED flash and
on the front it does have a VGA
resolution front facing camera the still
camera on the Droid X has an 8 megapixel
sensor takes images at 16 by 9 dual LED
flash and finish image stabilization I'm
gonna go ahead and put up some pictures
now you can sort of see the difference
between you what they look like I'll do
some in low light and high light with
the flash on on each you guys can check
them out
okay so picture this picture stand for
the notice that there's not much of a
difference here the three megapixel
difference between the two phones
doesn't necessarily transfer to better
image quality so the quality of images
themselves I think are very very similar
however what's going to give this edge
to the iPhone is the addition of that
front facing camera we're not talking
about video chat here at all just people
want to take a self-portrait up for
example or you ever want to hold the
camera now it's very nice to have that
secondary option if it isn't just at the
BGA resolution but you want to send the
picture of something that you want to
see and you want to message it out and
really is a great option so from a still
stand point I have to give that edge to
the iPhone just because that
front-facing camera if that wasn't here
or if the Droid X had a fund-raising
camera much like the Evo 4G would have
been a very different story so now let's
go ahead and jump over to video because
there's a bit of a different here with
video so the iPhone shoot 720p video
it's got two microphones the Droid X
shoot 720p video and has three
microphones so I'm gonna go and put in
some sample video here and you guys can
sort of check out the quality all right
so these are being recorded exactly the
same time testing out the video and
audio fidelity I'm certainly now in some
high light situations just walking down
streets all right so now we are testing
a video in low-light situations
all right so these are being recorded
exactly the same time testing out the
video and audio fidelity I certainly now
in some highlight situations just
walking down the street now we are
testing video in low-light situations so
looking at the quality of the video here
I was very surprised I actually expected
the joy X quality to be a bit better but
surprisingly it wasn't as good as the
iPhone 4s video quality and despites
extra microphone I thought the audio
fidelity wasn't as good either so you
can see this seems relatively obvious
when they're up to each other next from
a video standpoint you're gonna get a
little bit better from the iPhone 4 and
again that front-facing camera sort of
comes into play because you can record
the video from the front as well so even
if the quality was more on parity being
able to have that front-facing camera
for video again gives it an edge in sort
of video and still our two very separate
categories I'm using my phone for each
that was sort of the reason behind
breaking them apart so next let's talk
about operating system this is going to
be a really hot button issue I know gets
a lot of sort of the fans and fanboys
and sort of people on edge it's going to
come down to personal preference in
whichever one you like the iPhone sort
of offers a more closed Atmos truth you
can live with inside of Apple's walled
garden of iTunes and sort of how they
want you to view media on here the
iPhone is a very nice experience now you
get multitasking and you have to do a
lot of page scrolling to view your
applications you can't really dig much
deeper they're only have dedicated file
manager and really isn't any widget
support if you look over at the
operating system on the Droid X it's
running Android 2.1 with motoblur and
then the past setting motoblur has been
a hindrance on phones we saw with the
backflip and a few other motoblur
devices however they have completely
updated it to make it a really nice
experience and from sort of that
offerings of the stand point you can do
a lot if you like throw the standard
icon array you can have a standard icon
terrain and view it like that if you
want widgets you can have wooden support
so here I've got some weather and some
calendar
got different icons you can see down
there helps me scroll between pages and
the ability to also have the sort of
moving wallpapers or live wallpapers
really is a sort of a nice fun thing to
have on your phone so the more I use
Android the bigger fan I become a bit
and sort of from and operating systems
standpoint I think what we're getting on
the iPhone is nice we've seen
evolutionary upgrades from the first
edition and it's a new capable operating
system but it is getting a bit stale on
Android seems always be reinventing
itself and with these different skin so
between motoblur since you want and the
standard Android I get sort of three
different experiences which is nice
because you get to pick which one is
best for you
so you may like what Motorola has done
here at the motoblur and say you know
what the Droid actually want to be great
for me you may love HTC Sense you might
say you know what another device is
running HTC is going to be fantastic for
me or I like the stock Android build I
want something that's got pure
unadulterated Android 2.1 or 2.2 on it
the choice goes with the consumer and I
think from that standpoint the operating
system on Android is going to have to
get the edge' it's the first time I'm
actually giving the operating system
edge to angular advice but the more I
use it the more that I've seen how
Motorola's implemented motoblur here the
bigger can of it I become so that round
is going to go to the Droid X so let's
talk about sort of other other
intangible and other features here so
from the Detroit X standpoint you will
be getting flash in towards the end of
the year flash 10.1 that's got
multitasking does have HDMI out on the
iPhone stand point you do have video
chat which is awesome actually before I
film this us having a FaceTime chat with
a friend in London
the quality was great so you actually
pretty much get now free coast to coast
or country to country calling it both
you have iPhone force multitasking and
the new three axis accelerometer or
gyroscope so from the intangible
standpoint so the extra features that
you get and again that's what that
front-facing camera really comes into
play the iPhone is going to get this
round so those you that be keeping track
at home
the display went to the iPhone processor
was at I storage
went to the Droid X text entry went to
the Droid exports awesome keyboard and
the ability to sort of speak text to it
browser went to the iPhone we may have
to reevaluate that once flash comes to
it still camera went to the iPhone video
camera went to the iPhone both of which
because the presence and the usefulness
of the VGA camera on the front operating
system went to the Droid X the other
intangibles went to the iPhone and speed
went to the Droid X giving us a 10-round
total of iPhone 4 five Droid X 4 and a
tie at one if you guys will go back and
sort of watch the video comparison I did
of the Evo 4G you notice that the really
intangibles here were the front-facing
camera and the fork American technology
gave the Evo 4G an edge taking those out
anyways and you still have a very very
capable phone 4.3 inch display very fast
and does a lot of great things but in
this 10 round test of the iPhone barely
came out on top and I do say barely if
you're not gonna use that phone facing
camera would have been a much sort of
different outcome however sort of
putting everything together in total
package the iPhone 4 is the winner but
not by much I'm a huge fan of the Droid
X it's a great phone not only is it a
great phone to create value as well on a
fantastic network so can't go wrong with
either button head-to-head there has to
be a winner and the winner here is the
iPhone 4 so do you agree or disagree you
