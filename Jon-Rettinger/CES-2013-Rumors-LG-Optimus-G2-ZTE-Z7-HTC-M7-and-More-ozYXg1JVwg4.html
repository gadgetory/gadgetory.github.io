TechnoBuffalo and CES 2013 is right
around the corner literally and the
focus of this video is smartphones let's
take a look so it's no joke when I say
CES 2013 is right around the corner
january six kicks off one of the largest
electronic trade shows in the world but
while there's a ton of stuff we'll see
next week in Las Vegas connected
refrigerators awesome accessories cool
gadgets and more the focus of this video
is on smartphones and three smartphones
in particular these are the three that
are rumored for CES 2013 one is the LG
optimus g2 now this thing is rumored to
pack between a 2 + 2.5 gigahertz
quad-core cpu 5 to 5.5 inch display so
if you're somebody that doesn't like
those big displays you're going to be
kind of out of luck because a lot of
these devices have big displays but to
continue on 13 megapixel camera 3
gigabytes of ram and more so this day's
going to be a fast manage am I don't
know if people say manage am anymore but
it's gonna go nobody says that anymore
it's going to be fast that's for sure
the rumored ZTE z7 will compete with
larger smartphones such as the HTC droid
DNA and samsung galaxy note 2 and it
said to offer a 5.7 inch 720p HD display
1.2 gigahertz quad-core cpu 8 megapixel
camera and 3,000 milliamp hour battery
now HTC says there's a phablet or is not
a phablet rather samsung says there's is
kind of like a tablet phone hybrid we'll
see what ZTE says about theirs if they
release it the HTC m7 is the third one
this rumored for CES and it packs a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core snapdragon cpu 2
gigabytes of ram a 4.7 inch full HD
1080p display a 13-megapixel camera
2,300 milliamp hour battery along with
LTE and HSPA+ capability the trick with
all of this is which carriers the
devices are going to come to and I found
over the years at CES 2013 it's usually
more indicative of the devices that are
coming to the US as opposed to like a
mobile world congress where we see the
devices release on a more international
scope and then come to the US a few
months later this time around I'd expect
to see the HTC device and the LG device
both come to the state
pretty soon and then ask for the ZTE
unit as of right now there aren't really
high-end ZTE devices on any carriers in
the US so I'd expect to see that stay
international and less random carrier in
the US decides to pick it up on top of
the carriers expect to see tablets take
center stage as well with rumors of
product announcements from Microsoft
Samsung intel and barnes &amp;amp; noble with
their nut products so a lot to be
excited about at CES 2013 will be there
to cover it live from Las Vegas with a
great team of people in the meantime hit
