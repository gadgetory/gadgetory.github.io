to you by AMD hello internet and welcome
back to another episode of ask the
Buffalo the show r you can ask me
Ashley's gather any question you might
have for the wide world of technology on
sometimes beyond every tuesday we put up
a call for questions on TechnoBuffalo
calm you can leave your question in the
post comment otherwise you can send them
to me anytime of the day or night on
twitter at TechnoBuffalo or at ashley
ask emma just use the hashtag ask the be
so i can see it hashtag I can't read
usually I'll answer between three and
five questions every episode let's get
answering this is ask the Buffalo
Alexander Luke asks what kind of filming
gear do you guys use well Alexander Luke
we just upgraded and we have a couple of
cameras in office so we used to use a 5d
mark 3 which is very very lovely I'll
but we upgraded we've got a Canon c100
as a main shooting camera and it is a
true delight sir a true delight we also
use different kinds of lighting we have
a green screen here we have a six-cd
that we also use as a secondary camera
so we do shoot cannon here at the office
we use iPads for teleprompters we've got
you know all kinds of gear and equipment
and all this other just great awesome
stuff but that's what we use to film
like right now we're filming on the c100
and we have a center light and we've got
an iPad teleprompter Josh asks hey
Ashley what kind of games do you like
playing the most shooters fighters
adventure games or another category I
would say my favorite types of games
there's probably three categories in
particular I really love the genres that
I liked player i love rpgs so I'm a big
final fantasy fan but older Final
Fantasy so like kind of that middle
finally i z7 era I loved Final Fantasy
10 10 2 was okay there's a lot of
costumes in that one I did did love some
of that final fantasy I like RPGs I love
platformers huge platforming fan i would
say psychonauts is probably my number
one platformer of all time just because
it was so funny and so great I love
point and click games a big maniac
mansion fan from way back nes and and I
also really love adventure games so I
would say this year my absolute favorite
game has been BioShock Infinite hands
down so I guess that would be a shooter
but it wasn't necessary was like a
first-person shooter but there was so
much more I thought I'd venture to it
I'm gonna try not to butcher this but at
pho wazee ghazali says will the Moto X
and moto G receive a full international
release including Asia Southeast Asia
etc I don't think that the Moto X is
going to see an international release
and that's really unfortunate however I
do think that there is like a big push
here with the Moto X and this whole
assembled in the US and also their stuff
the Moto G on the other hand I
absolutely think will be the
international device that's sort of the
answer to the Moto X on it sure
does have a little bit lesser specs but
the thing is is globally that's actually
a good thing because there are a lot of
emerging markets like India who would
love a phone like the Moto G and the
fact that it is a lot cheaper than the
Moto X obviously the cost of the Moto X
is a little bit higher than what we're
used to seeing in terms of smartphones
even here in the States so I don't know
that the Moto X would sell that well in
certain markets that Motorola would
definitely want to be in so I think the
Moto G is actually a better choice for
an international device and and I do
think that you will be seeing the Moto G
roll out all across the globe at lamont
cranston 3 says ashley ask Emma how do
you keep getting prettier and prettier
with every video well only the shadow
knows lamont and I think you know what
I'm saying no seriously guys I'm
drugging you I mean you guys really need
to like take better care of and protect
your water sources much much better it's
you're basically being drugged into
thinking that I'm more attractive and
finally Tim Sinclair Lee says add John
for lakers this is a question for John
did you upgrade your gen 1 ipad mini 2
iOS 7 did it still work ok or did it
slow down I actually asked jon rettinger
the man the Buffalo I asked him this
question and he actually said no he
didn't see really see any slowdown he
said it'll act pretty much exactly the
same i mean it specs for my ipad 2 so
pretty much exactly the same as an ipad
2 getting upgraded to iOS 7 so if you've
been thinking about upgrading your first
gen ipad mini um you can and and also
Apple's got an update coming up pretty
soon I believe it's in beta right now
don't quote me on that where you're
going to be able to shut off things like
the transparency I you know different
things like that we're going to be able
to disable a lot of things that sort of
hinder performance on some of the older
iPads and iPhones so that's always
something you can also look forward to
you want to take a second to thank our
friend and sponsor AMD AMD powers the
world's best pc graphics did you know
AMD is powering both the xbox one and
the ps4 yeah that's right they're
leveraging the awesome power of AMD
you're going to be able to get the same
CPU horsepower to get things done on
your AMD power device during the day and
then unplug and play games when you
finish with your work products with
amd's newest APU
as the ability to function as a fully
working laptop when you need it and then
when you're craving a little less weight
you can undock that sucker and use your
AMD APU powered devices a tablet I love
it all-day battery life means your
device is gonna sip battery giving at
least eight hours of battery life a day
AMD powered laptops and tablets adjust
their power consumption depending on
what you're doing steam games writing
papers streaming netflix it's up to you
and it's all possible with the power of
AMD well that's it for this week's ask
