membership today what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here
hardware is all the rage nowadays
talking about dual core tegra tues that
have found the way to the motorola xoom
that same chipset making its way into
the motorola atrix we have speed coming
out the wazoo what does that speed me to
you all the horsepower in the world
can't make a difference if the software
is not optimized for it you could have a
quad-core chip which would blow away any
competition with the Starhawk software
rather can't take advantage of it it's
not going to be of much use to you and
now we're about to talk about hardware
some more on apple being the focus we
just saw the macbook pros get refreshed
and we are on the eve of presumably new
iPads being announced with a little bit
of a thinner display a front camera a
rear camera and a little better a5
processor which presumably accordin all
rumors is going to be dual core which is
great but i would treat all that
hardware in the world for an improved
user experience again if the hardware it
can't improve what i end up using on a
daily basis there's no use to it and
you're just burning battery now Apple
when they launched the iphone in 2007
whether you love apple hate apple or
fall somewhere in between there's no
doubt they change the mobile industry
forever they change the way we think
about a mobile device and what it can do
and it certainly gave birth to fantastic
competition like android and webos which
is recently getting a shot in the arm
with HP resources however since the
iphone launched in 2007 the operating
system has become extremely stale it
launched with huge features emitted that
should have been there from day one cut
copy and paste and mms us were the two
flagships now since then they've opened
the app store which is given additional
functionality to the advice to the
device but it hasn't changed what it
looks like for the end user when you
look at your iphone now versus what an
iphone look like in 2007 you still have
that same array of icons now you can
make folders but things are still the
same you get those obtrusive pop-up
notifications if
I am browsing a website doing some work
I don't want to know that it's my turn
on words with friends I want to see that
down below up top somewhere with not
gonna make me stop what I'm doing and
have to hit ok or cancel and pause
what's going on in the background which
is of a lock screen which displays very
little information Jill breaking now is
borderline becoming a necessity to get
some increased functionality Apple
should have been innovating with from
their previous iterations of the
software so what I'm looking forward to
most on Wednesday isn't a brand-new iPad
I don't care about cameras I want a
better user experience I want an
operating system that's on par with the
competition I want Apple to continue to
innovate company that I used to be proud
of when I used to love to follow but
they've lost their luster Apple iPhone
used to be my daily phone since 2007 I
know carry an Android device in my
pocket because I want those unapproved
notifications because I want true
multitasking not app switching Apple
needs to step up and continue to drive
the operating system forward there's
been so much focused on hardware and I'm
certainly guilty of that as well I run
through specs and talk about how it's
one gigahertz versus an 800 megahertz
and how that matters the end of the day
you need software optimized for your
hardware an apple has done a very good
job with optimizing their software but
they were really fallen flat on new
feature innovation I am hoping that iOS
5 is going to bring a completely new
user experience maybe they'll bring
which 'it's in the background at the
very least less and I hope somebody is
listening at the very least and
unobtrusive messaging system and a la
catrina take better advantage please
there are very simple features and
things that really need to be there in
order to have iOS and the iphone in
general remain competitive and of course
the ipad is well running the same
operating system these are features that
are required that Android has that webos
has and that should have been there from
day one so this has been at my rant on
Apple I'm hoping that it's going to
continue to push forward and it
continued to push and redefine we think
of the mobile industry but at least
right now I'm not holding my breath I
