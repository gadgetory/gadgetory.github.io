TechnoBuffalo
and this is my unboxing and first look
of the Prada phone by LG 3.0 better
known as model number LG p9 4 0 so a bit
of a funny name on this one and in this
video I'm going to be giving you an
unboxing and first look at this mobile
phone the sports a 4.3 inch Nova plus
display
so let's discover what that is so let's
get this round box out of the way and
we're into the really nice packaging
with the Prada brand on the front here
and let's have a first look Wow nicely
presented lovely packaging on this one
now this particular phone is running
Android 2.3 Gingerbread it's got the
product user interface which we have a
look at in a moment this is the mobile
phone itself let's just pop that to one
side and see what else we get inside the
box very nicely presented so we've got a
package here and in here we have got
some warranty information we have also
got welcome to your Prada phone so quick
guide around the interface and this is
going to be something a little bit
different for me because I've never used
something with the LG Prada sort of
interface overlaid on top of Google
Android so this would be nice to have a
look at and then we've got a full user
guide which is going to guide us through
everything we need to know about the
phone then we've got lots of little
packages I've got all these let's have a
look and see what's in these let's grab
this one first
it's like Christmas everyday we have got
a rather fetching looking headset Wow
look at that these are very different
and look nicely engineered
these are like metal barrels to the to
the ear pieces here and then nice
silicon tips on top and they're metal
construction around the side and then we
have got says it got a built in mic it
should have we've got in here a little
clicky button and on the opposite side
the little tiny mic pick up
nice-looking headset next package is the
USB cable micro USB on one end full-size
USB on the other we have got the battery
which is an LG battery three point seven
volt and let's see if we can find the
writing was it on this side here we go
1540 milliamp hour battery five point
seven Watts hope that's one side cuz
we're going to need that and then I'm in
the UK so I get a UK three pin power
adapter with a USB socket on this side
if you're in the US or another country
you're going to get a country specific
power adapter inside your box so let's
have a very quick look around the
handset before I actually put the
battery in this sports a one gigahertz
dual-core processor 4.3 inch display 800
by 480 resolution one gigabyte of RAM
512 megabytes of ROM internal storage
capacity of 8 gigabytes and you can of
course expand that with a micro SDHC
card now that processor the one
gigahertz processor is the OMAP 44
have a look around the back so remove
that really nice textures at the back it
almost feels like leather but it is of
course plastic and then at the top of
the handset here we've got the camera
which is 8 megapixels with an LED flash
autofocus round on this side completely
clear this looks like a speaker grille
just on this section here right on the
bottom we just got the mic pickup and
some more plastic to remove
by the looks of things as it's got a
plastic film on it looks like plastic
film all the way around let's just peel
this off here we go so they have sort
put plastic all the way around the phone
to protect it from scratches so
beautifully saw packaged and as I say
we've got microphone pickup on the
bottom here on this side here we've got
the volume up and down on the top here
we have got two little buttons not sure
what they do at the moment we've also
got a little cover which we slide across
which reveals that micro micro USB
socket and three-and-a-half millimeter
audio jack this little cover here that
feels really nicely engineered very nice
indeed then back round to the front
obviously we've got the display which
we're going to turn on in a short while
we also got a front-facing camera
1.3 megapixels it also supports sports
re AG sensor proximity sensor and light
sensor so all the sensors you would come
to expect from a phone by this not only
does it capture 8 megapixel images but
1080p video 30 frames per second so
let's get this battery into the phone
and then I will come back to you with a
first look at the Prada interface so
here we go this is the phone all booted
up and ready to go as I said before it's
running Android 2.3 Gingerbread with the
Prada user interface over the top it's a
very unique looking interface because
we've got no sort color so it's very
stylized in this or white-on-black
affair with all the icons so not only
have we got the icons across the bottom
here but we've also got touch sensitive
icons down the bottom so if I tap just
down here they actually light up we've
got what looks like a sort of setting
button here which pops up any overlay
menu we also got home button back button
and search button then on the main sort
of screen the main 4.3 inch screen we've
got access to the phone nice stylized
dialer as well and this follows through
on most of the user interface let's just
tap back to go to home one thing I
didn't like
that these sort of back light area down
here does disappear quite quickly so you
have to memorize where these sort of
icons are but it shouldn't take too long
for you to familiarize yourself with the
user interface now let's have a look in
applications so here we've got all of
our main applications which we can
scroll up and down and you also see as
we scroll down to the bottom of this
section we've got two more sort of
drawers here now we can tap on these to
expand them and then it leaves them
expanded or we can in fact pinch in so
if we pinch any apps actually collapses
the various categories it's a nice way
of organizing applications google apps
and your downloads as well so let's just
expand the Google service one it shows
you what actual Google services are
included and then we can collapse that
down and then go into the main
applications and see what's
pre-installed as default so we got some
nice applications to choose from of
course we've got the Google Market so we
can download whatever we want to the
handset as well then we in tap back to
go to the home screen seven home screens
in total we can swipe sort of left to
right and right to left to navigate
through these it's all good it's all the
normal Android sort of things we would
like to see but a really nice stylized
so user interface not sure I like it
it will probably grow on me as sort of
time prevails and I've used the handset
for a little bit of time let's just pop
into the gallery whilst we're here and
have a look at a quick snap that I took
of my Angry Bird
it's just rotate this round now I wanted
to show you this because this claims to
be a very bright screen it says that
it's called an 800 NIT Nova Plus display
so at the moment I've left it under
standard settings and this is the saw
display we're getting let's just go back
out to the home screen and I'm going to
go into settings and we see just how
bright this display goes so let's put it
all the way up to full brightness we go
back out to the gallery and have another
look at this photo and see what it looks
like it is a very bright display
this translates well into the video for
you but this is a gorgeous display very
bright very accurate colors and even at
this early stage I'm loving the look of
this LG Prada display really nice
everything seems nice and responsive
that's down to that dual-core 1
gigahertz Omak processor it's got a nice
amount of RAM also the internal storage
capacity which can of course be expanded
we've got 8 gigabytes plus up to another
32 given as 40 gigabytes in total this
is the Prada phone by LG model LG P 940
and this was very kindly sent to me to
review buy clothe technology you can
check them out at clove Cola UK where
you can pick this up for 429 pounds now
that gets you this handset sim free
unlocked so you can put any carrier
Simonet 429 pound equates to around
about 680 dollars in the US well thanks
very much for watching this has been
