TechnoBuffalo here if you're brand new
Galaxy s5 waterproofness isn't
waterproof enough for your life like
let's say you're always playing Angry
Birds or threes in the toilet and you're
prone to just dropping it in or you go
to the beach all the time you got kids
whatever it might be
Samsung has your answer this is the
brand new Galaxy s5 active we've got it
all dolled up for 18t let's go ahead see
how it does so here is the box for the
galaxy s5 active all dolled up in white
blue and orange for AT&amp;amp;T nothing too big
here pictures advice on the back and
typical AT&amp;amp;T box so sent to us courtesy
of our friends at AT&amp;amp;T SPR there is the
s5 active reminding you that it can wait
don't text and drive which is just a
good rule in general you should not do
that push it off to the side for a real
quick second is a heavy feeling phone
what else we're going to have inside of
the box Smart Switch making the switch
from other devices easier of course they
want to make that as seamless as
possible we've got help and safety we've
got headphones and if you want to see
more pictures that's what its gonna look
like
hit the link down below to go to the
article on second Buffalo I'll come over
gallery of all that stuff included we've
got just a regular wall wart and micro
USB cord nothing overly exciting there
and here though is why you are here this
is the Galaxy s5 active I will peel this
off if I get that whooshing noise oh I
did it still makes me excited we got
some stuff on the back see looks like
you throw it off a building that's
probably the idea come here plastic
longevity able to get this off you gotta
have to deal with plastic on the back of
this phone while I do the unboxing
yeah I hate plastic I'm gonna try and
get this off here y'all speed this part
up
there we go galaxy s5 active out of its
plastic all right let's run through the
specs and I'll turn it on and we'll go
through all of that bone goodness so
what you are looking at is a 5.1 inch
screen the same screen that's in the
irregular galaxy s5
it's 1920 by 1080 with a 432 PPI and
again 5.1 inches it is Super AMOLED tech
and if it looks as good as the regular
is 5 you're going to love this guy
Android 4.4.2 out of the box on the back
hidden is a 16 megapixel sensor that
discreetly can also shoot 4k video which
is kind of neat 2 megapixel shooter at
living right there on the front 2.5
gigahertz Snapdragon 801 2 gigs of ram
28 hundred million power battery 16 gigs
of internal storage 11 of which is gonna
be usable so 5 gigs taken up for oh s
and touch with stuff and it is ip67 so
that's just fancy talk from eating dust
resistant water just in that kind of
stuff it's not waterproof but you can't
take this underwater and shoot a couple
pictures for a little while I wouldn't
take it very deep but all the ports and
the important stuff is all sealed and
stuff that's open actually has a sealant
in there like 3.5 millimeter headset
jack so water won't get in so a quick
tour it's typical sort of Android we've
got actual buttons here that are sealed
in encase so nice to have physical
clicky buttons your typical Android fare
you got multitasking home and back
underneath that flap is where your
charging port is going to live left-hand
side we've got volume rocker up and down
I believe probably camera access button
but we'll check that out on the right
power and we've got through the super
sealed in back here though it is
technically removable go ahead and pull
it off and break that seal there's a
rubber gasket that goes around here now
the regular galaxy s5 also pretty water
resistant so got aside whether or not
you want super water resistant or just
you know very watery Justin so there's
the back try and snap this back on this
is not as easy to snap back on us other
phones cuz it's really got quite a city
got make sure that gasket is all the way
sealed there it goes
all right let's turn this phone on and
take a look at the UI
we got this guy all powered on it's
gonna be a very familiar touch with
style looks exactly like the regular
Galaxy has fired because it is a galaxy
s5 but just a little more waterproof and
durable previous active versions the
screen has looked little distorted
because of extra protection over not so
here the screen on the s5 is probably
one of the best phone screens I've ever
seen save for possibly the g3 it looks
just as good here on the active let me
show you what them some things look like
on it we'll go ahead and go to
TechnoBuffalo comics your text look like
I'm not always the best to see it on
from screen to the camera to YouTube to
compress and whatever resolution you're
watching then I'll take my word for it
does work very well of course being a
pretty beastly processor Snapdragon 801
things move faster because RAM is plenty
here it does have the ok Google ability
search TechnoBuffalo which I really like
it to be an you know it's gonna do it
saying and you know that it's doing its
thing see what's going to come on Boris
is the 18 2 variants you're gonna get an
18 T apps bundled in some useful like
beats music some maybe not like AT&amp;amp;T
Navigator but they are all here for
whatever you choose to do with them
you've got lookouts curating and all the
other Samsung stuff that comes with it I
would not want to use photos or
galleries it's sort of all here Smart
Remote capabilities as well
Samsung app and user management I'll
come right on board other than that
though it's same galaxy s5 that we've
seen will test some of the sort of
ruggedness of it but I would probably we
do the reviews gonna be very similar to
review the galaxy s5 which will link
down below but something is different
during our testing I'll make sure that
we sort of update and annotate to make
sure you guys know what it is and
anything particularly you want to sit on
this guy be sure to let us know until
next time I'm John write intro from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you guys the
next video I'm gonna go throw this off a
building or something thank you guys for
watching please subscribe right here be
the first ones to know whenever new
videos get uploaded we got a ton of
stuff we do phones tablets cars anything
has to do with consumer electronics
that's be plugged in or uses batteries
we review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
