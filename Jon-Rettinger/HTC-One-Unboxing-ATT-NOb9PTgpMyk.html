technobuffalo here's an unboxing for you
of the HTC One all dolled up by AT&amp;amp;T
let's go ahead see what's gonna be
inside this retail box when you go to
pick up your new phone alright so here
is the retail box for the 18 th tc1 only
way you're gonna know it's eighteen t is
about a little entente globey guy right
there a really slim profile box on the
back you up a little bit more of AT&amp;amp;T
branded that 4G LTE you right there and
of course the other stuff that comes
with it beats audio this is a 32
gigabyte version AT&amp;amp;T does offer a 64 if
you opt for that start running through
all the specs here when last we unboxed
the HTC One we did it in a
pre-production version we since had a
retail version we didn't do a separate
unboxing for that but since this is a
full carrier one we thought we'd show
you what was going to come inside as a
refresher I'll review the HTC One it's
really overwhelmingly positive I've got
a 9.5 I was one of my favorite phones of
not just the year but the past few years
and a phone that i would really happily
sign a two-year contract for so we've
got a quick start guide for you guessed
it getting started quickly we're gonna
update our review to reflect LTE usage
and how it affects battery actually by
the time you guys watch this video we're
filming this a few days before the video
is going to go live i will be able to
show you what that battery drain is with
LTE so we got this few days early
alright so there is texting and driving
it can wait splash it off to the side
for just a minute we'll run through all
the specs in a sec we've got a sim
removal tool here we've got some limited
warranty stuff HTC stickers forgetting
yo HTC on we've got some headphones
actually looked to be pretty nice they
are not beats branded unfortunately but
they do look sort of beats ish that red
sort of hue on it there's an inline mic
there and you get a few different sized
earbuds if your ears are oddly sized
then the usual stuff you'd expect in a
box of wall work and a micro USB
charging cable alright so we'll push all
that stuff up to the side take a look at
the phone itself let me run through the
specs as I
all the plastic all right so we are
looking at a gorgeous 1080p screen is
4.7 inches so it's 1920 x 1080 being
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
chip it's 1.7 gigahertz case you are
wondering 32 or 64 configurations ours
is obviously the 32 as I mentioned there
is that for ultrapixel camera on the
back we did a full video comparison and
picture comparisons as well showing how
that worked in video and stills against
a ton of other phones including the
droid DNA the Lumia 920 and several
others so links to all of our HTC One
coverage can be down below in case you
want to see how well that works other
niceties that this has is 802 11 BGN and
AC here and there's a lot of others or
free cool things packed into the phone
you've got an IR sensor on the top and
really incredible build quality the
video doesn't really show how nice this
phone actually feels in the hand boom
sounds HTC is calling their proprietary
speaking of speakers and these speakers
actually sound really really good not
just for speaker phone calls but for
music as well pretty impressive so down
below we've got AT&amp;amp;T logo branding and
show you the difference between the
unlocked version and 18 t1 if i push
those ranks which i really couldn't tell
which one was which if i flip them over
though only way you can tell again is
that little branding down below so
overall this is pretty much the same
phone that we saw and we did our full
review but as i mentioned we've got a
couple days head start before we can
actually publish this video so by the
time you guys see this i'll be able to
report back how battery life is being
affected by LTE as the unit we tested
was just hspa+ support so anything you
guys want to see about the AT&amp;amp;T specific
unit please leave your comments down
below give this video a thumbs up we'd
most definitely appreciate it I'm John
renter from TechnoBuffalo and I will see
you guys in the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
