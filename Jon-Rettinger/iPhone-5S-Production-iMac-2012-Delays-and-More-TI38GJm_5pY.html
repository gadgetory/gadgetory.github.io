to you by carbonite welcome back to
another episode of rumor roundup I'm
your host John wrenches the show where
we lasso up all the rumors from the week
put them all together nice little
package so you can know the four or five
stories that came out that you might
have missed thinking about getting a new
phone you're not sure what the rumor
mill saying this is a show to watch this
is rumor roundup it's gonna get started
let's go ahead and start with the iPhone
5s for the next generation iPhone
Apple's kept true with the S model the
3G 3GS or 4s it makes sense to believe
the next iPhone will be called the 5s
what does it make sense does that
production has allegedly set to begin in
early 2013 that doesn't mean we're gonna
see the phone in early 2013 just means
they're gonna start making them testing
them I wouldn't expect to see a new
iPhone until May June ish timeframe but
already work at the next one supposedly
the time frames had pushed up a little
bit due to iPhone 5 production delays
they can't make them fast enough
too many phone buyers out there want to
get their hands on a new 4-inch screen
you can't get your hands on a new iPhone
you might want to try some of the
alternatives out there Windows Phone 8
and Android of course are waiting to be
adopted by you they're just sitting
there lonely open them up if you're like
me and even wanted to get one of those
slim sexy new iMacs
your hopes and dreams are about to be
dashed and smashed and smushed new iMacs
might be delayed until 2013 according to
Apple Insider setting a commercial
source which was French blog mac vidya
claims the production of Apple's new
iMac models might not be ready for sales
ahead of the lucrative holiday shopping
season there's speculation the company's
advanced welding process is to blame for
the delay which sucks
fans processes but not gonna get out on
time during Apple's quarterly earnings
conference call which is held right
after the IMAX debut Tim Cook said that
there'd be a significant shortage of the
all-in-one but the client to offer
really any more details on it so kind of
doesn't make sense data now it's an
awesome new product and all of a sudden
like a only 10 of you can buy them
adding to the already high difficulty of
manufacturer the IMAX screens lamination
process but essentially just eliminates
the 2 millimeter gap of air to the
display in the front glass but I'll take
a 2 millimeter thicker computer if I
could just get it out on time in August
KGI analyst Minji quoi reported that the
process is more involved with 27 inch
model and would cause supply constraints
the initial batch of the machine that it
looks like he was right current
availability the desktop so still
remains unchanged in Apple's online
store it still shows in November
launched for the 21 inch model and in
December launched for the 27 inch model
so that hasn't changed yet so until that
changes tickers with a giant grain of
salt and hopefully I'm wrong he asked my
wife it happens more often than you
think
so are you one of the three million
people I picked up one of them damn hot
and sexy Galaxy Note twos and your love
of that multi window feature to take it
over your friends I have an s3 and you
laugh at them haha
sucka you don't have that well looks
like actually I'll do that for that much
longer the multi window feature is
coming to the Samsung Galaxy s3
according to T g-spot the notes
convenient multi window experience will
arrive in an over-the-air update at
slated to hit before the years up not
that many days left before the years up
so supposedly you'll get it very soon
and hopefully when jellybean family at
your phone at least for us here in the
US the National folks have had it for a
while even shipped with tables in
Australia so even reading about Windows
Phone 8 if you checked out our review on
the HTC 8x the Lumia 920 and you're
dying to get your hands on a Windows
Phone 8 device for yourself and you're
on Verizon one might have good news for
you supposedly free Windows Phone 8
device will be making their way to
Verizon of course on a two-year contract
prices reported looking to fill out its
Windows Phone 8 device lineup with a
device totally free on contract before
the year is up addition to the HTC
Windows Phone 8x which is 199 bucks and
a Lumia 822 which is $99 price is gonna
give customers the opportunity to pick
up a free Windows Phone 8 handset not
sure what its gonna be but perhaps it'll
be the achieve Odyssey by Samsung
it's a really solid handset feels like a
galaxy s2 ish and a Windows Phone 8
package but if you're looking to get a
cheap phone again a cheaper than free
that's gonna hold you for next two years
and you
Windows Phone 8 Verizon folks like your
weight is going to be very short let me
