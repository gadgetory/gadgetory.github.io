somebody who has had this phone in their
hand and using it for the better part of
a week there's a lot to talk about the
phone screen the main one underneath is
plastic you can't bend glass so
something else has to be used it was a
plastic polymer that makes this screen
sort of function and work it also Bend
and flex to protect that plastic screen
from scratching Sampson put another
layer of plastic on it so reviewers got
these in our hands and figured I'm gonna
peel that off as well problem with that
was kind of Bork the phones sort of made
them stop working and then gave issues
with the screen functioning properly and
things just stopped working all together
with the devices and we saw big tech
reviewers have those problems and sort
of one of the last issues that we saw
was the design of the hinge thing can
get stuck and caught in there working
its way up to the front create a little
bubble under the screen and that
eventually made the phone stop working
so how simpson was going to respond to
these issues if it all was a real big
question mark you know someone who has
this phone when i've been asked by a lot
of media outlets and sort of friends
that are in the industry samsung
answered that question they said they're
delaying the launch of the Galaxy fold
they're stopping taking pre-orders to
evaluate what's going on and presumably
to fix the problem there are two very
clear schools of thought one is to say
good for you Samsung before device ships
out to the public you are fixing
inherent problems but perhaps a flawed
design the other side of that coin is
how could a phone with these inherent
flaws ever make it out to reviewers
hands in the first place and as somebody
who's been using the phone had in their
hands again for a week there's a lot
more to the phone than the headlines
there's a lot more to the design than
the story you've been reading let's talk
a little bit more about the Galaxy fold
and see the bigger picture
the Galaxy fold has kind of been my
money Morphin travel buddy for the
better part of a week I started off in
New York flew with it to Toronto for
half a second and then all the way back
down to Southern California and probably
like you and you saw the announcement
for the fold and unpacked its kind of
unsure about it what the phone was gonna
feel like in look like in your hand
inserted from the very first second that
I picked up the phone it felt like
something different so first it feels
premium for two thousand bucks you would
expect it to feel premium if you could
say any phone feels like a $2,000 phone
it would be the fold I mean even the
satisfying search sound it makes when it
clicks open to the clasping sound it
makes in the magnets clothes and it
closes the phone up everything about it
looks and feels really premium may not
be the biggest fan of like the Martian
green it's kind of look at me for an
already look at new phone but holding
this phone and using it on a daily basis
I definitely feel like I'm holding
something in the higher echelon of sort
of tech value and so there haven't been
that many first the mobile industry like
for a while so when I picked up the
galaxy fold and opened it up for the
first time it was a really awesome
feeling sort of see a screen that moved
in morphs
as I opened it up and it was kind of
reassuring that it wasn't like a bad
screen either it's a Samson screen it's
plastic but it looks like a Samsung
screen so colors look braze it's dark
like it expect from something that has
OLED but the feeling of folding a screen
and putting it back in your pocket and
then taking it out and opening it up
it's really cool and you can't get that
feeling sort of that Oh like giant eyes
from just you know reading about it
something you have to experience an
experience it for yourself
it's hard not to think that this is the
way all things are gonna go just
probably not for a very long time
continuity is a big part of the galaxy
fold and that's where you do something
on the outside it shows up on the inside
and then vice versa
is really cool and works incredibly fast
and I initially thought that was a
Samsung thing but it's actually baked
into Android Pi so this is again where
things were awesome and things I've
never seen before
I could open up Chrome and be looking at
a website and open this up in that same
website exactly the spot in the article
I was at shows up on the big screen if
I'm framing a picture I open it up it's
going to be there as well
almost every app say for Twitter that I
tried worked and it was really cool so
for the sake of a new design maybe it
would have been easier for Samsung to
change a lot of the features that have
worked with you well on their flagships
so I like that the cameras are
essentially the same cameras that come
from the galaxy s 10 plus so you get
those three sort of different lenses you
get the standard zoom at a wide angle
then using the giant screen as a
viewfinder again is a really cool
experience so if you're wondering why
I'm so positive on the galaxy fold it's
not just the fold it's that I'm really
excited about foldable devices in
general I think a lot of the negative
coverage coming out of the fall to sort
of so lead the opinions on what foldable
phones can be now I'm not making excuses
for Samsung these problems should never
made it to production we should never
have device in our hands that are
breaking the way that the fold units are
but the potential of what the fold can
be and what it represents is a really
cool place to be so all the issues the
Galaxy fold aside it's made me believe
in the future of foldable phones even
more and there's a lot of different ways
this could go it could be devices that
fold out like this it could be devices
that fold the opposite way like the mate
X it could be like Jamie's concept we've
seen that it's a trifold design using
this phone and having access to that
bigger screen not necessarily
carrying around a giant phone in my
pocket has been absolutely awesome
seeing Instagram almost look like a real
desktop app then you have to use
continuity and jump in between the
screens is a really awesome experience
and maybe that's why my gut shot
reaction people sort of complaining
about the crease was you're getting a
foldable phone you're looking at things
that can do more than a solid slab of
glass and that's why I'm excited so in
the week I've had this phone being able
to take it to the gym and watch Netflix
on the treadmill without having to carry
an iPad with me has been absolutely
awesome when I want a bigger viewfinder
take pictures without looking like I'm
holding a giant tablet with me has been
incredible battery life has been awesome
as well too got two different spots to
store battery there is a really strong
future with foldable devices and before
you can get to that future you've got to
take that first step and the galaxy
folded definitely took that step and
maybe that step was more than a stumble
but don't remember the first step on
that marathon all anybody's gonna
remember is when you crossed the finish
line and we're far from that mile 26 but
we are on the way to the future of
changing designs there are a lot of
things that make the galaxy fold unique
and once your weird things happen with
it as a lot of people have come out of
the woodwork YouTube work especially
with opinions based on what they've seen
and what they've read and I do that as
well as serve the nature of YouTube that
offers a platform for commentary on
things that's part of the beauty of
being able to make videos something
about the galaxy fold is just so
different than the other devices that
I've ever held admittedly before I went
in to actually use the phone I thought
it seemed like a silly concept but it
seemed like something that not like
people were going to use then I started
actually using the phone and realized
there's a lot of potential in the device
I started to see how the future of
mobile communications was going to go or
at least an option for how it could go
and the galaxy fold as flawed as it
might be was a first step on that
direction
so as you decide whether or not you want
to shell out the almost two thousand
dollars to buy this one or maybe even
more for another company's foldable
phone I encourage you to find one to go
to a store they might have a display
unit and try it because it's such a new
form factor they think you need to have
it in your hands to see the screen
unfold and actually see that extra real
estate and then evaluate if it's the
right thing for you or not what do you
look to get a phone right now
you've got different companies with
their different offerings and you could
pick which rectangle you like the best
right now a device you can buy or
presumably by very soon you're
essentially limited to the galaxy fold
but imagine a future where there's a lot
of foldable devices to different form
factors
maybe LG's got one that folds the
opposite way you've got wall ways made X
Apple sit this one out for a few years
and finally gets into the market with
the eye fold or the iPhone folds that
maybe folds two or three ways and it
replaces the iPad the potential for what
a morphing form-factor can do is far
greater than one that's already set as
just a record
the future of foldable phones obviously
isn't here new designs have even been
thought of yet
new use cases new apps and take
advantage of these new form factors
probably are still in the back of some
developers mind Sigma dorm room
somewhere but what this can be and what
it represents
I still believe is the future and now
we're finally on that path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
