the company that made the robbing an
awesome and quirky phone and since that
acquisition Ridge has been kind of
silent about what their mobile plans
were well now now we know meet the razor
phone and typical razor fashion there's
a lot crammed into this completely
aluminum shell so razor took a different
approach to the design a lot of
manufacturers are going bezel lists and
rounded rounded curves and rounded
screen razors got a more industrial
approach the phone is made as a material
in there that's in their laptop so it
feels premium it's got a cool metal feel
to it it's also more rectangular than
what we've seen before
it looks very reminiscent to what we saw
with the Robin quite obviously you've
got a fingerprint reader in the middle
the phone on the right hand side you can
press in it's really nice to have it
there and then you've got two buttons on
top almost identical to what we saw on
the rub and they're located right
squared the middle of a phone coz rager
tells us this phones meant to be used
when you're playing games or watching
movies in landscape it's let me get this
one out of the way cuz they're gonna be
a billion questions it's gonna cost six
hundred and ninety nine bucks you're
gonna get a lot for that money or you
get 64 gigs internal storage of course
you can expand it up to I think it goes
up to two terabytes right now typical
razor fashion they wanted to cram a lot
in here so you've got eight gigs of DDR
four RAM which is insane to have the
screen is where a lot of the story I
think takes place it's a 5.7 two-inch XO
LCD panel it's two cases 1440 by 2560 we
didn't get a little bit dressing those
with the refresh rates 120 Hertz here
and what that's gonna mean in like
real-world usage and not just on a spec
sheet scrolling through stuff is gonna
look incredibly smooth it's like a
psychosomatic it looks better but it
doesn't really when you try this phone
you can get it in a store you pick one
up and start scrolling through anything
it looks incredibly smooth and also when
you're watching movies or YouTube videos
because a higher refresh rate things
should look also smoother tends to be
the theme of the razor phone they also
went for a wide color gamut so where
other devices might give you kind of a
bluish hue to the whites this is gonna
look actually white so all that stuff is
great but I think since it's ray
the big reasons behind that refresh rate
when it comes to games it's a variable
refresh rate so if you're playing a game
that needs the full 120 you can do it
it'll scale itself down as well if using
something that doesn't need the full
refresh rate it's kind of dynamic so you
can get an insane refresh rate on the
phone so they're gonna drain battery
which I should mention is four thousand
two milliamp hours so you're getting a
big old battery in this device other
specs are things you'd expect from
flagships right now it's got the
Snapdragon 835 with the audrina 540
built into it so on the camera front
it's got 30 of them and as is in vogue
right now it's got two on the back both
are 12 megapixel one's wide-angle and
one is telephoto 8 megapixel on the
front it's shipping with Indra and you
get out of the box race has been pretty
good updates on the laptop side and
presumably a pretty good updates on the
phone as well and they did say on the
record that got plans for Oreo soon so
we're gonna hold them to that when the
cool things on the software front the
phone is actually shipping out of the
box with Nova prime as the default
launcher which is awesome if you haven't
used Nova it's my go-to for launchers it
works really well on out of the box
swiping to the right it's also gonna
give you Google now so looking at this
phone you're gonna you're gonna notice
gigantic speakers on the top and the
bottom this isn't like a fake like grill
it's a sort of psyche out these are
gigantic speakers that we had a chance
to test out here and check my Buffalo
offices and they wouldn't let us
benchmark you to see how loud they got
because their units still a little
running some pre-production software but
it got really loud I think more
impressively than the volume didn't
sound tinny it had a lot of bass
especially coming from a phone it's not
gonna replace your home theater system
but if you want a phone that sounds
really good and maybe easy to play some
songs for some friends the razor phone
does a really nice job with it so
writing out the specs no headphone jack
does have USB C and they're gonna give
you in the box a dongle if you plug in
set Dongo you're gonna get a THX
certified 24-bit DAC so you can get some
high-quality audio in those cans
pre-orders are available now link to it
down below it's gonna be shipping on
November 17th at least in the US the
phone will work right out of the box
with 18
t-mobile no CDMA support here
unfortunately for Verizon and Sprint I
did ask her age about that and they said
probably not so if you want to pick up
this phone either switch to AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile or if you're on those two
carriers then thumbs up for you
so all the phone looks and feels pretty
awesome there are some things here that
might leave you scratching your head and
wondering why first there is no
waterproofing here razor set it's
because of the mesh on the speaker
grilles and also it's metal on the back
you're not going to have wireless
charging so if one or both of those
things are important to you it could be
a little bit disappointed
so no wireless charging for me is a
bummer but when you do plug it in to
charge it didn't get access to Qualcomm
quick charge for plus so it'll charge
fast is really what it boils down to the
last summation Bluetooth 4.2 it doesn't
have bluetooth 5.0 in here so we need
that long range bluetooth if you want to
share music with friends it's not here
so here's the deal with the phone at
least for me and why it kind of stands
out a little bit so at that $6.99 price
point it's not the cheapest throw in the
world and it's competing against really
the creme de la creme of flagships you
want to get this phone if that screen
matters to you seeing the refresh is
awesome if you watch a lot of movies on
your phone you think you might play a
ton of mobile games incredible device if
you consume a lot of content you're
gonna want to look at this phone if
you're creating a lot of content you may
want to see what else is available
wireless charging is important to you if
you take your phone in the snow or
skiing then you're gonna want to make
sure you get a phone that has sort of
that IP certification in here it's
competing in really crowded waters
especially at that price point but the
speakers are awesome the screen is
really good we'll see how that fares
though in our for you but first
impression I feel pretty positive about
the razor phone it's not cheap it's not
bringing everything to the table you can
get with competitors but what it does it
appears to do what but is that enough
for you guys to want to pick it up again
six thing that I will put all the links
down below if you want to preorder one
and if you can pick one up on November
17th when those pre-orders start to
arrive then what you guys think and let
us know especially what you want us to
test as we got this guy in our lab
put it through the paces hope you guys
enjoyed the video a thumbs up we
appreciate it the next time
John right here
