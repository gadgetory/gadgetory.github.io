to you by Toyota what's up everyone this
is Todd Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo
we're here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas
where we have the sony xperia z1s it was
just announced and we're going to unbox
it right now it's going to be an
exclusive to t-mobile in the United
States and obviously this packaging is a
little more unique than what you'd find
in a tmobile store shelf we've got the
SmartWatch 2 in here the z1s so really
we're just going to see what it looks
like in this package but you'll fight
you'll find totally different packaging
once it hits t-mobile later this month
so best of Sony best for you will take
out the phone itself real quick USB
charging on the top left here memory
card slot for the microSD that's on the
left as well got the dock and then
moving down you've got just the speakers
on the bottom on the right hand side
you've got a dedicated camera button
which we really love volume controls and
on the back NFC we've got the 20.7
megapixel camera and a nice beautiful
design similar to what we saw exactly
what the Xperia z1 SmartWatch 2 comes
with this unit for whatever reason here
but that's not going to come with yours
of course if you want to see what else
comes in it you'll have a micro USB
charger here we've just got a welcome to
las vegas sony knows we're here the
start guide for the z1s multiple
languages and then here's an activation
code for the runtastic pro application
with the the SmartWatch 2 that obviously
will not come with the c1s alright let's
power it on and check out some of the
features alright so now we've got the
phone booted up here you're looking at
the 5 inch display it's a full 1080p
resolution under the hood you've got a
Snapdragon 800 processor clocked at 2.2
gigahertz that's a quad-core chip this
phone's ip58 water resistance so it's a
little more waterproof than what we've
seen from Sony in the past of course you
still have the covers that you need to
keep closed the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack no longer requires its own flip
cover so this can still dunk in the
water and thanks to the dedicated camera
key you can
still take pictures underwater without
having to try to touch the screen which
usually gets a little messed up under
the hood you've got 32 gigs of storage
on board there's a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and of course if you want to
expand the storage you can use a micro
SD card slot to add up to 64 gigs of
additional up front we have a 2
megapixel camera we've already discussed
the 20.7 on the back it's running
Android 4.3 jellybean you have Wi-Fi
calling support you have HD Voice
support a lot of the features you see
from t-mobile phones so one of the
unique things that Sony and t-mobile
worked on is an application called
background defocus inside the camera so
we open up the camera there's this area
here where you can choose the different
applications that you want to use with
the camera will go down here and choose
background defocus this is again it's
only exclusive to the z1s so we'll take
a picture here of this moto x what it
does is it takes two pictures and now
it's sort of stitch them together so you
can see the background super-dee focused
we can adjust that with this bar here
and try to get it just right and in this
in this case it's not so great it's kind
of too it's adding way too much blur
there you can see it and this is still
in focus but it's not bad especially if
you want to add light effects neat
little thing probably not a reason you'd
buy the z1s but not a bad option to have
once you've already purchased it in any
case that's a quick look at t-mobile's
xperia z1s from sony should be launching
this month on tmobile both online and in
stores and this is todd Hazleton with
technobuffalo reporting live from CES
2014 take to get the Toyota for
sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
