to you by full sail university hello
internet and welcome back to another
episode of ask the Buffalo the show
where you can ask me Ashley discover any
question you might have from the wide
world of technology every tuesday we put
up a call for questions on TechnoBuffalo
calm you can leave your question in the
post comment otherwise you can send them
to me anytime of the day or night on
twitter at technobuffalo or at Ashley
ask ewa just use the hashtag ask the
bees so I can see it usually I answer
between three and five questions every
episode so let's get answering because
this is ask the Buffalo at Kelly banks
97 says hey Ashley do you think that the
ipad air was called air because Apple is
planning a larger iPad pro this is an
awesome question because really it kind
of leads us to some even bigger
speculation so I think that that's a
really good idea I think that this is a
potential for an iPad pro that 13 inch
iPad that we're sort of hearing rumors
about that might be unveiled sometime in
the spring now let's move a little
forward with that let's get even crazier
and let's say maybe Apple is planning to
rename their iphone line so maybe this
five or six inch iphone that is being
planned let's say a 5-inch iphone will
be the iphone pro and then maybe they'll
unveil an iphone air next year and we
won't actually see an iphone 6c that's
certainly possible and certainly
something that would be very interesting
to see Apple sort of streamline their
product line up at least the naming of
them so I think that's a really good
question I think you're onto something
at Star Bowl 89 says I have a g4
sidekick and want to upgrade what is a
good gaming android phone to upgrade to
or wait for okay so I thought a lot
about this and I think that obviously
with gaming you're gonna want a bigger
screen so you're also gonna want a lot
of RAM because you're going to want to
run the best games so if you haven't
upgrade available I would probably go
with a nexus 5 or a note 3 I usually
don't recommend the note 3 like off the
top of my head to people but for what
you're looking for
I would say it has a lot of power it's a
great device the screen is huge and I
think you'll get a lot out of it for
gaming so actually I'm really curious as
to what you end up doing so let me know
what you end up doing and what you end
up upgrading to because I'd love to know
how you are enjoying your new phone and
what you decided to go with min dog is
doable us and hopefully I pronounced
that right says hi ru TechnoBuffalo will
make console wars again with ps4 and
xbox one well I cannot confirm nor deny
the existence of a next-gen console wars
however if there was to be a next-gen
console wars if LP it would probably be
announced right on this channel so you
should subscribe to our YouTube channel
to make sure that if there was which
hypothetically it there might not be a
new console wars it would be announced
and you would get the notification
that's all I'm saying hypothetically
speaking Mitch asks hey Ashley do you
think a SmartWatch will be a thing that
stays are just a fad that will quickly
die I think that some features on
smartwatches can be fads for example I
really think that having a camera on
your watch is a really silly thing I
don't think that it's really useful
especially at the speed that smart
watches are at right now so the galaxy
gear the the camera on there isn't very
good and it just kind of grainy pictures
aren't very good it took a while to like
take a picture shutter speed was slow so
but I do think that the watch is really
a timeless accessory no pun intended
that people really enjoy wearing and it
is a fashion statement above other
things sometimes some people say I want
to be fashionable so I will wear this
watch but I do think that over time
we're still going to see smartwatches
but I think that they'll just keep
evolving and we'll see some features
removed like cameras and we'll see some
features added that maybe we haven't
even thought of at this point so it's
for me I like I don't think smart
watches are fat I just think that's the
future of the watch in general but I
also think that there are some features
that are a little bloated I gotta
interrupt the show really quickly and
give a shout-out to our sponsor Full
Sail University obviously apps are huge
you guys they're everywhere we've all
had those ideas that make you say I
should make this a nap Full Sail
universities
line mobile development bachelor's
degree program can teach you how to make
that app from concept to post launch
marketing and even better you do the
whole thing from the comfort of your own
home via full sales online education
platform with full sales mobile dev
program you learn both sides of app
development for iOS and Android create
your app with advanced programming
languages and then launched and managed
the business of your app once it's
complete but Ashley you say I don't have
a good enough computer to run lines of
advanced coding I can't afford a bunch
of cell phones and expensive software
that's totally okay because full sales
project the launch box program gives
students a macbook pro preloaded with
industry software plus iOS and Android
devices so you can test your app so if
you're ready to make that killer app and
you're interested in learning more about
full sales online degree program head
over to full sail edu slash
