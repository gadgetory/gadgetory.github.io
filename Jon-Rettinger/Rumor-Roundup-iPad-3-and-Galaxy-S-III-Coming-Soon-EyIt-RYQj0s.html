revision3 is brought to you by audible
you're watching second of buffalos rumor
roundup on revision3 random
what is going on everybody and welcome
to another installment of rumor roundup
run him up technobuffalo on revision3
i'll tell you what that intro that was a
blast to do the unnamed cowboy was a
good sport about I'll tell you what you
go to these trade shows especially the
ones in a place like Vegas and a lot of
the people work in the show not the
official company representatives but the
models the people hired to work the
booths and worth events like peplum
where this was shot there actually you
know part-time actors actresses that
kind of thing so this guy not only was
he game to to you know be in our goofy
little video there but he was awesome
did you catch the wink at the end there
if not go back and watch it again he was
fantastic you know I just stood there
and got laughs it up anyway but we're
back from CES and right back into the
mix here looking forward to Mobile World
Congress already so we'll round up the
rumors for the week ending today friday
january twentieth two thousand twelve
this episode of rumor roundup
TechnoBuffalo on revision3 is brought to
you by our good friends at audible first
up the ipad 3 the mythical beast which
new reports this week from bloomberg and
others talking about a few things first
of all LTE one of the big reports this
week is that the ipad 3 in addition to
having a Retina Display better cameras
being slightly thicker will also include
LTE support since the ipad 2 will have a
large battery it'll be able to handle
the power constraints that the LTE
network puts on devices so while the
iphone may not be ready for LTE just yet
because the batteries you know so small
I've had no problems big battery let's
do it so iPad through with LTE support
the other rumor this week is that it'll
be announced at a media event in early
februari I don't know if I quite buy
that seems like it's pretty soon then
again all this focus on the digital
textbook would mean the time is ripe
right now for an iPad with a so-called
Retina Display capable about you know
print quality resolution to really have
that full text book print quality
immersive experience on a digital tablet
some interesting rumors in the rumor
mill
we now focus our attention away from CES
and towards mwc the first one comes from
a teaser video that Samsung posted on
their own YouTube channel and there's a
device that some eagle-eyed viewers saw
in that video that doesn't look like any
Samsung device we've yet seen does that
mean that the galaxy s3 is on tap if so
Mobile World Congress would be the ideal
launching pad for it on no details no
nothing the phone itself it doesn't
quite look like it's real there are
little details about it the the way the
bezel is and the rounded corner there's
some other things that you know make it
look like a concept device at best if
it's even you know even real but hey why
not it's a rumor show samsung galaxy s3
at Mobile World Congress and there we
see is the event where the big companies
like Samsung HTC launched their global
flagship devices that trickle out to
carriers across the globe during you
know the rest of the year so we could
see it would make sense galaxy s3 at mwc
speedrunned oh you see some leaked
documents show no fewer than a dozen new
Android devices on Sony's roadmap for
2012 some of which may be launched at
Mobile World Congress notice that I said
Sony not sony ericsson because there's
no more sony ericsson it's officially
now Sony kicking out the mobile phones
mobile devices and all these devices
Android operating system not much else
in the way of details but the names the
code names are awesome my favorite
kumquat I would love to see the Sony
Xperia kumquat come to a US carrier
sometime later this year I don't know if
that's going to happen sony launched a
few new devices at CES last week and
they're looking to kind of claw back
into the mobile game if you will on the
strength of android and possibly also on
the strength of Windows Phone so stay

really say much now but there's
something in the works that's mwc
related technobuffalo related if it
comes together which I think it will
it's going to be really really exciting
it has it's not a promotion it's
something like that it's more to do with
the ever expanding heard and I will
leave it at that but I'm very excited
about what's going on that I think is
going to come to fruition in time from
Mobile World Congress so fingers crossed

just as soon as I can in the meantime
we're going to leave you with another
clip from the pep com show at CES last

roundup stuff so check this out it's

revision3 run them up they're really
stupid be sure to check out my canoas

cars and car technology we made a little
video about it so if you haven't seen
that yet take a look in the meantime I
will leave you with Mike Pearlman from
pep calm at CES thanks to everybody for
