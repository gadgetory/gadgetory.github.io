September everybody I am Robert
Rosenfeld and welcome back to the show
that's gone beyond the headlines and
breaking down the tech news and giving
you the info you really need to know
every Tuesday and every Thursday today
we've got some new images of the pixel
three and what it doesn't have may
surprise you also the one plus 60 is
shaping up to be one exciting phone and
a bendable samsung phone is coming and
sooner than we originally thought we've
got a ton of news to unpack today so
let's get started with it all here's the
lowdown
we've covered the pixel three Excel
leaks pretty extensively here on the
load on but what we haven't seen photos
up before is it's smaller counterparts
the pixel three photo surfaced a few
days ago allegedly showcasing the new
pixel three and would you look at that
there is no not in sight the phone looks
very similar in design to its bigger
brother the three excel it's got the
same frosted matte material for a
wireless charging on the back it's got a
finger reader but this device would have
a smaller 5.5 inch display with the
typical bezels around it and we're not
sure if this phone would have the same
front-facing technology for super
selfies or the rumor and hardware face
ID competitor but it's very likely it
can all be packed in there just built
into the bezels and no knotch google has
taken a lot of heat through the three
excel a phone that still has not even
officially been released so it's really
interesting to see what the company will
eventually end up saying where the
phones are officially released
and speaking of officially being
released that google event is set to
take place in new york city sometime in
early October and I'm curious what you
guys have to say about these leaks I've
heard a lot about the pixel 3 Excel what
are your thoughts on the smaller pixel 3
be kind of choose between two of the
phones which one would you choose and
why is the notch a deal-breaker is a
smaller one better which would you
choose leave a comment down below and
let us know for your chance to be
featured in the next episode lowdown and
I wonder what John thinks about all this
we are going to see how badly people
want a good camera and sake Android cuz
those phones beat ugly ugly by pixel
staining it's like a whole other level
of ugly but those cameras so good and
that was pretty cool thanks so much for
the cameo Jonah by the way guys I'm
eating the Philly on a little secret
today's John's birthday so cinema tweet
wish them happy birthday
they'll appreciate it the long rumored
Samsung phone with a bendable display
may finally become reality in just a few
months
Samsung CEO DJ ko reportedly hinted that
the device may be showcased at the
company's Developer Conference in
November though may not be available for
consumers just yet the rumored new
Galaxy Note phone would have a
seven-inch bendable LED display as its
main attraction and presumably it'll be
packed with powerful specs to accompany
that tablet size phone that can fold
down into a purse or pocket
unfortunately that's all we really know
this phone right now it's been rumored
for years we've seen concept videos and
prototype render drawings but this would
officially be the real deal where
Samsung may actually take the wraps off
it and show it off to everybody but we
don't know if it's going to be a full-on
demo of the phone that can be purchased
right now or just an early look at a
proof of concept that may be available
sometime soon or sometime in the future
we know the 1 plus 60 is coming soon and
some new leaks are giving us some
insight into what this phone is shaping
up to look like and it looks extremely
interesting alleged photos claimed to
show the retail box for the new one plus
60 showcasing the phone's teardrop notch
and in-display fingerprint reader the
two features are Oh many fans have long
been clamoring for and if true the 16
would be one of the only phones to have
this fan favorite combo and also if you
think about it the rumors may not be too
far off this might be totally plausible
we know oneplus as parent company Oppo
recently revealed the F 9 and it's got
that same teardrop notch we could see on
this phone and though vivo is the most
notorious company for they're under
display fingerprint tech we know many
other companies are working on doing the
same thing for their own fleet of
smartphones with awful being among them
the one plus 60 is set to officially
become available sometime this fall and
we'll get all the details on this new
phone and see if those leaks are true or
not on the last episode the lowdown ex
Alex CX had some thoughts on Apple's
upcoming event simply saying this
updated MacBook Air please now more than
ever it looks like this new budget
mascal gear is going to officially
become reality but Apple is notorious
for holding off on Mac hardware upgrades
for their own separate events so don't
expect them next week but look out for
sometime this fall all right everybody
that's all I've got for the lowdown
today thank you as always for watching
and thank Jon again for his cameo in
today's low ton let us know if you guys
want to see more of John in the lowdown
so I've got for today I'll be back here
on Thursday to talk more Czech news
until then have a great day and I'll see
you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
