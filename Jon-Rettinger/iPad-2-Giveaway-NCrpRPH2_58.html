technobuffalo here back with my favorite
kind of video it is a giveaway video and
I want you to win one of these it is an
ipad i want you to have it you can do
things with it you can touch it you can
play games on it you could throw it to
your friends you can sell it you can do
whatever you want but i want you to have
a 16 gig Wi-Fi ipad 2 in black or white
depending whatever color you choose so
stick around for all the details and i
know i say this in all of my giveaway
videos but I say it all the time because
I mean it all the time the giveaways are
a way for me to say thank you you guys
let me in the whole TechnoBuffalo staff
live our dreams driving into work today
thinking that my job was going to
consist of making videos about a tablet
which is something I would it's my dream
and you guys do meet a chance because
you watch the videos you read the site
and you support what we do so during the
bottom of my heart thank you thank you a
million times over thank you anke boys
just a small way that I can sort of show
you thank you as opposed to just me
saying it and showing some lip service
alright so let's talk about the giveaway
and what you gotta do to win we made it
pretty simple for you so we teamed up
with the folks at touch app to give away
a brand-new 16 gig Wi-Fi ipad that's
going to be available to anyone in the
world no matter where you are as long as
you're on this planet you can win I feel
like caveat is that it's going to be a
u.s. bought ipad 2 so if your country
has a different power adapter you may
have to pick up your own power adapter
or you can plug it into your USB port
and charge it that way but you will get
a brand-new 16 gig why buy ipod um ok i
have pet you're gonna get my patent on
my pod bigger prize awesome kinked up
with the folks at touch app i do this
giveaway foes you guys it might not know
a touch app is probably the best
cross-platform chatting application out
there so it has the standard stuff you
expect from a chatting application you
can chat it works with iOS works with an
and it works with blackberry but more
than just being able to send in messages
and get messages back and sort of see
that received and delivered messages it
also lets you send sort of full slide
shows which are kind of neat so let's
say that you are in college and your
first year and you are not stuffing as
much as you should but your mom wants to
know how much you're studying and she
asked you on your touch app hey John how
much are you studying I don't know why
she talks like that ocean types that's
what she does and instead of sending her
pictures what you're really doing you
can send her a whole slideshow of you
studying at the library with your arm
around your study buddy and at the
Bunsen burner Bunsen burning stuff how
do you can censor of all those pictures
and slideshow just like you'd share a
slideshow with friends if they were
there in the room with you it sort of
takes that whole experience almost like
a facebook timeline you get almost full
profile that you can share it's kind of
neat and gives you those whole features
that you'd expect from a chat
application so if you want to give that
a download and you're an iOS user you're
a blackberry user air you are an Android
user link let me down below where i can
just go to touch calm from your mobile
device and download it right there okay
