technobuffalo here Sony's PlayStation 4
event just wrapped up and devout
spoilers they announced the ps4 let me
go ahead and run down everything you
could expect when you finally get to see
it this holiday season so Sony took the
stage about a two and a half hour event
to sort of unveil the ps4 so the good
stuff it is going to be coming holidays
2013 let me talk about what they didn't
show before we get into what they did
cuz that really was a lot of the story
so they did not show the actual console
they didn't mention any sort of price
and they also didn't mention 4k so maybe
we'll see something around the e3 ish
where they finally unveil all that
information with disappointing though to
not see the actual console so what's
going to be controlling that constant
will your brand new DualShock for all
the rumors were true the pictures that
we saw where exactly we ended up getting
it's going to be powered with motion
capabilities and a small touch screen
right above the analog sticks right or
we expect it looks like an evolution of
the DualShock controller which has been
pretty good for Sony over years past so
you're pretty light on specs of
playstation 4 except that's going to
have a supercharged PC architecture x86
CPU enhance PC GPU 8 gigs ram and a
local storage of unknown size so we kind
of knew all that anyway so some of the
cool sup they did announce remote screen
via the PS Vita think about what the wii
u does and put that on the PlayStation
essentially if you've got a Vita and if
the game supports it you be able to take
that game and go with you and play it
anywhere you are so if your wife for
example wants to watch a cooking show or
a wedding show and you want to play good
game you can go ahead and do that
assuming you've got a vida they did say
it's not natively gonna support ps3
games before you get all sad good kind
it was the cloud company that Sony
bought a few months back actually about
a year ago now they did say that you're
going to try to kind of backlog the
entire library essentially be able to
stream the games they didn't give any
information about not to actually be
able to do it but they did make a point
to say that they are
right hopefully we'll be able to do that
that's not the cool stuff we saw when
you download a game you better play it
pretty much instantly you don't have to
wait for all 20 gigs of the game to
download soon as the first bit start you
can actually start playing which is
pretty cool some other neat stuff you
can allow friends to essentially take
over your game and help you so if you're
stuck at a game you need joey davidson
to help you you go ahead and just hit
him up but he could take over for a few
minutes and beat that hard level or beat
the boss for you they showed an absolute
dawn of games I mean a dawn of games
including Killzone game called driveclub
final fantasy is back Diablo destiny so
bungees gone independent working with
Activision that'll be coming to the ps4
and the graphics look as expected
insanely awesome we don't know is what
the output resolution is gonna be if
it's gonna have 4k but the games do look
great think of it as sort of what the
cut screens and ps3 games look like but
assume you can do pretty much all of
that while you are playing so a few
things here obviously the graphics are
going to improve as the console develops
we saw that with the ps3's lifecycle
they didn't give any more information
unfortunately about the console but what
you can expect again it'll be here
holidays of 2013 don't know what's gonna
look like but we do know it's going to
be coming we also don't know price so
all the big questions you wanted to know
only one of them got answered and that
was just the date over all the things
are looking pretty good it's microsoft's
move now to respond with the next
generation xbox but we can finally say
the next generation of consoles is
gumming ps3's yesterday's news xbox 360
yesterday's news is all about this gen
so when you guys think you excited about
the ps4 you're going to upgrade your
gonna not upgrade depending on the price
did you like the games I love to hear
your thoughts on everything Sony and ps4
related seems even weird to say ps4 not
ps3 if you liked the video or you like
the ps3 give us a thumbs up we'd love to
have the support thank you guys for
watching be sure to check us out at
technobuffalo come for ladies and
greatest tech news I'll see you guys
next video
