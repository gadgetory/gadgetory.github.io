to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone walk back there pisode of ask
the Buffalo I am the Buffalo jon
rettinger to show her you can ask me any
question you've got from the Y where the
technology and occasionally outside of
it like this week up this week we're
going to talk about TechnoBuffalo
meetups what phone you should get
netflix killing TVs and all kinds of
other questions right here on asta
Buffalo it's gonna get started if you
want to have a question featured on an
upcoming show every Tuesday we put an
article up on TechnoBuffalo com you can
leave your question right down below in
the comments otherwise any day of the
week any time of day you could send it
to me on twitter at john for lakers or
at TechnoBuffalo and use hashtag ask the
be so first question comes from the
website it comes from Billy Clark hey
John will TechnoBuffalo ever be doing a
meetup it'd be great to meet the fans
and be awesome to meet the staff I'm
totally open to it I'm not I just maybe
I feel like it wouldn't be that exciting
to maybe hang out with all of all of
ourselves all the time but if there's
interest I would absolutely do a meetup
we're sort of split up the office in
Southern California we got some staff in
the East Coast in the Midwest maybe meet
up in la would make sense if you would
come to one and you want to see one you
know please let us know leave in the
comments and if there's enough people at
address that i would love to meet the
audience and meet the fans and just meet
fellow geeks it's fun to sort of nerd
out with like minds so next question
comes from Asher a who s hey John you
get more lag on our next device that any
other phones with similar specs so
Android lag is the thing a lot of people
still believe exists when Android was in
its infancy there was Android lagged the
phones weren't as quick you would scroll
through a website for example on the
phone with lag i'm talking cupcake and
donut version of android modern version
of androids with dual core quad core and
crazy specs there is zero point zero
android lag it doesn't exist anymore at
all and android devices fast anything
else out there so a Nexus device
especially without any sort of fluff on
top of it is crazy fast you'll not have
any lag there whatsoever
question comes from twitter user Hugh
8th here in and asks at John for lakers
thoughts on leaks from a tech journalist
and a tech lovers perspective good bad
or both those are two total perspective
let's start with serve the journalists
and a business owners perspective so
they're super good for content super
good for shows like this talk about new
stuff that's coming out and they're also
kind of honestly very good for business
people are really interested in talking
about it those articles and videos get a
lot of views so you know from one
perspective it's really it's nice from a
tech lovers perspective I still can't
get on board with them I know we
participated I mean it's such a huge
huge contradiction probably little
hypocritical but I used to love the
mystery of a new device leak you know
what was Apple going to do what Samsung
gonna announce what's HTC going to do
next there is ZERO mystery anymore at
all I would wager by time the iphone 6
comes we're going to know everything
about the film Paul I've actually seen
the song with enough there's one or two
of them the all new HTC One that's
probably the lowest one of the most
linked phones in history you know there
really isn't any surprise any more or
any wonder it's more of a formality when
a phone gets announced I'll look people
are waiting for is price and release
date everything else we already know I
don't know I kind of like the Wonder and
then not knowing I like being surprised
by the other side I like having new
stuff to talk about I like geeking out
our respects you know all the new HTC
One it's it's round it looks kind of
like a metal galaxy s5 is that wages she
was going for it kind of gives a lot of
cool things to talk about so co e
different perspectives there hopefully
that helped to answer your question next
question comes from twitter at siemens
one two three asks at john for lakers
what phone are looking forward to in
2014 the answer is a few some of my
favorite phones of 2013 looking forward
to their successors so that would be the
HTC One which I love that I'm super
excited about the all new HTC One with
the dual cameras and sort of the able
ability to focus afterwards think is
really cool I got a baby that moves a
lot which we'll talk about actually the
next question but to be nice be able to
focus make sure that picture is always
going to look sharp so next HTC One
absolutely my is a curious about what
Apple is going to have next I would love
a 5.5 inch iphone i love the phablet
sighs I hope that rumor comes true so
the iphone 6 and last but definitely not
least the new Moto X moto x squared moto
x times 2 curious to see what Lenovo
does it that if it still has that
motorola and google DNA built-in i just
loved the feel of the Moto X it felt
like a next device you can customize we
kind of cool wood why I just loved
everything about it so whatever comes
next I'm really looking forward to
hopefully that helped your question we
stopped the questions for just a second
look at his face I have a problem with
shaving I hate going to store I hate
going to buy razors it just sucks you
gotta Treach to the store you gotta talk
to the person with the bib or try and
find them to get a key to that plastic
razor giant fortress thing then you got
a shell out like 20 30 bucks some
ridiculous shave tech that I don't need
my razor worked fine that's a vibrating
hands or the free and laser pointer
attached to it fortunately though there
is a company doing away with all of that
garbage and ridiculousness itude is
called a Dollar Shave Club and it
couldn't be much simpler than that for a
few bucks a month Dollar Shave Club
ships amazing razors and other bathrooms
stuffs right to your door their blades
are just as good as a big shaved
companies and at that much of the price
total fraction of its really really
reasonable they've got other stuff too
like dr. Carver is easy shea butter to
make your shave even more butter smooth
but do not put it on toast don't that
name deceive you and of course you gotta
try one wife charlie is the new
peppermint if you use a butt wipes for
men that's right I said butt wipes they
tingle in a good way save time save
money he joined now a Dollar Shave Club
calm / technobuffalo reality is buying
razor stings it gets expensive and this
is just an easy convenient way to get
razors and all the stuff that goes with
shaving right to your door this one a
little on the personal side at Flashman
163 asked at john for lakers how was
life with a kid Posey that don't know
I've got a five and a half month old son
if you could tell by the bags under my
eyes it's great I love being a dad the
only downside is one of the downsides I
guess I don't get to see him all that
often we start putting in a bath at like
630 at night using bad use around 750
now don't usually get home until like
six o'clock or
around there sometimes earlier sometimes
later so when we get like an hour and
half with my son and it stinks that the
injuries smiling and giggling and he
recognizes people he started to kind of
Babel a little bit I just I love guinea
chats hang out with them i love sort of
looking at him and seeing little bit of
my wife and sing a little bit of me it's
just that's kind of cool to see like a
little person I still can't believe it
like he exists but one day there was no
person and now there's like an actual
human being that we're responsible for
it is a crazy amount of responsibility I
have never focused more or been more
involved with anybody's bodily fluids
before my life like I am with with my
son whether or not it's stuff exploding
out the back before I would sought a
blowout so I'm gonna happen to my tire
now I know a bullet something very very
different I get peed on every day I get
thrown up on every day and every day I
smile because of it it's just it's
absolutely awesome and I'm loving it oh
I'm not sleeping as much as I used to so
