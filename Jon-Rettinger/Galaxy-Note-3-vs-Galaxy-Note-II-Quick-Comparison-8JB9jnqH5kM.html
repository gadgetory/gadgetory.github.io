checking out a quick comparison of the
note 3 and the note to the galaxy notes
are here in my hands you can see the
note 3 has knocks available now if I
swipe up on now I can't swipe up
anything on the note 2 nothing happens
but if I swipe up on the note 3 we have
my magazine which is a new feature on
the note 3 hopefully we'll be seeing
that across most Galaxy devices they
also are going to have that on the note
10.1 pretty much the same thing in terms
of TouchWiz they've made some changes to
apps like s note so you're going to be
able to check out your binders your
notebooks in a different way it's
definitely a cleaner more beautiful
interface I will say that much in terms
of specs Ross spec wise Hakeem this note
3 is pretty hardcore so it's a bigger
device in terms of screen size is a 5.7
inch screen as opposed to a 5.5 inch
screen on the note 2 but actually the
note 3 is 5 point 9 inches tall and the
note 2 was actually five point nine five
inches tall so it's actually shorter
than the note 2 but they've definitely
taken away some of that bezel space on
the note 2 to just really make room for
that huge 5.7 inch screen this is a new
feature this is Air Command you're going
to now be able to hover with your S Pen
over your device and clicking on that
button will bring up your air command
menu where you get a variety of
different options I'm using right now
screen right to be able to write my name
on the screen it's taken a screencap and
i can write my name on it no three is a
little tiny bit thicker the note 2 is
seven point six millimeters depth wise
and the note 3 is 8 point 3 millimeters
so definitely a little different here on
the cameras you have a 13 megapixel
shooter on the note 3 that's going to
record 4k video if your device has
enough storage as
posed to the note tues 8 megapixel
camera so definitely a difference there
lots of new stuff with the S Pen this is
a big deal they're really making a push
for people to get involved with the
s-pen even more than the original note
and the note 2 so this is a very
exciting thing for them and then of
course the galaxy gear is a companion to
the note 3 so it's definitely a device
that is extremely powerful we're going
to be checking out all kinds of stuff at
IFA this week but this was a big one
this was a big deal let us know what you
think of the note 3 in the comments are
you picking one up and stay tuned
