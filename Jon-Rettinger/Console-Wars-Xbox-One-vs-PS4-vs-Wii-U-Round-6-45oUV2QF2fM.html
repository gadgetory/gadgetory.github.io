is changing and the only question is are
you willing to embrace it welcome back
to the console wars times have
definitely changed before we can proceed
in the heated battle Babar Dumbo and
Timothy Olyphant here demand to be
addressed
elephant number one you're probably
wondering about the long delay between
episodes what can I say a job parenthood
you know how goes life just gets in the
way not enough hours in the day and not
enough days in the year so that's how it
is and probably will be but thanks for
sticking around
the console generation has reached
maturity and for some it seems we are
reaching the end of the line with all
the talk and hints about the NX Nintendo
has made it abundantly clear that
they're winding down activities for the
Wii U and the most annoying part is that
the Wii U featured a great ensemble
collection of superb first party games
that I'd argue are superior compared to
what the original Wii had to offer and
sure there are still some games coming
out this year I mean starfox has shaped
out to be a pretty good Nintendo 64 game
I guess and regarding Zelda Wii U I
think we're looking at a name change we
can surely expect this to be released on
Wii U and the Nintendo NX with priority
on the ladder just to be clear we you
did not tank because it had bad games
that we you tanked because there are
only 13 million of us who are willing to
buy a Nintendo console pretty much
exclusively for first party content I
think at some point Nintendo is going to
have to wake up and realize what made
the NES and Super NES so successful back
in the day it's not because they were
the best hardware is because they had
amazing third-party support the Wii U on
the other hand was initially aimed at a
market that no longer exists the
grannies grandpas and casual gamers who
picked up the phenomenon that was the we
are now all gaming on iOS and Android
devices that casual market is completely
lost and the masses that bought the we
have absolutely zero percent chance of
ever buying a dedicated game system ever
again for the NX to succeed in Tendo is
going to have to get both Wii U audience
and 3ds handheld audience plus probably
the mobile audience on board and that's
a pretty wide spectrum of people to
cater to the soon-to-be announced NX
Hardware I think will reflect this and
it will try to appeal to all parties in
an attempt to restore consumer
confidence Super Mario maker is one of
the phenomenons that Nintendo dare not
leave on a dying planet
form so whatever the specs of the NX are
I think you can expect Mario maker to be
there the standard x86 architecture
would be the smart bets for Nintendo in
terms of backwards compatibility and in
terms of multi-platform portability the
only question is do multi-platform
developers even give a hit
the first console in history to be voted
out of the console wars is the Nintendo
Wii U Mario it's time to put out your
torch it's time to go oh
this particular chart is quite
self-explanatory while the sales in the
Xbox one are by no means bad they're
actually in line with what the Xbox 360
had back in the day but the ps4 sales
are hands-down phenomenal don't the
PlayStation 4 is on track are reaching
ps2 numbers which were thought to be
unattainable in this day and age while
the Xbox one definitely has more than a
fighting chance
Microsoft has started to respond to the
PlayStation 4 success quite reactively
and the company has started to lean
heavily towards Windows 10 PC gaming and
the self-proclaimed Universal Windows
platform high profile game devs
including epics Tim Sweeney have risen
up to speak against the UWP which raises
some alarms as to Microsoft's intentions
you
exclusive games have always been a
selling point of consoles and once Xbox
exclusives including Forza Gears of War
4 and scalebound maybe heading over to
the PC according to Microsoft I was
personally very much looking forward to
playing quantum break on the Xbox one
but now that it's no longer even a timed
exclusive for the Xbox I think I will be
playing this game on my beefy gaming rig
if that is Microsoft and remedy
entertainment managed to get the game
running properly on Windows 10 Microsoft
has also been cleaning house by shutting
down some major first party studios it's
most likely due to the shift in strategy
but I find myself yearning for the
heydays when the devs under Microsoft
Studios put out some of the absolutely
best games in the business epic games
Bungie Lionhead rare missed Walker sure
some of the studios are still around but
their mere shadows of their former
selves luckily there are some new very
interesting IPs on the horizon but there
have been hints from Microsoft that
these will also appear on the PC and in
the Windows 10 store and these recent
shifts and strategy are really raising
some concerns as to why even own an Xbox
one and as of late I think even
Microsoft seems to be having a hard time
explaining it it's clear that Microsoft
wants you to own a surface tablet even
Windows 10 PC and Windows Phone and they
want to achieve this by diverting some
of that Xbox magic and brand value and
of course Xbox resources into the bigger
Windows 10 the ecosystem Soniya team has
gone the exact opposite route the
company has recently disassociated
PlayStation from all the other product
areas so the PlayStation brand and
revenue are not affected by product
areas that aren't doing so well let's
you be the judge are you as an Xbox
gamer benefiting from Xbox being
associated with Windows 10 and if I
recall correctly and I do xbox seem to
be doing quite well without the
association to Windows and the funny
part is that the launch of the Xbox one
was delayed in many countries including
my own because the new Windows based OS
was
ready and don't get me wrong I actually
love windows sent on my PC and I enjoy
Windows Phone but you have to admit that
it's been a hindrance to the Xbox one
Microsoft is also hinted that they are
open for the Xbox one to get upgrade
ability in the near future which may end
up being a game changer not only for the
Xbox but for game consoles in general
Sony has since then countered Microsoft
statements by hinting at a more powerful
PS 4.5 or ps4 Kay so it seems that we
may be at a cusp of an entirely new type
of console war things are going to get
more complex and definitely more
interesting but the whole idea of game
consoles being plug-and-play with no
need to worry about upgrades is I think
the single best reason why I love
consoles in the first place I don't know
about you guys I feel all warm and fuzzy
inside and playing my console look at
the games will be optimized for this
specific set of hardware or an entire
generation it's an environment where
everyone has the exact same experience
it may be somewhat subconscious but that
definitely appeals to me if there is an
enhanced Xbox and a PlayStation 4 K or
4.5 the best thing that I think will
come out of this is that it will end up
extending this console generation by
quite a bit
sure there have been attempts at
upgrading consoles mid generation before
Sega attempted it twice with the Genesis
and Nintendo has done it and is actually
doing it still with the 3ds but none of
these can be touted in success stories
so there are definite risks involved
this episode was originally intended to
compare the UIs of the Xbox one and ps4
consoles but when getting down to the
actual comparing I came to the
realization that 99% of the features are
just graphical and layout changes from
the previous generation which led me to
the question do we even need a PS 5 and
Xbox - if enhanced versions of the
consoles are released or will this serve
as an opportunity for shift and strategy
for Sony and Microsoft all systems now
support an architecture that pretty much
make them backwards compatible out of
box and the OS can be easily upgraded in
both systems so instead of buying a
PlayStation 5 or an Xbox 2 you simply
buy a Playstation or an Xbox which are
refreshed with upgraded GPUs and CPUs
every three or four years for example
the problem will at some point arise
when game simply won't be able to run on
the original systems but this kind of
approach could extend the console
generation in a way that keeps the
console hardware relevant against the
fast iterating mobile and PC hardware
space if the Xbox one does get
upgradability the question is can it
survive as a cheap PC and does it even
need to if there are no exclusives
filled Spencer however has made it clear
that there will not be an Xbox 1.5 but
I'm guessing the cutting the console
lifecycle short for the Xbox one and
perhaps rebranding the Xbox is still a
viable option so why does Sony need an
upgraded console well people seem to
forget that the ps4 does not have 4k HDR
video support because the UHD blu-ray
and high dynamic range video standards
were not finalized when the ps4 launched
Sony still wants to sell TVs and it
probably wants to position the ps4 as an
Ultra High Definition blu-ray player and
the only way you can do that is to
launch a new version of the PlayStation
4 with added support for hdmi 2.0 a
which enables 4k HDR video so I can
pretty much guarantee that that at least
is going to be one of the key features
of an upgraded PlayStation
if Sony as a newer more powerful APU to
the ps4 K they will of course risk
splitting their user base and make
especially the most recent buyers regret
their investment Sony also needs to draw
a clear line between the two consoles so
the ps4 K will probably be priced higher
than the regular budget ps4 whether Sony
upgrades APU 4k resolution for Triple A
games at this price point is still out
of reach
4k demands pretty much quadruple the
processing power and the math just
doesn't add up 4k upscaling however is
likely but the fact is that the adoption
of 4k televisions in homes is still
extremely marginal so I think the
console manufacturers at least at this
stage have very little to gain with 4k
gaming but who needs 4k games can look
this good at 1080p let's go check out
that tower I'll come with for all these
reasons I think it's highly unlikely and
we'll see a $400 console driving
triple-a games at a 4k resolution at
least anytime soon that being said it
would be an optimal time to upgrade the
GPU in the consoles because there is
another very demanding variable in the
mix namely VR
although not as demanding as 4k virtual
reality demands empower under the hood a
PlayStation VR at 400 bucks will play a
pivotal role in the adoption of VR in
general and with the high installed base
of the ps4 Sony may soon find itself in
a position where it can pretty much own
the VR market in 2016
Sony's strong position also gives them
the opportunity to take risks so if they
were to launch an enhanced PlayStation
mid generation this I think would be the
time even though the oculus rift is
equipped with the Xbox one controller
minimum spec requirements for the rift
suggest that the Xbox one hardware is
pretty much out of the equation
so I'm guessing one of the reasons why
Microsoft is considering an Xbox one
upgrade besides to be able to run games
at 1080p is to potentially enable VR
down the line in the form of the oculus
rift the psvr seems to be selling like
hotcakes
so in terms of future prospects the
PlayStation 4's outlook is quite solid
indeed if the software is there and
virtual reality ends up not being a fad
the PSP R has definite potential on
becoming a system seller for the ps4 as
well I really can't find any such
equivalent for the Xbox so the more I
think about it an upgrade that enables
the oculus probably wouldn't be such a
bad idea
Oh beyond the screen but what about the
hololens you asshole world well blend
while the technology is cool and
interesting the application for gaming
are debatable as is the field of view of
the world and the dev kit pricing
suggests that a consumer model is pretty
far away so definitely lots of future
potential but for the Xbox one it's
probably not going to be of much aid
time is going to end yeah - trust me or
what while I would not go out as far as
to say that things are looking a bit
catastrophic for the Xbox one but it's
not looking too terrific either
Microsoft however has the resources to
turn things around
coming into this console generation
Microsoft made a lot of bets that didn't
pay off and these mistakes ended up
costing them a lot of loyal X bots who
moved over to the ps4 and this
ultimately cost them the call duty
partnerships and various other
exclusivity deals during the previous
generation Sony did similar mistakes
they price themselves way too high with
the ps3 and they also made mistakes in
the hardware department by making it too
complex
the ps3's infamous tagline was it only
does everything and gamers they just
wanted to play games
Sony managed to turn things around by
focusing on the essentials namely gaming
you would think of Microsoft could have
learned from Sony's mistakes and
apparently learning from your own
mistakes is proving more concrete is
this the end of the console wars if you
ask me
well certainly not the Battle of the
console wars continues and the future is
unwritten Microsoft definitely has the
resources to turn things around
but the communication from Microsoft is
currently so vague and so ambiguous it's
hard to tell if they themselves know
what the future holds the Xbox but it's
quite clear a playstation will continue
to press hard with laser focus on
delivering great content and more
exclusive games
only time will tell how this plays out
but as it stands Microsoft is in a
position I think where they need to make
a choice either truly believe and commit
to the Xbox or diminish its value and
achievements by forcing it to become a
part of an ecosystem that nobody really
asked for at least of all gamers care
about and I can tell you that there are
enough gaming platforms on the PC so I
complete L need a closed marketplace for
games gaming is why Xbox was once great
at this and certainly not this it's time
to make Xbox great again so this episode
got a bit derailed for my original plan
but this bunch of elephants just needed
to be addressed before we proceed the
console war is changing and this series
will evolve with it no points are
awarded in this round but I will be
continuing the next episode with a more
traditional approach by comparing the
current state of PSN versus Xbox Live
follow me on Twitter I'm happy to answer
any questions that you may have stay
tuned for the next installment of the
console wars
