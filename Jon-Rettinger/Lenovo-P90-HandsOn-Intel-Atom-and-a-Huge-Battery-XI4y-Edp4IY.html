TechnoBuffalo checking out the brand-new
Lenovo p90 it's their second smartphone
running on an Intel Atom processor in
this case it's a Z 35 60 so 64-bit
quad-core up to 1.8 3 gigahertz here
pretty sweet-looking phone I like this
red color on the back you're looking at
13 megapixel camera and with the LED
there it's dual led to a close and then
up front you have a 5 megapixel camera
for selfies you can see that I've talked
about 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on
the left hand side you have these nice
brushed aluminum of buttons for the
volume and the power and on the bottom
you have a micro USB port off to the
left there the pretty sweet-looking
device it's a 5.5 inch display with a
1920 by 1080p display and you'll notice
it's pretty thin that's also got a huge
four thousand milliamp hour battery
which lenovo says lasts a really long
time thanks to that Intel Atom processor
sports LTE networks a single sim card on
this one right there on the right-hand
side and then you're looking at Android
4.4 KitKat on here which runs really
smooth although they say now with Ollie
pop to you it really takes care of that
a 64-bit processor when you open it so
I'm very good eventually so anyway just
a quick look here at the Lenovo t90 this
is thank you guys for watching another
