technobuffalo here since Steve Jobs
passing away yesterday I've been
debating whether or not to make a video
I wanted to be respectful of somebody
passing away and not appear to be trying
to capitalize or gain an audience or
money from from someone's death and
we've sort of been walked in that same
line with with the site as well I just I
wasn't sure what the appropriate thing
to do was but I thought about it for a
while I slept on it and I decided to
make a video obviously this video's not
gonna have any ads on it it's not going
to appear on technobuffalo com just my
thoughts on mr. jobs and his passing so
I never had the privilege of meeting him
so i can't speak to anything personally
but it feels very strange to feel like I
lost a friend especially someone i never
met in a lot of ways Steve Jobs changed
my life before I started getting into
tech and I've talked about this in the
past I was in marketing and I was
working at a job that I was miserable at
and I hated my first video ever on
YouTube was in boxing of the macbook pro
and my first you know couple dozen
videos were primarily based on Apple
products and that started me on this
career path that ultimately led me here
and to techno Buffalo and without that
macbook pro I wouldn't started making
videos i started making them because I
didn't know how to use my computer I
wanted to get a mac padded know how to
use it at all it's my first one so i
figured i'd make videos and it would
teach me how to use it and maybe I could
help some people in the process so
without that macbook pro out there I
never would have started making videos
and I never would have been down the
path that that I am now I was talking
about Steve Jobs passing yesterday to my
dad who appreciates technology but
doesn't know that much about it it's not
his life or world he likened his passing
to actually the death of John Lennon he
said you feel privileged to have been
alive in the generation decades when the
Beatles
there you know I feel like you were part
of something that really helped change
the world whether it's true or not
obviously you weren't personally part or
he wasn't personally part of the Beatles
but I felt like he was part of that
community I think that's the same thing
with Steve Jobs none of us ever knew him
are a lot of us you know never had the
privilege of getting to know him but but
the man changed the world whether you
love or hate Apple products he
definitely changed the way companies to
look at hardware the way companies look
at software he changed a lot of business
models with the proliferation of
vertical integration and he changed the
way that you know smartphone
technologies are used you know maybe you
would have seen some of these
technologies come out if it hadn't been
for Apple maybe we wouldn't have but
history played out the way it did and
the current tech atmosphere exists
because of steve jobs in a lot of ways I
feel like him and people like him are
the modern da Vinci's of our generation
and it's sad when you know some of that
of that stature and that influence
passes away especially passes away at
the age of 56 it's extremely young age
to pass away on a personal note cancer
is something that that's hit my family
and I'm sure has affected a lot of you
as well and to to see someone that
prominence fall victim to cancer is very
awakening you know to know that
everybody is is fragile so while a lot
of us didn't know Steve Jobs personally
I'm sure that all of us have lost
someone in our lives that was important
so maybe we can take his death to not
only remember what he did for the tech
world but also to remember what people
that have passed have done for you maybe
members of your family may be friends
you know or whoever that might be you
know take a moment to remember them what
they meant to you and you know in in
that way you know steve jobs can be
remembered more than just a guy who ran
a tech company can remember more as a
guy who made you remember your
grandparents or made you remember your
great-grandparents
remember your friend who passed away
years ago that's how I'm looking at it
and a lot of ways that kind of makes me
smile to remember people that that I
haven't thought about in years
unfortunately so just my ramblings on it
I will most definitely miss Steve Jobs
even though I never had the the
privilege of meeting him but he affected
my life and left indelible mark on my my
career path and my life again so just my
thoughts I'd love to hear what you guys
think I'll see you the next video bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
