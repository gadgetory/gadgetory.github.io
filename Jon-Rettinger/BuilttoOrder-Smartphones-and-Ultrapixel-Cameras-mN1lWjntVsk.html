to you by 23andme welcome back to the
episode of ask the Buffalo I'm your host
Jon renters to show you could ask any
question you've got from the wide wide
world of technology and sometimes little
outside of it so on this episode of ask
the Buffalo we're gonna talk about
t-mobile's crazy new plans we're going
to talk about Bill to order phones talk
about what goes on behind the scenes
here and how good are the ultrapixel
camera right on the coming HTC devices
this is asked the Buffalo let's go and
get started rishabh sharma who asks do
you think the four ultrapixels will beat
13 megapixels so by 13 megapixels i
think you're asking about the galaxy s4
now what really is yet to be seen I will
say though and we're in New York for the
galaxy s4 event we did shoot some sample
pictures with the s4 and then we shot
some same sample pictures with the HTC
One and they gc1 did a pretty good job
because if you look like right here but
certainly when we get the phones in a
real world environment to test them in
low light and regular light so it's
gonna be very interesting put those to
suck us into head the next question
comes from Crafton d who asks what do
you think about a bill to order
smartphone you leave if there's any
chance for it to become reality than
your future so I think what you're
referring to is Google's alleged ex
project where phones are gonna be built
to order just like a lot of laptops our
model that Dell really helped pioneer
this is a really interesting idea i'm
not sure if it's gonna come to fruition
depends how customers really can get
sophie is customizable eyes do you want
to choose the screen a 720p screen a
1080p screen or low resolution can you
choose the amount of RAM maybe 512 up
the 2gig can you choose a hard drive
they get really granular and you'll be
able to customize everything on the
phone it could be very cool but price
could get out of line really quickly so
there's something in economics called
economy of scale the more you make the
less expensive they are you know you go
to costco and you buy a pallet toilet
paper it's less expensive than buying
just a single roll of toilet paper so
their economy of scales when companies
make phones they make the same phone
goes through assembly line over and over
and over and over again having things be
custom involves little bit of
differences that go into it whether it's
going to be hand different
is where machines can be triggered two
different things it's gonna add to the
cause definitely so I really would keep
a lookout to see how that works but it's
a really cool model and if anybody can
pull it off it's probably google all
right so next question is about what
happens behind the scenes comes from
Josh hey John about how many videos do
you record in one day and how many takes
does it take to get through one video
usually depend on a day generally one to
two videos so film the three a revision
three episodes that's right and just ran
so it's rumor roundup and ask the
Buffalo every Monday Wednesday and
Friday I'll film those few days in
advance he come off the junk watch he'll
do the editing and then whatever else
comes up during the week some new phones
new tablets new news ever else is
interesting we will film I don't have a
set number that i put every week and
usually i can do my videos and generally
one take majority of my videos aren't
scripted the videos that i do have a
script that i use a prompter for giving
my notes or something like rumor roundup
when there are a lot of rumors i want to
make sure i get all the information
correct throw and recite the specs the
phone i don't want to mess something up
so those will have a script every other
video i do is really just coming right
out of my head I'm not an actor so
trying to read from the script just
never sounded overly natural Smee able
to talk from the heart and from my mind
has always worked out better for me so
if it helped ain't your question the
next question comes from Rudy hey John
what do you think of t-mobile's new no
contract strategy and you think the
other carriers will follow that's a
really good question Rudy so if you
don't know t-mobile's branded themselves
the uncarrier essentially what that
means is no more contracts don't to sign
a two-year deal to get a new phone what
you can do is you can walk into a
tmobile store you can pay full price for
a phone they will unlock that phone for
you when you pay full price so if you
want you take it to any carrier you on
that phone and you pay just a monthly
data fee or voice fee or a combination
of both and that's the model but what's
really different about it is that you
can pay for the phone over time too
let's say you want to get a galaxy s
three or four whatever it might be so
you can put a down payment on the phone
you could pay out the rest of that phone
over about a two-year period if you want
so that sounds very similar to a
contract but you could pay that phone
off anytime that you want Denison's you
paid off in full t-mobile will unlock
that phone for you any own it but you're
never locked into a contract which means
you're paying full price for device you
can upgrade anytime you want it's a
really cool model to say okay I own my
phone I'm with tmobile because I want to
be
them and I think that it's a model that
if successful certainly other carriers
will copy I think it's gonna take quite
a while to see if t-mobile can pull it
off so if we that helped and your
question let me step away from the
questions for a min to thank our friends
