Robert Rosenfeld if this is your first
time watching the lowdown you just
happen to stumble across this video on
YouTube welcome thank you so much for
watching this is the show that breaks
down some of the top headlines making
news in the tech world kind of going
beyond the headlines and giving you guys
the information that you really need to
know
and Apple is expected to announce a lot
of new hardware at their New York City
event next Tuesday and if the rumors are
correct the iPad pro may not be the only
new gadget from Apple that may be
stealing the show it looks like there's
gonna be a little bit of something there
for everybody here's everything we are
expecting to see at the event and
everything we think we know about
Apple's fall event happen in next week
here's the lowdown we've been hearing
rumors for a while now of a totally
redesigned to bezel this iPad pro and we
may finally get our first look at this
device next week and we reported the
details of what we should see on these
new devices on last week's slowdown but
in case you missed that episode here's a
quick refresher we're expecting to see
slim bezels and no headphone jack no
home button some new face ID hardware
and a USB C port so that's going to be
replacing the Lightning port that's been
widely used on Apple products for the
past few years and this update alone
sounds like it's gonna be a pretty big
deal but it looks like this will just be
the beginning we're hearing some reports
from credible analyst Ming Chi Kuo that
the iPad Mini will also be receiving an
update making its return with some new
internals for not sure if that will
follow the design trend set by these new
iPad pros or not this is actually kind
of surprising we had heard some recent
reports that the iPad Mini just wasn't
selling well and has not received an
update in well over a year so it would
be surprising to see this new model
especially since it looked like the iPad
Mini was going to be discontinued but a
refresh model is a welcomed addition
besides iPads Apple is expected to
announce some big updates to the Mac
Hardware lineup specifically a new
budget laptop that may come in the form
of a new MacBook Air and an updated pro
focused Mac Mini let's talk first about
the laptop and the MacBook Air by itself
is in desperate need of an update
missing key features like USB C Retina
display and updated Intel processors but
this new laptop would fix all that
allegedly packin some newer internals
are ran a display and may even come with
a redesign to possibly take in some cues
the MacBook but there is very little we
know about this laptop right now though
we are expecting it to come at a bit of
a more budget-conscious price point a
new Mac Mini is also expected to be
unveiled at next week's event and it's
raising a bunch of questions it's
rumored to be heavily focused on the
professional market and should receive
some much-needed updates to the
internals and possibly receive a new
design as well we're expecting it to
pack some options for higher-end
processors some more RAM dedicated GPUs
and the latest and greatest Thunderbolt
i/o but again these are all just
assumptions at this point there's not a
whole lot we actually know and Apple has
reiterated even recently that the Mac
Mini is important to their lineup time
and time again so it'll be interesting
to see if they actually and finally show
off a new Mac Mini and what that new Mac
Mini actually entails rounding out the
list we should see some minor updates
mostly internal ones coming to the iMac
line and maybe even the 12-inch MacBook
and many are hoping many are really
hoping air power may be introduced at
this event as well but we're just gonna
have to wait and see about that
what are you guys looking forward to for
this on that next week are you really
interested in those new redesigned iPad
pros they look really good or you like
me kind of deep down maybe just a little
bit more excited for the new Mac
hardware that we could expect and maybe
even see something that hasn't even been
leaked leave a comment down below and
let us know what you guys are excited
for what you're expecting what you may
or may not buy and why and if you do
leave a comment you could be featured on
the next episode of the lowdown alright
guys that is all I've got for today
thank you as always so much for watching
I'll be back here on Thursday to tackle
more tech news breakdown headlines and
just talk tech like we always do here
thanks for watching guys I'll see you
Thursday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
