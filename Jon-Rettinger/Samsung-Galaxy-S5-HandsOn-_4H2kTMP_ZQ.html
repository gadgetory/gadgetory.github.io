technobuffalo i'm here at Mobile World
Congress checking out the galaxy s5 is
finally here we have a gold model some
other colors are floating around we got
blue and also a grey will launch in any
case let's go through it so you get a
5.1 inch display up front 1080p despite
the rumors that we were going quad HD
it's also ip67 water-resistant so you
see the water resistant cover sort of
the port down there on the bottom for
the micro USB port the volume controls
on the left up top you've got 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and the IR
blaster on the back a 16 megapixel
camera got the LED flash if you look
close it's got these other sensors here
that's because it has a heart rate
monitor on it will show you that in a
bit on the right of power button and not
much else so up front here though the
home button now has a fingerprint
scanner which works with a swipe and
Samsung has a partnership with paypal so
if you're checking out online you can
swipe the home button and pay up top
you've got a different user interface
here but mostly what we've seen before
with s finder though you can search
throughout the entire phone sort of like
a universal search and then Quick
Connect for connecting with your smart
watches which there are a variety of
here if you can see otherwise onboard
you've got Kit Kat and TouchWiz or
nature UX if you will on the left here
my magazines it's not fully working i
was trying earlier but it doesn't really
quite work go home and we'll go over
root 2 s hell 3 point oh and i can show
you real quick the heart rate monitor so
we'll turn it on right so and then you
just put your finger on the back see
it's glowing and it's keeping track in
my heart rate do not move our talk
though so i'm breaking the rules but
we'll let that go
in any case quick look here at the
galaxy s5 no pricing or release date yet
but it does come in three colors like i
was saying grey this gold sort of copper
color which is really nice and then a
blue version as well so highlight
features really what you're looking at
here is the home button the fingerprint
scanner on the back you've got the 16
megapixel camera pretty sweet it's got
Auto HDR so like when you're focusing
actual I'll show you real quick but when
you're focusing and we can't really demo
it but it'll do HDR live as you're as
you're taking a shot so if it's really
bright a really dark and you really want
to see what HDR can do you can see the
head of time as opposed to a lot of
smart phones these days where you take
the picture and then see HDR afterwards
that's a pretty unique feature so that's
a highlight in addition to the heart
rate monitor on the back which is pretty
sweet kitkat everything feels really
really fast under the hood Snapdragon
800 processor you've got 16 32 gigs of
storage expandable you can still pull
off the back even though it's water
resistant which is pretty sweet 2 gigs
of ram and then of course to the 5.1
inch display with 1080p resolution not
too shabby feels really nice it's light
reminds me a lot of the galaxy s4 but
once you're like kind of playing around
with it you get a little bit of speed
even more so than you felt on the galaxy
s4 so really interesting device we can't
wait to play with it a little bit more
but this is todd Hazleton from
