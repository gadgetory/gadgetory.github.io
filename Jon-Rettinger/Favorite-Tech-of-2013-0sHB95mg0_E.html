to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome back to this year-end episode of
retinas rant and it's got nothing ranti
in it at all of looking back on a year
feeling very retrospective I wanted to
give you my top five pieces of
Technology and a little bit of tech
trends that I thought were the best of
the past 12 months it's going to get
started so i want to say these are all
products that i use personally the
company reviewed a ton of stuff i did
include anything on my list and I didn't
get a chance to use and test myself
coming in at number five perhaps a bit
of a surprise Dropcam give you the back
story here there are a ton of web
enabled cameras this is going back
towards a very beginning of the year our
offices had a bit of a security scared I
wanted to try it up our security the
folks who dropped am reached out and I
figured you what we'll try it I had
really low expectations and the camera
ended up being absolutely awesome the UI
is really easy to use it's always
streaming it's got a DVR in the cloud
notifications whenever there's movement
was really helpful for a peace of mind
and then they released at HD version
which made the already pretty solid
quality look even better so I love to
drop cam as a small piece of technology
it's not very expensive in about 18 100
and 150 to 200 bucks that I really loved
and does become invaluable I've got one
now and my son Nathan's nursery so I'm
at work I can log in just you know check
on and make sure things okay coming in
at number for something that initially I
did not gonna be on my list at all this
is the PlayStation 4 I have never really
been a PlayStation person I never liked
playing on the console excited like the
controller all that much I always
thought it was the best value of the
consoles out there you got a ton
especially in the ps3 xbox 360 era you
know you've got a really awesome blu-ray
player and of course all the media
capabilities but ps4 is changed my mind
I really enjoy it I'm not using it for
games i use it for all my streaming now
if you have even touch my apple TV since
I got the ps4 I love it and I'm excited
that it's got a place in my component
Santa for probably the next close to
decade ps4 has been awesome for me
number three the new iPads whether
you're an iPad
air or an ipad mini's better display the
new ipad definitely have a place in my
heart i prefer the meanie ipads i really
loved the original ipad mini now it up
the specs the printers put it on par
with the big size ipads get random
display has been awesome for me if
you're like the bigger size of course
the ipad air make things super super
thin thin bezels and a really light
design i think apple knock this
generation ipads out of the park the
software side that's a whole other
discussion but hardware absolutely love
the iPads next coming in at number two
the Moto X first I think this says a lot
to people in our office one of our main
mobile writers brandon russell and our
managing editor Roy Choi Aran Moto X is
with them with a kiss to pretty much
every single phone i love the fact you
can customize every aspect of it first
time we've really seen that at least
every physical aspect of it I like the
fact explain the United States really
like it's gotten google updates very
very quickly almost as fast Nexus
devices I like the notifications it's
got on there really everything about the
phone is nice it might not have
cutting-edge specs but the experience is
really good and I think that's what
matters most and number one Google Play
phones this was something that really
nobody saw coming essentially all the
flagship phones of the year pretty much
got stock Android edition loves I was
debating about whether or not for an HTC
One at my number one spot or making a
Google Play phones but it turns out i
really liked the HTC One Google Play
edition I really like the galaxy s4
Google Play edition the new phones that
just came out the Xperia you know did
just a giant xperia z or i guess i just
called sony z when i got google played
up i really love that Google is doing
this their contract free relatively
expensive devices you don't decide any
two years of your life away or worried
about you know upgrade plans or when you
kept grade or pay it off over months you
get stock Android you get really quick
upgrades I really like that Google is
doing is hoping to try that continues
we're seeing it sort of branch into
tablets now Oh at the LG G pad and I
think it's a really cool trend and one
of my favorite things to see I love
seeing how technology has been evolving
how consumers are becoming first and
think the google play edition devices
are a really a keen example of that
they're all missing a ton of other
devices that I could have included
really hard to pare down the top five
but for me these are top five that I
really enjoyed the most I thought did
something cool for my life or that
represent
a new trend in the industry altea what
