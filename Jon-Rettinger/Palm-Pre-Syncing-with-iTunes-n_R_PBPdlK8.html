really cool things about the palm pre is
that it syncs with iTunes it actually
tricks the computer into thinking that
Dupre is an ipod for syncing your music
videos and pictures so let me go ahead
and show you how that works so first
we'll just take your micro USB cord and
you'll plug it into your pre and we're
going to pop up there to ask if you want
a media sync USB Drive or just charge
make sure you select media sync and
that's all you got to do on your device
so let's go ahead over to the computer
and check out i tunes so once you've
connected your pre to your computer just
like an iPhone or an iPod iTunes will
open up and immediately recognize it
first time you do it Alaska what you
want to name it I've named mine just
palm pre and you see that it'll show up
right in the tray under palm pre and the
screen looks just like it does when
you're thinking an iPod or an iPhone i
should mention though that this will not
sync your drm material so that means any
music or TV shows or movies that you
bought from the itunes store will not
sync unless your music was itunes plus
and drm free however any cds that you've
ripped or downloaded from other means
we'll work on this perfectly you can
sync your pictures you can sync your
video that doesn't have any restrictions
on it and everything just works nicely
it will not work though with contacts
it's kind of the last caveat with it and
you'll see as you go through you really
have the options just like you would on
any other ipod it tells you that you
know you're running a palm pre the
capacity software version serial number
is xed out and they're all formatted for
windows even though i'm on a mac so you
can select your music your playlists
your movies TV shows that aren't drm
podcasts or photos i saw all my photos
contact will not work and games are
certainly just for the iphone or ipod
but it does really work nice than you
can see right down here that I sunk all
my pictures I've got three and a half
gigs of them got quite a bit of pictures
but everything just worked when you sync
your music though it will sink the music
but it won't sync your metadata so your
play count
playlist will be a little bit screwy
just know they all you're going to do is
get your music on to your pre you're not
going to get any sort of secondary data
that goes with it just something to keep
in mind but it is very nice and really
simple to do the one other caveat with
this is that Apple can break this at any
minute essentially the pre tricks of
computer into thinking it that it is a
ipod so if you do have a pre-order
thinking about getting one I recommend
taking it quick because there's no
guarantee this is going to be lasting it
working for a very long time just
something to keep in mind i know i just
wanted to give you guys a short
demonstration of itunes syncing with the
pre for clues of content be sure to
follow me on twitter twitter com slaps
john for lakers and i will see you in
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
