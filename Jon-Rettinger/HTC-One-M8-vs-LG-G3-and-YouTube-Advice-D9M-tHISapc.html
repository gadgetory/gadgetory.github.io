to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of ask the
Buffalo I'm here of genre injure I am in
the ask the Buffalo chair just to show
you could ask me any question you've got
from the world of technology sometimes
outside of it we take personal questions
here we take other related questions up
this week though it's all tech I'm
talking about advice for aspiring tech
reviewers is installing Yosemite in its
beta format safe we're gonna talk g3 vs
m8 and we're talking surface pro 3 vs.
MacBook Air so that's the buffalo let's
start asking buffalos first question
comes from Twitter oh gee techies asks
at John 4 Lakers what advice can you
give to new and upcoming tech companies
so assume you mean like people want to
check reviewing not like oneplus this
tech startup company I did a whole
series on advice for aspiring youtubers
I get this question all the time I'll
put a link down below check out that
playlist and we'll annotate it here as
well so you can serve see all those all
those videos that go into how to get
products how to try and get sponsors had
generate your content how to sort of
conduct your business sort of ethically
it separate yourself from the rest of
the pack doesn't go and check those out
if you want to get started in tech
reviewing we just want to be a youtuber
in general hopefully it's gonna help you
next question comes from Twitter as well
the art of Joshua asks at John four
Lakers and safe to download OS 10
Yosemite on a primary computers at this
stage of beta hashtag ask to be so until
your story currently it is in beta 4
I've been using it in beta 3 for about
two and a half weeks down then I
upgraded to beta four I've had no issues
at all with OS 10 Yosemite it's now in
public beta you can go ahead and get a
code pretty easily and go ahead and
install it now the one caveat there is
third-party applications that's gonna be
up to that developer that's gonna work
or not work but my experience every
third-party app that I use has worked no
problem at all so if you don't use that
many third-party apps you use all of
Apple's first party stuff then
absolutely jump in I probably I can have
any issues at all you might not even
notice that its beta and a lot of people
have said otherwise my experience has
differed I was having really bad
Wi-Fi issues with my iMac at the office
it was just connecting every three to
four minutes I did all the updates I
went and talked to Apple there was no
fix for it so I figured I would try
Yosemite and see if that fixed it I
couldn't justify getting a new computer
now especially this phase in the life
cycles we got new iMacs coming in new
laptops so I tried it and it fixed the
problem immediately so if you're having
Wi-Fi issues on an iMac or a MacBook Pro
then you might want to consider triangle
cemani hope it up and your question next
one comes from I am Pham 143 at John 4
Lakers HTC One and mate in lg g3 which
one do you prefer
so when I first tried it you seen when I
made a VY dude it's not gonna get any
better than this this is the best foam
that's gonna come out this year then I
got my ends on the LG g3 and I was like
oh sweet sheet three I love your ton of
bezels and your buttons on your back and
I still think that the g3 is the best
phone to come out to here it's gonna be
really really hard to be dead if you're
trying to pick one or the other I'd be
hard-pressed to not recommend you pick
up the LG g3 yourself the questions for

commsta TechnoBuffalo learn something
new and the last question comes from at
tweets of summit who asked at john for
lakers can you recommend the surface pro
3 even when I'm thinking about a MacBook
Air if you ever thinking about a MacBook
Pro I can totally recommend a surface
pro 3 listen I know I'm in the minority
here I understand that
I love the surface pro 3 I like surface
pro 2 I am enamoured though with the 3rd
iteration of it you could easily use it
as a tablet it's light enough getting
the keyboard dock is awesome it's
powerful enough to be used as a full
computer can handle games a little on
the expensive side but I think you can
absolutely use it for the best of both
worlds and I could wholeheartedly
recommend it in fact I've never said
this before since I'm not doing
or video editing if I was getting a new
laptop for the office I would pick up a
surface pro 3 instead of a MacBook Air
or a MacBook Pro the one caveat being
out of wait until the surface pro 3 dock
comes out I could use that with an
external monitor so yes absolutely for
my money I think the middle spec I five
with eight gigs Aramco 256 gig solid
state is like the perfect middle ground
so yet go wrong either way but don't
discount the surface pro 3 you guys for
