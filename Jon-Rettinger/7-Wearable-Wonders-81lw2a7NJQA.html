TechnoBuffalo here wearables are
everywhere it's hard to get away from
them but there are so many out there
it's hard to find the right one for you
so I took the entire wearable market
place and I think seven that offered
different features at varying price
points hopefully helped find one that's
right for you or the holidays coming up
maybe the right one that's a gift you
can tell we got a lot to talk about
I'm gonna put a link to each product
down below and also link to the Amazon
wearable storefront and get information
on not only these but a ton more it's
going to get started so let's kick off
our wearable party with the latest from
TomTom it's their multi-sport cardio GPS
watch this thing looks like it's meant
for the extremes with an integrated
green LED heartrate monitor it will show
you full screen graphics so if you train
and it's three unique training modes it
also has one button controls lets you
easily navigate through menus with just
one button available in five colors if
you really want a rugged durable GPS
stable fitness tracker check the sucker
out misfit isn't just what I was called
through high school they also make a
pretty sweet fitness and sleep monitor
called the shine the misfit shine is an
elegant activity and sleep tracker that
inspires you to live a more active life
shine emits a halo of lights that shows
your progress reading of the activity
goal while looking like a fashionable
accessory shine tracks running walking
cycling swimming up to 50 meters deep
and of course just other sports that you
want to do the misfit app then takes all
your hard work and turns that data into
easy-to-read charts shiny runs on a
replaceable coin cell battery for up to
six months entry gotta worry about
plugging this thing in and charging it
up the reason though that's on the list
for me is a sleep monitoring part I've
struggle with insomnia for the better
part of a decade and the shine tracks
total sleep by breaking the data down
into lightning deep sleep to help gain
insight into one of those important
parts of a healthy lifestyle
you can set sleep goals which have
really helped me it also looks fancy and
does you know I'm all about that knife
next up is the Microsoft band this do
everything wearables on the list because
last CES it proved it's worth adorning
my wrists every single day obviously in
my profession I switched phones a lot
and this is one of the only bands that
worked with almost every OS except for
blackberry meeting if you're using a
Windows Phone Android or iOS you're set
the Microsoft band is one of the sleeper
hits of the year it does everything from
tracking your heart rate steps calories
burn and sleep quality makes you more
productive with email
using calendar alerts at-a-glance
maximize your fitness with guided
workouts 24-hour heart rate monitoring
automatic activity counting and run
mapping take note from set reminders
with your voice in Cortana's personal
assistant on Windows Phone the incoming
calls tech social updates weather in the
ton more all from a very customizable UI
right on your wrist just make sure you
order the right band for your size if
you want to get fancy
maybe the Garmin fennecs 3 is for you
this thing checks most of the tech boxes
1.2 which sunlight visible
high-resolution color chroma optically
bonded display water rated up to 1080 M
omnidirectional steel XO antenna utilize
one or more Wi-Fi hotspots automatically
sync your data with Garmin Connect and
updated software it's got a rechargeable
battery up to 20 hours and training GPS
mode 50 hours in ultra track mode and up
to 6 weeks and just normal tummy the
time watch mode it pretty much just does
everything track your fitness trackers
swim profiles help you navigate it's got
an altimeter barometer and compass all
built in pretty much anything you want
in a wearable fitness tracker the fennec
3 has plus it looks really nice while
looking more like a classic watch than a
wearable the basis peak packs a ton of
features peak if you look at your
activity fitness and sleep along with
SmartWatch notifications so you can just
work towards being a better you while
staying close to what matters tracks
your heartrate all the time 24/7
automatically detects your walks runs
ride and sleep with no button pushing
required so it just knows if you're
being active and with occasional nudges
to help you reach your goals Peaks
always try to help you improve which I
need I sit down way too much it all
comes in a sleek comfortable design that
goes easily from the workout to the
workplace at this point I'm not sure the
Fitbit charge HR you bunch of
introduction but here it is anyway
heart rate activity tracking Auto sleep
silent alarm exercise training caller ID
OLED display Fitbit is the king for a
reason the charge HR is a combination of
function durability that everyone can
find a use for it I haven't got one for
my mom and she loves it last but not
least Garmin is back on list with its
vivofit - it's only activity tracker
with over one year of battery life it's
got a backlit display and a move bar
