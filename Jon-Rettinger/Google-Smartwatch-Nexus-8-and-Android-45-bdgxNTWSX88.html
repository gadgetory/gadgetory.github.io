to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rumor
roundup I'm realest John renders the
show we take all the tech rumors from
the week and there was a lot of them
this week and we smashed it and condense
them in a compactor of one show of rumor
awesomeness up this week it's all about
Google will be talking about the google
smartwatch nexus 8 and when we might see
Android 4.5 this rumor roundup it's
going to get started so it feels good to
finally not have a week talking about
the galaxy s5 so Samsung took all the
mystery out of that so we talked about
the galaxy x 6 I hear it's going to be
made of space-age adamantium it's going
to have a 9 inch screen and be an 8k
display just you heard here first folks
so it's been rumored for a really really
long time the google smartwatch a few
reports of service recently suggesting
that LG is working on a SmartWatch for
the big G technobuffalo can confirm
after speaking to an industry source
that a device is indeed far along in
development right now it appears that
google searching for OEMs to build smart
watches but LG is definitely on board
and has developed a prototype device our
sources have said HTC's also been
rumored as a possible OEM by bloomberg
but if I was a betting man I'd bet up on
a coming from LG additionally the watch
will make its debut during Google's IO
developers conference in June so not
even that far away what I've comes to
wearables little design is obviously
important since it's gonna be on you and
be seen all the time we're told it looks
a little bit like the sony smartwatch
meaning it's got a square display
instead of a curved or rounded one
making it more in line of the existing
smartwatches on the market also it will
have an always-on access to Google now
which makes total sense similar to the
Moto X which means you just speak
commands at any time like dick tracing
just talk to it a color screen is also
on board size we still don't know yet
those you'd like to customize though a
simple strap will be here as opposed to
anything special like maybe the qualcomm
toq got the battery built in so we're
thinking about a number of
rubber plastic it's probably going to be
the go to strap option the device does
not have a camera we are told it it
doesn't appear that will also be able to
play skulls and instead I'll just really
receive notifications from your Android
smartphones notification machine we
don't hear anything about iOS support
but I wouldn't bet the house on that so
if that wasn't enough google smartwatch
rumors we also have a bit more
TechnoBuffalo broke the story that
Google is going to announce its
SmartWatch OS sometime in the spring
before I oh right now it looks like the
time frame will fall between March and
May again ahead of the i/o conference
the company will announce the operating
system so that additional OEMs can get
on board so that apps are ready when the
vices finally hit the market we take a
minute to thank our friends and sponsors
at GoDaddy it's go time and go daddy is
here to help you kick butt online if you
always want to start a website now it's
a pretty good time you can pick your own
com for like two dollars and ninety-five
cents to do it visit godaddy.com enter
promo code techno 295 to get your com
for again just two dollars 95 cents
although some limitations may apply if
you want to start your brand new website
go ahead and do it now is it time be an
entrepreneur create your own blog
everybody know what you think about your
turtle collection again that is techno
295 you too tall or 95 sent URL back to
the video let's just keep it with Google
while we're here a google reportedly has
plans to ditch its Nexus 7 this summer
instead explore the less competitive
8-inch market according to an unnamed
Google Dublin employee the search giant
will completely stop development of the
Nexus 7 because the market is SuperDuper
saturated with 7-inch tablets curiously
though the rumor states advice to be
unveiled in July alongside Android 4.5
said make an appearance at i/o in June
which looks like it's going to be a ton
of stuff coming out at i/o anyway
mysterious device will allegedly be
developed by asus they've been
manufacturing a partner of Google's for
quite a while currently the most notable
8 inch tablets made by samsung and LG
well Apple's iPad Mini comes pretty
close at seven point nine inches also
Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX is 8.9 so a ton
of competition in the 8-inch market
virtually no details this alleged nexus
8 or share
presumably it would launch with Google's
latest version of Android Android 4.5
which we also know between this much and
this much about no other details were
provided by that source and fortunately
so it's going to be a busy first half of
the year for Google we're going to get a
SmartWatch Android 4.5 might see the new
Nexus eight although I'm not tapping the
Nexus 10 hear rumors of a new one of
those coming for quite a while we still
have not yet seen it I would bank on
that coming at il so what do you guys
think google smartwatch i think if any
company could pull it off Google's
probably one of the ones that could
looks like it's going to be just
notification machine so a different
approach then what Samsung is taken with
its gear line of smart wearables I like
notifications I really liked it on the
pebble I liked it on the qualcomm toq
this might be really the next step and
having a full app store could be really
cool as well but one who you guys think
leave the comments right down below you
excited for a SmartWatch you're not
excited for smartwatch and we're excited
about that 8-inch tablet let me know
what you think until next time I am jon
rettinger from technobuffalo see you
