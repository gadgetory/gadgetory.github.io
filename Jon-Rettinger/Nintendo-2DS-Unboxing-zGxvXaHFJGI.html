we have the Nintendo 2ds ton box a
really interesting move by Nintendo not
want anybody really guessed they would
make they took the 3ds remove the 3d and
then took out the hinges it's a really
actually interesting device and I'm kind
of excited to unbox it so let's open up
and see what's inside here it is the 2d
s we got ours in crimson red it's really
interesting device we are kind of
thrilled to open it best of both best of
two worlds I should say and on the front
of the box you can see it's this place
all games in 2d so if you were ever
confused about the name 2d s there is
now no more confusion you can play three
DS and DS games but they will be in two
dimensions you don't have a 3d slider
like you would on the 3ds obviously
let's pop this box open and see what we
got this is a very good box here all
right so we have some 3ds AR cards it's
got a little pack of AR cards here there
is a camera on the back of this so you
will be able to play AR games and of
course the Nintendo Club your manuals
all that good stuff your charger so
here's your charger all the good things
and done filled um
the 2d yes here it is wow this thing is
actually really cool it's definitely on
first impressions excuse me it doesn't
have the same sort of premium feel that
the 3ds does it definitely is a little
bit cheaper but it's really cool and
obviously I mean if you have even adult
hands they fit pretty well like right
here on the sides here's the back so
it's not a full red it's it's got this
nice two-tone color to it I've got your
stylus right here in the corner or on
the side in the middle and here's your
SD card slot right here this one comes
with four gig SD card so if you were
during about that on this side on the
other side you've got your volume again
not quite the premium feel that the 3ds
has or the 3dsxl
the buttons do feel a little bit the
bumpers feel a little bit cheaper than
normal as your cartridge slot AC adapter
slot and that's pretty much it you got
your dual dual cameras our 3d pictures
not sure why they included that it's
kind of weird but maybe for some of the
games I guess it requires software wise
a camera gear front-facing camera and of
course the two screens I I believe if
I'm not mistaken this is actually all
one screen and it's just separated right
here but kind of a strange design
decision but you know Nintendo isn't not
isn't exactly known for you know status
quo design decisions so we'll give them
that the screen itself is the top one is
a three and a half inch 400 by 240
display and then the bottom is a
three-inch 320 by 240 display so 1300
milliamp hour battery inside here so you
are not going to be you're not going to
be without your three or two TS for too
long I here's your headphone jack 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and you have a
sleep toggle because obviously you can't
close it
no clamshell no clamshell action here be
able to put it sleep wake it up all the
good stuff if for anybody who cares has
a dual core ARM processor so if you're
wondering what is inside this thing that
is what's in there it's available right
now you can go get one they are only a
hundred and twenty-nine ninety-nine so
if you've ever been wanting to get in on
the the DS bandwagon this is a really
good entry point if you haven't done
that before joystick feels pretty good
it's pretty it's tight
definitely responsive and it has a
really nice sort of softer rubber finish
which is very nice for long play
sessions of course these are released to
coincide with the launch of Pokemon X&amp;amp;Y
which is a very big deal and our very
own joy Davidson will be writing up a
review for that as well as for both
games I should say but same standard
stuff we've seen from Nintendo pretty
cool we're gonna be putting this thing
through its paces if you guys have any
questions leave them down below and if
you like for your sake it's the thumbs
up on the video and subscribe to the
YouTube channel that's it for this one
guy
see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
