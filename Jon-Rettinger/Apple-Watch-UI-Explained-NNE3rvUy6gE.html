TechnoBuffalo here the UI on the Apple
watch is unlike anything we've ever seen
from Apple and because of that it could
be a little bit hard to understand and
figure out what does what think about
getting the Apple watch or maybe you
just picked one up I thought I'd give
you guys a UI tour and show you what
does what what turning the crown does
what pushing it in double tapping all
that kind of stuff is going to do let's
start with the home screen
so the screen here has something that's
called force touch essentially if you
tap it you can go and open something up
so if I want to open my activity monitor
I could go ahead and tap that but if I
push down and push down harder you can
access other menu options that'll work
throughout the entire phone though it's
a bit inconsistent with what apps are
gonna use it so from the home screen
here you can customize the home screen
any way you want so we'll go ahead and
select the one that I've got called
modular and you can pick what you want
to show so I've got calendar showing up
there you can pick a whole bunch of
different options you can do so for each
of those little quadrants you find what
you want
push the crown in push it again and you
are good to go so much like your phone
this has notifications if you just swipe
down from the top you can access them
and you can see what you have scroll
through them all swipe up and it'll go
away if you want to look at glances and
you control glances from your phone if
you swipe up you can see what you've got
set in glances you can set much more on
your phones actually going to show here
so bear in mind you're only gonna see
the first few so use them sparingly
they're kind of like little widgets I've
got mine customized a little bit I'll go
through and set them a little bit more
the first one it's always gonna pop up
though these shortcuts so if you want to
say it's just vibrate if you want
airplane mode
do not disturb or turn off the
notifications you can do that right here
and swipe that to go away so you've got
this digital crowns crowns pretty
familiar if you've ever used sort of an
old regular watch but this one does a
lot more so if you push it once while
you have your home screen on its gonna
take you to the apps and here you can
sort of scroll around to see what apps
you have you can select one if you want
or if it's you got big fat thumbs you
can go ahead and zoom in a little bit
and it'll open the one that's served in
the middle you can course zoom out as
well to see all of them right there
we'll go ahead and push that once and
that's gonna take you back to the home
screen they also do other things too so
if you double tap it it's gonna open
your last used app so here
my activity monitor I just set it up so
don't judge me by my lack of inactivity
and if you go ahead and long press it
you're gonna get serious so go ahead and
go back again to go home long press it
and this is where series gonna live and
so you can do a lot of things most of
stuff you can do on your your phone I
can also open apps as well so long press
it open one password it'll go ahead and
open whatever you asked it to do so if
you want to know the weather you want to
set a timer you can do all of that using
Siri if you don't want to go through and
sort of go through all those apps you
can be a bit hard to figure out what
your app is what you can customize where
the apps show up though on your phone so
if you want to use settings in the
middle or phone calls in the middle now
you can go ahead and customize that as
well and again you keep digital crown to
zoom in you're gonna want to fight the
urge sort of used to thing or so zoom
it's gonna sort of cover the screen
Apple encouraged you to use one finger
as you do your so we'll go back home
there's another button on the right hand
side that does a lot of different things
to pressing it once is gonna go to your
favorite dials by default it'll pull in
what you've got set as your favorites on
your iPhone but you can customize what
shows up here how many you want or how
many don't want go and select we're
ringing around here if I want to go and
select office for example and I could
tap that and I could call the office
directly or message them if you wanted
mess somebody else who has an Apple
watch another icon will show up in the
middle that's where you can doodle
things or send your heart monitor and of
course your Apple watch can also be used
to make and receive phone calls it has a
speaker built-in and a microphone so you
don't hold it up to your ear are you to
talk to like you would any sort of
external speaker
so I got Ralph calling me I'll go ahead
and answer that and now I am talking to
Ralph hi Ralph so now we're having a
phone call you can adjust the volume
using the digital crown you can mute it
or when you're done just hang up bye
Ralph and go ahead and just hang up
right there and here we are back at the
home screen if you double tap that
button on the bottom then take you to
Apple pay and you set up Apple pay
through the Apple watch app on your
phone
not through the passbook app as you
would use Apple pay on your phone and if
you long press the buttons gonna be sort
of your power buttons where you can turn
it off or enter power reserved no it's
actually just gonna show you the time
it's gonna reboot down and then boot
back up into power Reserve you could
turn that off and go back into regular
mode by holding down that button again
so there's obviously a lot of stuff you
can do with your Apple watch but this is
just sort of a general UI over overview
how to do things what does what you know
how to make sense of absolutely
everything here a UI here is not overly
intuitive it's a brand new user
interface with brand new ways to
interact with your device so you
definitely want to use to watch for a
couple days to learn what's gonna do
what I'm a self a cheat sheet but
perhaps a trial and error is the best
way to go thank you guys for watching
hope you enjoyed give the video a thumbs
up we always appreciate it until next
time I'm John render from TechnoBuffalo
so you guys next one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
