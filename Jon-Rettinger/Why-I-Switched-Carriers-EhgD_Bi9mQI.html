sponsored by University of Phoenix I'm
actually going back to school to try and
learn how to make my company my family
and just general internet usage
experience safer you undersea a Phoenix
waived all fees for the course I'm
taking and if you want to learn more be
sure to stay tuned to the end of the
video there's not much allegiance when
it comes to cell carriers carriers are
offering crazy promotions it seems like
we're only a few months away from
t-mobile offering to pay your mortgage
if you switch there's a lot of
temptations to find a better deal and
find better service I don't want to talk
about my care experience because I've
actually switched carriers three times
over the past like 12 13 inch months and
I've tried all four carriers it was an
odyssey to finally find a situation that
worked we just have a show on
TechnoBuffalo called retinues rarities
got to talk about some experiences that
going on so I thought this be a good
time to bring it back in the caveats
here cell service is gonna vary
depending on where you live but I would
wager you won't have it as bad as I did
because I got zero cell service so if
you get like one bar we're using old
version of iOS one ball of service you
already better off than I was so doing a
story about how I came to where I'm at
and my Odyssey of horrible customer
service and things I'd learned about
each carrier there's been a few years
since I last did a strip carrier switch
video and after that I kind of just
settled in with AT&amp;amp;T
it wasn't great it wasn't bad it was
constantly good which is pretty much the
best you can ask when it comes to cell
carriers but then my wife and I and my
kids we moved moved to a new house and
it was a new construction area where
there's a former Marine base there so we
didn't get very good cell service so I
checked 18 T when we moved and I got
maybe one bar service and it would drop
to none I just tried to use Wi-Fi
calling I thought that would be enough
and my Wi-Fi calling experience was
really really inconsistent it was
dropping calls or his echoes on both
ends if I left the house and like walked
outside or drove away while still on a
call it would drop it just didn't give
for reliable cell experience especially
on my cell phone is my primary phone so
being a techno buff away the privilege
of being able to test all cell carriers
so I brought home a Verizon SIM card
t-mobile SIM card to sprint sim card and
the only one that worked the Katie
consistent service was Verizon so
that made life pretty easy as I did to
switch to Verizon and for the better
part of four months it worked I didn't
get the best service sometimes it
dropped calls but it was fine I was able
to use my phone which is what mattered
but again I was in a new construction
area and houses got built behind me and
I guess the service was so weak to those
houses went up my cell servers went away
with Mariah and I was bummed and I
didn't really want to change carriers
again because it's kind of a hassle to
go through so I reached out to Verizon
customer service on Twitter and I was
like hey here's what's going on
can you help me so I asked if they had
any sort of cell extender you know those
little towers you can plug into your
router and it'll sort of blanket your
house you're here with some sort of cell
service and they said yes they do and I
was like awesome please send me one
they're like no problem that'll be $250
and it's gonna be 3G not only did I not
want 3G in 2018 it seemed ridiculous to
have to pay for it to fix a carrier
spotty issue especially when he went to
my address on their map but it looked
like service was perfect so reach out to
t-mobile and I was like here's my
problem can you solve it and they're
like yes actually we have a 4G LTE cell
tower you plug into your router it will
blanket your house in LTE which sounded
awesome I said how much is it now like
it's free just a twenty five dollar
deposit it's like great I brought one
home I picked it up from the store I
tested it and suddenly I went from no
service to full LTE and it was awesome
so made my decision
pretty simple so now after I've switched
I did see that Verizon is offering
they've updated finally their 3G tower
to be an LTE tower but you still have to
pay for it which is a bummer and I I
gave t-mobile credit I looked up the
model of this tower it's about five
hundred bucks and they've just given
these things out I wanted just to share
my story with you guys cuz I know I'm
not alone trying to find a good cell
carrier and I will say it's been nice I
don't have much loyalty if suddenly
Verizon offered something better or
Sprint or AT&amp;amp;T offered something awesome
I would jump in a heartbeat I just want
to make good calls in my house and I
want to get the best deal probably like
you guys so switching carriers was
an arduous kind of tedious task but it
did help me find a solution and I try to
find solutions for a lot of things in my
life and one solution I've been trying
to find is a big gap in my knowledge
when it comes to protecting my website
protecting the users and being able to
make sure the site can stay up so I'm
talking about cyber security so I
decided to go back to school I don't
know much about cybersecurity which is
almost embarrassing to admit from
somebody who runs a website we've had
issues in the past and her site got
hacked I had to rely our developer to
fix the problem I didn't speak that
language so I really wanted to try and
sort of speak at least educate myself so
I am now 20% through a five week course
from University of Phoenix it was my
first time taking an online course so it
was kind of an interesting transition to
see how that worked there portal is
really good and I think the best part is
certainly the quality of the course is
really helpful but also I can do it on
my own time
I obviously worked I got kids at home
I'm not overflowing with time where I
could go to class and be there at that
time so I got the flexibility to take it
or as I need to and take it in chunks
whenever I have some time or more
recently about with insomnia I can spend
the hours of 3:00 to 5:00 a.m. working
on the course and it's helped me
directly so now when I have my weekly
meetings our developer I can talk to him
I can say what are you doing to mitigate
this issue and he can respond
if this sounds interesting to you and
maybe you want to prepare yourself for
another job or you want to better
yourself or maybe consider running a
business and just want to make sure
that's gonna be secure I'll link to the
course that I'm taking down below peace
you guys want to learn some more all
right so between cybersecurity and
changing carriers you got to know me and
my struggle is a little bit more I love
these riff style videos where I can just
sort of tell you a story that's going on
or something that happened to me good or
bad hope you guys liked this - oh Pew
enjoy the idea of bringing it back to
the video a thumbs up all that other
stuff please that YouTube tells us to do
because they're not notifying you of
subscriptions anymore so subscribe and
hit the bell and of course come back for
a ton more video content I got some
really cool stuff coming up till next
time I am John ready from TechnoBuffalo
and I'm happy I can make a phone call
from my house
so my parents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
