comm here and you might notice I have a
little friend behind me this is the
sharp 8 series 60-inch Aquos 3d Smart TV
so let's take a look shall we
okay so this 1080p LED TV is kind of
awesome it's part of Sharps newest line
of Smart TVs the design is obviously
really sleek it has a thin brushed
aluminum frame that doesn't distract at
all from your viewing enjoyment which is
nice and a stand to match and it's got a
lot of style so that's always a nice
thing when you are searching for a new
television as for picture quality there
is a lot happening under the hood of
this TV this model uses quattron color
technology so by adding 2 million yellow
subpixels sharp claims you'll see a more
realistic picture I can't say one way or
another things look more realistic
because really who knows what that means
but it does actually look extremely good
so maybe sharp is on to something
there's a 12 million to 1 contrast ratio
240 hertz refresh rate and a dual-core
processor powering the set moving on to
the 3d on this bad boy it's actually
quite good I'm pretty skeptical of 3d
TVs because I find the picture usually
way too dark for my eyes to see
everything on the screen properly but I
will admit I found myself enjoying a
couple of movies in 3d using this set a
sharp uses a technology they call
quattron 3d that surprise apparently
adds yellow pixel to the standard RGB
mix you'd see in a normal television I'm
guessing that's why the picture looked
so much brighter and it's one of the few
TVs that actually made me think about
buying a 3d set am I totally convinced
on 3d not quite using 3d glasses is
still really annoying especially if you
wear glasses at home to watch TV and
it's even worse if you wear huge glasses
to see with like I do
lastly the smart part of this TV so
sharp offers a full suite of Smart TV
apps directly through your TV which is
pretty convenient for any new TV buyer
but not anything we haven't seen before
in smart televisions unfortunately if
you've had a Roku or an Apple TV for a
while you may not get as much use out of
that part of this TV which was the case
for me Oh sharp offers a remote control
app for iOS and Android smartphones so
you'll never have to fight over the
remote again because everyone can have
one on the couch now so in short yellow
pixels are good 3d still iffy and this
TV looks pretty freakin awesome in your
room the price is a little bit painful
the MSRP is 20 to 9999 but I did see
some sales going around on the web for
for you if you're so inclined you can
probably find a decent deal if you look
around I should you wait for UHD TVs
this is a big question lots people have
been asking well that I can't answer
because nobody really knows how fast
networks and studios are gonna start
recording in 4k and then on top of that
we don't also know how long it will take
for UHD TVs to start landing in the same
price zones as a set like this so take
that advice for what it's worth
it's been a long time since you've
upgraded this might be a really
excellent choice for you but if you just
upgraded last year maybe I'd wait for
you HD to hit more consumer friendly
prices and then go with that well that's
