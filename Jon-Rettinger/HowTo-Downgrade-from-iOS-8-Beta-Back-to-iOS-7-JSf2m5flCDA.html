from technobuffalo and today we'll be
giving you guys a quick tutorial on how
to downgrade your iOS device from the
latest iOS 8 beta down to iOS 7 we've
been testing out iOS 8 beta 4 since it
came out last week and we actually did a
short video on some of the new features
from the latest beta so you can check
that out in the link down below of
course with any beta software you can
always expect bugs and other issues in
the time i've been using iOS 8 beta for
it's been particularly bad for me I've
been getting random reboots freezes
slowness and other issues and I can see
the other users are getting the same
thing but luckily it's pretty easy to
downgrade so the first thing you have to
do is make sure you backup all your data
which you can do either through iCloud
or on your computer via iTunes take note
though you can't restore any of your
data coming from iOS 8 down iOS 7 if you
did upgrade from iOS 7 all your previous
backup sprite or iOS 8 should be
restored just fine and the second thing
you'll need to do is disable Find My
iPhone on your iOS device if you have it
enabled so go ahead and disable that
right now so once you disable Find My
iPhone the next thing you have to do is
download the right ipsw firmware in this
case we have an iphone 5s from AT&amp;amp;T and
will leave a link down below this video
where you can find all the necessary
download links so after you downloaded
file connect your iPhone your computer
and once you see that your iphones
connected click on it and hold alt
option if you're on a Mac or the shift
key if you're using Windows then click
check for an update when the new window
pops up look for the ipsw file that you
just downloaded and double-click the
file so once it starts to downgrade
don't unplug your device let it sit
there and let your device do its thing
your iOS device will eventually turn off
and on again at one point and you need
to unlock your device just to set it up
you can either set it up as a new iphone
if you'd like and just input your iCloud
account to get all your contacts back or
if you have any previous backups on
iTunes and just restore it from there
after that your device should be as it
was before you install the beta and
hopefully bug free hope you guys find
this quick little tutorial helpful if
you guys have any questions you can
always leave a comment down below this
video or send it over on Twitter and as
always on mark than sagging for
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you guys in the
next video hey thanks for watching this
