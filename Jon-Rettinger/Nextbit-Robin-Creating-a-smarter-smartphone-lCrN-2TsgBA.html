TechnoBuffalo and as you guys know I'm
huge into the democratization of the
smartphone market and we're very lucky
today to have a handful of guests from
none other than next bit if you've been
paying attention to the site been paying
attention to the Internet you might have
seen the next bit Robin hit the web's
and we're talking with some of the folks
on the team you should see them right
here right now why don't you go ahead
and reduce yourselves sure hi I'm Tom
and I'm the CEO co-founder of next it
I'm Mike CTO and co-founder awesome it's
a pleasure to have you guys here and I
figure we'll just get right into it
we've we barely heard anything but just
rumblings before the Kickstarter hit I
know I saw my buddy Ryan block tweet
something about the phone that was the
first that I had heard about it pretty
impressive you guys were able to keep it
under wraps for quite that long but
since we don't really know all that much
about you guys are about the company why
don't we just start there once you tell
us about where next bit started and how
you guys all wind up working together
where you come from
sure so Mike and I have actually been
working together for almost eight years
now I want to say seven years we
actually met on the Android team at
Google back around 2007 and so we we
were we work together on Android through
summer of 2010 so that was like after
droid after Mexico on and everything and
then left we had a startup called 3lm
that we was also doing Android stuff did
that for a while that I ended up at
Motorola and Google bought Motorola so
ended up back at Google and then then we
started next bit yeah awesome so you
started a next bit how what was that
process like what was the impetus for
trying to create something like the
Robin we essentially which came first
next bit or the Robin next bit and it's
actually Mike's original concept you
want to talk a little bit about kind of
the beginning of the company in the
business yeah so this is maybe around
2000 I want to say 2011 or 2012
somewhere in that timeframe that I
became really addicted to Angry Birds I
just got really obsessed with that game
being a a gadget enthusiast myself I
love to upgrade the latest and greatest
devices and I actually found it very
frustrating I couldn't understand why
why would I upgrade to a new phone I
lost all my levels I actually found
myself not wanting to upgrade to the
latest and greatest phones and I started
thinking more like you know looking at
the physical realities of where
technology is today connectivity you
know the processing power of my devices
the cloud all that I could it didn't
seem I felt like at least from the
software perspective all this should be
possible right and really what if he
kind of took the cloud and really
embedded it into the OS itself to
provide a more seamless experience not
just for transitioning between your
devices but in a way you can even exceed
the specs of your device like you should
never have to worry about running out of
space on your phone I found it kind of
silly that every time I went to go take
a video or a picture and my phone was
out of space I would get this error
message and I had you know hundreds of
gigs and Dropbox I had one terabyte of
space and Google Drive and I had all
this cloud storage but I was still
running into storage problems and this
kind of you know really led us to the
next bit so that sounds I mean that
makes perfect sense to me let's talk
about the software for just a minute
you know you decided this is a solution
that you wanted to come up with a
problem that you wanted to solve what
was your approach in terms of hitting
Android trying to take that cutting out
the things you didn't need and sticking
stuff that you needed inside of it what
was your approach in terms of how much
you wanted to change how close to stock
you wanted to stay and things of that
nature yeah I mean coming from Android
team we didn't really want to change
anything more than we really needed to
right so I think part of that is having
that understanding of of the system I
think you know shift 1.0 and worked on
it for numerous years so in terms of a
technology approach you really wanted to
focus on where the key areas that we
want to just improve upon to enable this
type of experience and let's just tackle
that other areas let's leave it as stock
as possible because there's a lot of
great stuff that the team in Mountain
View has worked on
people contributed to the open source
project we should leverage that like
there's no reason to reinvent the wheel
yeah stick with what works that makes
perfect sense so what can we kind of
expect to see in terms of the changes
that you have made what's what's kind of
like the biggest departure that we're
gonna find in the Robin OS is that is
there a name by the way
no we haven't actually named the us it
really is it's Android with with some
modifications and enhancements and what
we call smart storage right so what you
know the modifications we make there we
like to call them surgical modifications
right in the framework we try and touch
as little as possible and we try and
leave the experience as tough as
possible but there is a different
paradigm here right so the way you know
Mike was talking about you know there's
cloud storage today you have Dropbox you
have Google Drive you have a bunch of
solutions but they don't actually
fundamentally solve the problem of not
having you run out of space on your
phone because they're essentially
desktop Aero solutions right these are
all you know concepts or products that
got developed to solve desktop time
solutions of like and I have a file on
my work PC I want to access it on my
home laptop when I'm watching a movie or
something like that there weren't really
built email with mobile in mind start
with them so smart storage for us it's
kind of like the next generation it's
like okay on a mobile phone I'm not
thinking about well I have a class
system with folders and directory and
I'm going to go in and open a folder
that's gonna be my folder of things that
I can also see in my other you know my
PC or things like that right on phones
you have apps you have multimedia like
pictures and videos that you tape right
and you run out of space right and so
how do we solve that problem right and
so all of the the tweaks that we've made
they're either you know operating system
you know framework level changes that
enable hooks or their UI changes that
let you understand that a you know in
the beginning of using your phone it's
just like the normal phone eventually
you're gonna run out of space like
everybody does on their phones at that
point it's gonna be a little bit
different because we're going to
intelligently move things off of your
phone that we think you don't need
anymore for example will downsample hold
photos actually have screen resolution
on the device but the full res will be
in the cloud or will make will take off
apks that will leave a shadow down icon
you'll see that in the demo and a little
bit later right where it's kind of
grayed out and so the experience we're
trying to say is
have this storage locker in the cloud
that you move things to and from you
just have your phone and when you're
offline or you're not trying to access
the cloud or anything your phone is your
32 gigs of local and anything that's on
it one or whatever you do but when
you're online your phone is actually now
100 gigabyte phone and it's all there if
you want to access it right so you can
always tap on a great icon and the app
will be there and you don't lose any
progress in your state you don't lose
your and your brave levels you don't
have to log back into any app right it's
all there right and so that's this
required a little bit of a different UI
to just make that really clear so that's
essentially all the changes we've made
is around that so what is that what what
is the number of like if you had just
one sentence to tell a potential backer
what the number one biggest change to
the UI is what is that one big
difference that we're gonna notice
launcher yeah we have a chest on
launcher which is kind of an you'll see
that it just helped us convey when an
app is moved to the cloud and when it's
downloading cool so how is that gonna
work with other you know some of the big
customization features of Android in
terms of being able to install something
like Nova Launcher for example good
question yeah we're actually we a little
work with Nova Launcher we have a scheme
that worked with that too
we have escaped or third-party so
third-party launchers are okay and and
you can still use our smart storage and
you'll still see the shadow icons in
addition we've got a little bit further
one of course everything we do on the
phone is optional right you don't have
to if you don't want so we think it'll
once you're under Spacely you know trust
me you want it but alright you may you
may not want a friend that's fine but to
you know what you might not want
anything we've done but it you know we
render enthusiasts we like you know the
spirit that we did Android and
originally you know of this open source
people doing what they want so we've
actually unlocked the bootloader on our
device right so when it shipped it'll
shoot Blanc with loader and we're going
to honor the warranty for people even if
they flash other roms on our we're not
gonna so right now every manufacturer
even without mccullars little void your
warranty if you flash something else on
the phone cause you might break it for
us we're gonna honor that right because
Mike's a hard worker he pawns all those
devices you actually been an easter egg
back in the droid
you put an easter egg yeah I snuck in an
overclock feature in the original
Motorola Droid the very last minute
I loved it first of all I loved that
phone second that's awesome
third you you can'tyou leapfrogged me
that was actually a question that I had
for a little bit later on so why don't
we just tackle that right now really
quickly I was just kind of curious you
know what's your thinking in terms of
selling the device with the bootloader
unlock like obviously I hear that end of
in terms of the users being able to do
what they want with the devices where
Android enthusiasts I get it
but it kind of feels like that's a
little bit of a bummer to not have what
you guys are building at least a bummer
for you guys well you guys are building
that really makes it a differentiator so
kind of what is your your perspective on
that and kind of that leads into the
next question which is do you guys have
any plans to bring this kind of
functionality to maybe a rom of your own
or anything that might breach devices
other than the Robin sure yeah I'm
taking the first part so it's weird
right we when we did this we really
wanted to make sure every decision we
made we can answer whether is this
what's best for the user right like and
it sounds cheesy and corporate but it's
really not right it's really where it
comes from where we come from and so you
know we're doing this phone we're really
enthusiastic about doing a phone like
this direct-to-consumer right so we're
not going through carriers right we're
going direct to the end-user and it's
tough it's really hard right it's hard
cell phone people can't go in a store
and touch and feel and all that but the
benefits are really big right one you
can get a device out much faster if
you're not going through carriers - it's
cheaper it's cheaper in multiple levels
and so we can actually sell it at a
cheaper price right so you say you as a
user save 100 plus dollars just because
of consultants you directly and three we
can make it any way we want to there's
no blow there's no 34 apps that you have
to pre install from the carrier there's
no you can't have this feature because
it you know maybe it's a boy feature or
whatever like there's nothing cut right
and so we're like this this is
empowering us through this business
model empowers us to really make a
device for the customer when you know we
so when our last times been acquired by
Motorola and we were
there it was really weird for us cuz we
first joined and we sent a lot of
meetings where they said you know well
the customer wants this and the customer
wants that and I'm like why would why
don't people want that and I'm thinking
I wanted to realize that when they say
customer they mean carriers right
they're mean like oh you know the
carrier once I've been a want boy or you
know I mean it's like like oh okay
that's what they mean right it's real
like no no we're gonna be different
we're gonna be a hundred percent about
just making the product so we really
want to be like this what's best and we
know like we think our features are
awesome we want people to use them but
it's your phone like what it's just
silly like do whatever you want when
your phone man like you pay for it it's
yours I don't want to have a same what
you do in your phone yeah so it just
comes in that philosophy of like is this
what's best for the user we will but the
answer the second part I think you know
look it's it's right now we build the
software off of AOSP and that's what
we're shipping on the devices I think as
the team grows over time and there's
popular mods out there we'd love to see
if we have resources to become
maintainer
ourselves of our builds you know for
this hardware but we don't have any
current plans unfortunate to bring our
software to other devices that's just a
whole you know a whole other company
just do that simple right now it makes
perfect sense well I would love to hear
a little bit more about that software it
Mike if you could speak just a little
bit - you know obviously I don't want
you guys to to spill a jar of your
secret sauce but if you could give me a
little bit of insight into kind of how
you guys know which devices I'm not
using or is it something quite so simple
as looking and seeing when the last time
it was used was or you guys doing
something a little bit more intense than
that yeah well if you'd like we can jump
into a little software demo and I can
also talk about about how the software
works while we're doing that I I think I
would I think I would very much enjoy
that and I think our viewers would enjoy
that too
let's let's jump into that so I'm gonna
switch the camera
so you're seeing android 5.1 5.1.1
lollipop here and we are working on the
port to em already so due to hardware
schedule ring we're anticipating at the
first batch will ship with lollipop
and those users should expect an update
to follow in just weeks and then the
rest will ship with that so you're going
to see the the launcher here here on my
apps I've been using my phone for
several months about eight months or so
and running out of space I will simply
swipe to my panels here and you're going
to notice the screen looks a little bit
different for some apps you're going to
notice Spotify Ted and Skype I'll show
you here are a little bit grayed out and
this is what we call a shadow icon so
what actually happened is because my
phone was running out of space my phone
intelligently adapts to me as the user
so it actually recognizes what are my
favorite apps where the apps I'm using
when I'm using them and when I run out
of space it can actually free up space
for me right then and there so let's
just say that today you know because I
haven't used Spotify in eight months I'm
more of a Pandora user myself but you're
telling me there's a great promotion on
Spotify we need to check it out I can
simply tap on Spotify here and you'll
see the download progress bar kick in
and you're also see the color of the
icons start to fade in as we gently
installing now as the user we always
want to come back to control for the
user what's best for the user is calm
trying to point it out so we always give
you the option if you click this little
fat button here we always give you the
option to pin your apps so even if I
haven't used Spotify and nine or ten
months I can still pin the application
to my device so if I'm running out of
space we'll make sure that app is always
there and if I'm ever curious which apps
are actually in the cloud or not I can
click on this little cloud icon here and
we can see these are my apps in the
cloud but let's go back to Spotify and
let's launch it and you're going to
notice that was Spotify I didn't have to
type in my username or password again
I was literally able to
exactly what I loved off eight months
ago when I last used it so that's the
experience when you want to pull that
back down from the cloud the next thing
I'm going to show you is I think we've
all been in a scenario where we are
either at a park at a concert you want
to take a picture of video and your
phone is full and you get that error
message you're out of storage so we're
going to take a video here to open my
camera application and I will film a
pretty boring video sorry this is I'm
just gonna tilt it up here and we'll
just keep it that's my favorite kind of
video I love ya so I'll talk a little
bit a little bit about how the check
works while I'm just filming this
30-second video so what happens is when
your phone is plugged in and when you're
connected to Wi-Fi we will back up your
apps and your photos we actually
synchronize those to the cloud so we do
this in particular because we want to
make sure that we don't impact both your
your data plan as well as your battery
life and once we back these up the phone
actually knows now which apps have been
synchronized to the cloud so when you're
running out of space whether you're in a
tunnel or an airplane it can actually
make a very intelligent decision based
off of your usage patterns and the last
time in sync with the cloud so when it's
actually freeing up the state it doesn't
need to upload data at that moment in
time right seems like it's it's not
unlike throwing something into your
trash if you use a Mac you're
essentially marking it for deletion once
you've actually emptied your trash right
right so I just in my video and let's go
back to the screen and we're gonna
notice a couple more apps have been
essentially auckland so you can also
check this little notification here
flappy birds and twitter we're off with
and this is because I haven't played
flappy birds in a while
but I don't know yes sorry but I can
always use the tap on this icon here to
bring it back down and it's gonna come
down a little to stall
and this last bit I'm going to show you
is how do I access my photos right so
this convention we do we look at both
photos and apps and when we decide to
free up space or actually it's really
when your phone decides it needs to free
up space what will happen is it will
actually generate a screen size
thumbnail on your device and it will
free up the original version in the
cloud now because we're connected to
Wi-Fi I can choose to attach the
original image the same way as I've
always done I just opened up to open up
Gmail go to new attach file I can look
at my recent and you'll notice this is
the video I just film but here's a bunch
of images that I have not looked at in a
while and these have been uploaded and I
can simply attach an image of this
yellow car now what's going to happen is
because I'm connected to Wi-Fi it will
actually fetch the original image and
embed it within Gmail and you'll notice
that we didn't have to provide an SDK
there was no additional work I didn't
have to open up Dropbox or SugarSync
find the image and share into Gmail I
can just open up Gmail as I normally
would attach the image if I were on my
LTE connection or just away from Wi-Fi
what will happens instead will prompt
the user and say hey would you like to
download three point nine megabytes and
for some people maybe you're on an
unlimited data plan or your company's
paying for your data three point nine
Meg's is fine and for others if you're
on a two gigabyte t-mobile data plan
maybe you don't want to use three point
nine bags and you just want to use the
locally cache version so we always come
back and give control to the user when
and how you want to use your data but it
all comes back to you know having an
intelligent device that really adapts
itself for you they saw how you're using
it that looks fantastic thank you so
much for that quick look that's I
believe that's not some
that we've seen before the ability to
attach an image so that's really cool
that kind of leads into a handful of my
next questions I mean one of them you
kind of covers how quickly can I get
something back from the cloud if I find
that it's something that I need you
basically just showed me in real time
how long it would take my last question
is it pertains to software is is really
if you were speaking directly to a
potential backer or someone who just
picked up the device and and they stop
and say to you you know like handful of
my colleagues for example in the office
have had brought this up what are what
are you what's your position in terms of
you know
Asajj Inge the concerns of the folks who
might say but well you know what if I
can't get to it you know what what if
I'm driving I'm on a road trip and and I
don't have an internet connection and I
can't get to the thing that I need and
and now I'm just up a creek without a
paddle
yeah so it's interesting right and I
mean people forget that this only kicks
in when you're already run out of local
storage or you're just about to right so
you know the answer is well what do you
do when your phone is out of storage now
right you delete something and you know
you you move it to the cloud or just
delete it you're moving you're uninstall
applications or you delete all
multimedia to make space and you
actually have to do it constantly right
we did a bunch of research when we
started about you know how big we're
problem is that people run out of space
and it's extremely common it happens
pretty much to everybody is the answer
and when it does it's not a one-time
thing right you don't just like oh I ran
out of space let me delete stuff okay
now I'm good forever it's like no you
know what another week or two
you know if you're like me you have kids
like another three hours later you're
like okay I'm out of space again but
it's constant yeah managing it so you
know so one you know again at what we do
is the better version it's the better
alternative to well you have to lead a
bunch of stuff manually and to remember
like Mike said when you first buy your
phone and start using it nothing about
is different right I mean well it's an
awesome phone and you're gonna feel
really good about yourself but except
for that another thing about it is
different it's but it's just backing
stuff up when it's when it's on Wi-Fi
and connected to power right so you
don't even necessarily notice that the
LED lights on the back will kind of go
off to let you know what's happening but
but other than that and I think you know
it's just a normal one you're using
right and all this time though it is
learning right it's learning like which
apps you use it's learning about your
behaviors things like that and then you
know if if we do our job right by the
time you're running out of 32 gigs let's
say six months after you buy the phone
you know what have a pretty good
understanding of what it is we should
keep you know some photos over 90 days
let's say you have a bunch of those
right
we're not even deleting them completely
we're just down sampling you're right so
you'll still have screen reading it's
only if you want to attach it or if you
want to zoom in right that you'll need
to download the full reps again right
and so is that you know is that really
going to be that big of a problem and if
you're disappointed it's not you know I
mean it's a very unusual use case where
you'd be like oh my god I can't zoom in
on this photo you know to see this this
detail or things like that we just don't
think anything like of course it's
possible but where you think if we do
our job right there shouldn't be a lot
of the disappointing moments right and
we'll get better over time like you know
this is this is this is a learning for
us as well about how people use the
product and whether or not it's meeting
the goals but we'll be super attentive
we'll be engaging with the community to
make sure that we're doing a good job
and implementing any feedback that
people have like as soon as we can great
beautiful honest answer let's let's
switch gears just for a minute here I
just want to talk about the hardware for
just a second I have a couple of
questions pertaining to it you've been
working with Foxconn for manufacturing
awesome I take it you know a lot of your
relationships from your previous
positions helped out a lot there I just
wanted to cover just a handful of little
things that I know are our readers are
gonna want to know our viewers are gonna
want to know especially with respect to
this specs so I just wanted to start
with the processor the brains of the
operation what made you guys go with the
808
obviously the 810 has gotten a little
bit of flak lately for some heat issues
and I know that you guys are trying to
keep a cap on cost so I was just
wondering kind of what was the impetus
for going with the 808 specifically over
maybe something a little bit cheaper
even and what what kind of what
compromises that that might have brought
into the equation sure so yeah I mean oh
my goodness specifics of the house and
wives but this kind of goes back sorry
against your label it's just what's best
for the user and sort of also like what
we want about right
it's
like it's kind of yeah look we started a
company to make a phone we want to
confirm that we want to use crap
first and foremost so everything we did
was kind of just the common sense of
like okay here's the total package
here's the display is the resolution you
know here's the battery size look how do
we make this the best total package and
so you just kind of make the decision
based on like those factors together
like if there's features are not
necessary you know but because they
literally can't use them on display
resolution we just don't do that ya know
so 808 you know we looked at especially
when we're designing the phone in the
beginning we knew first we wanted 5 to
5.2 inch screen right we just wanted
something that fit well in your hand and
because of that then that sort of
dictated well what's a screen resolution
you want and we decided you know 1080p
is actually a really great resolution
for that we could go to qhd+ but the
power impact was going to be significant
we also knew we want to all-day battery
life but we didn't want to phone that
super thick and we wanted phenomenal
performance that would provide us all
these characteristics so the 808 when
looking at all these things actually
would be a really great choice plus it
was actually very mature chipset at the
time too so you can just get better
power improvements better yield grades
you know less chance of bugs all that
stuff that's a really big point that I
really want to point out not just for
other folks in your positions
other companies trying to make some big
changes but for our readers that's one
thing that a lot of folks don't think
about you know that's that's something
that also makes a lot of sense from an
engineering perspective when you're
talking about software you know what
kind of language do you want to build
with you know you want to build with
something that has a little bit of
staying power something that has a
little bit of maturity behind it and I
think going with an 808 is something
that gives you guys a little bit of
stability I think that's something that
our viewers would be wise to think about
and consider you know that that sets us
up as users for the best possible
experience you know there's something to
be said for not being on the bleeding
edge when appropriate
so let's let's let's jump through just a
little bit there's this kind of newish
category I've been calling it the value
category in my in my videos it's it's
somewhere between you know and I feel
like 1 plus started it with the 1+1
actually that's not even true and that
the Nexus line started it so in reality
you guys got exactly what you guys were
after because now we're at the point
where you can make a phone and sell it
for a reasonable price off contract and
unlocked so on that in that particular
category you guys are just on the higher
end of the spectrum in terms of MSRP so
I was kind of curious if you guys had
done a little bit of hands-on time with
kind of the other devices that are in
that particular category at the moment
like the oneplus 2 the zenfone 2 and a
handful of the other ones that are
coming out or if you guys have got the
chance to play with the Moto X pure just
yet
but I was curious how you guys feel the
Robin stands up when you put it next to
these other devices that are in the same
price range
yeah so we're actually yeah of course
yes to everything less is rapid we're
good yeah we'll just leave now
no so so yes this is a continuation of
what the Android team was doing with
Nexus right bringing that director
consumer to get the latest and fresh
just like version of Android without any
blows you know Apple to this price
because there's no channel you know more
than you have to go before the carriers
or things like that
and we're really happy to see that that
category penticoff we think oneplus did
a fantastic job right of really kind of
scaling that Xiaomi obviously not in the
US Europe or any other markets the
rear-ending 2 but in their markets right
fabulous job of building a massive
actual following and tons of units under
this model right of direct-to-consumer
and kind of iterating on software
quickly and not trying to drive a lot of
market on the on the hardware right so
we think it's absolutely a growing
category and we think it's it's a it
makes a lot of sense you know I think
people underestimate you know I mean on
the iPhone side of the house right on
iOS there's there's two things that
affect the price on iOS and that
shouldn't or
for this furniture on Android so one is
your iOS is firmly established
successfully as kind of a luxury grant
right which has a premium right so you
pay more for a Louis Vuitton bag or a
Rolex watch or whatever it is right and
that's fine and no Android or iam has
really captured that except maybe
Samsung and they spent a lot to do it
but you know for the rest of the man
it's never really been available and
then - and iOS is not a competitive
market right if you want to you have AI
messages on iTunes and iCloud and use
your apps there's one hardware vendor
you go to and so just to mean economic
sense that's so that's that's the
monopoly market right it's like there's
only one choice agree to go to write
Android there's a lot of choices
actually the point of Android right
that's why it was open-source that's why
we let allow only a mr. customer eyes it
that's why you know we can do things
like what we're doing now when Robin and
smart storage right because of that it's
open market pricing right so you know I
think trying to match prices and saying
well high-end phone should be $800 for
that's what Apple charges it's kind of
always been the wrong strategy right for
the your hands just because it's
possible for Apple to be bet doesn't
this really mean
android games can or shouldn't do that
right it's not I think what you're
seeing when the oneplus and Xiaomi and
what we're trying to do is just a little
bit more honesty like you know hey you
know this is we're not trying to pad a
lot of margin into this we just we need
to like get the lights on and then I get
things going but beyond that like this
is pretty much as cheap as we can make
it like you know and and you know I
think that honesty more than the price
point itself is actually the refreshing
part for consumers you know so there's
kind of a lot it's just we can talk
about everybody adds they do a process
you know it's like it's expensive right
we have a fingerprint sensor we have NFC
USB type-c you know dual front-facing
speakers with two lamps like you know
you can be like this is why the phone is
premium phone that's why it's not like
under you know under 300 rights in the
three to four hour band which we think
all these phones kind of stand that the
high end of the phones is and should be
right and we think among them you know
we've got a pretty fresh design that
hopefully people like we've I think we
checked all the boxes in terms of specs
right getting what they're in for and
NFC and USB and you know everything else
quality camera everything that we've
kind of invested in so we think we check
on the boxes - to me
able to be in that that price range but
we also think we stand out with the
design with some of the choices we made
and with the software obviously more
than anything oh don't do that to me
don't do that to me no III gotta say you
guys did a phenomenal job in terms of
the the industrial design I think that
the phone looks gorgeous I think that
the color options are great and I really
like it's been a while since I've seen
like I mentioned Ryan it's been a while
since I've seen he and Peter get get
really excited about something and I've
known Ryan for quite a long time and and
he's he's a he's a tough guy to please
much well he's a tough guy to please so
my last question as it pertains to
Hardware specifically is where you guys
feel you made the biggest compromise to
achieve that particular price point like
obviously you know and and I got to say
to the the honesty aspect is so
refreshing you know it's something that
like you said I think is becoming more
and more common and and that's important
I think that's what we're seeing right
now it's one of the things that we try
really hard to do here at TechnoBuffalo
and we try and be human ultimately at
the end of the day we're just people
using phones and you guys want to make
the best one you can make so like I said
where did you guys have to make the
biggest compromise to hit this price
point I think the biggest compromise
honestly was mostly for the design when
when it was really engineering
engineering and design we're trying to
figure out how can we build it terms of
price point although I kind of think was
there something that we were really
really concerned about I need to be
honest I think there wasn't anything
specific we were like no we can't have
that that's too expensive we really did
make the phone we wanted to make right
and come hell or high water we're gonna
sell it in that price band
I think the only compromises we have to
make or things were kind of decisions we
have to weigh against each other a lot
of it had to do with thickness right so
yes people want removable batteries we
totally know that you know as a thing
but you know we're wireless charging
right was a big feature that you know
people ask that sometimes but you know
those things just what the current
design wouldn't be possible without
having a bunch of
thickness to the phone then I think a
lot of you know any confident remarks we
made where around this but to be honest
we wouldn't have made them sorry guys if
we thought that was you know like worth
it you for the phone overall or actually
think when you balance everything out
including how it looks right at the end
of the day because you do want you want
a phone that you kind of just think it
looks awesome right you know I you know
I think that's at the end of the day you
have to make that trade-off a little bit
right and so we did that on this side of
things I would say right earlier just
keeping the overall shape and design you
know I'll tell you a certain that we
have a tone you know when we really had
this for example we had a really hard to
pay about fingerprint sensor because at
the time when we started it was only
available on the back or front right and
it really just wasn't comfortable with
us because we knew fingerprint sensor
was going to be important you know
especially we have it and then if she
said for Android and stuff but it just
didn't really fit with the design really
well right like if you had in the bottom
we have to remove a second speaker we
have to long gate the phone on the back
of just kind of stick out and what's
really weird it was really hard for us
to decide what to do and we've kind of
said you know what we just don't think
it's it's it's important enough like
it's important but maybe we should do it
luckily we we kind of pushed on the
vendors and they they had the side thing
that they were working on right and we
took a look at that and we're like oh my
god you put it on the side right and
then we thought about I'm like oh it's
just where you already have your hand
like that's perfect like you take out
your phone that's where your finger
already yes yes that's freaking awesome
right so you know we kind of pretty so
like the actual that this technology
came out just in time to be built into
the device and now it's it agree with
the power button so it's literally like
where your finger already goes to all
the time on your phone you know it'll
just be that's where the fingerprint is
you just mean it's not a swipe you just
hold it you just have to hold your
finger there right breath education
right and said oh I'm sorry that's the
Greek on the side yeah yes that's the
fingerprint sensor slash power button
correct so these are awesome units that
you're seeing so there's still early
prototypes they're functional and this
is the power button and fingerprint
sensor any
yeah gorgeous and I gotta be honest man
I mean I'm not crazy about Fitness I
would much rather have a slightly
thicker phone and have all the features
that I want I mean like we look at the
note 5 you know we've got giant devices
in our pockets I don't think an extra
millimeter or two it's gonna kill us if
we get it to do what we need it to do
awesome so I just have one more kind of
open or open-ended question for you guys
that I really wanted you guys to kind of
take and run with I just want you to
imagine for a minute that I or a viewer
is a potential backer and you have one
thing that a potential backer needs to
know about this device or about the
company what's that one thing that you
tell them what's the most important
thing that a potential backer needs to
know about next fit and the Robin and I
think it's it's actually different right
I think that's the bottom line I think
in a sea of sameness and boring and and
just just general phone fatigue right I
have this joke internally when a new
phone comes up and I like because people
email us you know like our investors oh
my god have you seen this phone and
you're playing yeah why ap she's yet
another Android phone you know like yeah
it's not like this is why we can do it
because it is easier than ever right to
actually make a phone and it's become
like you call them democracy that's a
hard word you know what you said oh oh
it is a hard word I can tell you
firsthand
that shooting the word democratization
on video is not easy
authorization of smartphones that you
mentioned right it's true and that's
good and bad right the good is it looks
a lot of people try a lot of different
stuff which is great the bad is you know
there could be a lot of bad product that
there right a lot there's just a lot of
meat soonest and this is not a me-too
product from from everything from the
hardware the colors the you know the
kind of the features and of course the
software right and it's just the
beginning on the software to rate this
storage is our launch feature we're
gonna actually be doing a lot of other
stuff later on and part of that will
actually be engaging with the community
you'll see towards the end of the
Kickstarter as well as after kind of
help you guys set the road map for us
but we really want to you know kind of
communicate engage with community but we
have a lot of ideas we don't want to do
anything that's just an iteration we
anything it's a little feature we only
want to do things that will actually
help you but I actually solve a problem
and that's like a big change right
something positive right I mean the
changing like the UI UI interaction I
mean like something that actually
functionally works different like how we
we've changed storage around right of
storage around stone and that's might
take enough you you know I think I guess
my thing I would say is to potential
backers
I mean Bacchus if you just believe in
our principles and where the company is
going that a new phone company is trying
to build just a super honest transparent
phone to you but also just from a
software side we want a phone that gets
better over time right smart phones
should get smarter they should be
smarter than where they are today and
part of the reason why we started this
company why we're going to Kickstarter's
we were kind of thinking well why wait
right we we can do this we've you know
when we're on the Android team
originally we were underdogs in industry
and I think so
yeah we're kind of the underdogs again
but with everyone's support we think we
can we can help push the industry
forward awesome
awesome well there you have it guys next
bits slogan think different or just do
it I don't know you really want to know
it's just our longer-term vision right
it's you on any piece of glass right
what we want to do is eventually we
think should be able to authenticate to
any smart device and just have your
stuff there for you but that's a longer
conversation so that's true we have
actual internal like RonRon that we say
every day is that don't be stupid
so that is actually a company mother and
generally for all our employees all the
time like remember what's our motto
don't be stupid
I'm a minute if that's okay with you
guys I'm gonna go ahead and adopt that
as my motto as well great awesome thank
you guys so much for joining us I hope
this has been a blast for our viewers
thank you guys for watching I hope you
guys had a great time learning about the
next bit Robin if you enjoyed this video
go and hit that like button and you can
hit that subscribe button down below as
well if you would like Mike and Tom to
personally come to your home with a
Robin with your name engraved on it
which they will definitely not do I just
made that up Tom's gonna be the one to
do it
and I think I think Mike and Tom will
will join me in encouraging you guys and
urging you guys to be kinder to one
another in the comments be kind to each
other thank you guys for watching and
I'll catch you guys in the next video
thank you thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
