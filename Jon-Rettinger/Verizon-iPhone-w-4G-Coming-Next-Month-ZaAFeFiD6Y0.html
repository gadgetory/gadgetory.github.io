technobuffalo here I want to talk about
the tech equivalent of the Yeti the Loch
Ness monster the magician whatever it is
you want to call it let's talk about the
verizon iphone this thing has been as
ruined as long as the iphone itself has
been in existence we've got a fresh
batch of juicy rumors which sounds kind
of disgusting but these rumors may
actually have some Lex Twitter backed up
by what's supposedly a bit of fat so
let's go ahead and run through the mall
I've got my glasses on so you know this
is a serious video let's get started so
if you see me look down I've got some
notes in front of me there's a lot to
cover Mack daily news today sort of put
out the first rumors of an LTE based
verizon iphone LTE is verizon's new 4G
technology that just launched actually
last week in select markets and a sort
of plant for a full rollout I initially
observed most technology pundants and
geeks and whatever speculated that when
Verizon did get an iphone which now
seems inevitable would not be launching
with LTE onboard very similar to what we
saw in the first iphone launch without
3g the network isn't widespread and it's
a tremendous suck on battery however Mac
Daily News which has a decent record of
prediction is saying otherwise and
quieting quoting quite credible sources
which is a hard thing to say so let me
go ahead and run through the full list
of rumors with you so supposedly verizon
management had training on the iPhone
last week and this has been
substantiated by their sources you would
have thought would have heard a bit more
leaks coming out of this this is one of
the first I guess poke in the dam and
the water is starting to spread out so
verizon also supposedly had functioning
lte-capable devices at this management
training session that they were showing
off to employees so this iphone that's
got 4g does in fact exist a formal
announcement is supposedly coming right
after Christmas the formal announcement
right after Christmas was supposedly one
of the last terms that AT&amp;amp;T may
to negotiate with apple so post-holiday
fig everybody wants to get an iphone
before the holiday run out to 18 t will
see announcement possibly all right
after Christmas for the first of the
year which also coincides with CES so
that may be the ideal platform for the
big red to actually launch their 4g
capable device the verizon iphone
supposedly will be available immediately
upon announcement so we're already at
the middle of december so a month from
now we can actually have a verizon
iphone in your hands a 4G verizon iphone
in your hands to say the least devices
are supposedly 100% cooked and I've
already been shipping actually for quite
some time to sort of build up on
inventory kind of interesting the
verizon iphone is not big shift to any
of third-party retailers to try and keep
the rumors and the leaks to a minimum
Verizon agreed to take one hundred
percent responsibility for security of
these devices all devices will be in
their hands until the official
announcement takes place but probably
stored in some serious raiders of the
lost ark type warehouse piling up but
supposedly will be saying these and
these are not necessarily an iphone 5
it's an iphone 4 that is going to be
lte-capable kind of interesting so the
new phone is LTE device and it's
actually going to be called the LTE
iphone supposedly and is going to be
exclusive to verizon is going to be spec
for spec an iphone 4 with the benefit of
LTE now since LTE is not sort of
everywhere in the country yet it will be
able to fall back to verizon's 3g
service which is evdo so it's also be
really the first LTE phone that we've
seen on the market i suppose it makes
sense that a phone of this magnitude
that sort of able to take advantage of
this new data network would be the ipod
touch sort of a flagship phone so next
the iphone 5 was planned to debut in the
summer as an LTE capable phone on a
variety of carriers
he is also committed to an AT&amp;amp;T network
to an LTE network but their LTE networks
and sort of saying that quite a bit I
was not ready too closely that angered
Apple you don't want to anger the Giant
so we'll see it announced on verizon
first and again it's not an iphone 5
it's supposedly as an iphone 4 that's
lte-capable Steve Jobs himself is
supposed to be very upset the carriers
aren't getting their LTE act in order
which whatever II can be upset all I
wants an apple is supposedly funding
some of the infrastructure for the
carrier's to launch their LTE capable
devices so this sort of goes against
what's been said in the past again
people have been speculating that an LTE
iphone would not launch until the
network was more widespread and the
battery technology had improved that was
for the same model that was all at the
initial of 3g iphone this does seem to
have a bit of likes to it it would make
sense that we will actually see a full
lte-capable advice on the press call
that was announcing their 4g network a
verizon was very adamant about saying
that they're going to hold off on
announcements on devices until a
consumer-oriented event which certainly
would be the consumer electronics show
in january so are you waiting for a LTE
iphone i can tell you I've use LTE the
speeds are unbelievable but oftentimes
these speeds on your phone isn't
determined by the network speed the
bottleneck is actually going to be the
processor so while your phone might be
capable of pulling down 16 megabits per
second the process is not necessarily
going to handle it so you'll probably
see speeds that would be akin to using
Wi-Fi at home with a puppy that fast but
don't expect lightning blazing fast
speeds unless unless attr started
verizon rather and Apple are going to
let the iphone service some sort of
mobile hotspot or enable tethering at
which case if used as a 4g modem much
like this guy here you can take
advantage of those 4G speeds on your
desktop could be interesting so what do
you guys think about all these new
rumors are you excited not excited I
think a lot of people have been waiting
for a verizon iphone a 4g far as an
iphone
really truly capable of running on a 4G
network I would probably be worth the
wait it would be icing on the cake for
these folks that have been patiently
biding the time for years personally I'm
really excited about the potential and
especially if we can see it in just a
few weeks could make a consumer
electronic show a very very interesting
venue i'm jon rettinger technobuffalo
see you next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
