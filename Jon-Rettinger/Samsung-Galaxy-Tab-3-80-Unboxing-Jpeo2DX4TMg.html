checking out the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3
this is the 8 inch model so this is the
mid-sized one between the 7 and the 10.1
we are gonna do an unboxing so first of
all we can see we have this lovely Wi-Fi
model it's 16 gig it's the bronze
version there are only white and this
sort of brown bronze color available and
we are going to unbox it so let's take
this thing out and there it is still
with the sticker onboard as you can see
8 inch WXGA LCD screen it is a 1280 by
800 pixel display so that's your
resolution
one and a half gigs of dual core
processor action it's a 16 gig Wi-Fi
model well let's peel back and check out
the device itself so here we go you can
see it's got this bronze edge to it I'm
going to try to focus in on that so
there's the bronze edge you can see it's
definitely a little bit different if we
flip it over we can peel the plastic off
the back of this which I'm going to do
right now because we all know Samsung
loves to put plastic on all of their
stuff all over the place sometimes
months later you'll find plastic on the
back of it let's peel this off alright
so hopefully you can see that it's got a
bit of a brown tone to it does stick
with the color scheme that they've kind
of been sticking with lately so that's
kind of nice you're looking at like I
said one and a half gigs of dual core
processor action it comes in a 16 and a
32 gig model it's got a 44 hundred and
50 milli amp battery it is not messing
around
also a micro SD card slot so we go to
micro SD right here to expandable
storage something that people really
love on devices check out the rest of
the inside of the box before we get into
the tablet itself there's a box in a box
it's box ception we have our smaller box
and we've got all of our lovely manuals
charger micro USB cable all the good
stuff alright so now that we have
checked out all of our block stuff let's
boot this bad boy up and get it going
and as it boots up I will tell you that
the camera on this tab is a 5 megapixel
camera with a front-facing 1.3 megapixel
camera there we go there's our load
screen here's our main home screen we're
gonna swipe around check it out so you
can see it's pretty smooth for a
dual-core processor not too terrible not
too shabby we can go into our apps let's
check out what we have here so you can
see we've got paper artists throughout
some of our Samsung proprietary apps
here s voice s translator s planner
Samsung link we've got a bunch of stuff
Smart Remote Story album and of course
we have watch on so let's get out of
here and let's take a look at the
internals on this bad boy this has a
forty four hundred and fifty milli amp
battery so hopefully this will last you
all day long
it it's pretty nice it's a good unboxing
I am gonna give you my first impressions
later obviously that's what unboxings
for just show you unboxing
taking the package off it's like
Christmas morning and that is what we've
done here so this is the Samsung Galaxy
Tab 3 8 inch running Android 4.2.2 and
looks pretty good I'm excited to check
it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
