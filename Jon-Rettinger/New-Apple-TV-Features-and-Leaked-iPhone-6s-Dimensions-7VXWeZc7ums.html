to you by Harry's hey what's going on
guys a marketing Sangin from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's episode of
rumor roundup will be talking about LG's
next SmartWatch Apple's iPhone 6s and
Apple TV and Google's new nexus
smartphones this is rumor roundup let's
go ahead and get started last we heard
LG was bringing a brand new Android wear
device to IFA this week but it wound up
being a no-show a new report however
claims the next generation SmartWatch
won't arrive until late September though
it may be worth the wait a pair of
trusted sources apparently showed the
upcoming device to android police though
there aren't any leaked photos or even a
name for now the report notes that the
new watch will sport a round display but
with a different size screen and thinner
bezels compared to LG's watch or bane
the company has also apparently added
two more physical buttons placed on
either side of the crown the overall
style is also getting an upgrade the new
SmartWatch will apparently incorporate a
mix of brush and polished metal the
result is a design that's more angular
and sharp according to android police
which adds that it has a futuristic
sporty look unfortunately we may not get
a look at the rumoured SmartWatch until
later this month and there's no word on
when the device will actually be
released in the meantime LG is offering
a limited-edition watch urbane luxe with
gold plating and an alligator leather
band though you're probably better off
waiting for this next gen model instead
the original Nexus 5 may just go down in
history as the ultimate Nexus device
offering what were then high-end specs
at an extremely affordable price rumor
has it that LG is about to drop an
updated version of the popular handset
but a new report suggests it won't be
quite as affordable LG's new Nexus will
apparently cost at least fifty dollars
more than the original Nexus 5 and that
would put the rumoured phones base price
at 399 dollars with 16 gigabytes of
storage and 449 for a 32 gigabyte model
when you consider the devices rumoured
mid-range specs that seems a little high
the same report also reveals a potential
name for the new phone Google will
allegedly call it the Nexus 5x though
that name is apparently still up for
debate there are also claims to confirm
rumoured plans for an event on September
29 where Google will reveal new Nexus
devices from LG and Huawei the Nexus 5x
or whatever Google ends up
calling it is expected to pack a 5.2
inch 1080p display a Snapdragon 808
processor two thousand seven hundred
million battery a 12 point three
megapixel camera three gigabytes of RAM
a fingerprint reader and a USBC port it
will allegedly come in black white and
blue color options and feature a plastic
back meanwhile Huawei's rumoured Nexus
phablet could offer a significantly
bigger display with a quad HD resolution
a cutting-edge Snapdragon processor a
fingerprint reader and an all-metal
design this sounds like more of a
high-end device which suggests it won't
be particularly cheap of course both
devices should run Android six point of
the box making them the two first phones
to offer Google's latest mobile software
when the new Apple TV finally launches
it may spell the beginning of the end
for roku that's because Apple is
apparently poised to copy one of the
best features offered by the company
universal search by using Siri and voice
controls you will apparently be able to
search for a specific movie TV show
actor-director across itunes and all
other apps available on the apple TV the
same report also revealed that the
fourth generation Apple TV will cost
$149 this lines up with an earlier rumor
claiming Apple was still debating
between $149 and 199 dollars either way
it's a lot pricier than the current
model and we hope Apple goes with a
slightly cheaper option Apple will
allegedly continue to sell its current
set-top box at a discounted price but
new features like Siri and universal
search will likely be limited to the new
model the company's rumored live TV
streaming service should work on older
Apple TV devices though it's not
expected to arrive until later this year
at the earliest the iphone 6s is
expected to look almost identical to
last year's iPhone 6 but Apple may still
tweak the dimensions a little bit newly
leaked photo sent to MacRumors suggests
the upcoming handset could be slightly
thicker wider and taller than its
predecessor the images show a copy of
the iphone 6s assembled from factory
parts potentially offering our best look
yet at the device to the naked eye it
looks like nothing has changed but
detailed measurements of the device
revealed that isn't exactly true the
iphone 6s is slightly thicker coming at
7.0 8 millimeters compared to the six
point nine millimeter iphone 6 it's also
taller and wider at 100
eight point 19 millimeters by 67 point
sixty eight millimeters again that's a
small bump from the previous model but
we assume the iphone 6s plus will
receive a similar increase in size as
well macrumors notice that most iphone 6
cases will still work just fine with the
iphone 6s though tight fitting
accessories may not make the cut some
case makers including spigen have
already revealed new accessories based
off these updated dimensions suggesting
that this is just a room so before we
end this video I want to thank our
friends over at Harry's shaving can be
quite expensive nowadays but fortunately
our friends over at Harry's can hook you
up with premium razors at non premium
prices their starter kit starts to just
fifteen dollars and that includes the
razor three blades and your choice of
Harry shave cream or foaming gel I
personally like the gel it feels nice on
my face as an added bonus you can get
five dollars off your first purchase by
using the code techno after using the
code you can also get an entire month of
Shaving for just ten dollars thankfully
we want to have to wait too long to find
out since apple is expected to invade
iphone 6s and iPhone 6s plus at an event
set for next week on September nine
