brought to you by goto meeting well out
there folks is John Q here from
TechnoBuffalo hope you guys are doing
swell welcome to another episode of
what's the apps today we're gonna get
our writing on with a little application
called ia writer III a writer I a writer
AIA writer yes
AIA writer joins many other mobile apps
based on that oh so wonderful and
magical cloud thing that all the kids
are talking about these days I a writer
stands apart from other writing
note-taking and tech stock editing apps
but is focused on user experience and
simplicity its minimalistic UI execution
styling syncing and saving is all
specifically designed and engineered to
provide the user with the seamless
writing experience allowing them to
focus more on the content they're
writing versus things like formatting
and whatnot which is all done
automatically by the way no fuss no muss
although I would like to consider myself
as one I'm not really a writer of any
sorts more of a casual always
good-looking and always swab note-taker
but based on the comments and reviews of
others the writers or the people who
write as a hobby really really dig this
app and I mean really dig it and I can
see why the syncing allows you to resume
exactly where you left off regardless of
device be it your laptop desktop iPhone
or iPad I a writer's keyboard is also
optimized providing quick access to
punctuation keys as well as providing
you with left and right arrows very
handy going from the iPhone to the iPad
you'll notice more short keys on the
keyboard as well as focus mode which
puts more visual emphasis on the
paragraph or sentence you're working on
this has got to be my favorite feature
and it's available on the desktop
version as well but not on the iPhone
the documents background is slightly
off-white which helps you a little bit
when you're staring at the thing for
hours on end they also use a slab serif
kind of font which helps with the
readability unfortunately even with all
these amazing features I a writer
selling point also happens to be its
downfall I a writer's reliant on either
iCloud and/or Dropbox for sinking
sinking on iCloud is extremely buggy
I often
almost every five minutes get prompted
to resolve sync issues if I have ia
writer activated on multiple devices the
developers have said that they're
working on it but for now it's extremely
annoying Dropbox seems to work much
better but some have reported issues
with file ordering another downfall
would be the price it currently goes for
$0.99 for both the iPad and the iPhone
which is fair but the desktop client
goes for a rather steep $8.99
especially considering similar
multi-platform cloud-based services like
Evernote go for the awesome low low
price of get this free and speaking
awesome I'm gonna take some time to
thank our friends at GoToMeeting being
able to attach a face to a name is super
important it enhances how we do our
business and how we build our
relationships but sometimes meeting
everyone face to face you know all your
clients your friends your colleagues can
be impossible especially if they're kind
of scattered all around the world that's
why I recommend GoToMeeting with HD
faces unless you meet face-to-face from
anywhere even on the go
let's meet face to face from anywhere
even on the go with an iPad with
GoToMeeting by Citrix it takes just a
webcam and a click to collaborate in
group HD video you can see your
attendees eye-to-eye while collaborating
on documents in real time you will feel
instantly connected even if you're
thousands of miles apart plus
GoToMeeting is just so easy to use I've
had users just download the free
GoToMeeting app to join I use
GoToMeeting from time to time I have the
app on my iPad and it's really nice to
have that mobile freedom because when
you're sitting and working all day this
feels nice to kind of walk around pace
and just stretch your legs in a little
bit one time when a conference was going
on I had the app on my iPad I'm just
walking walking walking while everybody
was all conferencing it's great
TechnoBuffalo viewers can try goto
meeting free for 30 days don't wait for
this special offer visit goto
meeting.com click on the try it free
button and use the promo code techno
again be sure to use the promo code
techno overall if you're one who enjoys
writing and you're looking for a
minimalistic cloud-based writing app I a
writer's definitely worth taking a look
at I would advise you to try it out on
your iPhone or iPad first before picking
up the $9 desktop clients if you just
want something simple and cheap i'd
reccomend Evernote all you got to do is
sign up for an account it works and it's
free so I a writer
3.5 out of 5 at least for now until they
fix that iCloud synching issue well I
