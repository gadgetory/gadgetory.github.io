tin from techno-pop checking out the
brand new Huawei watch it's actually one
of several models that will always door
to sell but this is the entry-level
model that will retail for $349
beginning September 2nd that is today
and it will be available on September
17th so this is the $349 like I said it
has stainless steel around the face
which actually looks really really
gorgeous you get the leather band
running throughout and on the back you
have the heart rate sensor and then you
also have a magnetic back that pops on
this charger here and you can easily
charge it fully in just about an hour
while I said which is pretty incredible
considering it should get about two days
of battery life even with that ambient
display on so you get a ton of cool
features here let me just go through it
the focus is on fitness tracking and
alerts and that kind of stuff so you
have support for third-party apps like
up from jawbone you also get 40
different watch faces pre-installed here
from Huawei in addition to the more than
1500 that are already available in the
Google Play Store which is pretty sweet
you can see you've got the dial here at
2 o'clock which you can use easily just
to bring up the screen or activate you
can say ok Google I don't know if it's
gonna hear me it didn't to bring up the
regular alerts that you usually get on
Android wear this runs the latest
version of Android wear so that's one
point brave we also have a 1.2 gigahertz
Snapdragon 400 processor on board that
we've seen before 4 gigs of storage
which you can use for local storage for
songs and stuff like that now you also
get 512 megabytes of RAM and who always
says it suspects that this is going to
be enough hardware to keep it going as
Google continues to issue Android wear
it updates in the future as for the
display got 1.4 inch AMOLED screen
they're 400 by 400 pixels so Bali said
that's going to give you the sharpest
Android wear watch
market coming in at 286 pixels per inch
you can see right here but it looks
really gorgeous so like I said this is
the entry-level model so 349 the
entry-level price but you can also get
one with a steel band that'll bring it
up to 399 and you can go into all kinds
of different models with rose cooled at
the high end coming in 650 or $700 and
in the middle you have a stainless steel
black version with a special coating so
that doesn't get scratched up but
otherwise this is a really nice looking
Android wear watch probably my favorite
today it's so far I want to give you a
quick look this is Todd Zoltan from
