unboxing for you of the samsung propel
pro this is a Courtney non-touchscreen
windows mobile 6.1 standard device that
was just released today which is April
14th for 18 to wireless and it'll run
you a hundred and forty-nine dollars
after a fifty-dollar mail-in rebate and
of course a two-year contract let's go
ahead and dig into the box here and get
to the fun stuff got the back to open it
up with all right slice on into that
here is the box itself samsung propel
pro let's take a look around it and see
what we got this also is being called
the blackjack slider it looked very
similar to the blackjack one and two
both made by samsung except those more
in sliders those were full candy bar
devices so it's got Wi-Fi gps email in a
camera obviously and since it's running
windows mobile 6.1 standard it is a full
smartphone meeting you get a full suite
of applications including Word Excel
PowerPoint you can edit all those
documents you also have a full email
client you hook up to microsoft exchange
server has a built-in gps for figuring
out where ever you want to go that will
hook into AT&amp;amp;T telenav service or with
google maps this is pretty standard box
here same business on the side on the
back here are some specs let's go over
some of the key stuff here so windows
mobile 6.1 standard non touch screen
Wi-Fi supporting B&amp;amp;G it is a 3g phone
which he has a pretty beefy processor
528 megahertz it is 3.9 x 2.4 x point 6
inches so that's kind of the diameter
and the thickness of the device it is
256 megabytes of ram 128 megabytes of
ram display is actually a very unique
display at 320 x 320 it's the first
windows mobile standard phone that has
meeting it's actually a lot longer so
reading email should be a lot easier
we'll take a look at the screen in just
a moment weighs about 4.8 three ounces
got a 3 megapixel camera external
microSD card hold up the 16 gigabytes of
space slide-out qwerty board and the
rest of that good stuff all right so
enough of that let's see if the phone
looks like I'm actually pretty excited
about this I used to use an original
blackjack way before the iphone even
came out so I have some experience with
windows mobile 6 or rather windows
mobile quite open this thing up welcome
to AT&amp;amp;T all pretty standard fare getting
started CD includes user manual
activesync and a windows mobile device
center and warranty stuff I don't know
how many you guys actually use this but
don't they ever get open speaking of
never getting opened getting started
guide part of the fun of getting a new
phone is figuring out how to use it on
your own so you've got a battery and
Samsung is pretty well known for
including really beefy batteries let's
see what the milliamp hour battery on
life on this is 1440 milliamp hour this
is a big batter you'll have no problem
getting through a full day of normal use
with this it's actually not as thick as
the other 14 hundred million power
battery that they included with phones
like the epics in the past so that's
good to see here is the phone put that
aside for just a second we've got
Samsung's not awesome proprietary
connector I'll show you guys what that
looks like Samsung always does this mean
to send them some sort of note to use
micro or mini USB use some sort of
standard instead of this proprietary
port but there it is and if you use
samsung device in the past then you
won't mind it and just a standard wall
charger with that same court so let's
look at the fun stuff here is the phone
comes in a plastic bag slide it out
does not want to be slid it's unsuitable
all right so here is the phone actually
does have a little bit of heft to it but
that's mostly due to the slide-out
QWERTY keyboard let's take a look around
the device and see what we have so
here's your 320 x 320 display you've got
two soft keys right there you've got a
send key you've got a home button which
I'm assuming all these light up you've
got a back button and an end key you've
got a select button in the middle and
you've got a four-way navigation around
it so 5 way navigation in total on the
left side of the device we have a volume
up and down power and there is your
micro USB port it's nice that they
included that on the outside of the Vice
do not take out the battery to access
that on the right side we don't have
much other than the camera button and
the charging and earphone port this does
not have a 3.5 or 2.4 to point out of
headphone jack unfortunately you have to
use Samsung's proprietary port to plug
in headphones which is quite unfortunate
again I wish Samsung would use some sort
of standard for that but enough about
that let's take a look at the keyboard
here and do a first impression feel
keyboard on this does actually feel very
nice it has a very similar feel to the
blackberry bold the keys on the side are
sort of beveled and actually they are
relatively flush but because of the
beveling on the side I do you feel like
they're raised and they definitely have
a nice click enos fuel to them and it's
just as clicking on the outside as it is
in the middle obviously your number
arrays are right there with a two-tone
color let's go ahead and power this
thing on let's peel off the protective
film this thing is definitely a shiny
chrome it looks to be a fingerprint
magnet in fact it's so shiny looks like
you can use the back right there as a
mirror you guys can see me looks like a
funhouse mirror you can sort of see me
hello dad alright so let's power this
thing on
hit off the film all right you can get
that whooshing noise that comes from
this no whooshing noise sorry guys
welcome start using your phone please
see the getting started guide we're not
going to do that so i am going to pop in
the sim card and put in the battery
actually let's take a look at the back
and i will do that for you guys live on
camera we'll go ahead and open that up
see how the back of this comes off
there is a little latch push that in
lift off the back of the battery there
we go battery is off you can see the
back of the device really only a room
for a sim card in the battery so go
ahead and pop in the sim card done and
done and we will see if this batter has
a charge usually they come with a
partial charge on it put the back back
on I will power this guy on and we also
do a size comparing before I power this
on I definitely should say that the
front of it you can see an outline of
where the screen is but it actually
looks almost like a mirror finish so you
can see sort of reflection on their see
my finger so you can almost use this as
a the front of this as a mirror if you
wanted to as well so we sell the power
buttons on the sides go ahead and turn
it on and we'll see what we can go
Samsung branding I've actually came away
relatively impressed with windows mobile
6.1 when I used it in the past I wasn't
a fan at six point 0 0 or 5 point 0 but
6.1 standard at least uses a sliding
panels it makes navigation a little bit
easier we get that ridiculously loud 3g
logo from AT&amp;amp;T your windows mobile load
up screen and at 320 x 320 screen
definitely looks very nice it looks much
longer than most typical non touch
screen phones take it to connecting the
3g and there so let's see what we get on
the default home screen here gen
navigation is
the phone to turn itself off there it
goes okay so you've got this navigation
tago and you've got your sliding panel
interface I did a full demo by the way
of 6.1 standard versus the iphone it
keeps you guys are interested can go
back and check that out but definitely
or standard 6.1 interface the sliding
panels which I actually am a fan of
really easy navigation to see what you
have so let's do a your required size
comparison here and I've got my standard
Kasia phones we've got the iphone zoom
back a little bit doesn't get some sense
of perspective stack on top of each
other just about the same with a cross
however thickness wise is another story
all together but of course the propel
pro has something the iphone doesn't a
full qwerty board so there's a size
comparison with the iphone let's bring
in another samsung device this one is a
touchscreen this is the samsung epix can
see size was there's only a difference
there this is short and fat this is tall
and skinny and I think this comparison
is actually not that much different
thickness and this again still has a
slide-out qwerty board which I actually
preferred the slide-out not gonna
accidentally dial anybody's numbers with
it slide slid in so I really like that
nice way to lock the device and answer
phones without having to push new
buttons but then again i still like food
phones right home in the minority there
here is the HTC fuze 480 this one has
slide out keyboard as well it's the
touchscreen phone thickness wise look to
be just about the same size wise the
propel pro is just a little bit thicker
but not by much now i should say well i
said the propel pro is on the thicker
side and it definitely is but it's
certainly pocketable you can put in your
pocket really not notice it and i think
it's a little bit thicker because of
that fourteen hundred million of our
battery which i am more than willing to
deal with to have a phone that'll last
me all day and the next one I'll compare
it with here is the sprint or not the
Sprint rather in the treo pro which is
that
the only available for sprint right now
this is an unlocked version size
comparison is your thickness and talk to
each other so like most phones I'll use
this for a little while I'll give you
guys a full review although on initial
inspection build quality seem to be very
good and the spring-loaded sliding
mechanism definitely pops up relatively
quickly which is nice I've got a very
easy feel to it this is certainly going
to be a fingerprint magnet as you can
already see so many guys this is jon
rettinger with an unboxing for you of
the samsung propel pro sure stick around
for a review coming up and for exclusive
