from TechnoBuffalo here and the motion
control wars have officially begun
Nintendo is not the only game in town
the PlayStation Move is now available to
the masses and we are going to take a
first look and unbox this bad boy right
now alright so what we have to unbox
here today is the PlayStation Move
bundle pack it comes with the wand the
PlayStation Eye and the sports
championship game and then we also have
the one non included accessory we have
the PlayStation navigation controller so
you've got sort of all this stuff in one
box
this kit is going to set you back just
shy of a hundred dollars and the
navigation controller the not nunchuck
is going to set you back just about $30
so let's take a look here at the bundle
pack first PlayStation Move so we've got
the PlayStation Move motion controller
which is not called the one I'm probably
just going to call it an ice-cream cone
so that's sort of what it looks like oh
we've got few other things in here as
well the camera and the game when the
game is sort of Playstations version of
Wii Sports or Wii Sports Resort it's a
bunch of little mini party games either
included on one disc so without further
ado let's go ahead and bust this sucker
open we will bring in the O box for this
one I'll cut the tape here and you can
pick these up from Best Buy Game Stop
Amazon wherever you want to go to buy
these they are available and shipping
today good move my fingers out of the
way and try and stab the box Hey
alright so we've got the seal broken
almost broken yo this knife is not the
most efficient way to cut boxes but it
does make for entertainment I suppose
alright so that is now cut let's go
ahead and dig in I've actually not seen
one of these in person there is still
more tape to go I want to make sure that
you know that this thing is brand new
never been used before alright so the
tape has now been cut let's see what
we're going to get in
I we've got the game sports champion
take a look at that in just a moment
we've got the PlayStation Move
controller and you can see why I called
it the ice cream cones go ahead and open
this thing up and then rip the plastic
and for those you that are wondering
this little bubble on top sort of
rubbery there are some LED lights
underneath it so you can change the
color there's no denying that this looks
a little bit silly but it supposed to be
one of the best motion controls out
really delivering true one-to-one
movement let's take a look at sir the
button right here you've got the move
button in the middle your PlayStation
button your typical array of PlayStation
buttons here you've got the square the
exit triangle the circle and PlayStation
and Sony in particular really making a
move to let people know if this does
indeed have buttons which is a direct
attack at Microsoft's answered motion
controls their controller list Connect
system got a select button on the
left-hand side start button on the right
and a trigger button down below and of
course you've got the bizarre looking
ball on top got a wrist strap as well so
you don't throw the sucker through your
TV got a charging USB port here which is
kind of nice looks like it is a mini USB
for charging go and push that off to the
side for just one moment let's see what
else we got in the box we've got the
PlayStation Eye I assume which is a
camera for the PlayStation so now the
folks at Sony can really watch you and
see what you're doing on your couch now
let's take a look at this if you already
have a PlayStation Eye there's no need
to get the whole bundle I didn't have
one it's got speaker camera PlayStation
logo and a little indicator light to let
you know when the suckers on no suction
cup on the bottom just a little bit of
rubber and it plugs in and powers
through one your PlayStation 3's USB
port there's no external power for any
of this which is kind of nice and we
have anything else in the box we have
game demo discs so you can demo some
games PlayStation Move QuickStart guide
let's see what else what games do we get
demos of hopefully it's something fun
let's check it out
game demo disk you are going to not get
very much here in the way of games so
that's unfortunate push all this stuff
off the side let's take a look at the
sports champion game and see what comes
on here the movers are required looks
like there's some tennis some archery
some volleyball and some shooting I'm
sure there are a few more games on there
as well so let's push all this stuff off
to the side and let's take a look at the
PlayStation Move bubble ice-cream
controllers friend the aptly named
navigation controller which would be
akin to the wheeze nunchuck and this
sucker comes in a blister pack and
throws you guys will watch my videos you
just saw you know that I unbox things
with this ridiculously stupid knife
we're just going to eat especially
difficult to do with a blister pack but
I'm going ahead and try and give it a
shot live on camera so don't laugh at my
inevitable unboxing fails here and
possibly finger chopping fails as well
so I am going to just saw this sucker
open link blister packs are the most
ridiculous things on the planet I mean
you'd end up cutting your fingers and
they never open well I make loud noises
probably deafening the audience but I
think that I may have actually got it in
one shot boom that was actually an
unboxing win alright so push this off to
the side to let you know how to pair
them together great and here it is in
their navigation controller and this
sucker is Wireless and it's got a up
down left or right it's got an X in and
oh and it's got a pretty nice actually
feeling thumb stick got a trigger and
button on the top it's actually an l2 or
no 1 button and that's about it so let's
say you're going to look when you're
getting your motion control on
- silly but we'll see I'm very curious
to see how this actually works and how
it compares with the other motion
controlling ventures out there be sure
to stay tuned to the channel for all
kinds of motion controlling goodness and
also some comparisons and demos and the
rest of that stuff I'm sure checkup
TechnoBuffalo come to take a look at
additional coverage I am John Rhett
injure and I am going to get my move on
that sounds silly I'm gonna move on out
of here I'm gonna move on up I'm going
to shut up now
