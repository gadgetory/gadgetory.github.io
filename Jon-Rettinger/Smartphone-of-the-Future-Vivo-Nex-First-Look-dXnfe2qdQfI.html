Robert Rosenthal from TechnoBuffalo I am
here in Shanghai China for the launch of
vivos latest flagship phone the NEX this
is the phone the company says is the
smartphone of the future now if the name
vivo sounds familiar yes they are the
same company we saw back in January at
CES with a prototype of their bezel-less
phone with the fingerprint reader built
in under the display the same technology
is here on their newest flagship phone
along with a whole lot more the first
thing you'll notice about this phone is
that it has a truly edge to edge bezel
as display that comes in at just under
six point six inches and it's completely
free of any obstructions there's not
even a notch at the top then X has a 91%
screen of audio ratio and in order to
get that much display and so little
bezel Evo how to get creative with the
placement of the front-facing camera and
their solution is quite clever when you
activate the front-facing camera in the
camera app the camera actually raises up
from within the body of the phone itself
it's really cool to see happen and it
only takes about a second from you
tapping on the front-facing icon in the
camera app to the camera coming up and
being ready to use this is a mechanical
mechanism with moving parts but vivo
says that they've tested this enclosure
and drop and durability tests and they
say the camera can be raised and lowered
up to 50,000 times without any issues
the display itself is a Super AMOLED
panel and yes the next has the same
under display finger of a reader built
into the phone that we've seen before
but this time it's a bit better than
previous versions the new version of the
fingerprint reading technology is a bit
more forgiving of where you place your
finger on the phone when you go to
unlock it vivo says it has about a 50%
higher recognition accuracy rate than
the previous version had and it's also a
bit faster it's still a little bit
tricky to get set up initially but once
it registers your fingerprint
successfully it unlocks it very quickly
and seems to work well all the other
sensors you'd find on other smartphones
are here in the necks as well they're
just hidden under the display even the
phone's speaker system is built under
the screen and
uses the entire display to vibrate and
transmit sound to act like traditional
smartphone speakers on the back of the
phone you've got a dual vertically
stacked camera system with one of those
being a 12 megapixel F 1.8 shooter and
the other five megapixels and a 2.4 on
the bottom of the phone you'll find a
USB C port for charging and on the top
pay there's a headphone jack vivo has
some of the latest and greatest silicon
powering the necks inside of this thing
is a snapdragon 845 processor and Adreno
630 GPU Hinn and all the graphics 8 gigs
of ram and 256 gigs of an internal
storage all fueled by a massive 4000
milliamp hour battery this phone is
running on vivos fun touch OS which is
based off of Android 8.1 Oreo and allows
you to use kind of Android P iPhone 10
ask gesture styles to navigate around
and access to four controls on the phone
it also has its own smart assistant
built-in named Jovi which seems to be
the company's equivalent to Bigsby
dedicated button and all in my brief
hands-on time with this phone I have to
say that the phone feels incredibly
premium and well built and the massive
bezel is display is incredibly immersive
and I don't usually mind the notch on my
iPhone 10 or other Android flagships
that I'm testing but once you use a
phone that has nothing on the screen to
distract you it's difficult not to see
it becoming a trend adopted by other
manufacturers and something you're just
gonna want as you're pricing and
availability the next is initially only
going to be on sale in China no word yet
on expansion to other markets like
Europe or the US and that flagship
version with 256 gigs of internal
storage
he's retailing for the equivalent of
about 780 US dollars so what are your
thoughts on this newest phone from vivo
the idea of a bezel list notch list
phone with a fingerprint reader built
and under the display has long been the
dream of so many and now that this
concept phone has officially become
reality are you guys interested in
picking one up leave a comment down
below and let us know and also let us
know if you guys want us to do a full
review on this vivo next I am Robert
Rosenthal from TechnoBuffalo thank you
so much for watching I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
