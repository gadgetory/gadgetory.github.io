from TechnoBuffalo we're checking out
the porsche design p9 88 2 smartphone
from blackberry get a load of this we're
going to do the unboxing right here
there it is there's the phone itself
it's made out of stainless steel get a
quick look that back leather covers
genuine leather it's some of the top 2%
leather you can buy in the world
blackberry tells us and then here you
have the custom pin for your blackberry
messenger bbm so it's a card you can
carry with you let's go through the box
you've got all the global chargers
you'll ever need probably you also have
the porsche design blackberry so you get
the blackberry battery rather so you
have the logo right there and that's an
1800 milliamp hour battery I'll go
through the phone in just a second
here's the charger micro USB cable under
here you have the Start Guide in various
languages being extra careful here try
to get this up and then here you have
the porsche design screen cleaner
microfiber cloth that comes with the
phone to complete with the logo and like
most blackberries it comes with
headphones get these
I want to ruin the box you get a set of
earbuds that have also the PD logo on
them you look at it from the side sort
of a PD combined logo for Porsche design
now let's take a look at the phone
itself okay so here's the phone itself
like I said it costs two thousand three
hundred fifty US dollars you've got the
stainless steel as we talked about on
the right hand side you have the volume
controls nothing on the bottom on the
left you have the HDMI port and a micro
USB charging and you can see if you look
close this Porsche design logo that we
saw in the headphones as well up top the
power button and 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack this back cover is made
out of genuine leather like I said it's
some of the finest in the world and you
also have the 8 megapixel camera capable
of recording 1080p video and that's
complemented by the 2 megapixel camera
up front quick look at the software here
okay so when you swipe up the screen
you're greeted by the Porsche design
world timer which is based off of one of
the porsche design watches and you also
get a slightly different user interface
they're more square icons blackberry
tells us as opposed to what you find on
on regular BlackBerry's as you can see
you've got NFC and of course global
roaming with 4G LTE so that will work on
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile in the United States
okay so let's take a look under the hood
here just pop off the battery panel from
the bottom it's got 64 gigs of on-board
storage but you can add another 64 gigs
using the micro SD card slot that'll
give you 128 total here's the porsche
design blackberry also have the SIM card
slot like I said it supports LTE
globally and in the United States on
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T onboard you have a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core processor and 2 gigs
of RAM so really similar specs to what
we saw on the BlackBerry z10 though
overall it's got a much nicer build
design here of course you'll have to pay
for it like I said it's $2,350 it
launches this week in the United States
on Friday that's actually tomorrow in
porsche design stores there's one and so
in New York City for example and other
locations around the world let's take a
quick look at some of the accessories ok
so here's one of the accessories this is
a $95 sleeve or pocket if you'll call it
that slides right in and then pretty
cool you just pull this tab pops out the
BlackBerry and then it slides out and
it's nice and secure there so it's not
going to it's not going to go anywhere I
don't know I just did that all right and
now let's just take a look at some of
the rear back panels that you can swap
out there's three different ones they're
all the same
genuine leather top 2% in the world
you've got a blue one a red one and a
khaki tan one and these all also retail
for $95 each okay that was a quick look
at the porsche design p9 9 8 - smart
phone from blackberry this is todd
