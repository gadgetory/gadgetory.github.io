amazon day happy filled day happy hump
day depending on where you're located
perhaps it means you're having an extra
good day it really is comforted for you
we are going to be talking about the
news du jour which is my fancy talk for
news of the day we've got you fire TV
and you can play a drinking game along
with me and take a shot our time I say
kindle fire TV and Windows Phone 8.1 so
ask questions we've got our moderator
and good friend and editor-in-chief Sean
the beard on in here hi everybody who
will be moderating and trimming in
answering questions he's our streaming I
guess local expert so to speak so
there's there's a lot of things to talk
about Amazon's now officially getting
involved in your TV Microsoft's Windows
Phone is getting closer to being a real
big competitor I think to the iOS and
Android Thrones you could even say that
they are playing a game of thrones or at
least trying to play a game of thrones
high but I'm not even going to
acknowledge that sorry I should be the
caveat my baby was up from one to four
in the morning screaming atheon so if my
jokes are even less funnier than usual
I'm so sorry and I'm not sure that's
even humanly possible our first question
comes from Josh McMurdo well windows 8.1
Update finally let users boot to the
desktop and skip Metro UI dude yeah
announce that yes they did and it's sad
when they have to make an announcement
like their figure there's so many things
to talk about when things I talked about
was yes you can now boot directly to
your normal desktop like you've been
able to do in every other version of
windows before then that's probably the
feature most people were extra excited
about so yes booster remember this tile
you I we're just gonna break over here
oh and also remember we have the same
deal we made about touch screen like
thank you the mass of it because we
realized the mouse and keyboard
experience
the modern UI was awful yeah yeah duper
extra awful okay we've got one more
windows 8.1 question okay this one comes
from Shawn huh well windows 8.1 finally
show how good windows 8 will be um
that's a subjective question I've always
liked windows 8 um I liked it on the
surface I will say the learning curve to
learn how to use it was really really
long that's for somebody like me who's
you know more on on the tech-savvy side
folks it just sort of used to using a
computer had a much harder time so I
always liked windows 8 I think one of
the 8.1 makes a little bit easier for
people being able to sort of launch app
seamlessly between normal you are
desktop UI and modern UI and then you
know doc both those apps things going to
make life much easier for a lot of
people remember you loaned me that
Windows a laptop and I called you that
night and what how do i shut it down
yeah like yes scroll and bring the charm
bar from the side you gotta go to
settings and then the where's tower it
made light wood what is it that you to
be a four step process yeah no question
don't turn it off this question comes
from Siro did you order the Amazon fire
TV yes of course me good I think it's
awesome when Amazon did like available
today if you have same-day delivery and
we knew this was coming when you sell a
controller leak but like the console
itself or the box itself didn't leak the
packaging didn't leak at all I think
that's pretty incredible nowadays when
like every single part gets leaked
online so I don't know who Amazon's
using for their super-secret suppliers
who their supply chains but Apple HTC
and Samsung maybe I want to look at him
a little bit ya know there had been no
leaks on the box whatsoever ameritech
all the rivers we'd heard was that was
going to be a dongle chromecast sighs
yeah which is pretty cool and even the
name nobody knew you know fire TV um was
pretty neat so I could didn't credit for
that yep here's a another question i'm
not sure we know the answer on this one
yet uh matth√§us she Sean excuse me
i mispronounced your name is amazon fire
TV coming to other countries outside the
US EG central europe my guess would be
yes but they did not specifically
address that it will be coming to other
countries they didn't say which
countries in one no unfortunate yeah so
I I would've mattered that a well yeah
yeah that would be my guess as well okay
this question comes from sooner Chandra
is Windows Phone 8.1 a free update and
is it coming to all windows phone 8
phone yes absolutely free updates I
don't know people really charge for OS
updates anymore I think that got killed
Apple did for a while and they yeah they
did up until Mavericks yeah um they took
my windows phone 8.1 I don't think OS
done kits mobile OS up they think any
capital charge for OS update to rejoin
oh yes I'm sorry on the desktop they
charge but not on mobile so uh yeah it
will be free and they didn't say if it's
coming to all windows phone devices but
I have four rumors that it will come to
all Lumia devices so if you have one of
those you should be should be ok but for
I understand this hardware requirements
are very similar to what Windows Phone 8
was so we can run a windows phone 8
presumably can running point one as well
I'm surprised it was a big update they
didn't call it Windows Phone 9 or this
windows 18.5 like a point 1 denotes a
cat angulo update they added it's fun
really awesome new features i hope you
guys know God because I really want to
talk about him well here you go then for
Alexander's 14 14 will windows phone 8.1
finally have the microsoft version of
Siri it will and it is called Cortana
officially which is awesome Cortana of
course from halo fame she's the little
virtual character that master chief hung
out with room too much of the story but
it does make sense that they call the
court on it's pretty awesome it looks
like it works pretty well one of things
I liked about it that you can't really
do a series you can type request to if
you're not have additional where you can
talk or its loud you can just type it
and she will understand and execute your
every will which was pretty nice oh yes
finally we have it and it will
coming very very soon yeah I'm it's a
geeky thing but I love the fact they
called it Cortana yeah I think everybody
really really like that from one of our
regulars from session the hull do you
need a amazon prime subscription to take
full use of the Amazon fire TV yes for
boys yes yes I mean unless you just want
to watch like Netflix and Hulu whenever
Netflix probably makes it there yes yeah
exactly yeah it's gonna be very tightly
integrated into the glamazon ecosystem
even with the price increase I Peng and
renewing my prime every year I'm so ably
giddy to do it it is the best money I
think I spend all year prime is so worth
it even just for the second day shipping
so the streaming stuff is just like an
added bonus ah I know not affiliated
amazon at all and not advertising or
anything but i think prime is really the
best going a tech even at 100 bucks down
it's worth every single penny living in
the middle of nowhere like i do it's a
lifesaver Sean really does live in the
middle of nowhere you google maps
address it's like a forest and then like
a pin drops right in the middle of it
pretty fun okay here here's another
subjective question but interesting from
shauna do you like Windows 8 or Windows
7 better I like what does ain't no
honestly I like a touch me like using on
the surface windows 7 was nice so sort
of still just windows to me so I prefer
windows 8 but I recognize that I am
still probably in the minority with that
opinion but I really like the way it
works like the way it looks and once I
sort of got the hang of it I could
appreciate sort of the X you can call it
confusing and elegance um uh windows 8
that's one way to put it no now here's a
very excellent question about Windows
Phone and this one comes from Nathan
gelsen I had windows phone two years ago
and the apps were limited how is it now
that is a good question Nathan he also
had a great name um the apps have gotten
way way better so for me there
core group of apps that I use Facebook
Twitter Instagram and whatsapp and all
of those are available on Windows so on
anything secondary that I can live
without the other apps are important to
me at least a Google Analytics app may
they have a Google Analytics app a
youtube app and there's been issues with
google working with microsoft on a nap
but there's an app called was it metro
tube that works really really well so
all the apps that I've me get have have
been there and that's something that was
not true you know two years ago probably
when you used it so we actually gotten
way way better there's still a ton of
garbage apps out there but you can find
the gems and they're much easier to find
and much more of them now than
definitely there were two years ago
here's a question from sumner Chandra
about the fire TV why would someone up
for amazon fire rather than any other
service provider there'll actually be a
post about that shortly after the show
and you wanna give it either now aunty
nan I i will give a teaser i I think
some of the big things are the gaming
supports while it's still not PC gaming
like some of the rumors had said also
the fact that it's got a lot more
horsepower under the hood and voice
search I threw my hands up in joy for
voice search yeah um it's a funny
comment got me is actually better spec
than the iphone 5s yeah it's a gonna be
very interesting i can't wait for minder
arrive tomorrow yeah i'm excited all of
our tomorrow as well all right and
here's a very specific question from
mated ilk are there any changes in
Windows 8.1 RT um that's a good question
I don't remember the mentioning RT at
all I think the only change my making RT
is making our tea just magically
disappear yeah I I think we're going to
see with windows 9 at RT just kind of
slowly die yeah I don't I don't I
remember hearing a word about Windows RT
yeah exactly all right from Greg kiss
kessman excuse
is it worth picking up amazon fire TV if
i already own a chromecast good question
yeah all right enjoy church is nice
gaming is nice if those aren't important
to use of your chromecast I mean you get
pretty much know anything to do on your
phone or tablet York you'll do that
includes you know foo do now and a ton
of other services um I think chromecast
and it's a cheaper option to chromecast
is still good we go Sean yeah yeah I
totally great chromecast is it's getting
a lot more support especially since they
launched the SDK in February and I I
think that it's still a great option
especially at $35 you really like you
can't beat it yeah I agree it doesn't
hurt to have a full set top box as well
for it depend on what features you're
looking for so yeah the only problem i'm
running into it all the stuff is I have
enough freaking hdmi ports I there's
gonna be an editorial about that coming
up in the not-too-distant future like
not everything you're plugging to eat
GMOs TVs have for if you're lucky and
you can get a switcher I know when you
can get a receiver employed by means
like you just don't have that many hdmi
ports more more ports on TVs please uh
Jacob was at a samsung event and
actually asked them and they said that
the average user only uses three HDMI
ports and they do not see this currently
as an issue what okay so let's run
through this together shall we once I
assume you don't have a splitter or
you're not running to your receiver
you've got a cable box or satellite
whatever that might be um let's say
you've got one streamer which is
probably a few so it's very few probably
more books you've got either chromecast
an apple TV Roku something like that
pretty reasonable people have one of
those um one gaming system perhaps mmm
Xbox one we whatever ps4 so there's
three taken right there's I think most
sort of common core system then you want
to start adding things like a fire TV or
chromecast or Roku or myriad of other
option appletini if you don't have that
blu-ray player blu ray player exactly
ports go
ev eV EV really ridiculously fast ya
know it's crazy yeah I will say another
free Xbox ones are going to everyone in
the audience that build what's worth
whoa well kind of wish i wasnt build now
even though i have an xbox one uh here's
another question from somewhere to Agra
how much can I be the joke if they have
all these Xbox one's laying around and
sold how much does the fire TV costs
ninety-nine dollars 99 99 but if you
want the game controller then that's an
additional thirty nine dollars 3999 so
forty dollars but it does currently come
with 16 99 and value in amazon coins and
a freaking amazon coin it's like
dogecoin look better so much coin so
much coin at coin habit quick thank you
from one of our viewers here who is the
questions not moving up there but from
Nathan go Orson not a question but I
want to say that I enjoy the interaction
with all of your viewers thanks hey Dad
thank you sir hey you wait you're
pointing at you we do enjoy an
interacting with all of you it's nice to
hear what everyone has got on their
minds what's the important questions I
wish though that we can interact more
because Leslie just like me talking but
I wish that we could talk back and
dialogue up yes exactly okay and here it
is again I know it we already addressed
this but I'm sure it's going to come up
multiple times for me to Mesa jhilik are
all phones running Windows Phone 8 to be
updated 8.1 I know we already dressed it
but I'm sure this is all a lot of
people's minds yeah we don't know about
every phone they didn't say which phone
but the river we've heard will at least
be every dunia phone will get 81 yep
alright our next question here is from
Schwimmer John dragon what type of
gaming integration is there in the fire
TV it's going to have its own game store
and they
also announced amazon game studio which
is currently developing a dozen original
game so there will be thousands of
currently available android games as
well as the ones amazon is working on it
so it's a big point that John mentioned
they are android based games make it did
they expect the games that cost an
average of I believe a dollar in 85
cents you have dollar 85 so the unity
out looking like a sixty-dollar flagship
console-style game you know it's more
cheaper impulse I purposes but they are
you know android-based big game
supposedly porting from typical Android
over to fire TV should be relatively
easy for developers yeah they said since
its Android an HTML base that you not
only in the games but in the apps it
should also be a very easy move over so
I expected we'll see a lot of stuff
coming up very quickly agree ok the next
question comes from Rex Enzo will the
windows phone 8.1 Update make devices
with 512 megabytes ram like Lumia 520
better and faster um they didn't say
after that we didn't get into like you
know following the devices but I would
assume that it's not going to make it
faster either you're still dealing with
a limited spectrogram again I settled
lumia devices like assume that you will
get something of a point one I wouldn't
be surprised if it's a pared-down 8.1
version else that's five of the twelve
megabyte ceramic still sort of on the
lower end of what's uh you know becoming
standard now it is yeah it will be very
interesting to see now here's a little
bit of an op topic question but it's one
that's on everyone's minds as of light
from mated cilic do you think Microsoft
will release a SmartWatch OS like Google
yes I think you'll have one live tile
and give you a single notification no I
do you think Microsoft's going to get
into it of course typically microsoft
fashion probably get into it about six
years when the trend is already on the
sort of downswing yeah i think
eventually they will oh yeah me too mmm
from Alexander's 1414 does the fire TV
support any type of marrying for Kendall
devices they did not mention
today it does have a second screen
option for when you're watching a movie
I'll pull information from IMDb even
about the specific scene you're watching
but they did not mention any sort of
mirroring but that seems possible with
the Bluetooth connectivity and Wi-Fi
connectivity so maybe down the road yeah
I would have seen that's a no-brainer
that that will come and Sean mentioned
the integration of IMDB which
coincidentally amazon owns I'm really
yeah yeah I was soon as I said IMDb of
like of course it yeah I will say guys
for the next leg whatever 10 or 15
minutes that were on if you have other
questions to that you want to ask if you
want asked by other piece of technology
please go ahead and do so you know
looking primarily on the fire TV and
Windows Phone 8.1 but anything else you
guys are welcome to try answer chime in
and ask well we actually have one of
those it's been lurking down and the
system here does the new HTC One have
wireless 802 point 11ac citizen new the
fire one mA um I'm checking our product
page boys keep one m8 i believe only has
an N but at 2.45 yogurts I got some top
of my head that right on its back
sometimes I am going to check that right
now oh yeah I think I can do this back
to almost my memory yes folks we're
going to test John on live video here
you can just dig dis name phone if I can
excite the specs for you it has AC ah
balzac you were correct about dual band
but it does it does have a see also guys
nokia lumia 930 just got announced its
international version of the lumina
breakdown done right so yeah I thought
they were going to announce that this
evening it just happens John oh whoa
live and on the air just haven't you
heard here first food okay uh there's
some interesting questions popping
towards the top
uh does the fire TV offer anything new
shell hug Wanderers so what is it Sean
one of you ha i answer it does offer
some new things it offers a optical out
which the apple TV offers the big thing
though everyone is going to be the
gaming because this yes the Roku does
have gaming support on some of its
models but it's very limited and it's
just with the remote in an a B button
with the integration of the controller I
think that makes things a little bit
more interesting but I'm almost looking
at like a string box with an oil can
console shoved inside of it yes at the
period it's a very good analogy action
yeah so I I think once we have it in
hand and we can actually look at the
games especially this the first game
that's coming free with the controller
sub-zero and we can actually see how it
plays I think that's going to tell us a
lot more yeah something oh that's great
I can't wait for the sequel work in to
come out should be pretty good Johnny
Cage come come out after you after that
folks this is what I have to work with
every day anyway ah this question comes
from Craig kessman any more rumors to
round up regarding the nexus 8 um
nothing honestly nothing new we heard
some grumblings from one source but we
couldn't get it verified by someone else
so I unfortunately I don't know anything
concrete on that one yet at all yeah I
think it's probably gonna happen but we
just don't know for sure you up yeah
alright moving on here let's see we've
got tons of questions coming in uh a lot
of questions asking how the the fire TV
compares with other devices like I said
there is a top 5 list coming out shortly
after the show so I will be addressing
all those for you folks in that post I I
think the big thing is its size
especially the quad
core processor the two gigabytes ram the
dedicated graphics processor I think
it's going to be quite powerful actually
when we look at it yeah and they said
you know lag with anything that's why
there's a dedicated GPU here so it's
growing through menus will be no lag and
all kind of other stuff you sir that no
lag experience and I think a lot of
people have been been hoping for yeah
exactly another question from summer
Chandra has windows phone 8.1 improved
on multitasking did they cover that I
unfortunately was not able to watch so
before we get to their tech exam is
asking about the vin on my desk the OCD
is killin em sis for you they didn't
talk about one from tasking at all
presumably you can close app so you can
swipe them up close multiple the same
time but they didn't talk much about the
test nail or at all about it Oh John can
you wave if you read this anyway oh my
okay let's see here oh now this is
interesting i did not realize this i
will have to double check this i didn't
think it started in 94 amazon's turning
20 this year Wow um so I know Sean you
know this answer but to some of the
younger folks out there what kind of
company amazon start as what what did
they sell ready answer at your head if
you can if your answer was books you
would get correct they were just a
bookstore i remember buying books from
just amazon com i think i went through
my order history not too long ago my
first order from those in 96 and it was
books that was all they did was just
just books and they did it very well now
here's a question Jon I didn't get to
ask you did you see this question is
from a bomb 24 is e la mex the musk the
next evolutionary inventor you saw the
60 minutes 50 60 minutes piece and
I believe you man eric schmidt from
google said when he dies he wants to
give you on muskies money because he's
going to change the world yes i think
you one must absolutely is I think it
goes beyond serve like that sort of
Steve Jobs analogy i think steve jobs
did a lot for consumer electronics in
the world i think in one Musk's gonna do
a lot to actually change the world and
there's a big big difference there um
mr. musk has said his goals hard to not
only help save the planet but also to
help mankind expand to a multiplanetary
looking so get a colony on Mars which
judging by how quickly are burning their
resources and cleaning this planet is
going to be increasingly important so I
thank you very much thing to be on musk
is the next revolutionary inventor and
world world changer hey I have to agree
I and having yo seen Tesla cars in
person now it's it's quite interesting
it's yeah yeah so now i agree to john
hagee how many people consider angle you
know what i think i'll start a rocket
company and actually do like it hasn't
been a successful American startup card
company since Chrysler that's been like
it's been successful since Chrysler
those are very very long time ago 1938
apartment wants to say I mean just like
a really really long time ago and so
many have failed it's a it's very
impressive you know DeLorean fisker
recently american motors gone under me
that so many car companies have have
failed exactly um okay I Sumer I I saw

question that i'll let you answer all
i'll just put it up at the top and let
you deal with this question on your own
Sean why do you always wear a cap while
live streams I've been asking that
question too not only does he work
during live streams Sean where's that
cap during everything when Sean comes
the office cap we go out in Southern
California Gavin and you think that
Sean's got like a weird he's got like
what is like a Kuato on the back of his
head um isn't that cuanto para otra yeah
I came out the stomach but yes cuatro oh
that's right on the you know the back of
his head um you know where he's he's got
those whose name we do not speak growing
it had the back of his head I don't know
why Sean does that that's a very valid
question I know last time I was out the
office it was februari I did not wear
the hat once to the office mmm I did it
i I just I like wearing a stocking cap
it's just always been my thing Monday
zhem of robbing convenience stores and
John makes a little face every time he
sees it coming my bad kid sees me put it
oki oz like this is our homeless
editor-in-chief what if they have the
beer yeah it's weird that when Sean
comes they just like pushes his stuff in
a cart 0 like tighten up Chrysler found
in 1925 Dana I was old not close on that
what are we gonna do with you John you
got HTC One m8 Stacy wrong and I'm
listen I did laws my cred yeah we're
gonna make you stand in the corner for
an hour he'd go for an hour break who is
the Amazon fire TV directed towards
that's actually a very interesting
question chalant what do you feel that
one um I think it's yet another example
of Amazon very successfully if you look
at the the kindle fires who's that
directed towards it's a android tablet
but not quite an Android tablet and so
it's directed at I think the
budget-minded consumer who is already on
Amazon all the time and it's just yet
another opportunity with the fire TV for
them to keep you in the ecosystem and
get you to buy amazon coins purchase
videos directly from amazon prime
instant video and hey wouldn't you like
have access to all these free movies you
could if you signed up for amazon prime
which amazon prime customers also spend
more money on average than your average
amazon comes am um I want to jump in
here it was just announced by Stephen
Elop on stage that in fact all Lumia
devices will be getting 8.1 including
the 530 so all the new devices it says
Lumia your phone will be getting 8.1 no
idea when but it will be coming so we
can confirm that rumor that
her for a while that's very nice very
nice um from Adam al-ahmadi I'm going to
apologize what was the best feature
Windows Phone 8.1 for John there are a
lot of really cool features I I like the
analysts fear was gonna make jokes and
laughing me but how they serve made the
home screen a raster baited image is
very cool the sort of like little
pictures make up a whole big one the new
keyboard is awesome I'm really really
excited about that I've always really
liked Windows Phone I think now it's
just gotten way better it's really
Cortana it's something that just really
neat it's not really impressive anymore
because those things kind of been done
it's nice and agrees with apps you can
type to it but I'm excited for for the
new home screens the new lock screen
looks great i'm a better for a lot about
Windows Phone 8.1 I can't wait to try it
yeah I think this is gonna be a good
update yeah okay we're going to take a
you have time for one more question Jon
I do have time for one more question all
right this one comes from Eric Hong can
you stream mobile tablet content via
fire TV does fire TV voice search
feature search all providers contents or
just the amazon prime I know that Roku
allows you to search all providers
contents that was a lot of it is that
that's why I picked oh they did not say
anything about streaming any content
from the kindle fires yet as for
searching all providers they did not
dress that directly we will have the
fire TV in the irvine office and i'll
also have one tomorrow that's actually
one of the very first things i want to
try out and see if it does search more
than just saying go ahead and women aged
just just gonna be prime but we'll see
yeah the NCS gonna be interesting
because the Rope who does search all
like Netflix Hulu Plus and all that so
it's gonna be interesting to see if the
voice search does work for all of them
it because they dim directly address
that today no need so okay we we have to
I want to take this one because actually
I can answer this one very easily
will we ever see web OS again from a
bloom 24 yes on what platform John
