with the air pods - not entirely true
but the main one Before we jump into the
rest of the air pods video if you guys
notice a change in videos we're having
fun making these we don't want you guys
to miss anything so hit the subscribe
button a little Bella see notified when
new videos are coming your way so in the
air pods first came out made a video on
it I thought they were actually
ridiculous and only served Apple for
justify removing the headphone jack on
the iPhone 7 like they were charging you
for a feature that they removed in to
some extent I still think that but you
don't like any Apple product I wanted to
try it and I didn't want to form an
opinion based on just you know some
rambling around in my head so I tried
the ear pods and I slowly started to
come around on what they could do and
what they could do you know for me I'd
try to make my life a little bit easier
I still think the timing of launching
them we could moving the headphone jack
put a bad taste in my mouth but at least
now I can appreciate what the vision was
when the air pods first launched so a
lot of them the mystique of Apple and
the secret the air pods is how well
things integrate and just work I mean
the pairing is as simple as opening up
the case and then they're paired in and
work and you could use them on any other
sort of Apple device you've got going on
Bluetooth and they're there ready to be
connected
that is awesome something you can't
emulate with another pair of headphones
also obviously like that they're
wireless not having a cord to get
tangled or not having you know pull a
lot of cables out of your pocket
certainly super nice as well I've been
relatively impressed the battery life
considering how small they are in all
honesty I'm not that big of a music guy
I'm not an audiophile have a hard time
telling the difference between you know
really incredible sounding headphones
and headphones that are just average but
my use case with air pods is mostly
based on phone calls I am
on the phone all the time I don't like
having a phone up to my head so the fact
of the air pods serve that purpose very
well the microphones been really good I
wish I had a little more noise
cancelling or any noise canceling for
that matter but for making phone calls
light music listening and listening to
audiobooks they've been a perfect fit
for me so I think if you ask Apple now
if they anticipate is excessive air pods
they would tell you a hundred percent
yes I think Apple fell backwards in the
air pause success that they felt back
with them to success the App Store and
then serve hindsight rewrites history I
think they were trying to make up
forgetting removing a feature on the
phone and then they took off and created
a brand new category that I think caught
Apple off-guard as we saw by the supply
constraints in the first ship also if we
remember when the first air puffs
launched like you couldn't buy them
anywhere if you didn't pre-order they
were still hard to find up until four or
five months ago so I think that scarcity
probably helps people think that they
had something that was rare and Anna
maybe was a planned thing on Apple there
was a supply chain constrained but I
think that helped Apple achieve some
more mainstream status maybe people just
want them more so I think air pauses
like as a status symbol has been has
been fun and like their their memes of
like fancy looking dogs with air pods in
and I think sort of once they reached
that cult status of like you're
successful if you have air pods
I think then people started to ignore
the hideous design it kind of became
more mainstream so I did 60 bucks for
Gen one for a lot of people is obviously
justifiable it sold a ton of them it's
still expensive but it was maybe more
justifiable because at the time there
weren't that many other they're good
wireless options and then you know how
seamless it paired made the air pods at
least seem quasi justifiable up to a
hundred sixty bucks price point but now
at two hundred dollars I think they're
really approaching the threshold of like
that's just too expensive
so it's been almost two years since
earpads won and the hype was building
for the next-gen the rumor mill was
churning about what it was going to have
and in hindsight it was probably more of
like a wish list than things Apple was
planning but all the stuff it would have
wanted colors noise-canceling water
resistance better audio fidelity and
then air pods to came out and what we
got was wireless charging hey high
support and the h1 chip
alright so we're we're friends you're
not gonna yell at me I can admit it
I bought air pods too I pretty much just
bottomed for wireless charging call me a
hypocrite it's fine and I've been using
air pots too and they work exactly the
same as air pods one the pairing time is
slightly faster I have noticed zero
difference in audio quality and I charge
them wirelessly so I spent 200 bucks to
essentially get a get a green dot I feel
like for the first couple days that I
got air pods - I was trying to talk
myself into thinking that the audio is
better so I didn't feel like I spent
$200 for no reason but then I went back
and listened to my ear pods one and I
really have a hard time noticing any
sort of of difference whatsoever but
they charge wirelessly if any product in
Apple's recent history was like a
stopgap until what's coming like a point
5s generation it is clearly air pots -
they they look the same they sound the
same they perform almost the same they
can just like put on a tinfoil hat for a
second and talk about what actually came
out with the air pods
- remember the Box mentioned air power
which obviously isn't a thing anymore
I'm gonna go out on a very tiny limb and
say air pots - in the wireless charging
case which was actually shown off back
when Apple was announcing air power was
ready to go in some part of 2018 and was
actually held for I'm guessing for the
air power launch and they realized they
weren't gonna launch
it they started you know just shipping
them otherwise it makes no sense for air
power to be mentioned on the box so what
you're getting is already something that
should have been out four or five months
ago and even more credence to this being
just a you know S series of upgrades and
you know the big one coming next year
when you get presumably a lot of the
things you want on your wish list it's a
different market now that when air pods
one came out airports to are coming to a
more like mature market so with anything
electronic something new and better is
always coming so think of air pods to is
like air pods
s and 2020 is the rumor of be getting
better water resistance in actual
noise-canceling better battery life
color options those things that will
sort of separate the current gen airpot
s-- from you know what could be coming
so that alone is a good reason to
consider waiting and if wireless
charging is what you want you can buy
the wireless charging case on its own
without having to they don't get the air
pods to to go with them
there's also crazy amount of competition
now for you know for your earholes you
know you've got obviously the galaxy
buds the first one to come to mind Jabra
is got options Bose has options Apple's
own brand beats has an option that does
things that air pod suit doesn't do with
the new power beats the Chinese
knockoffs are coming like crazy and for
sniffily less money there's just more
options now than before making air pods
to some even like a less compelling of a
buy like some of the features of air
pods to is nice but even Apple
themselves the they just say better
sound quality but they don't really
sound that much better it says improved
battery life but like it's really not
improved that much this isn't a
compelling reason to go out there and
buy of a brand new pair of ear pods to
so I think that the caveat is if you
don't have any wireless headphones
especially if you don't have air pods
one and you just want what apple offers
cuz it works the Ricoh system then yeah
air pots to is a good way to go if
you're on a pair of headphones to
phone calls listen to music or
audiobooks it's awesome so since I'm
kind of living in a dreamland
let me take a little bit about what I
would like for air pods 3 and Tim Cook
if you're if you're watching in this
hypothetical dream land you take some
notes let's start with something that
makes them look different if I'm gonna
shell out that money I want them to look
different than what I had before so give
me some colors with new air pots a matte
black and it would make Marquez happy
would look crazy sweet product red ear
pods would look awesome
I would love some colors I like to be
able to use my ear pods on an airplane
also so some sort of noise cancelling
would be really nice and a lot of people
like to work out in their pods and maybe
they get a little sweaty so better water
resistance would be awesome to have
improved audio fidelity better battery
life all that kind of stuff would be
things that I would want air pods for
you to have so if we could just check
off each one of those first I'll be a
happy man but I still probably find
something to complain about because of
who I am as a person
chances are you even you may already
have your heart set on air pots and if
you do buy them you're gonna get a pair
of really good wireless headphones if
you've got gen one you're looking
longingly at the green dot on your
friends case hold off it is not worth
the upgrade if you don't have any sort
of wireless headphones right now there
are a ton of really good cheaper
alternatives that bring things to the
table like noise cancelling and better
water resistance and better battery life
that the air pots - just don't
and the moral here being is is don't be
a John save your money and take your
special friend out for for a nice dinner
they deserve it
you know who I'm talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
