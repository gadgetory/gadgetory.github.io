brought to you by go daddy well hello
there it's John Q here from
TechnoBuffalo and welcome to what's the
apps in the last video I asked you guys
to leave some comments as to what
application I should check out a samson
23 asked me if i can check out Pro HDR
camera for android well a simpson 23 my
friend i did just that now i've played
with some HDR and photo applications for
the iphone but they weren't really my
thing i don't really take pictures and
for those of you who don't know what HDR
is HDR basically takes three versions of
the same photo at different exposures
underexposed neutral and overexposed and
combines all of them together to create
a singular photo preserving and
highlighting as much detail as possible
and sometimes sometimes it has a surreal
mystical photoshop a airbrush a kind of
look right off the bat Pro HDR camera
sounds promising I mean the word Pro is
in the name I mean like Wow Pro how can
you go wrong that's legit right there
man
but don't let the name for you okay I
loaded this guy on the LG revolution I
figured the camera on the LG revolution
would be a little bit better and more
up-to-date compared to this Nexus I had
laying around right here and what you're
seeing right now it's basically all of
these settings that you can do for Pro
HDR cam I know right where is well
everything there's no white balancing or
zooming hex you can't even tap to
autofocus in this application which is
kind of silly because you can do all
this in the default camera application
there are some hidden settings but these
don't really do anything besides change
the photo size but at least there's HDR
imaging right I guess so if you want to
call it that Pro HDR literally takes two
pictures one after the other instead one
single photo processed differently like
on the iPhone 4 and I know you might be
thinking John you're so handsome and
popular but does that make a difference
yeah it does and Pro HDR camera does it
pretty slowly as well so if you have
jittery hands like myself you're gonna
end up with two slightly different
photos that when combined will have a
ghosting like effect after doing a quick
indoor test and seeing how disgraceful
the camera performs in low lighting
conditions I went outside keep in mind I
am NOT
a photographer I don't know anything
about photography I just happen to make
videos using a photographer's camera
close enough right okay yeah here's a
picture of some leaves
notice that ghosting thing I was talking
about and I held the camera with both
hands okay and it still it still sucked
after you take a picture you can play
around with these sliders to create some
pretty cool coloring effects but it's
kind of useless you know when the
picture sucks for this one I want it to
be all artsy so I took a picture of me
holding a rock and as you can see I'm
even worse with one hand Wow now there
are three rocks and no ghosting I wonder
why well that's because I turned HDR off
yes the primary feature of this
application had to be turned off so that
I can take a fancy artsy picture of me
holding three rocks in my hand but at
least the coloring was nice and I mean
it's pretty cool
and for those of you who like taking
self-portraits for Facebook Twitter
Google+ or whatever you use were you all
like oh look at me this is what I look
like when I'm in the washroom trololol
like that I have some bad news you can't
use the front-facing camera to take
pictures with this application it just
doesn't work it doesn't register there
is you can only use the back camera okay
I don't I I don't understand here's me
trying to take a picture myself and I'm
telling you guys it's really really hard
you don't know where the camera button
is so you kind of have to time it
perfectly this one I've obviously failed
this one too and you can see me standing
there struggling with my awesome awesome
slippers last try here and I still
failed what can I say guys it's tricky
stuff and speaking of tricky stuff or
rather awesome stuff I'm gonna take some
time to give a shout out to GoDaddy

amazing go daddy deals from rf3 and if

thank you very much GoDaddy and back to
the review for my final artistic piece I
took a picture of a leaf on some pay
to represent nature and humanity and
stuff ecosystem greenery and saved the
whales done by plastic bags kind of
thing although I did pick up that leaf
myself and put it on the pavement which
kind of defeats the meaning of this
artistic organic nature II picture
rendering kind of you know useless just
like Pro HDR camera oh yes I went there
that's better and you've probably
guessed it
HDR was off when I took this bad boy the
only only good thing about this
application would be the coloring but
you can only color images taken with the
application so with that I did Pro HDR
camera for Android it's zero point five
out of five and if you can somehow
somehow snap a decent HDR picture with
this application the post coloring
options will come in handy to make your
image look pretty so a sense in twenty
three and for you Android users out
there I'm sorry I just don't think Pro
HDR camera is worth it just save your
two bucks go to the grocery store by
yourself two or three cans of pop meme
and run around in the field or I found
and find a really nice meadow just run
around in the meadow and drink your pop
and just go wow look at me I'm in a
field I'm all majestic like drinking my
coke you can even throw your cans of pop
at that's super fun right there super
fun so if you have any suggestions for
any applications you want me to review
just let me know by commenting thank you
very much for watching this was John Q
from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you guys
next time
