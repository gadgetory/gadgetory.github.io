TechnoBuffalo show I'm I'm your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
TechnoBuffalo i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton hey
everybody how are you doing today Todd
I'm good yes we we missed last week
unfortunately folks it was just it was
crazy busy and then we had an unexpected
being short-handed and was just a ton of
thing so we do apologize for missing
last week but that means we have that
much more to talk about this week yeah
we have a lot to talk about because you
know the best time to send out an
invitation for your big event is the
friday evening it's a friday night at
four-thirty pacific yeah so there's like
one time zone of people left writing for
30 minutes yeah very weird and we're
talking about Google that was the oddest
choice of a time to release an
invitation it was last Friday thankfully
we have guys in the California office
and they wrote the story but Sean and I
weren't around it was 630-730 are times
and Google sends out an invite and now
typically you know maybe during the week
one of us will be around at that time or
at least nearby but on a friday night
it's just like I mean who's like who do
they think they're out well you messaged
me I just got off the treadmill and you
messaged me and you're like I'm trying
to get an invite I'm like what's going
on how I Demi's get on the treadmill
yeah that's like what and we are invited
so we will be there yes we will be there
ends a little busy because but i know
i'm sorry please finish no it's just
like I feel like if you're trying to
make news or getting headlines you know
you want it to be in front of everybody
you announce it when both coasts are
there right well there's actually in
mainstream media the best time to
release bad news is considered around
that time yeah that makes sense because
then it gets buried in the weekend or or
when Apple's announcing something
exactly so that gets very yeah so
Google's choice at that time by normal
me
standards is extremely odd and by our
tech standards it's extremely odd but
whatever it is we got the invite we will
be there but so we're going to see two
phones I still have not memorized which
is which yeah the rumors are the Nexus
5x which which is LG and then that goes
naming those names came up like right
around last week too I think yeah and
then the 6p which is allegedly made by
Holloway so the six-piece supposed to be
the flagship of the two I think the 5x
heads like a Snapdragon six something in
it as opposed to the rumored 820
Snapdragon 820 and 60 so you know we'll
see what the prices come in at and if
there's like a real big sacrifice that
you're making besides like some flagship
specs between the two because it'd be
really great if you get you an awesome
experience at a lower price for the 5x
as long as they're not taking too much
out also you're the two phones here's
what I find out about the 5x the the
Nexus line has always been a developer's
tool essentially it was never intended
to be a bo consumer product well I think
last year that started to change but
right yeah it was never originally sort
of / so if they're releasing a mid-range
phone the question is either a are they
finally accepting that this is a
consumer product or B are they trying to
give a tool to developers for developing
countries mmhmm yeah it's a good point I
mean there's both I don't know that
they're chasing merging markets excuse
me because I do have you know lower-cost
phones was it android android one
android one for emerging markets and I
don't know that the pricing of the 5x is
going to be that cheap you know I think
it's going to be like probably 300 bucks
minimum and I don't think that's
emerging market pricing excuse me we're
looking at like a hundred fifty bucks
but I think it is a sign of their moving
towards a consumer space
and last year we had the Nexus 9 which
very much seemed like a consumer play it
was sold and Best Buy and stuff like
that mean sorry guys are fragmented okay
and then you also have his name is Jimmy
yeah and then you also have project Phi
which sort of is just taking off but
it's open to the public it doesn't
really have much to do with developers
at all right it's just right we're gonna
lose eous and if these both support
project Phi and I think they will then
all of a sudden now you've got three
phones at support project by you've got
choice I think that's a big consumer
play and I don't think I had a chance to
really talk about it but I use project
file lot in Europe when I was there and
I really really liked it so I'm excited
to see whether one of these phones
probably the 5x i'm not sure i need a
flagship so close to buying the 6s plus
which I just did i pre-ordered it but
I'm interested in the 5x now you know I
hadn't even thought about this so you
just mentioned it we have not heard any
rumors of a new tablet this year ya know
I and we I was going through prepping
our post as we usually do ahead of time
sort of getting things ready just in
case google announces they were ready to
go with some sort of post and there's
nothing in the land of tablets that
we've heard about that they could
surprise us well you'd think that rumors
would have popped up by now that
suggests you know maybe something's
coming right but you really haven't seen
anything right i mean we have heard yo
the rumors of the chromecast and
whatever this audio streamer is that
we've been hearing rumors about right
yeah there's been no rumors of the new
tablet yeah the other thing is that i
was thinking in the past it's really
these events have been totally different
sometimes they'll dive into other things
like photos or maybe maps or something
at least on the mobile side you know
maybe they'll talk about android pay a
little bit because that's new but so far
like you haven't really heard a lot i
mean there's a rumor that photos is
going to get revamp soon partially at
least anyway with with collaborative
galleries so like you and I could go
somewhere to take pictures made upload
to the same gallery from both of us
which is pretty cool and maybe that's
one of the features they'll talk about
there but yeah
so far I'm going into the event
expecting Nexus 6p 5x chromecast to
which sounds like it's got better Wi-Fi
a couple colors and stuff like that but
I don't really know what else to expect
and then chromecast Audio which is
apparently a way to connect say older
speakers but what I was trying to figure
out is what makes this different than
any other Bluetooth hub that you can buy
for say twenty bucks connect your
speakers and then connect to that and
you can play and one of them are
suggested that there's multi-room
support so maybe you have a couple of
them linked up and then you can have
speakers throughout your house and are
connected for much cheaper than say a
pair of Wi-Fi speakers or something like
a sonos or bluetooth and then android
6.0 marshmallow like maybe we'll hear
the release date maybe the maybe the
final bills will hit the Nexus 6 and
stuff also on that day but really it's
like that's okay those are our that's
our focus but where else could Google go
and that's why i was saying maybe photos
maybe they talk about payments maybe
they get into android TV a little bit
i'd like to hear a little update on that
and especially now that apple tv's
coming and I know that it's already knew
I mean it's still pretty new but we
could still hear an update on like you
apps coming I mean I feel like Android
TV is still almost like that Android
wear beta experience like there's some
good apps but it's not it's not huge yes
and I think they need to take a dealer
you know and I'm so thankful that
they're doing the chromecast and other
colors because you know that device is
just one time or you plug it into the
back of your television and never see it
again yeah that's what I was what like
rumors are showing yellow red and a
regular black and they look like a
little hockey puck or like as if they
went and spend time on like how it
should look well that doesn't matter at
all like good little dongles perfect
just throw it behind your TV like you
said yeah you never see it again yeah
and I can't wrap my head around that
either yeah it's like oh let's spend no
time working on that because you know we
need to know what's going on
so we have a question that a reader
senem via Twitter a couple weeks ago
that definitely relates to what we're
seeing here today and this followed up
on the iphone event from connor furlong
do you think it's becoming increasingly
less likely to be amazed and when was
the last time something did amaze you ah
yeah i think it's well and that that
goes back to just leaks to like it's
hard to go and amazed when you've
already heard that it reported on rumors
and stuff for months like if Apple came
at us I left field with something you
know like sick I don't know say the car
ipad air three yeah like yeah yeah a
knife at her through something like that
or the Apple cars I'm like whoa but yeah
it's increasingly hard because of that
and I also think because of expectations
you start to set things a little high
all of us do I think you go whether it's
apple or Samsung or anybody else I'll
say the last time I was amazed was
probably it's usually when i look at
samsung's new screens to be honest I
think that's what on their phones I'm
always just like whoa like that's pretty
cool if we're talking hardware
specifically hardware and specifically
on a phone I think that's where I would
I'm pretty amazed right i think a lot of
the problems that we're in a very
iterative stage of phone development
this point oh yes everyone's throwing
the fingerprint reader and i don't
really consider that that innovative no
matter who did it first i don't care
it's it's not that big of a thing we're
stuck basically in the same form factor
every phone is a black slab you know yes
sometimes there's other colors but every
funds a slab there's not anything super
interesting going on you know the last
company that tried to do something
interesting and well as soon as i said
we'll all know how well it did was the
fire phone you know with the the stupid
camera set up in every corner and oh
look you you can look at the picture
from different angles all right
there's there's nothing super innovative
going on you know you get little tweaks
to how the camera works you know whether
you know it can be 00 it rotates this
way or you can rotate it to the fronts
for super you know sexy selfies right
you know it's there's not anything I I
don't think it's even just the rumors
it's just that there's not anything new
being done right I mean I think we're
spoiled to like everything is so great
and then it just gets like slightly
better slightly better slightly better
but if we were to step back say for
years and then pop in and look at the
galaxy note5 we'd be like whoa like that
I guess grabbed my head around that and
girls and you could do the same with the
galaxy note 4 realize whoa but if you
went from note for note 5 you're kind of
like oh but but what about the removable
battery in the micro SD card slot and
that's where we start to get spoiled in
here like wait a second like we should
still consider where were you were just
four years ago and that's the hard thing
too is that when us you know we're
following it every day our our fans I
think our readers are falling it every
day and so for all of us it's sort of
like okay yeah like which one am I going
to spend my money on I don't know you
know maybe the camera is most important
or maybe that it's made out of metal is
most important and that's what it comes
down to versus these large leaves that
we thought I mean if you really look at
it like we're using our phones for
payments whether it's sampling or Apple
or anybody now LG with android pay we
got something that's just incredible to
me we just walked up and pay with your
phone or even your watch and I was
talking to Brandon one of our writers
the other day and he was like whatever
happened like those tiny phones and I
said you know do you remember this
such-and-such phone I forget what it was
called but it was like a lipstick in on
earth like a lipstick tube on verizon
made by samsung was the funniest looking
phone and that's when like you know the
differentiator wasn't displays and RAM
and mental bodies it was like the actual
form factor which sort of goes back to
what you're talking about like
they seem to make advancements in how
the funds looked back then versus you
know well let's not forget that Brandon
has a definite issue with any phone of
any size right look and you know it's
funny I was just thinking about those
differences way back when this is
probably five years ago four years ago
five years ago samsung launched a phone
called the continuum on verizon and it
had a little ticker screen at the bottom
that had its own area for applications
and stuff like that it wasn't very
popular and now I'm just covering you
know these rumors yesterday that another
staffer Jacob was writing about LG
creating this phone with a ticker on it
hey wait a minute we saw this five years
ago well yeah like you're saying granite
has a hard time loving dogs it's more
specifically phablets he is not a
phablet fan by any honest right edge
nation he loves phones he just hates
phablets yes but I still laugh about the
time he strapped a the original galaxy
note to his wrists to try to simulate
what a phone watch would be like but um
that was also a that was also the time
of the great photo gallery where he went
and bought everyday products down at the
7-eleven and brown back to the office
and comparators license here it is next
up pop tart hey what's up yeah he's
gonna say oh my anyway so the other
event coming up is LG who I'm not quite
sure why they're making an event out of
this I know I was trying to figure that
out to it could be any number of things
you know it could be discussion about US
carriers for this nexus 5x or something
like that but I think mainly that's
going to be at the Google event then we
had the g pad 2 or whatever was just
introduced in berlin maybe they'll talk
about us availability because that just
launched and and then I'm just trying to
think like it could be maybe I mean
there's rumors they're building like the
g5 or whatever right there next bike
ship whatever that is but it seems to me
maybe a little too soon and I don't know
that it's going to be that that thing of
an event but it also could be something
huge like that now and then we of course
we also have Microsoft coming up on
october six hmm it's like good grief but
microsoft from weber here and it sounds
like it's going to be primarily the
surface forward yeah well surface pro 4
wouldn't and then the full surface yeah
and then the phones i think you the I
haven't been positive on the phones
being there oh I think they'll be there
because it's about time they said fall
and we've seen plenty of leaks I they
need to get something out the door I
think they'll be there well at least
these companies are being like Amazon
was like oh hey look we have released
new fires Yeah Yeah right they just
priestly products were there like seven
I don't that was ridiculous the fire HD
eight the fire HD 10 the new kids tablet
they had a new fire TV they had the fire
TV gaming edition the fire new fire TV
stick you find on Nick then they also
had the tablet you could buy in a six
pack yeah the fifty-dollar tablet at
seven that was a crazy day and looking
like nothing like no press conference
just you know those I cutter and they
don't send out like press releases you
could fight him you know knew where to
go look but it was just like we all went
onto amazon for whatever reason we're
like oh hey look there's new stuff which
is great I kind of like that versus
these huge press events and it's just
like a zoo I agree i I'm not a huge fan
of the the big precedence the only I
just wish you even 30 minutes early send
us the press releases so we can get
ready right yeah you know that and for
anyone that was listening earlier Todd
was saying something about you know I
was prepping posts for the Google event
I just want to explain real quickly we
have zero
ants knowledge what we do is we prepare
what we call skeletons which are simply
we put in the headline Nexus 6 x yo is
announced and that's all that's there
it's just a ready built posts so I
didn't want anyone thinking that we were
like sitting on a whole bunch of
knowledge we wish more ah that's
something we do before every major event
because it just makes it that much
quicker for us on the day yeah he's here
especially if we know like 5x at 6p seem
pretty locked down right yeah sorry 6p
so we would prepare up I didn't even
catch that you said something else I I
so six hours haha so we would prepare
that ahead of time yeah I'm just like
I'll be announced yes nothing like
getting ready for events it's our
favorite pastime around here but uh yeah
such an Baja asks you know what we think
of the phones but more specifically
which we vary somewhat address that but
what could the letters stand for and I'm
curious about that because we really
have no idea what those letters mean
yeah no I don't know yeah I I I guess
we'll find out or maybe they just mind
uh denote them as something different
I'm not sure yeah they seem like odd
random choice Nexus 5 they need to
distinguish it in some in some way but I
think that was a really popular phone so
they're trying to take advantage of that
again by you know really see a new Nexus
5 and then they can't call it the nexus
5 2 right i guess like wouldn't be the
first time a company's on something like
that and so that's why i'm guessing the
x is there in the p what that means for
perfection yeah plus tablet well let's
kick off the question and answer section
with the most upvoted question from
brazen Frank what did you return this
week Todd I have not returned anything
in a while but I did just buy the Amazon
echo and I connected it to
two one two three four five philips hue
lights which has been awesome so I have
those all connected to my phone the
lights all connected to my phones but I
can also control them from the echo so
actually let's let's try right now for
those watching I'll exit turn on my
living room lights can you guys yes and
so on Alexa turn off the living room
lights there you go that's kind of
awesome yeah so I I'm still not
convinced i need an echo in my life but
now but its kind yeah Oh mark Eric Lane
has a great question referring back to
the Google portion what about the nexus
player will we see in new enhanced Nexus
player to this year I want to buy one by
we'll wait if a new one is coming we
have heard nothing yeah I don't think so
i think the nexus player was sort of i
don't want to say proof of concept with
it like a white box like here's what you
can do with android TV here's what we
did now go make your own and that's why
you have nvidia and other companies
making their own so i think i don't
think there's going to be a player too
if anything maybe some android TV talk
on updates oh yeah i mean last year's
when they basically introduced i think
the new android TV interface and Nexus
player and so we saw that for the first
time I'd like to see some changes there
uh this is a totally off topic but from
brazen Franco since I had the exact same
question of what was happening when we
started the show got a new place Todd no
I just flipped my living room so I move
my desk the other side yeah but don't
worry brace I also at what that what's
going on the windows on the wrong side
from michael de sel what do you think
will happen to google wallet since
android pay is now out we kind of know
what's happening but it seems odd that
both products still exist yeah well
they're going to keep both they've
already sort of talked about this google
wallet is now purely for said
and receiving money to friends sort of
what you would do with facebook or venmo
or paypal so like send Shawn $25 for
pizza and then you cash out which is
nice i mean i love venmo so if Google
Wallet catches on among some people
that's awesome but most of my friends
you spend mousers our reason for me to
switch then Android pay is just focus on
what Google Wallet used to be which is
you know your loyalty cards your credit
and debit cards and making payments no
retail stores yeah I'd I'm not quite
sure why they didn't just combine them
yeah well I think that's what they
wanted to you originally but then maybe
it got confusing and then now this is
kind of cool yes because having two
separate products that both relate to
finances is not confusing at all yeah it
should be called I like wouldn't it make
sense of Android pay was the one to send
money to your friends because that's the
one that you're paying them with and
receiving and then Google wallet's the
wallet you take out in stores I don't
know Oh what do we know about marketing
hey from Jasper Rex what do you think of
the LG v10 the dual screen seems weird
yes it does yeah that's the one I was
talking about earlier that it's it's
been done before samsung had the dual
display on the samsung continuum which
launched on verizon in the united states
and they just had that ticker on the
bottom so this could be i mean it looks
like the same idea it's just the tickers
up top but we'll see what they do to
take advantage of it but you know
opening it up to third parties and stuff
seems to be a value add for these kind
of additional screens and then
developers never do anything with them I
mean excuse me look at how many apps or
on the edge screens on Samsung's phone
today I mean those are relatively
popular phones and there's like nothing
from third-party vendors like you eat
five apps 10 apps the most so it really
depends on what LG does with it that
makes a compelling I totally agree from
such an Baja what do you guys think of
iOS 9 so far if you guys updated yes we
everybody updated within seconds of the
well as quickly as we could with however
I have any fun
I would say my there's one thing i don't
like about it and that's when you do the
double tap on the home button to close
apps I don't like the new format yeah I
don't like that either I heard the old
format where everything was just this
app this app does that now this window
tiled thing is weird and yeah I'm not a
fan but uh it seems quicker I'm not
really sure about the battery life yet I
do like the fact that at least on my
iPad air that they change how many icons
were on each page of a folder otherwise
i mean it's it's an iOS update yeah I
haven't really found a lot that i felt
like i needed i guess it's nice to swipe
down and see like my most frequently
used apps so like when i was covering
for starbucks today i just i found that
there because I open it every day yeah
it doesn't feel you know as drastic as
other stuff but I'm looking forward to
hey Siri on the new iPhones I think that
should be pretty cool or you can say
that at any time with these you have to
have a serious to be plugged in yeah
which thank goodness I have my
headphones on because both my iPad my
iphone are charging behind me and joey
is a big fan of went on conference calls
with me just shouting hey Siri and
making them go off from Brisbane Franco
for 199 what's the better purchase
Nvidia shield TV or Apple TV I'll take
this one I'm going to be very blunt
we're we're big fans of the folks over
nvidia there they're great people they
work with us I was sent an Nvidia shield
TV to review I did the review I was not
impressed now that being said it was not
the hardware the hardware was gorgeous
android TV is not a complete platform
yet is not easy to navigate is not easy
to organize whatsoever
you have really no saying how its
organized it's very clunky Apple TV I'm
not the biggest fan of but I would
choose the Apple TV over the Nvidia
shield TV any day of the week also
there's more apps it's easier to
navigate you know with the upgrades
coming with the new one I think it's
going to be even easier thank goodness
for getting rid of the old remote but
that is the it's somewhere here on my
right here the this is the worst remote
ever designed by a human being see now I
the Nvidia shield TV I like because I
spend a lot of for whatever reason I've
just gravitated towards Android for my
multimedia stuff so like my movie
rentals and stuff or through google play
store and I think that's a pretty it's
good there and using your voice to
navigate through movies and stuff like
that is really easy and it works well
and I do like the option right now it's
free the pc streaming through your
shield TV if you have a fast enough
router so like the games and stuff that
they give you for free you can play
that's pretty cool that well that part i
agree is cool but i think long-term
apple TV just because it's open to more
developer or actually I take that back
developers had access to android TV as
well there's just not a lot of apps that
are made for it I think Apple developers
iOS developers are going to take more
advantage of the Apple TV I agree and
then they already have so again if it
was the nexus player you know no matter
what would any product running android
TV right now I'm just not a fan of I
just don't think the system is robust
enough yeah if you're going to buy any
Android TV though I would get the shield
I that I agree with you yes if you're
set on getting an android TV device then
yes then Vidya shield would be the one
to get ya do agree with you from Damon
Sanchez what do you think about the
blackberry Venice is this coming up on
being the most leaked phone in the
man yeah i'm wondering when it's gonna
finally make its debut at this point
it's going to be the most anticlimactic
release yeah oh okay I mean John Chen
said that they've looked at it but
they're not going to do it unless it
really makes financial sense for them
which is a wise move the doobies gonna
buy it and don't make it but if it does
hit the market I'm very compelled to try
a blackberry running Android I I am too
but i I'm sorry I don't I don't put a
lot of credence in what John Chen said
simply because like you know somebody
was spied using it down the wild at the
toronto international film festival it's
shown up so many places we know there's
a bunch of these things running around
right you know this is not a we looked
at and thought about know you're in some
form of production yeah you you do not
have this many units running around the
earth if you're just looking at it right
right good point yes I I just I have a
real problem with that that line he said
but i'm wondering if window and if
they're going to make a big deal out of
it too like is he just gonna hit their
website as a couple of devices have
where is there going to be a big like
well I also think at this point it would
be silly to announce it prior to the
Google event you know why launch it with
anything less than marshmallow yeah so I
I think we may still see it this year I
I'm convinced it's coming I just don't
know when but uh we'll see it could be
one of those things just you know like
tomorrow oh yeah I I don't get it but
boy we have a ton of question so let me
see if we can't speed up here a little
bit we got another streaming question I
did want to get to because I haven't
given an update on this recently from
such humble hull hey Sean how's your
cord cutting going to affect your
watching the new TV shows that are
premiering this week and returning shows
also have any of you guys watch the
limitless TV show if so what did you
think of it well
I never saw the limitless movie so I'm
not overly excited about the TV show I
might check it at some point as for how
it's impacting how cord cutting for
those i don't know i cut the cord back
in may i am i'm completely streaming now
it's really not that big of a difference
i just i watch everything a day later
you know yes I i already had a hulu
subscription which I did up my hulu
subscription when they announced the no
ads version I was like oh yes for extra
dollars a month my time is worth that
much oh yes and then I also CBS is the
biggest pain in the behind i watch for
CBS shows so I had by CBS all access
which luckily is only five ninety-nine a
month but still like just join hulu we
that will you please but no it's not
really impacting my television watching
at all the the only show that i could
not find on a streaming service at this
time and as a long long time fan I just
want about the season was the new season
of doctor who which I bought on Amazon
but that was the only show from the the
new season that I couldn't find through
my various services so it's going great
just i watch everything a day later it's
just like DVR and just time shifting it
it's working out for me uh let's see due
to do ever brazen Franco is the iphone
really rose gold to me it looks like
standard p its standard pic yeah that
thinks pink it's pink i don't i don't
know where we got in this world that we
have to call pink rose gold sounds
fancier i guess its bank yeah daddy here
i'm sorry you can try to tell me all day
long that it's not bank but it's hank
from such a baja do any of you guys use
any launchers on your android devices of
so which ones
I I just use google mail you use a
Google now launcher I think that's what
John prefers to i use apex on all my
phones after i review them yes they make
that very clear we never we never
installed third-party launchers until
post reviews time I've tried to jump
through hoops to install sense on some
phones to them because i really like it
but uh and you can do it it's just kind
of a pain in the butt yeah so I don't go
apex and I do apex because I mean that's
just the first premium one that I bought
and then I like to have as many icons
sort of on the home screen as possible
so I can show you see restarted I don't
have a phone on me but they're all small
right along the bottom so i can fit as
many other screen as i can cool from
michael vez el do you think the surface
funds will be a hit history says no yeah
yes I want them to my other side I
really want them to be but they have
such tough competition to go against
right now that it's going to be tough
but then the nice thing is if Microsoft
can show that developers are actually
creating apps for Windows 10 that run on
these phones also through continuum or
constant no Continuum's what they call
it continuity that continuum where it
basically just scales the app down to
that screen then that's really cool
because then you can plug it in using
presumably us bc or some kind of other
wireless display standard and then
you've got the full app on another
screen that's cool to me but we'll see
if they actually freak on I I'm still
just waiting on the Kin three on the kid
3 yeah I might be waiting a while on
that yeah from brezin Franco what do you
think of apples pan on the shape down
3.5 millimeter jack when I be simpler to
just use the 2.5 millimeter audio jack
or at that point just use the Lightning
port and isn't the race to this phone
becoming ridiculous yes it is becoming
ridiculous I think the
if they go with the shape down 3.5
millimeter which if in case anyone
doesn't know there was a patent filed
wasn't it back like in 2011 yeah 2011 so
I don't yeah that pans been saying
around for a while so anyway it came to
light that it's a shave down 3.5
millimeter which means that your
standard headphone jack will not fit
into the this jack which means selling a
lot of adapters a whole lot of adapters
but as brazen mentioned since the time
of that being filed the Lightning port
came around mm-hmm I think that some
point Apple will do away with the 3.5
millimeter and just go with lightning
yeah that to me makes the most sense or
just bluetooth like that's one of the
you know Wi-Fi or Bluetooth direct to a
blue to set of headphones like why rely
on either on but yeah I think if you
needed something all we just go through
lightning Brendan like keep the phone
this thick if you're making these kind
of advancements and whatever space you
have left fill it with battery lead to
3.5 million your headphone jack look at
the problem yeah exactly / Mykal the
sale hey Sean when do you think the Kin
3 is coming out my fingers are crossed
man yeah I favorite really cross if
nobody for those of you that may not
remember the kid one and two I have them
in a drawer back there I'll dig him out
for one episode you got take those apps
what did Abby did they sell it was like
five it was like a couple hundred
thousand each it was the worst phone
phone lunch ever yeah um yeah oh it was
the kid wanted two were so that when we
say Microsoft has a stray of problems
with phones yeah but I mean windows
mobile was hugely popular I'd wanted to
all I can remember is when they launched
the kid wanted to you couldn't turn on a
TV show without those commercials
running
heyo how much money over like four
months oh it was unbelievable uh talk
about a disaster yeah we got a lot more
questions here I'm trying to get through
as many as we can from Sol G au jus
bleah I hope I pronounced that correctly
google photos updates maybe yeah that's
what I was talking about maybe we'll see
it there maybe it'll just be updated as
it usually is but I'd like to see it
there i mean i love google photos it's
where i put every single photo i have
and i love that it creates these auto
awesome images and the i guess the
latest rumor suggests that he might have
collaborative galleries which would be
really fun super interesting question
from chris patten um what dual sim
unlocked phone would you recommend
zenfone 2 alcatel idol 3 so me and my
four c or any other options is it
possible to use a data only sim from
t-mobile and a phone and use a voice
text em cricket nothing I don't want one
active under mat work I don't know
either I that is one thing i wish the
more and more people are carrying two
phones because EO they have their work
phone and they have their personal phone
somebody released dual sim phones in
this country haha I don't get it I guess
you I I don't think you could do that
but maybe I don't know I've never used a
dual sim phone to be so I'm not sure hey
I grew out of those options now show me
seems to be popular I've just never used
it i really like the alcatel I don't
three those probably worth considering
Nate curse that's a super interesting
question we unfortunately we just don't
have that much access to dual sim phone
so we've never gone to try that concept
but it's an interesting idea yeah I
always thought and I'm probably wrong
that he kind of had to have one or the
other but that doesn't really make sense
for people with sheriff own so it must
be both but I don't know that you can
granularly leave data on one and voice
and voice and text on the other possibly
i guess no uh hi guys I this is from
Phineas hi guys i have a iphone 6
is it worth it to upgrade to the iphone
6s plus we're at some news on this yeah
you're not doing it and I thought you're
doing it i'm not doing it my feeling is
that there was not enough there yes 3d
touches interesting yes faster processor
I can't live without those things yeah I
I'm just going to wait for the iphone 7
you know fingers crossed after the I
parody or three disaster I don't know
what's happening anymore my third set
hey maybe it could be the iphone 6s
double plus I don't know so yeah i'm i'm
not convinced i needed an upgrade Todd
well Todd's Todd I don't know that I
know yeah I was gonna say I'm not the
regular consumer so I'm doing it for a
number of reasons and I feel like it
would be weird to cover mobile newsle
all the time and not actually have the
Apple flagship on my desk of all the
other collectors but also the upgrade
program was compelling to me so you know
I pay apple monthly and at the end I
give the phone back and then I get the
iphone 7 and continue on with my life
that one seems that seems pretty cool
and then I was thinking well then I
could just sell this and maybe buy the
ipad air 2 or something because i was
thinking about grabbing one of those
anyway well i don't know i mean i was
like either buy it now or wait two
months and then i'm going to buy it then
anyway so let's me back now why would
you buy an ipad air 2 at this juncture
because the ipad pro starts at seven
ninety-nine that's too expensive to me i
have the ipad mini 2 and i was thinking
well that could use an upgrade is
getting a little sluggish at this point
so i could go with the ipad 4 or just
get the larger screen because i haven't
owned a larger screen ipad ever really
crazy yeah i've always had the mini i
did not know that that's interesting um
okay there was one other question I guys
I'm sorry we're gonna have a bunch of
unanswered questions you guys have had
great questions this week though oh
shoot I can't find it right now there it
is brazen Franco
is the tablet market fading away like
the netbooks with phablets becoming the
most popular devices in the ipad
remaining the only relevant one tough
question as a rly yeah great the upgrade
market has sort of disappeared because I
mean I think that's why we didn't see
Apple interviews an ipad air three like
who they probably didn't see a huge
number of updates from the air to the
air too and so they were like well why
would we release the near three so they
release a different fun-packed form
factor the ipad pro and probably hoping
that oh this is distinguishing enough
that people are going to be like i need
that one because it's different it's got
that finger screen i've never had that
before and they've got a pen and i've
got a keyboard which reminds me a lot of
surface yeah oh I yeah here's the thing
though I i we don't know what the
reasoning was for no ipad air three i
think they overlooked the idea the dirt
ipad air 2 was just an iterative update
it was not major I had every intention
of getting an error three I have a
feeling a lot of original ipad air
owners were thinking that so now they're
assuming that we're just gonna go oh
well we got no choice but to pick up the
the behemoth which is not as user
friendly I I am a huge tablet user ID I
i am the i am the poster boy for tablet
usage and i just don't want to carry
around a 12-point 8-inch tablet yeah
samia and the fact that it's got the
faster processor right so like that is
compelling but i didn't see what i was
saying on earlier podcast episodes is
this a tablet that i could really work
from that's different from the ipad air
2 like it's got a bigger screen but I
don't need that to do I mean I could do
that I can do the same stuff off of my
iPad Mini aside from the multitasking
but there aren't the third party app
support that I would be for that because
I would want google hangouts on one and
whatever i'm writing
and safari on the other so like I could
do all of that on the ipad air 2 why
would I get this other tablet because it
has a keyboard but i can buy a cheaper
keyboard for the ipad air 2 because it
has a pencil i don't need that at all
never use a pencil in fact i actually
just go on don't forget the pencil is a
add on purchase right exactly yeah the
total cost comes up to what like 1,300
bucks it's ridiculous it's ridiculous
but speaking to brazen more general
question do we think the tablet market
as a whole is disappearing that's a
really interesting question you know
we've seen that sales are dropping
however they're still selling tens of
millions of tablets but you know as I've
said before when I'm on a plane I always
look around like mid-flight what
everybody's using I don't see other
tablets other than ipad I once in a blue
moon I see the same song I once I sign
the sous transformer I was like kudos to
you because I love those tablets yeah
they're great time yeah they were so I
don't know I we all dreamed of the day
tablets would come along they got here
and I just don't know if they didn't do
exactly what we hoped they would do and
we lost interest in them or if this is
just possibly a wall i don't know i
think the tablet market is in a very odd
space right now yeah well i think also
like how many people do you know that
don't have some sort of tablet and among
those how many of them actually want
another one a new one rival gosh your
friends you have older iPads or nexus
7's which is really popular i mean i
still love that neck systemic and then
they're like well why I shared the best
buy sale yesterday with them where they
knocked a hundred and seventy five
dollars off all the ipad mini trees and
they were like well there you go HP
TouchPad right that's what it was touch
and on my bed Oh like know what
my desk and they were all like well why
would i get another tablet there you
know this is just fine so that's the
thing I think that's the problem this
people just don't see the need to get
these three tablets yeah now I picked up
the touchpad on the fire sale and I keep
it around it in the building I'm n we
have cement floors everywhere so if we
need to walk around with a tablet at the
time we grab the touchpad because we
don't care if it gets brown hahaha
that's our oh we don't care what happens
to TAF once I wish I pads allowed a
cursor to I could really do a lot more
work if I had a cursor yeah android
android supports it just fine with a
bluetooth mouse yep well folks we're
