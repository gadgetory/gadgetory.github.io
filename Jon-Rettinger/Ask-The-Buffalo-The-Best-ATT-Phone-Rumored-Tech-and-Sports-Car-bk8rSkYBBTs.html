to you by LensCrafters welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalo I'm
your host John Rhett injure this is the
show where you can ask any question that
you have from the world of technology
not sure what phone you should get this
is the place where ask that question
not sure if quad-core is really gonna
make a difference this is where you ask
not sure which tablet or phone or watch
weird hybrid tech thing to get you get
the idea go ahead and ask them here
let's go ahead and jump into the first
question it comes to us from the
TechnoBuffalo website and it's from
stewart stewart asks my contract is up
but i want a phone that allows to me the
whole two years which phone you think is
best for my network AT&amp;amp;T on the phone I
think that's best for your network
that's out now are coming out is the one
that I've got in my pocket right here
boom Galaxy Note definitely is my
favorite phone on a teen team probably
my favorite phone of the last 12 months
get it coming out on the 19th you're
going to have LTE you could have a giant
5.3 inch screen go check out
TechnoBuffalo comm for my one month
later review of the galaxy note but
definitely my favorite phone for AT&amp;amp;T so
Stuart hopefully that helps answer your
question all right so our next question
comes to us from users snacky G he asks
what piece of tech are you most excited
about for this year rumored or announced
this is kind of fun the announced stuff
we already know what's coming it's way
more fun to speculate on rumors the
Apple television not Apple TV that $99
box been out for a couple years this is
the actual Apple television but what's
cool about it and what's supposedly
gonna be cool about this is where all
the rumors and fun sort of come in is
the way it's controlled it's gonna have
face detection technology and so it
could detect who you are and whether or
not you should be controlling the
television and you can do troll it via
Sirius obviously voice enabled which is
actually gonna be awesome during sports
games and that
I'd say you're watching the Lakers and
Kobe misses dunk you know and then your
TV turns off or you yeah slam it home
and the TV just falls off the wall
long-winded answer that's what I'm most
excited about all right so our next
question comes to us from Marcus
Williams he's asking why no
TechnoBuffalo shirts to be available to
those folks that cruise the site 15
times a day well Marcus we want to make
sure that our fans have a chance to get
the same stuff that we where perhaps
you're talking about the shirts that you
saw donning at CES and ready boom boom
boom boom boom these shirts are actually
available for everyone to buy at
TechnoBuffalo dot Spreadshirt dot-com
I've been wanting to do merchandise for
quite a while but I didn't feel right
taking and keeping money from it
so one hundred percent of profits are
going to go to charity every time we get
a hundred dollars I will make a video
showing live that donation being made we
made a donation of about two hundred and
sixty dollars about a month or so ago
and that video is all filmed we marked
everything up about 10 to 12 percent and
a 100 percent of that goes to charity we
don't can't keep a cent of profits is
the only way that I could feel good
about selling merchandise it just felt
wrong to sort of keep money for that
thank you for asking your question and I
want to take a quick minute to thank our
friends and sponsors at LensCrafters so
here we are at LensCrafters learning
about their Accu fit system let's go and
check it out did you know that you can
take the same eyewear prescription to a
different vision care professional and
actually see differently the placement
of prescription is placed in your frames
which should be custom fit to your face
it's also important to seeing your best
well now you're a movie star cuz you're
on camera with this in mind LensCrafters
has designed and launched a key fit
technology and exclusive state of the
art digital measurement system that
delivers the best possible placement of
your eye wear prescription within your
glasses frames a key fit technology
precisely measures the relationship
between your eyes face and frame to more
accurately place your prescription in
your eyeglasses frame and has been
proven to be five times more precise
than manual measurements I'm pretty
excited to get your frames I'll tell you
one thing I'm also learning
very pushy I press more precise optical
measurements resulting clearer crisper
vision I know it's silly great go to
LensCrafters dot-com / a key fit to
learn more and find your near so
LensCrafters store to experience a Cuban
alright let's go ahead and jump to our
last question this comes from user Gus
esta bar who is asking which sports car
of any type would you buy the most good
question I'm much like come on an
Android kick right now I want a huge
electric car kick but electric cars for
me are awesome for technology the tech
that goes into them and torque you get
that instant torque right away so I'm
big on electric cars the two that are
most exciting to me right now the Tesla
Model S looks absolutely gorgeous got
that 17 inch screen it's being powered
by NVIDIA Tegra processor I had a chance
to check it out at CES and was really
impressed not necessarily us works car
but the thing is fast
so that's a car that I'm most excited
about a Tesla is also going to be
announcing their Model X which is their
all-electric SUV will actually be there
for that on the 9th in Los Angeles so
check us out for all of that coverage
also one Segway I hear everybody's
saying Oh
electric cars aren't any greener for the
environment because coal is burnt to
make the batteries and that's true right
now conversely there's only one way to
get oil for traditional combustion
engines coming from the ground and it's
got to be mine from the ground an
electric car doesn't care where
electricity comes from so right now it's
being made in coal burning facilities
but in the future perhaps with a BLM
made for more greener technologies maybe
we'll be able to get electricity from
wind from waterfalls or other green
sources so it's not an investment in how
things are created now it's more of
forward-looking for how we're going to
create lectricity in the future so a bit
of a my thoughts on the whole bunch of
car thing and awesome on the low end
torque but they're quiet they're quiet
quiet killers my wife and I always joke
that the Prius isn't the parking lots
are the silent killers because he never
hear them coming and in a smack read you
so hope you guys enjoyed this episode of

tech news rumors and boxing jokes and
all of that stuff that you need to live
