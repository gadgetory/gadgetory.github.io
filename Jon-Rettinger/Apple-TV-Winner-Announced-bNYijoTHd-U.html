technobuffalo calm here and i'm very
happy to announce the winner of the
Apple TV giveaway that I've been running

continued support some of you guys may
be watching the behind the scenes of me
filling this during a live stream if you
are you're looking at me from over here
hello and if you're watching this just
straight on YouTube hello to you as well
so we had well over 14,000 entries for
the Apple TV which fantastic and really
exceeded my expectations to pick the
winner what I did was I took all the
comments picked them into a Word
document went to random done work and
picked a number and really scrolled down
with my eyes closed until I hit that
prescribed number of seconds move the
cursor over to the left and selective
who the winner was that was the best way
I could think to keep it fair so thank
you everybody who entered and without
further ado and virtual drum roll the
winner of the apple TV is a similar 350
same name on both YouTube and Twitter I
believe it's a woman she entered two
days ago so thank you for entering thank
you for winning thank you for your
support I'll be sending you a PM on
YouTube asking for your address and i
would get this out to you next week and
i hope that you do an unboxing so you
can share with everybody and you know
people can maybe give you some exposure
i'll be sure to send out your name
everybody can see the apple TV and know
if you're enjoying it or not so thank
you guys for the supporting the video
thank you for your support of me and for
technobuffalo coming up I really just
straight-out appreciate it so that's it

times but one more time won't hurt thank
