TechnoBuffalo we're here with the brand
new LG g3 and we know that people always
want to know how they compared to the
iphone iphone 5s in this case so i just
wanted to show you a size comparison
it's actually pretty funny because you
can only have a smaller display here
versus the 5.5 inch on the g3 yeah the
Cheeseman really easy to hold in one
hand I think maybe this is the sort of
way we'll see Apple go if it tries to do
a 5.5 inch iphone 6 in the future really
so the nice thing about it is it's easy
to hold and adjust the volume and power
the single hand and even though I can't
really get my thumb across the screen I
really like to that you get the almost
edge-to-edge display here so you can see
just how much bigger of the phone is so
we'll go to the side to it also appears
to be the inner than the other phone i
think we'd have to look at the direct
measurements but going around obviously
the design changes are very different
about the IR blaster on top of this
power is the volume controls and totally
different places charging and the micro
USB and the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and lightning ports are all on the
bottom of these nothing on the left of
the up to g3 but it's really nice fun
it's actually super light and in the
hands with the iphone 5s it it doesn't
feel like as much bulkier or phablet
like as you would think and LG sent a
lot of work with the keyboard and stuff
like that to to make it much easier to
type with a single hand or where auto
correct your mistakes as you go along
the way but in any case we just want to
show you a quick difference of the two
phones side by side especially for those
out there who might own an iPhone and
want to know just how much bigger at UK
