to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of renter's
rants mrad renters the show where I
usually rant and rave on something
that's been pissing me off this week in
technology but the past seven days I've
actually been pretty happy nothing's
gotten my rant he's in a bunch of ins
gotten me mad and cranky I've gotten
good night's sleep and I am all smiles
so this is not gonna be a rant evideo
there's gonna be more of a video of
trying to help you guys and I'd make
this video about once every eight months
and more subscribers come on and haven't
seen it there's always refresh
information to give so if you are an
aspiring youtuber you're an aspiring
tech journalist I have advice for you
let's go and get started
definitely that might be new to the
YouTube channel it started just out of
my love for technology I was looking to
get a brand new computer I had this
giant 17 inch HP laptop behemoth and it
died on me and I thought hey you know
what I think I want to try a Mac and I
didn't know how to use the operating
system so I went on YouTube I tried to
find tutorials on people using the Mac
and there wasn't anything out there
there was no one out there showing how
to use a computer YouTube at that point
pretty much just guys get kicked in the
balls and cats playing piano so I
figured hey I'm also going to look up
video cameras I'm gonna find a nice
cheap video camera and I'm gonna make
videos many people watch it maybe they
won't really so force me to learn my new
computer so I bought this like
absolutely garbage video camera from
Costco it used tapes if you watch
earlier videos you can hear like the
tape winding as I go and I bought that
Santa Rosa a MacBook Pro that I still
remember with very fond memories and
start making videos just for fun and
people started coming and watching them
and I was able to interact with every
single person I was able to answer a
single comment the small community I
loved it it really sort of brought a
fire in me that I never had I I was
always okay what I did before I was in
marketing and I was always you know I
had done all right
I didn't have that passion for work I
didn't have like that fire that got me
excited to get up every day and doing
this loved I got to talk about
technology which I've always just I've
always heard been a part of my life I
couldn't believe it so it grew and I was
able to sort of figure out how things
work they got into the YouTube Partner
Program and started TechnoBuffalo bring
sort of very condensed version of where
I am right now but what I had that you
guys don't have is I had the benefit of
being one of the first to market I was
one of the first folks I started making
you to lead us on about technology one
reason I was able to achieve really any
stress subscriber growth or notoriety
because weren't the video other people
out there I think people that are doing
videos now are infinitely better than I
have been Utley more talented no more
than I do but having a killer time
getting exposure so I want to share some
tips for you can do now if you're
starting a YouTube channel or if I
already have a youtube channel what you
can do to possibly grow it and get
noticed so let's go and start with one
big misconception you need crazy
expensive camera equipments and you
gotta have a lot of money to
biotechnology both of those not true at
all my early videos I wasn't using that
crazy tape camera others in the iSight
built in my computer you can pick up a
very cheap HD webcam lesson one hundred
dollars don't you invest in a to three
thousand DSLR video camera it's just not
necessary use the built-in audio until
you feel like you've got the resources
to get something better but it works and
it's fine I got to go out and buy every
single piece of technology that exists
either you could talk about your
opinions on them you know talk about
Apple if you want to give your pans on
the new iMac mantis air or this really
buy it go the Apple store if you got one
year you play with it if your pressure
dollar design and talk about it be on
with your audience hey listen I don't
own this beer my first impression and
playing with it for a few minutes and
share your thoughts that way I share
your thoughts on keynotes as I happen to
like what's happening you're not like
what's happening you know do you like
what Microsoft has announced you really
a big fan the surface talk about why
share your opinions doesn't have to be
always so product based number two find
your own style or voice if you watch my
earlier videos I was really really
really bad in them I was trying really
hard to be somebody else and it was
until I realized you know what I'm just
gonna be myself on camera and I hope
people like it and I serve it's hard to
have a little bit of growth so be
yourself don't copy anybody else's style
don't copy my style my decide works best
for you find the editing style that
works best seeking of editing style you
don't need crazy fancy editing equipment
either if you buy a Mac comes with
iMovie which I used up until like a year
ago or if you buy a PC Windows Movie
Maker works great you get a free trial
of Sony Vegas for a month see if you
like that Adobe's got awesome offerings
that you can try out with cloud
services for I think 20 bucks a month so
you don't have to spend a lot of money
to do this the next thing is be very
mindful of your language if you wanna be
taken seriously want to be professional
the professional language don't use you
know slang words try not to use hums AHS
and lights be very careful of like I use
that all the time I earlier videos don't
use idioms don't put smiley face in your
descriptions don't spell words with a Z
that should end in an S just be
professional but yourself would be a
very professional version of yourself it
would be some advice for you the next
thing is how we get on the product where
these products come from how could you
possibly get them as well and the answer
is it's going to be very difficult and
it's much harder now than it was back
when I first started because there
swimming were people trying and aiming
for them when I did net for starters I
went to a whole bunch of companies I
made a spreadsheet of almost 100
companies ranging from 18 T all the way
down to small case manufacturers I went
to their website I found press contact I
found press releases the bottom of those
illest press contacts and I wrote a
really detailed thought-out message what
value I could bring highlighting me
review their product now by no means did
you ever guarantee a good review and you
should never feel obligated to give a
good review because someone set your
product I'll pair people know how things
work be honest be a hundred percent
honest we don't like something say it
but always be fair and try and leave
your own biases out if you're an Apple
person and you're reviewing an Android
phone trying to get it through fresh
eyes don't look at it why you don't like
it look at it why somebody else might
like it be sure to follow up with this
PR people if you did a video on it
you've got a hundred views or 200 views
share that with them give them update
report to a boss to show that they're
doing their job well it gives them a
little bit of leverage it makes their
life a lot easier you want their life to
be easy tag your videos how do you tag
your videos it used to be you just blank
it tag everything did a article or video
about a phone you write 35 different
tags you put phone when 70 different
placing description not so anymore
YouTube change your algorithms be very
short and concise with your tags if
you're even something like the Galaxy
Nexus or X is for for example you would
do any fits review the Nexus 4 all
attacks should be would be LG LG Nexus 4
LG Nexus 4 review Nexus 4 review new
neck
review google android now in really me
the extent of it don't blink attack
everything you're gonna make your video
fall down so that's sort of a whole
bunch of advice crammed into one video I
hope it helps I wish you guys the best
of luck it's a really crowded field out
there and there are ton of people that
have much more talent than I do and I
hope you guys get the exposure that you
deserve it's not a competition between
me or any other youtuber that might be
out there including you we're all part
of the same family you get success
notoriety only helps elevate the whole
field you don't they say you know you
put more water in the old boats rise so
I want all boats to rise and I want you
to be successful I hope this video
helped so let me take a minute to thank
