to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here and we
are at LG's 2015 CES press conference
Lee announced a ton of new stuff from
TVs to washing machines to the all-new G
flex 2 I go ahead and recap everything
that you might have missed so start the
conference out dr. Scott on the stage
talk about their slogan first innovation
for a better life and what that was
going to me and they jumped right into
the good stuff which was started with
TVs it was last year that LG announced
they were going to start using webOS
into television sets and this year we
are seeing the evolution of that so
webOS is still in LG's TV sets but now
it's getting way better way faster if
that's on more improvements so now the
platform is twice as fast it's got
support for 4k streaming it's going to
boot up and be ready to use in about two
seconds you can customize the bar at the
bottom to put your favorite channels now
and overall just a faster more enjoyable
experience those do that are looking to
pick up a new LG TV set and then they
talked a ton about their Oh LED lineup
it stands for organic light-emitting
diodes and it's a new display technology
being used what's cool about oh le D is
that each pixel can turn itself on or
off when it's off you can get true
blacks you have to rely on something
like LCD technology to use this sort of
backlighting so you ever get that true
blocks your picture is going to look way
way way more vibrant an LG is running
the gamut on sizes and features with
their new o LED lineup so they're
unveiling seven new sets ranging from 55
to 77 inches all of which are going to
be 4k the 77 inch model has a few tricks
up its sleeve it is flexible so it
either been to give you that curved
experience or flatten out depending on
what you want with just a click of a
button so that's kind of neat we saw
that debuted last year and now it's sort
of reaching out to mass-market consumers
so next the chief streaming officer of
Netflix came out say of course not only
that 4k streaming is now available but
soon you're going to have HD are
streaming available high dynamic range
or get really cool pictures they were
highlighted by saying their new Netflix
series Marco Polo
absolutely gorgeous well it's going to
look like an actual TV set is kind of
yet to be seen but the demonstration
they showed at least made it look really
nice and then they got to the washing
machines and I know you guys might not
be so excited about washing machines but
it doesn't kind of cool stuff they got a
new twin wash machine it's a tiny little
washing machine sits on the pedestal
below regular one so you can do two
loads if you want to do you know your
main wash on the top and then maybe wash
your naughty bits down below I got
ability to do that and the work with any
existing LG washing key which is kind of
cool and last but definitely not least
they got to what I was excited about and
that is the G flex 2 i love the original
g flex one when it was announced last
year now it's got a ton of new upgrades
let me jump right and tell you what you
can expect so the screen is now 5.5
inches one of my knocks in the last jan
was 720p screen that has been rectified
it is now a 1080p screen and it's using
a plastic OLED screen so it should look
really nice it's also curing over some
of great features that we liked with the
LG g3 it's got optical image
stabilization it's got their laser
autofocus all pair with that
13-megapixel camera gonna live on the
back and of course being to the back and
also has all the buttons on the back to
your volume up and down and your power
and lock the G flex 2 was really one of
the first of the next generation of
super phones it's being powered by the
new Snapdragon 810 which is 64-bit and
octa-core thing is an absolute screamer
penny want region you're going to live
in I what come on either two or three
gigs of RAM one of the crazier things
I've heard on the phone of course it
supports micro I see now but I can sport
a micro SD cards up to two terabytes
which as far as I know don't even exist
yet but when they do you can just have a
stupid amount of storage on your phone
LG is also trying to get the latest
version of Android on the device so
it'll ship with Android 5.0 lollipop
right out of the box you get all the
great features that lollipop has to
offer the phone is now up to thirty
percent more durable the glass is
treated by a proprietary glass covering
that LG made themselves to make it super
strong the healing back that we saw with
the first one is here but now it's way
improved it's going to heal itself in
seconds and not minutes and healing
itself means if you get a little
scratched but if I with your keys they
sort of put a little bit of heat on it
that scratch is going to almost
disappear just a really cool thing to
have on a phone of course it was that
same flexible
screen that server has a bit of a curve
to it you'd expect to the phone call the
g flex you put in your back pocket you
can bend the phone a little bit if you
need to the whole idea was before we
started getting smartphones regular
analog phones had a curve we sort of
lost that as screens got bigger and
flatter and smartphones came to exist LG
is trying to bring that back so you get
a more ergonomic feel not only when
you're holding the phone but also when
it's up to your ear it's also got some
new quick charge technology in the canal
I you would go from zero to fifty
percent in about 40 minutes it's got a
3000 milliamp non-removable battery so
you shouldn't be able to get plenty of
juice out of it this is really again the
first of the next generation of super
phones from the processor to the RAM to
shipping with lollipop there is a lot to
like about this phone so obviously know
a lot about the phone a few things we
don't know we don't know what care
they're going to launch with we don't
know when they're going to launch we do
know though is what colors are going to
cover in their lunch they are going to
ship in platinum silver or flamenco red
depending on whether you're feeling
spicy or not and wait what do you guys
think about everything LG announced I'm
excited for the g flex serval up to cure
your thoughts on it view in the comments
in the pants region until next time I am
