to the kindle fire line here this is the
kindle fire HD 8.9 packs a lot of punch
in its right in between stature the
7-inch and the 10-inch this guy sits
right in the middle and might be the
sweet spot for tablets let's go ahead
dig in take a look it's we've got the
typical amazon kindle box it's black and
it's cardboard and it's got a little tab
let's go ahead and pull that tab right
now mmm I don't know why but every time
that is still super satisfying let's go
ahead and open this up and they're
perched underneath is the kindle fire HD
8.9 i'm sorry call it the kindle fire
for right now obviously our other sizes
prices are gonna range from 2 99 to 384
depending on that you get 16 a 32 gigs
or side to opt for a version with ads or
no ads push it off the side for just a
quick second feels very solid in the box
not a power brick to be found but we do
have a charging and sync cable which
let's see if it is it's like a very
fancy microUSB kinds of rubber soft
touch feel on it that's nice rounding
out what else you got in the box it's a
card and it says card thing yeah getting
to know your kindle power button all
kinds of other stuff but we know our
kindle already i'll introduce myself
hello kindle my name is John your name
Chevy John's 8th kindle let's go ahead
and pull this plastic off come here
glass dick I'm foiled by plastic fairy
ya ass up
holes not flow for that much longer and
we slide it out alright so let's talk
about the specs this guy is running a
custom version of Android based ice
cream sandwich but it's meant just for
amazon kindle so dimensions we've got
9.45 inches x 6.5 inches by a very thin
point 35 inches and it weighs 20 ounces
it feels really nice in the hand 8.9
inch screen it's an HD LCD screen
resolution of 1920 x 1200 10 hours of
battery life we've got a dual-core 1.5
gigahertz processor that's the omap 4470
a Giga ram and again at 16 or 32 gig
configurations it's got camera on it
living right there it's a 1.3 megapixel
camera for video calling Wi-Fi only but
is dual band it's got bluetooth but no
NFC you've got dual speakers living on
here and a free month of amazon prime so
what else we got talked about dual
speakers when i show you those dual
speakers that's where they both are
going to live a soft touch feel on the
back i guess this would be considered
the top holding in portrait on the
bottom we've got micro HDMI of course
the charging port for syncing on the
left hand side there's volume rocker up
and down power 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and while i'm sitting here
yammering go ahead and power it on they
can take a quick look at the custom OS
as it does its kindle fire Fang overall
it feels really nice actually quite
surprised how nice and stable it feels
quite a large bezel on it though but
that's not too bad plenty of place to
hold your finger while you are browsing
reading watching videos or ever other
things you might do on your tablet you
naughty people alright so let it boot up
we'll come back to quick look at the
operating system alright so we got our
kindle fire HD all powered up it looks
very familiar for anybody else that's
ever seen a kindle fire it's all jazzed
up and ready to go so you get some
drop-down options and you pull that down
unlocked volume brightness wireless sync
and some more and everybody loves some
more that's where all your settings are
going to live there as well so go ahead
and hit the
button and main navigation is going to
be three buttons home back and your
favorites so you can shop and go to the
kindle store if you want to you can see
a ton of stuff there in the kindle store
movies magazines books music all kinds
of other stuff that amazon wants to sell
you and if your Prime member of course
you're going to want to be a part of
that I'd also going to be broken down
into games so you can obviously check
out what games you're going to be on
here on the device or if you want to
download some whatever you want to
choose it could take you to the store
and these are these are in games of
course you can go ahead and download
games whatever is on the device or I'll
take you to the store and speaking of
store these are Android apps but they're
not the same apps that you can get in
the google play store these have to be
specially certified for amazon well some
apps might be the same they got to go
through a whole other certification
process and that's where the app you're
going to live and of course your app
store will be there as well there's a
full email client on your skype is going
to come pre-installed personal videos
office suite so you can edit to your
office documents will be here books
music newsstand audiobooks web photos
duct and offers of course offers another
way frame is on to sell stuff and of
course they want to keep you in their
ecosystem and Amazon does an incredible
job with three kisses and but there was
ever a company that could really give
Apple a run for their money in terms of
ecosystem and content they offer I
really would have to be amazon they do a
very incredible job let's see what the
browser looks like i'll show you the
keyboard to keyboard is actually very
nice looking and the screen looks
beautiful so we'll go to TechnoBuffalo
calm try to do it from the side and see
if it pops up techno techno Buffalo and
we'll go ahead and select it just going
to show up there somewhere it's using
Amazon silk browser which is as you
would expect silky smooth and so here's
a google page you can see that pinch to
zoom and everything works I think it
expect to work from a modern web browser
of course we'll go and put this guy
through its full paces let you know what
to expect and whether or not you should
pick up a kindle fire there are a lot of
tablets to choose from this holiday
season let's definitely should be one to
consider stay tuned for the coming days
