lakers khamir with a review for you of
the samsung eternity for eighteen t
wireless so you guys have seen me unbox
it you see me walk you through the
keyboard and the browser on it so let me
tell you a little bit about the phone
itself the 3g capable phone with an HTML
browser and a full on screen keyboard
doesn't have any real physical keyboard
buttons but it does have three
navigation keys on the bottom I walk you
guys through all that during the
hardware overview so first off this is a
phone and I always preface my phone
reviews with this it's gotta sound good
call quality was actually very strong
sounded very clear on my end although
the three or four people I tested the
phone with did report the same white
noise on their end so it may vary by
location but at least be aware of that
but call quality for the user of the
phone was absolutely fantastic so I used
actually use this phone for a good few
weeks have to say I'd to keep increasing
impressed with it the more I used it the
haptic feedback is probably the best
implementation of haptic feedback
firstly I've ever used the vibration
isn't annoying it didn't seem out of
place it's not overwhelming it's very
nice and subtle and really is a very
good touch the on-screen keyboard I'm
very vocal that I don't like on-screen
keyboards even though the iphone is my
primary phone and I've grown to get used
to its keyboard I much prefer a heart
attack tile keyboard the Samsung
attorney actually has one of the best
on-screen keyboards that I've ever used
it really is very very intuitive and
really easy to get used to a type on and
that's the accelerometer built-in as you
guys saw in other videos so when you
turn it the keyboard does rotate to full
landscape and just becomes very easy to
type on I did a typing test and you guys
can see so I'm not going to go too much
into detail on that but just know if
you're a heavy texter you will not be
disappointed with the samsung eternity
why the other features is that really
surprising about the phone and not many
phones have this outside of the iphone
as a proximity sensor actually built in
so one the problems with touchscreen is
when you put them up to your head your
ear can hit stub and end up your
mom and end up calling your ex
girlfriend and that's never a good thing
generally so what this does soon as you
put up to your head it actually turns
off the screen and you pull it away
turns it back on again a very nice
convenience feature and something else
that was very impressive about the
samsung eternity another very cool thing
that it does so the call quality again
like I said was loud loud enough and the
TV on here was very cool it's an added
package that you have to pay for but it
does make the phone have an extra a
little bit of a WOW factor I haven't
seen TV implemented very successfully in
many phones but 18t and Samsung really
got on the ball here the TV is clear
it's crisp the sound is loud and it
really is fun to watch TV on your phone
I don't know how often I would do it if
I own this phone and I used it as my
primary device but it is kind of nice to
have long ago you can watch Comedy
Central a movie is a CNN some of its
live content I could see on a normal
television some of it is canned and it
starts when you play it but it is just a
really very neat feature for a non
smartphone I was actually very impressed
with the browser it was full HTML
capable and it did render pages the way
they're meant to be seen like you'd see
on a computer none of this mobile web BS
that i am not a fan of so if web
browsing is important to you this phone
will suffice it doesn't have the best
web browser in the world but it is good
enough for a phone of this caliber it
does play youtube videos which is
actually very cool if you go to youtube
and you click on a video it'll launch
its own YouTube player and it will play
the video over 18 tease 3g signal video
quality was pretty nice it wasn't
anything to write home about but was
good enough to watch and the external
speakers were loud enough to hear what
you were saying so that's all things
this phone does well what it doesn't do
so well is email and it doesn't really
advertise itself as an email device it
just has a Java applet for email which
is quite unfortunate so if email is
important to you I'll look at more of a
smartphone as opposed to a feature phone
like the samsung eternity it was weak
characters weren't always rendering
properly scrolling through emails was a
pain I think just weren't always coming
in in a prompt fashion something to keep
in mind this come with a built-in I am
client so you can use all your im's that
are used to
you're a I am msn yahoo and things like
that gads of a music player which is
just like any other music player on any
other phone it works plays music guys
overall if you're looking for a feature
phone that can handle some email that
can view the web has a good keyboard for
texting and you want to watch TV I can
wholeheartedly recommend the samsung
eternity to you if you're looking for an
email centric device looking for in the
market for a blackberry and iphone a
windows mobile device the eternity is
not for you but I think that's who
samsung is marketing this too so if you
match the aforementioned category of
looking for just a phone that can do a
few cool things samsung attorneys and
excellent device on a five-star scale i
give it a really solid for if it could
just handle email well and had maybe a
little bit of a better browser this
phone to be an absolute knockout highly
recommended it's for sale on 18 d prices
can vary by time and day let's go ahead
and check AT&amp;amp;T website if you're
interested anyway guys this is jon
