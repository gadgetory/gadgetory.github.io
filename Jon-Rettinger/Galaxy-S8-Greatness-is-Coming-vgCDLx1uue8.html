rumors chilly outside got my dad sweater
on let's talk about the latest from
Samsung the galaxy s 8 and clearly
Samsung needs to for lack of a better
cliche just knock this one at a park
after the note 7 literally went up in
smoke so it looks like they're going to
pack everything they have into the
galaxy s eight including some of the
highlights from the note 7 slide for the
blowie uppy parts like the retina
scanner so if the folks at Bloomberg are
to be believed we are going to see an
OLED if I want a wraparound display in
two different sizes 5.1 and 5.5 inches
in John you say why two sizes well as
opposed late there's not going to be an
edge variants of the galaxy s 8 it'll
just be galaxy s 8 and you can pick a
smaller or a larger one and the
wraparound is probably be similar what
we have on the edge line it's not going
to go all the way around the background
you're just going to go all the way
around creating kind of a bezel list
look speaking of bezel asst how about
home buttons do you like the tactile
feel of Samsung's home buttons and the
fingerprint sensor in there that's
something you enjoy if it is you get out
of luck because that's going away
Samsung's going to be integrating a home
button actually into the screen
supposedly beating Apple what they're
planning for the iphone 8 don't know how
they're gonna do it but there's a
company called synaptics and nap tech
send app synaptics so hard work to say
you should try it that has a technology
that exists we don't know if samsung is
going to use their tech or maybe they
built it in house but it's gonna be
there and no more home button but you'll
be able to just put your finger on the
screen to unlock it so be prepared for
like smudge City towards the bottom of
the phone of course being a flagship
from Samsung is going to be crazy
powerful two different variants as
usually seen Snapdragon 835 for for us
north america and other regions and then
fraud the asian markets it'll be
Samsung's in-house a casinos processor
also rumors kicking around of six gigs
of RAM that wasn't from Bloomberg that's
just what my own little birdie is
projected just one
market chubby bird whisperer to meet us
when you're going to see this phone the
rumor also is we're going to see these
phones I'm pointing at you a lot i'm
sorry for that it's gonna be it's gonna
be coming in april i don't know why i
seem mad but but April April is when
these phones are coming and with that so
you guys like to look at that like oh
that's great news i can't wait to plug
in my headphones to my my brand new
galaxy s 80 LED nope adios headphone
jack Simon to pour one out for your
headphone jack homie cuz that thing is
going away so galaxy s eight hopefully
gonna have decent battery life and not
not blow up I hope they don't go thinner
lighter faster if they go lighter faster
maybe go a little fatter like some of us
can do is to get a little older as you
guys like to point out in the comments
need to give it better battery life and
get the battery cells more room to move
around and expand its looking at my own
cells cut to do without coming in
contact with positive and negative and
then just exploding so you guys excited
about the galaxy s 8 I'm nervous I feel
like like Anna Kendrick's character and
pitch / before she performed sweating it
on the inside I'm hoping it's going to
be a great phone I'm hoping it's going
to bring Samsung back on the map a
little bit worried that the 5.5 version
might be what would have been the Galaxy
Note 8 which might go away but I'm not
I'm not betting on that that's just me
speculating making up stories exclusive
and I think guys for watching video a
thumbs up we appreciate your
notifications on so you know when
technol buffler video comes up I
appreciate it i'll see you guys next
video so maybe with your brand new
galaxy s 8 you want to watch some shows

your time sitting on that damn couch
