TechnoBuffalo here they say the
essential needs are food and water for
the mobile traveler and the geeks among
us it's food water and data and now we
have another way to get some mobile data
this is thus Wireless 4G LTE mic by long
name 41:10 L intelligent mobile hotspot
by Novatel Wireless this is a 4G Wi-Fi
device running on Verizon's LTE network
let's go ahead and dig it
so what you're thinking yay he's
unboxing of my five but there's actually
a decent amount to see here as opposed
to other MiFi devices that I'll bring in
and of course most importantly we will
be doing speed tests with all the MiFi
devices that are roaming the
TechnoBuffalo labs so stay tuned for
that video so here is the device itself
in the box from a plan standpoint 50
bucks is gonna get you five gigs of data
10 dollars over per gig or 80 bucks is
gonna double that to 10 gigs of data at
that same $10 overage this is sent by
the folks at Verizon to review your G
SIM card so weird to see Verizon with a
SIM card I assume it's they probably
already installed it which they did and
here it is a little bit thicker than
other MiFi devices that we've seen but
there's a lot of good stuff that happens
here that we haven't seen yet on some of
these 4G LTE devices we kick that off to
the side for just a minute I said what
we're gonna happen here is some
information charger and a USB and we do
it charges via microUSB which is great
and you also have a little bit of a
cleaning cloth or a bag for it take a
real quick look what this is and you can
keep your device being I guess
microfiber cloth to hold it okay so push
all that business off to the side and
let's take a look at the device itself
now this is the second MiFi device in
Verizon's line-up they've launched a
Samsung device a little while ago about
three weeks ago
we'll take a look at this here to see
what the differences are you're trying
to decide which one might be right for
you
the Novotel variety so the one that we
just opened up is a little bit fatter a
little bit longer but you are gonna get
full status indicators here on top let
me go ahead and kick this on and I'll
tell you a little bit more about the
device while I do that I'll see if it
has any power so the green light is on
so this guy can do a lot of goodness
Verizon is saying it's gonna get a
typical download speeds assuming you're
in a 4G area a 5 to 12 megabits per
second and up of 2 to 5 you can connect
up to five Wi-Fi enabled
at one time which is kind of neat slim
compact size all that business battery
usage up to five hours auto shutoff with
30 minutes timer by default if you
actually charge this while you're using
it as well so you can plug it right into
your computer and get ready to rock and
this does have a 3G fallback so it
appears it's booted up one of the nice
things about this guy you can actually
see your signal strength with the other
device you only knew if you're on 4G or
not depending on the LED indicator light
with this you can actually see whether
or not you've got a 4G signal and right
in my office
4G tanks to go in and out if I go
outside I get a pretty decent 4G signal
alright so you guys didn't see this but
if you ever saw the movie Zoolander when
he spends a few minutes trying to smack
the iMac to get the files out of the
computer that's sort of what I just
spent doing here at the MiFi hitting it
trying to get it to work I had to
realize that the SIM card that was
pre-installed in here is actually
installed upside down before I finally
got to see a signal strength which you
get right there here and have your
battery and it's also gonna tell you how
many users are connected by those little
dots hopefully you can see that on the
screen there's just one user connected
right here what you're not gonna want to
see is that purple color light which
just means you're connected to 3G what
you're gonna want to see is green green
is gonna mean you're connected to 4G as
soon as I step outside of my office I
got very strong 4G signal as I mentioned
but inside here not so strong so it
tends to turn on or off I'll be stepping
outside and doing a full 4G speed test
in this device and I'll compare it
head-to-head with the other my thigh in
Verizon stable so if you get one of
these and the SIM cards already
installed note to self
go ahead and check it out to make sure
it is installed properly it's very easy
to connect to one of these on the back
my thumb's covering up there's a sticker
there that tells you what the Wi-Fi
network is and the password and you can
log in to the IP address actually give
you directions in this master ego or a
device book to log in and change the
passwords very easily it's actually
right on the last page at the end up
picking one of these up that's how
you're gonna do it you're gonna want to
go to HTTP colon slash slash 190
point one six eight dot one dot one and
that'll let you change the network name
and the password something that you're
gonna remember that's not a ten long
numerical code so this is the my Phi or
G LTE the Novotel variety for Verizon
Wireless this is a long winded unboxing
but you guys know that's how I do I love
to hear myself talk I hope you guys
enjoy it and again we'll be doing full
speed tests here coming up its 4G my
find something that you're interested in
would you use it if you do a lot of
traveling it's probably gonna be
something that's a lifesaver
this of course obviously has 3G fallback
if you can tell by that violet blinking
light or purple blinking light depending
on what color you wanted to have so you
do sort of get the best of both worlds
and should that ever turn green and
you're rockin a 4G signal you will be
getting very very very fast speeds I
know when I was at CES last year in
Vegas where 4G was alive and well I was
pulling down upwards of 16 megabits per
second which was awesome anyway guys I'm
John retinue TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
