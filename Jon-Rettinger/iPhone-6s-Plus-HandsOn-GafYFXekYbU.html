from TechnoBuffalo here we are taking a
very first look at the brand new iPhone
6s plus all done up its new fourth color
this is rose gold so from the outside
everything looks the same but the inside
there is a lot that's different first
you can see that s denoted right there
let you know this is indeed the s model
but the big story here is force touch
being brought to the iPhone which Apple
is calling 3d touch but use that in a
lot of different ways it's good and say
I want to make a phone call for example
if I go ahead and push that down a
little bit of taptic feedback it's a
really quick taptic response go ahead
and find somebody that I want and make a
quick phone call that works for most
apps as well so say male for example
quick a little push you can go ahead and
see your inbox now the one question I
got during the keynote was you get to
hold your finger on it to go ahead and
slide it up you can but you don't have
to you go ahead and put your finger
right off it and go ahead and select
whatever you would like I was looking
around the phone it's very familiar it's
what we've seen with the current six
plus obviously this color here is unique
you've got your profile switch still in
the familiar upper left-hand corner
volume rocker up and down that you've
got your lock switch
lightning port and speakers noise
cancelling mic a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack here but we do have new is 7000
series aluminum we now have much
stronger glass on board you'd expect a
glass to be new to incorporate 3d touch
here new taptic engine the new a9
processor here with transistor
architecture built right in that's going
to be about 70% faster than the outgoing
a 90% faster graphics performance the
other big story here lives on the back
and it's that guy right there might look
the same about was 15% more megapixels
it is a 12 megapixel sensor now that can
take 4k video video on the front side
though there's also a new camera here
it's a 5 megapixel sensor and Apple was
saying they want to make sure there was
a flash on the front but they didn't
think I need to put another flash in
when the screen could do it now you can
use this screen as a flash or just kind
of cool
pricing for the sky is going to be the
same as the outgoing iPhone 6 plus and
same configuration so 16 is still on
board here all the way up to 128 a lot
of other new things here too
including noob and support faster Wi-Fi
and other things welcome to the camera
like live photos for more coverage on
the iPhone 6s plus in the iPhone 6s of
course stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo comm
so guys like videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
