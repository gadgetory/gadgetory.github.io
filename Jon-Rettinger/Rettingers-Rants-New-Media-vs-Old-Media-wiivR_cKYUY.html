to you by netflix what's up everyone
john renter from tech nova flew here and
welcome back to the episode of retina
shred this is sure every week i pick a
topic from the consumer electronics
world i put at my crosshairs and I yell
at it up this week an article particular
that talks about new media and old
meanie and really not understanding
differences between the two what that
means for the future of communications
advertising is overall marketing so if
you make youtube videos they feel like
nobody understands you this is the video
to watch this is retinues rants
let's get randy so an article was
published early last week I don't want
to draw much attention to it but it was
called the jennamarbles paradox you can
google it if you want to read the
article was actually the gist was this
author didn't understand new media by
new media I mean things that are online
so YouTube social media stuff you know
Twitter Facebook LinkedIn and the rest
of that and online marketing as a whole
not understanding YouTube essentially
when he said what some of these giant
youtubers acclaims of subscribers are
making hundreds of thousands even
millions of dollars and they're putting
no money to the quality of their content
and he was essentially saying that it's
a degradation of society and can't
understand how anybody would ever watch
these crappy videos and YouTube as a
whole was sort of the harbinger of the
coming apocalypse of communications in
the world especially the US obviously I
took a little bit of umbrage with that
he was saying that you know youtubers
are uneducated they don't know what I'm
gonna do with their lives they just talk
to cameras for a living and I say that
you know as I'm staring at a camera so
first sort of as a hobbyist way to give
back to the startup community here in
Southern California I do social media
consulting so I'll go to small startups
and I will help them for free to build a
social media campaign to try and get the
word out there there's a few reasons
that I do this first I think it's really
important to build media campaigns I
come from additional marketing before I
started doing all the tech stuff I
worked for an advertising agency that
did advertising actually for Honda and
Acura so a huge huge huge company that
really went the traditional way so I've
got experience for how regular marketing
works in regular marketing you know I
mean TV radio print ads and throw the
rest of that kind of stuff and the big
struggle guy went into when I go to
these companies is I'm bucked up against
older generation
that doesn't understand new media you
know there's a way that things were done
a lot of times new media can be very
threatening to this older generation
obviously that's not universally true
some older folks and older generations
get it and see the irrelevance of it I
always explain it like this this is what
I would say the author of that article
so working for Honda an actor you can
choose to spend upwards of four million
dollars to run a Super Bowl spot not
including production of that video and
maybe if you're lucky you'll hit 2% of
your demographic that you look before
now on the other side of that you can
spend a fraction you could spend maybe
$10,000 advertising the same product on
YouTube or social media you could target
exactly your demographic almost 90% of
your demographic and for a fraction of
the cost and you give actually a
relatively higher turnover rate you can
actually have relatively higher
engagement rate on the social media side
so there's real value there and you can
do it for less money and because you can
do it for less money it's a huge threat
sort of the old way of doing things and
there's certain technologies coming I
think there's really been a bit of
reticence understand how that works and
to say you tubers put no money to
production and they're a bunch of sort
of ignorant anuses really isn't a fair
thing to say so obvious people are
watching people are watching jenna
Marbles she might not be my cup of tea
but to millions of people she is if
people love what she does and it doesn't
matter that she's not it was not a full
production crew doesn't have separate
lighting if it works for her twitch for
the audience then who are we to say stop
it don't do it it's not right so my
overall message for for YouTube is keep
doing what you're doing you're gonna run
into problems people not understanding I
know every day I'm gonna have to explain
to people what I do for a living they
look at me like I got two heads this
isn't an understanding of what it is
quite yet
but the younger generation the folks
coming up we're gonna grow up with
YouTube grow up with new media it's not
gonna be new media anymore just gonna be
media and that's the way marketing is
done it's done online traditionally
there's some TV and some print of that
is obviously going away so don't worry
about those people that say that you
know fight through it you have to fight
through and struggle for the rest of it
people might assume you're uneducated or
unjust soon that you don't have a career
path but again fight through that as
well as serve adversity go through
through any job so take criticize an
opportunity to sort of re-establish
yourself and sort of explain what is you
do in the light as a role in society
that's sort of the approach that I've
taken so we take it made it to think our
friends and sponsors at net

definitely subscribing to them it is the
premier way to watch movies and TV shows
should be directly to your television
