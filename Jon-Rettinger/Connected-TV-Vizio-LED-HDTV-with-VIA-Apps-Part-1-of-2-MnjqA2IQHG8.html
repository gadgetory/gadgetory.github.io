of our trainings speaking friends out
there I open and mangle that too badly
what is going on everybody this video is
going to serve two purposes one it's a
review of this here TV set two it's
kicking off my series on connected TV
the future of TV watching what is TV
watching all about what's it going to be
like in the future or people even going
to call it TV watching anymore way back
80 or 90 years ago when I was a kid we
had a TV set in the living room it had
an antenna actually was kind of a two
antenna setup telescoping you pulled it
out like this
see like this at a lot of practice and
if we had it in the right spot and I
move the antenna the right way we got I
think five channels we got the three
major networks because back then there
was no Fox
we got PBS and the fifth channel was the
local independent Channel that showed
like wrestling and old cartoons on
Saturday mornings that kind of stuff
nowadays a lot of people have cable or
satellite in their homes you can get all
kinds of internet TV Hulu and iTunes
content you can get a Vudu and Amazon
video on-demand all that kind of stuff
you can get Netflix both streaming and
through the mail you can rent videos you
know all manner stuff you can get mobile
TV on your smartphone and your tablet
computer and TV in your car and the list
just goes on and on so what's the deal
with TV these days what are people
actually doing what are some of the ways
that you can get all the different
options hardware and software how can
you use your computer or your smartphone
or other devices you might already have
to get TV content at home and on the go
and you know what's the best way to
watch whatever it is whether it's pro
wrestling old cartoons reruns of freaks
and geeks or you know whatever it is you
want to watch what's the best way to do
it so we're going to kick things off
with a look at this your TV set it's a
vizio it's a 22 inch TV
it's got vizio z' Vizio internet apps
they call it which are connected apps
that let you do everything from update
your Twitter status to watch streaming
Netflix on-demand through the TV set
through Wi-Fi or Internet and I'll tell
you what I learned the hard way that
being laid up in bed for half of one day
and all day the next day we
cold is probably the best way to get a
thorough review experience with a
connected TV set because all I did was
play with this thing for about 36 hours
so enough out of me onto the review
let's fire it up alright so like I said
this is a 22 inch model from Vizio I'll
put the model number down in the
subtitles it's an LED set it's 1080p
although at this size 22 inches
you know 1080p unless you're up close
you're using it as a computer monitor
you know uh the 1080p thing is really
going to help you all that much
here I'm firing it up it's funny to have
to boot a TV set up but you know that's
the deal with that with these things
these days got the sound on right now
gosh you got a hooked up to these
external speakers I'll get to more on
that in a second it's 22 inch 1080p LED
backlit on the edges only it's part of
the razor series so it's ultra thin I'll
show you that in a second this TV I
actually purchased this was not a um not
a review loaner but I actually bought
this over the holidays it was on sale I
picked it up for $200 plus shipping uh
the same place where I got it now has it
for 270 not on sale prices seem to be
between 250 and 300 although I'm seeing
them on eBay for the $200 mark or lower
so there you go
got here to show you real quick not
going to a full unboxing or anything
like that but here's the remote it's got
your basic remote controls plus it's got
the transport controls for watching the
streaming video and stuff it's got the
via button for Vizio internet apps and
then your standard you know keypad
layout all that kind of stuff the TV
came with a special panel you have to
use if you want to mount the TV to the
wall which is kind of a drag because you
can't flush mount the TV which you know
you should be able to for TV this thin
came with the remote with batteries came
with a couple of cables and there you go
highlights of the TV set obviously the
apps we're going to get to in a second
it's got 802 11 ny5 built in they're
calling it HD Wi-Fi which is pretty
funny it's also got an
at port built in a couple HDMI inputs a
couple other inputs and then analog and
digital audio out now the audio out is
actually a big deal because the speakers
on this thing are terrible the sound is
just absolutely awful you can see
actually the speaker's off right now so
I've actually got my cable box hooked up
directly to these external speakers so
you're not going to hear the sound this
is a espn2 obviously coming through the
cable box
I'll show you or I guess listen you what
the sound sounds like using one of the
disturbing audio apps but the speakers
are just pretty bad you know on a set
that's this thin and at this price point
you're not going to expect a whole lot
you know there's certainly passable for
just listening and TV but I think you're
really going to want to hook this up to
external speakers home theater system
something if you're planning on using it
okay so what we're here for really you
know kind of in a nutshell the picture
quality is pretty good the colors are
pretty good for the on the set it's only
LED backlight or edge backlighting but
again it's a 22 inch set so you're not
really going to notice it that much the
size of the set is nice I don't like
this standby light when the TV is off
the standby light the Vizio logo glows
this kind of gold brown color you know
the whole time waltz off which I don't
really like and it's sort of odd having
a TV set that has to boot up the boot up
time isn't all that long but the TV's
actually crashed crashed twice on me
it's basically a computer you know it's
basically like a limited functionality
you know Home Media Center computer
built in here so once the thing just
totally crashed and the light was
blinking on and off and then it rebooted
itself the other time the remote just
wouldn't do anything so to crashes so
far also one firmware update that had to
be installed which added some
functionality and one of the notable
things that made the Netflix app much
nicer which is pretty cool but just kind
of funny to have a TV set you know that
that that crashes and needs firmware
updates and such um and there is kind of
a I don't saying on a lot I apologize
I'm aware of that believe me having the
software baked into the TV set very
convenient but you do you know run the
possibility of if the software just
totally malfunctions then you can't
watch TV till you get it fixed
you want to add more fun
shonali if this you know TV doesn't
support it then what do you do that kind
of thing their answers to all the
problems but something to consider so
we'll take a look at the apps down here
on the bottom and we'll start off with
where this thing actually starts off
when you load it up
so the HDTV settings we cookie went
through ups guess we hit the run blender
quickly run through here these are just
your settings for the set
you know assigning your inputs wide
screen mode closed captioning all that
kind of stuff one thing to mention on
the audio panel there's a setting for
lip-sync in my experience this hasn't
done very much so we'll leave it at that
I had some issues with lip synching on
Netflix I'll get to in a minute that did
not help there's actually equalizer
settings which on the one hand is pretty
cool on the other hand with these
speakers didn't do a darn bit of good
but I guess if you were outputting
to you know a home theater system or
external speakers could come in handy I
mean they are I when I when I ran it
through the external speakers they did
help you know was noticeable and if
you're using the Rap City app to stream
audio I could see where that could be
helpful otherwise you've got your basic
settings here or sleep time or all that
kind of stuff
network capabilities like I said 802 11
n Wi-Fi built-in as well as on Ethernet
jack in the back I've been using the
Wi-Fi only I have a pretty fast I mean a
decently fast cable modem connection and
just a I don't even have an N Wi-Fi
network setup right now this is running
on a you know - 11 G Network and I vent
at any trouble streaming video streaming
1080p video from Vudu anything like that
I got to get one of those designs shaped
into my head alright we'll go back and
take a look at some of the other apps
there's a Flickr app you can look at
Flickr photos I don't even know I have
anything in my I have some stuff in my
photo stream here these are all Yahoo TV
widgets and so to get into these widgets
some of them you don't have to sign into
but the Yahoo related ones like Flickr
you have to sign in with a yahoo ID so
here's some of the photos in my Flickr
stream we don't need to go into those
but basic you know Flickr functionality
you can explore different people sets
that kind of stuff look through the
contacts in your groups so you know
pretty neat stuff if you're into Flickr
ah we'll go back here and there's not an
easy way actually I'm sure there is I've
actually had a little bit of a problem
there we go hit the menu button get us
back to the widgets Yahoo News if you're
into doing that Rhapsody come to the
free trial or you can stream your
Rhapsody music through there's a
Facebook widget which I'm not going to
go into all the widgets here but some of
the popular ones Facebook the Facebook
widget is actually pretty good I don't
know why you'd want to deal with
Facebook and Twitter on your TV set
personally I think most of people who
want to use something like this on a TV
are going to have a smartphone or
another device around that it makes more
sense on because when you now that
content I don't know it's on TV but I
don't know if that's appropriate for our
eye for our audience here so there's my
there's my wall and if I want to enter a
status update one of the drawbacks here
is that I have to use the virtual QWERTY
board and click through on the remote to
enter things in so if I want to enter
the quick brown fox and jumped over the
lazy sheepdog you know I'm going to have
to do a whole lot of clicking and I
might get blackberry thumb by the time
I'm done
so for reading you know your Facebook
wall or your Twitter stream or whatever
you know kind of handy I guess if you're
into that whole thing but for entering
text I I don't see you know the value in
it personally
that's why Cordia remotes are becoming
more popular here's the Netflix app and
this was actually one of the main
reasons that I was interested in this
set the TV Guide is just kind of a view
engaño guide built in that's going to be
more useful for you
Yahoo Finance there's some other Yahoo
widgets we'll talk about those a little
more the Netflix app is one of the
reasons that I was most interested in
this set and the Netflix app actually
works quite well and with the update
after I installed the firmware update on
the set the newer version of the Netflix
app is actually really handy because it
lets you not only stream stuff from your
instant queue but you can actually
search
