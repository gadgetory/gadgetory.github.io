just called the essential phone we
actually reviewed it on our Facebook
page but I didn't take a look at it and
when we first looked at it it was before
it got a lot of software updates for the
camera it was also before a two hundred
dollar price drop making us peers to be
at least a bargain at five hundred bucks
I kind of wanted to take a look at it
myself since I didn't do the full review
we had to send back our review units we
just went out and bought this one we
bought in the new color that's available
now it's called pure white so I figured
an old-school unboxing kind of needs an
old-school knife let's go ahead and dig
in it's the essential phone so before I
put blade to plastic I want to think
actually YouTube themselves for
sponsoring this video they are
appropriately enough watching a brand
new channel focused on unboxings it's
just called youtube.com slash unbox link
to it down below ton of awesome creators
in boxing a lot of really cool products
sure to check out especially this
holiday season he's like to buy a lot of
tech you want to see what's inside the
box
they've got you covered with the new
unbox channel again link down below so
if you guys are new to the channel this
seems to be like my old staple this is
senior stabby this is the original
unboxing knife so I'm excited to take a
look at the essential when we first had
it in I only got it for maybe 20-30
minutes so there's a box it's got a tab
on it go ahead and do a pull this kind
of satisfying I like a little more
whooshing noise action it should just
slide it right out it's a pretty clean
box if you're not familiar with
essential it's actually founded by the
father of Android at Andy Rubin so and
there is the new pure white color which
I hadn't seen it's pretty good in person
inside you've got a USBC cord it seems
to be a pretty good length it's also
Braden it feels pretty sturdy charging
brick it's USBC dongle no headphone jack
so this is gonna give you on that USB
see little sleeve it's got some legal
material in there and a sim removal tool
so so this one was 700 bucks it was kind
of a tough sell but now I've got a 200 I
love price drop we're getting a lot of
phone for your money including
the highest quality materials you ever
seen in a phone the back is ceramic and
the side banding is titanium and they
claim it's gonna be super durable in
drop specially the titanium band the
most common drop is on the corner and
ceramic it supposedly pre dura but we've
seen some drop tests with the ceramic
has cracked the front is of course glass
and it is Gorilla Glass five and there's
a lot of talk about about the screen
first you're getting about 85% screen to
body ratio which is really awesome at
the top of that screen you're get a
little cyclops that is the 8 megapixel
camera can also shoot 4k video it's not
a dead zone I should mention also the
digitizer goes across it so you can
still still swipe down from that area it
does make using the OS look a little bit
weird of course some apps obviously not
gonna be optimized for it so it's gonna
make the status bar look a little bit
chunky I don't mind the cyclops look I'd
rather be there than have the facing
camera on the bottom but at least it
makes it identifiable that it's the
essential phone because there's there's
no little brain and on the back the
fingerprint reader is going to live in
the back it's really nicely placed and
above that it's probably our biggest
knock at least when we first tested the
essential and those are the two cameras
so they're dual 13 megapixel sensors
you're probably thinking one regular one
wide you'll be wrong it's one regular
one monochrome so we'll see how that
works
essentials put out a ton of software
update since I reviewed why I wanted to
go back and look at up seen some sample
to come out after the most recent update
and it looks to be drastically improved
I'm gonna do a visit review I'm excited
to take a look this I'm excited to see
if it's gotten any better I want to do
more revisited reviews so anything you
guys want to see us cover questions
you've got about this maybe for your own
experiences in the comments down below
and let us know if you like every now
and then an old-school unboxing video
come back up also let us know in the
video a thumbs up we appreciate it until
next time
