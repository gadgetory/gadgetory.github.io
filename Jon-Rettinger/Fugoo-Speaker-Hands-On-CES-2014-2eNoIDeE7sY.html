to you by Toyota I'll be honest but this
one really caught my eye and I'm going
to show you guys why so this is this is
fugu right here and if I'm not mistaken
and please correct me if I'm wrong six
drivers drivers absolutely do 360-degree
audio so you got two tweeters on each
side two passive radiators and two mid
woofers on minions now you'll notice
that he popped this right out of a
little case and that's because there are
different styles you can use which is
pretty cool this is the sport kind of
amazing looking it's really cool very
sporty indeed and this is fugu tough so
this is straight-up ruggedness happening
on your speaker now the cool thing about
fugu is it sort of reminds me of a GoPro
but a speaker so you can take this this
baby you can put it on a kayak this has
a mount you can mount this anywhere that
you feel you want to go bike riding you
want to put it on a kayak it's
waterproof down to three feet dust proof
snow proof drop proof wiper so basically
this thing is gonna last you and as you
were saying earlier if you get it a
little muddy you can actually just hose
it off that's the best part I like that
a lot
I'm a big fan and if it falls in the
pool just pick it right off just fish it
fish it right on the pool no big deal
doesn't matter
so there's a couple other things that
fugu has that I found very intriguing
first of them being actually really love
this this remote here so he's actually
using it as a watch but it also is a
lanyard you can use it as a lanyard
which is pretty cool so one of the
things that I like a lot about this is
you have your controls here but then
this button right here is an action
button so if you're using Android you
can use Google now with this and if
you're using iOS you can talk to Siri so
if you're using fugu and you're like
gosh when's the game start when's the
big game start
you can ask Siri or you can ask Google
now and it will tell you if you have a
phone call you can answer phone calls on
this you can make calls on this you can
say hey Siri call my husband and then
he'll call me as I'm laying by the
poolside and I can call my husband it'll
be great but this is really cool but the
best part you guys flip it over show
them that's a bottle opener boom that is
this is like party central right here
it's like a party in a speaker I'm a
really I think I think this is way cool
so this is meant to go pretty much
everywhere with you if you love music
it's something really interesting now
when and for how much all right we're
going to take orders the end of this
month we're going to start shipping in
February they style and pro or $1.99
each the TUF is 229 and are you guys
gonna sell the shells separately like if
you'll do the interchangeable jackets
will be sold we got a lot more coming
the rest of the year - there'll be
completely exciting new designs this one
is my favorite the tweed very British I
love it
come soon a couple months from now
they'll start about $39 and then 49 for
the tough jacket so after six months a
year you want to get sup the new stylish
you just want to renew your jackets no
problem pretty awesome so that's
if you want 360 degrees sound it sounds
really good all the way around it so if
you're at a party if you're laying by
the pool whatever it is you're doing
it's a pretty awesome speaker I'm a big
fan of it so thank you for renewing my
interest in Bluetooth speakers sir thank
you so much thank you
