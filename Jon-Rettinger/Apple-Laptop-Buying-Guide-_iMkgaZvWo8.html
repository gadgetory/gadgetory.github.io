TechnoBuffalo here with my apple laptop
buying guide I make these videos
probably about two to three times per
year as we gear up towards Apple updates
pc laptops are updated pretty regularly
throughout the year Apple if we're lucky
we're going to see updates about two
times and I think we're heading up to
one of those periods one of the
questions I get all the time is when is
a good time for me to buy my macbook for
me to buy a macbook pro well I'm going
to go ahead and answer those questions
hope you enjoy so I'll be doing another
video going over all the desktop lines
in Apple's lineup let's go ahead and
jump right in with the laptops let me
first say that I think we are going to
have a redesign completely of the laptop
models primarily the macbook in the
macbook pro sometime in mid december
early january so if you're the kind of
person that needs to have the most
recent up to date up to design
technologies you are going to want to
wait to purchase a macbook or macbook
pro if you have your eyes set on a new
macbook air you're going to be fine
those products were just recently
updated alright so let's start with the
top the entry level math book so in the
past we've seen Apple combine their
macbook and macbook pro lines and
leaving only the plastic model to sort
of bear the macbook a name we used to
have an all aluminum macbook i think
that the plastic model is going to be
very very very short for this world
unfortunately apples design standards
are really going towards that aluminum
unibody look we saw it with the heirs we
have it now with the macbook pros and as
iconic as a plastic look may have been
in the past i don't think it aligns with
apples design in the future so if your
plastic look at something you really
want you may want to jump right in and
pick one of those up it's been about a
hundred ninety five days since the
product was less updated and it a verjus
about a hundred and ninety five days
between updates so we're really blue
right now for an update if the plastic
macbook does get a stay of execution
a logical upgrade would be in the
processor standpoint to a newer more
powerful core i3 chip that would be sort
of the logical upgrade that we'd see
there's not much left Apple can do with
the plastic design it is sort of plastic
unibody but again doesn't follow that
all aluminum look we may see an update
and RAM to perhaps from to standard 24
standard although that is unlikely if we
do see any update for the plastic line I
think it's only going to be underneath
the hood and we'll just be in the
processor as again I do think the
plastic body is going to be short-lived
so why is that plastic body going to be
short-lived well let's go ahead and talk
about the macbook pro first according to
a macrumors it's been two hundred and
thirty days since the last update and an
average is about two hundred eight days
in between so we're already about 20 ish
days late according to apple's average
release cycle so i think we're going to
see a complete redesign of the macbook
pro line think it's going to be more in
line with what we see with the current
macbook air with the tapered design now
that design is going to lead to a few
questions first what's going to happen
to the ports well we see a 13-inch
macbook air with just two USB ports and
that's really just about it people go to
a macbook pro for the port options and
the big question is how Apple is going
to use their macbook air design on the
macbook pro and still give people that
array of ports that they've been used to
whether or not it's a card reader I
brought back firewire port extra USB
ports whatever that technology might be
so they we're going to see a bit longer
design factor that will comment there's
extra ports I think apple is gone with
the flip down window we saw on last
generation macbook airs so we may see
longer ports I don't suspect you're
going to see sac USB ports one on top of
another that does not make it conducive
for using multiple devices so expect a
bit longer of a design a very similar
with that tapering form factor that we
have right now as far as hard drives go
what's Apple going to do they want to
make these things so thin well there are
smaller hard drives 2.5 inch spinning
platters a top
but of course the market is headed
towards solid-state drives and we may be
at a point where solid state drives
become sort of the affordable option
Apple currently on the macbook pro has a
512 gigabyte solid-state drives a bill
to order option for thirteen hundred
dollars clearly no one's going to jump
in at a thirteen hundred dollar bill to
order option I think that once that
price gets half or a bit more a 512
upgrade could potentially be a
possibility I think we're going to see
entry-level solid state hard drives of
128 and 256 similar what we have in the
13-inch macbook pro and that's going to
be true for the 13 and susie macbook
airs and that's going to be true for the
13 15 inch macbook pro models perhaps a
cheaper built order option to that
larger 512 solid-state drive which
hopefully get price in half from that
current thirteen hundred dollar price
range and again I expect these updates
to be in the mid december early January
timeframe so again if you love the
current design and you want to be able
to grab a good deal on what perhaps
might be a generation behind technology
but still a very capable computer and
now would be a time to get your macbook
pro if you want the latest and greatest
you need to have that and you want to
suit the new design they're going to
look like to make your decision I
definitely wait until after the update
if you do decide that the current
hardware is what you want you still may
want to wait until that update as often
times in the Apple refurbished or there
will be severe discounts on the outgoing
model and up also he generally discounts
up pretty nicely a newer of the outgoing
model something to keep in mind I didn't
expect any updates in the macbook air
that was just updated about two months
ago so I think that's gonna sort of stay
as it is certainly the next time that
does get upgraded I think we'll see
faster processors perhaps ultra low
voltage core i3 models I also think of
the macbook pro we're going to see
updates to of the chipset to the Newark
war series of chips so perhaps I've
three i5 and i7 some low voltage
variance of each certainly there a big
power consumption and it's impacted like
I suspect any design is going to be a
power management is going to be a trim
bendis factor I think also will see the
hard drives sort of splayed out almost
like a stick of ram lycra suit in the
past especially for the solid state
drive sell it state drives so the mod
tools would be sort of separated and
soldered right onto the motherboard
perhaps making upgrades quite difficult
much more difficult than what we have
right now with the spinning platters
anyway guys want to know what you want
to thank are you excited about these
potential macbook and macbook pro
updates are you going to miss the bus
design do you think i am way off i
really wanna hear what you guys have to
say sound off in the comments down below
and look for a video going over the
desktop line so the mac mini the imac
and the mac pro i'm jon rettinger from
