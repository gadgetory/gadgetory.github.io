technobuffalo here 2016 is upon us and
Samsung is going to be unleashing a ton
of awesome products some things you
might know something you might not
expect so I'm continuing my top five
predictions for 2016 with what Sam's I'm
gonna do come in under five USBC 2015
was all about charging we saw wireless
charging finally make its way at all of
Samsung products and we saw a
fast-charging finally come of age but
this year it's all going to be about
that reversible plug expect us bc to
make its way across all samsung devices
regardless of price coming at number 4
the galaxy view will definitely not get
a second generation I would have loved
to bit in Samsung's pitch meeting for
this 18.4 inch tablet they're like hey
don't we need I'm just gonna make the
ipad pro look tiny that can kind of be a
TV but also kind of not on a TV but also
too big that you can't carry it but also
need to built-in handle I think is a
product that should not exist and it's
gonna join the likes of the galaxy zoom
and other dead Sampson products samsung
graveyard come it number three the
galaxy s7 so saying the galaxy s7 is
coming sometime in the March timeframe
is Cupid obvious like saying I'm not
gonna be able to sleep tomorrow night
have insomnia you know that it's going
to happen in fact I made a friction
beautiful you can expect in the galaxy
s7 so you should pause this go watch
that and then come back if you think you
can't expect open a galaxy s7 that I'll
share with you here micro SD card
support to screen sizes will see a
faster processor it'll be the Snapdragon
820 for the US the x denotes 88-90 for
the other parts of the world but it's a
look almost identical to the galaxy s6
now so you'll be trying to keep that in
your pocket for another year number two
arguably my favorite of all Samsung
products the galaxy note 6 santak
usually uses their note line as
therefore flagship what all the specs
when she put her down to their galaxy s
line of phones the note 60 is going to
be a beast coming towards the later part
of the year around august-september to
november timeframe expect 4k screen and
not like what Sony did wear it sometimes
4k expect a legit
4k screen practice screens get a little
bit bigger after six inches but the
bezel is to get thinners of the package
should remain about the same size also
odd expect Samsung because they don't
like to get out SPECT to have more ram
than four gigabytes whether it's five or
six not sure yet but it will be easier
for its but the obvious things too like
improved optics microSD card slot will
be there but do not get your hopes up
for remove the battery that's not gonna
make its home also slight improvements
will see the Galaxy S Pen get a little
bit better in touch with get a little
less TouchWiz II and more more android e
so thumbs up to that and the number one
thing you can expect from Samsung this
year this one's going out a little bit
on a Ledge something modular rumor
circulated earlier that the LG g5 was
going to be a modular phone in fact
dating back two months ago we heard some
rumors the galaxy s7 was gonna have a
modular camera I'd expect a brand new
samsung line this year to be modular
maybe the galaxy s you'd galaxy s mod
where you can pick what you want your
phone to be you want to say battery you
want a low resolution screen you can
have that you want a better camera
module pop that in want a bigger battery
you can do that as well modular phones
are coming in a coming very quickly
we've seen proof of concept that
google's project ara whichever really
made its debut ask plans but Samsung
again does not like to be outdone so I
would expect something modular build
your own smartphone type thing to hit at
least some time in 2016 or the very
least be announced this year the same
things I've got a company that releases
a ton of products more products than
probably a company should but I feel
pretty confident about these five which
one of you was excited about what to
hear your thoughts and comments on it
mash that thumbs up button we always
appreciate it until next time I'm
generative technobuffalo doctor guys the
next video Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
