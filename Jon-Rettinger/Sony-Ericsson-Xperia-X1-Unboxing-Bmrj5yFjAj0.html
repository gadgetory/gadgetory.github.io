TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the sony ericsson xperia x1 now I
know this is a little bit of an older
phone but it's still pretty hot and one
that I really wanted to get my hands on
for a few reasons
first the sequel the Xperia x2 is slated
to be launched sometime in the next few
months taking a lot of the cues from the
x1 and we've seen a lot about the
Android powered x10 though too coming
out sometime in 2010 so the x1 here is
running a very custom build of Windows
Mobile 6 which means it's got this cool
panel interface which can be used to do
a ton of different things and actually
you don't have to interact Windows
Mobile itself it's sort of Sony
Ericsson's take on touchflo 3d for
example it's a skin on top of the OS now
playing around up it and it's a very
good skin and it makes a phone work
really well and it makes the operating
system enjoyable to use so I'm looking
forward to taking a look at the x1 this
can be picked up from Sony style for
just about 700 bucks so it's really not
a cheap proposition but you can look
around in there certain other discounts
you can find it is a pretty nice looking
phone it's thin it's got a full QWERTY
keyboard let's go ahead and take a look
at and I'll show you so I'm going to
specs as we go through when open up the
FedEx box here this is not a job for the
big ol knife because this will chop my
finger open trying to open up a FedEx
box with a knife go ahead and peel this
off there we go and let's see what we
have inside here is the xperia x1 this
has not been picked up by US carrier
though it has been picked up by carriers
abroad so if you want to buy this of
course you have to buy it unlocked and
it is quad band 4 eighties 3G network
share we've got the xperia x1 if you're
looking for a full QWERTY Windows Mobile
experience the slide-out keyboard the
xperia x1 it is probably one of the
better phones out there but I'll use in
take a look so here's the Box got a
picture of the device on the front looks
like we have the silver one I believe it
also comes in
back nothing on the side picture the
device letting you know it's Windows
powered and of course it's got Wi-Fi
which appeared to be B and G a 3.2
megapixel camera it's got media two
touchscreen which is three inches and it
has assisted GPS so it will use its
integrated GPS radio and it also used
the cell towers to help coordinate your
position here's a picture the device you
can sort of see the panels right there
and I'll get to all that sort of follow
up videos go ahead and open this up and
see what we get the top just slides
right off the cool looking box Xperia
this is probably a similar boxing and
branding we'll see to the rest of the
Xperia devices so there are two separate
boxes we've got some getting started
guide from the fish panels I'll show you
that a little bit later some support
there's a phone itself leave that there
for just a second and see what else
comes in here pull this up we've got
charging cord which appears to be mini
USB with a wall turner I'd also have a
pair of stereo headphones with a
microphone and Swit to be an extra
stylus so nothing else terribly exciting
in there let's take a look at the phone
itself and that's what we're all here to
see it's very thin it's got a really
high quality feel to it
screens a little bit narrow but not too
bad and that's got an 800 by 1400 pixels
so 800 by 1400 on the 3-inch screen
diagonal which is sort of an interesting
size for a screen it's very long let's
slide the keyboard out and see what it
feels like it's got a very nice sliding
mechanisms got that sort of arched slide
if you look at it this was designed by
HTC although it is a Sony Ericsson phone
keypad seems to be very nice got a lot
of throw to it pretty easy to navigate
where you want to go a big space bar
which I like and a big Enter key take a
look at else we have on the left hand
side you've got your charging port which
is mini USB 6 slot right there which is
a microSD expansion port microphone on
the bottom on the right hand side of
device looks like you've got your volume
toggle which is interesting which phones
have it on the left side but er there it
is and then we also have you looks like
a camera and shutter button right there
for the 3.2 megapixel camera on the back
with LED flash and that appears to be
about it on the device you've got your
lock and probably a power button as well
and if you put five millimeter headset
jack on the bottom you've got sort of an
interesting array of buttons and things
you're probably used to with Windows
Mobile so you've got your send end and
that actually is a power button your
okay button and you've got a new panel
button which opens up a whole new panel
interface you've got probably some soft
keys let's boot this up and I'll show
you just a real quick overview of what
it looks like just a quick two seconds
so I'll do a full video of the Sony
Ericsson panel interface may not even
have a charge in it to even boot up
there's got a little bit of a buzz so
should be something going on go ahead
and zoom in just a bit okay so the phone
has booted up for the first time it took
about 35 full resentence wasn't too bad
but the squash the splash screen told me
that is running Windows 6.1 windows
mobile 6.1 more specifically trying to
connect to Wi-Fi here but let me just
show you very quickly sort of the piece
de resistance of the x1 what separates
it from the rest of the windows mobile
phones as a resistive touch screen it's
not capacitive but this panel button is
what makes it very interesting to get
these new sort of custom home screens
and there are a few more that you can
download go ahead and pick one for
example each of them have a little
different bit of utility so we'll go
ahead and just launch a fish one here
and these special starts swimming and as
they swim and will start to change color
and that will indicate that you've got a
missed call or a text message sort of
interesting things and they'll swim
around as you tap them that is sort of
one of the fun panels but there's a lot
in here that have more utility as well
and I'll go through each one of these
sort of more in depth in
upcoming video and you guys hope you
enjoy this is John Ranger with an
unboxing for you of the sony ericsson
xperia x1 you found a remote interest in
how the xperia x1 works and how the
Xperia x2 it's 4th time you is going to
work this should give you a pretty good
sense of what you can expect hope you
guys enjoy and I'll see you in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
