little business trip down to Southern
California having a whole bunch of
packages waiting for you what's up I'm
Noah from TechnoBuffalo let's find out
what's in box number one all right so
three packages we're going to start with
FedEx on top here we'll get to UPS and
USPS later just back from a little trip
down to I tell you what sometimes this
job is awesome I got to check out the
DreamWorks Studios as part of a press
junket for some TV related stuff talk
more about that later because that is
not what this box has to do with this
box has to do with tablets but the trip
to DreamWorks very very cool I really
enjoyed that but this this is the HTC
Flyer Best Buy is logo on the box there
you go HTC and Best Buy bringing this
thing to market in the US this is the
Wi-Fi version it's got the 1.5 gigahertz
processor that's Android with HTC Sense
it's not Froyo or it's not a honeycomb
rather it's Android 2 with HTC Sense but
heavy heavy modifications too and you
know with with sense lots going on there
so saw this thing for the first time
back at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona been very excited about its
sense because I think it's I you know I
think what's making these tablets
interesting is the customizations that
that companies are doing to them so so I
can check this one out I also really
like the size of it 7 inch display so in
the box we've got the tablet covered in
lots of protective film thanks to the
folks from HTC by the way for sending
out this review loaner we appreciate it
they also threw in two of the two of the
styli stylus plural uh Cingular styli
plural i think so
check this out it's a you know it's a
powered active stylus has two buttons
the magic pen I think they call it two
buttons and a battery
unscrew the cap there put the battery in
finally a battery cover I can see hole
is so simple even no one could do it so
there you got two buttons on the stylus
and also in the box lots of information
and how to use this thing Asti look
that's for me right battery cover
instructions awesome HTC Flyer a quick
guide warranties all that stuff some
stickers that I'm sure have a specific
use that I'll learn about soon enough
here's the the power adapter in its own
fancy bag proprietary connection and USB
cable for syncing as well so flyer a
quick guide get to know your tablet
before you turn it on make sure you
prepare it correctly battery cover take
it off micro SD card homescreen
rearranging icons customizing the launch
bar lockscreen customizing the
lockscreen because it's got the new
sense with you can launch app straight
from the lockscreen connect to the
Internet and then fast browsing
wellsure t3 how about some checking a
buffalo on there I guess that's that's
you know we're getting there we're
getting there
gotta grow got to grow so here's the
tablet itself it's heavy you know for
its size it's a it's a little bit heavy
it's got the aluminum unibody
construction and you know it definitely
has a little bit of heft to it what's
really cool is when you rotate the
tablet not only does the screen rotate
but watch the capacitive buttons they
rotate as well so you've got your
buttons in the right place whether
you're using the device in portrait or
landscape mode which i think is pretty
neat well unlock it the 3d sense that
works in either portrait or landscape
mode very cool
getting my weather data on so I am
excited to check this one out we'll
leave it at an unboxing for now a little
bit of hands on there but just looking
around real quick at the three half
millimeter audio jack on top with your
power lock switch on the right spine
volume up and down buttons with it looks
like dual microphones
on the bottom there's your charging
cable I think I said proprietary before
I don't think this is proprietary I
think it's uh I think it's USB I'm just
so used to seeing the the microUSB on
everything through me but anyway on the
back here five megapixel camera on the
back and then you've got a front-facing
camera as well which I believe is that
one megapixel I think it said I can look
it up later obviously but uh 1.3
megapixel camera on the front the rear
camera has autofocus bluetooth 3.0 it's
a seven-inch touchscreen like I said 16
gigs of internal storage it's thirteen
point two millimeters thick so thicker
then you know an iPad or a Galaxy Tab
for sure but smaller obviously it's
Wi-Fi only it's got GPS there you go so
kind of a quick first look there's a lot
to dive into on this one so I don't want
to I wanna do too much with it because I
want to check out the magic pen and see
how this stuff works and have something
you know hopefully semi-intelligent to
say before I uh or I do it but here I'm
gonna draw in the canvas
I have a really big mouth now I gotta
fit to rotate this here so I can write
Buffalo there you go see that's me
saying alright what's up I'll know from
TechnoBuffalo know it's a first look at
the huh maybe I'm tired after my trip I
don't know at the HTC Flyer the Wi-Fi
version HTC and Best Buy it bringing
that one to the States again just an
unboxing first look very excited to
check this out though Android based with
lots and lots of custom software going
on much much more on the flyer all the
other tablets whatever is in these other
two bucks is coming your way on
TechnoBuffalo calm until next time I'm
gonna go get my flyer on make some more
funny drawings of myself I'm Noah thanks
for watching we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
