from TechnoBuffalo here and evidently a
lot of people email and call Apple the
only thing they're asking for are
smaller devices coming on the heels of
the now 4-inch iPhone se Apple unveiled
the brand-new nine point seven inch iPad
air iPad pro it's called the iPad pro
but it's a little more power it's also
gonna cost a hundred dollars more than
what the iPad air line used to be so let
me tell you what this money is gonna get
you friend
you're going to get a lot of hardware
from the larger iPad pro the a9x chip
with the m9 coprocessor support for hey
Siri I said that's a seat I didn't turn
on all your phones there's also of
course support for the Apple pencil
there was a new smaller keyboard
attachment as well so if you want to
type you can do that camera wise Apple
went to the iPhone 6's parts bin which
is some pretty good parts bin to go to
it's got a 12 megapixel camera that can
shoot 4k video but it does have a camera
just be aware there's some hums maybe
you like that on the front it's got a
five megapixel sensor another thing new
is a true tone display what that's gonna
do is change the color on the screen
depending on your ambient light so if
you're in a warm environment it's gonna
go warm if you're in a dark environment
a good dark if you got a disco take your
iPad and go home
other things are gonna separate it from
the iPad air lines forty percent less
reflective twenty five percent brighter
and 25 percent greater color saturation
then the outgoing iPad air to going to
be available and the colors you'd expect
but rose gold is here as well
pricing is going to be $5.99 for 32 gig
no 64 option it's gonna jump up to 749
428 gig and $8.99 for a new 256 gig
variant model but also will be cellular
versions available it's gonna be
available for pre-order on the 24th of
March or going for sale on the 31st of
March or if you're watching this long
after and you want one just go through
and pick one up iPad air to get a price
drop through 99 and the iPad Mini is now
269 pretty much along the lines of what
we expected a smaller iPad pro the few
new features all the powered all the
utility of the larger iPad pro but in a
smaller package you guys are excited
about this one in your thoughts leaving
the comments down below are you like no
John I don't want this you're like oh
