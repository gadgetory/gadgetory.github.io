phones of its time it was one of the
first with excellent build quality had
great speakers and interesting camera
but as years went on HTC seat on the
throne started to slip a lot but now we
have this this is the HTC you 12 plus
and if you're using it for two weeks
it seems HTC is back and I'm having all
of these same feelings that I had with
the original n7 this is a big phone but
for the most part the space is used well
up front there's a six inch screen and
I'll talk about that more in a second
there's an aluminum frame around the
edge and the glass liquid surface on the
back which basically means the glass
curves around the edges and corners but
the u12 has one of the more unique
design cues out there a translucent back
I love this you can see the housing for
the camera and the fingerprint sensor
and it just gives you a look that you
don't see everywhere the only thing I
don't really understand what this is the
fake-out in the middle these little
lines really give the impression that
wireless charging is a thing but it's
not that's really the only part of this
design though that I don't understand
everything else makes sense and coming
from previous years this is a great look
now back up front is that six inch
screen it's a 1440 by 2080 Super LCD
display and it's in the 18 by 9 aspect
ratio yeah it's not OLED but it still
looks great vibrant colors it's DCI p3
compliant and supports HDR 10 which is
good to see it has good viewing angles
the only thing I wish is it to be a bit
brighter but it's still plenty usable
and I'm not really missing Oland the
bezels here are also not huge and
there's no notch which is a rarity here
in 2018 I'm personally a fan of this
especially since the bezels are so small
they're just no need for a notch here
and I think this design works
boomsound is also back with dual
speakers which get loud and sound good
there's one on the front of the earpiece
and went down below compared to the
iPhone 10 and s9 which have a similar
setup the u 12 is noticeably louder I
wish there was a tad more bass but other
than that the speakers are enjoyable now
there's no headphone jack here
but you do get a pair of HTC u sonic
earbuds in the box which work over USB C
and four included here buds they
actually sound quite good and they have
noise cancellation so that's good
now before we get to cameras I want to
mention the sides of the phone so like
with last year's phone the u12 plus has
edge sense although now it's updated
with even more features this gives you
the ability to squeeze or tap the sides
to give you quick access to different
options with you twelve there is now
more than just the squeeze you can
double tap or long hold to get even more
options that you could before there's
one feature that sounds cool for a demo
but honestly I didn't think I would be
using it but I actually use it a lot
my favorite shortcut was a tap to shrink
down the screen size for one-handed use
and you can do things like quickly open
the camera or open a certain app really
anything I think this is a better option
than a dedicated button and the fact
that you can remap each tap to do pretty
much anything you want or just turn it
off altogether makes this much more
useful one thing I don't like is the new
volume and power buttons now instead of
being actual buttons they're only haptic
buttons now in theory I have no issue
with this but man it's just not executed
very well it takes way too much force to
activate it and you can't adjust the
force needed to press it I was
frustrated every time I use them this is
probably something that can be fixed
with an update but for now this is my
least favorite part about this phone
okay let's move on to the camera because
there's a lot of them too on the front
and two on the back
the main shooter on the back is a 12
megapixel ultra pixel camera with an F
1.8 aperture and optical image
stabilization and the second is a 16
megapixel sensor with an F 2.6 aperture
and 2 times optical zoom but no optical
image stabilization here the camera is
solid it definitely has a tendency to
add a lot of contrast which you may or
may not like but I was impressed by the
overall amount of detail that was
retained even with these somewhat
noticeable heavy processing when you
zoom in it doesn't get splotchy and over
sharpen it still holds up really well
now switch over to manual mode and you
have excellent hardware that can compete
with the best in the bunch and produce
great images like with most phones these
days the limiting factor with the
quality is the processing but the u12
does it better than a lot of fields
it's a solid camera on the video side of
things you get 4k 60 which is good on
the front there are now two identical a
megapixel cameras the only purpose for
this is to get a bokeh effect
I like the idea in theory but like with
the back camera the portrait mode effect
isn't all that great it does a decent
job of cutting out a subject but it
looks a little bit unnatural especially
the blur in the background I would have
liked to see the second camera used for
something a bit more like maybe a super
wide angle or something like that just
not just two identical cameras but
overall the cameras on the u12 plus are
solid and certainly aren't a reason not
to get this phone powering the phone is
the usual slew of components Snapdragon
820 5 6 gigabytes of RAM adrena 630 64
128 gigabytes of internal storage which
is expandable ip68 water-resistance
3,500 milliamp out of battery which I
found to perform well with heavy use
watching video browsing social on the
web it lasts about a day like with
pretty much every other phone in
existence the only thing it doesn't have
like I said is wireless charging it's a
bummer there but it does support quick
charging so there's that it comes with
Android 8.0 Oreo and should be getting
Android P with an updates although you
never know what those things it is a
skin version but it's not too intrusive
there are things like blink feed if you
swipe over Amazon Alexa built-in and
different icons but all that is easy to
change if you want so is the u12 plus
perfect no but it's a solid phone that
delivers almost all the features you
would want in a flagship it could use a
few software updates but I don't think
you can go wrong with this if it's a
phone you're looking at and it's $800
starting price the competition is fierce
especially considering how similar
phones are these days but finally it
seems HTC is back in a big way and the
u2 A+ is definitely worth considering so
is the you 12 plus something that you
would buy or are you gonna wait for some
of the other flagships coming out be
sure to let us know down below in the
comments I don't think y'all so much for
