technobuffalo here timing an apple
laptop or desktop purchase is oftentimes
in risky affair you never know if you're
getting right at the end before an
update especially if you're buying one
of these every few years you want to
make sure you've got the latest and
greatest technology it's going to hold
you until your next purchase so an
effort to help make these decisions a
little bit easier about a week and a
half ago I put out an apple laptop
buying guide in that video I promised a
desktop version well this is the
fulfillment of that promise so let me go
ahead and tell you when I think the good
time is to buy your apple desktop
alright so let's start with the most
popular apple desktop of course I am
talking about the imac right now in
early december we're about mid cycle for
a refresh which would put a potential
update around the march april timeframe
so if you're thinking about getting an
imac for the holidays or the next month
or two now is a very good time if we do
see updates in that march to april
timeframe cheetahs are there going to be
very minor think we'll see an update to
the intel core family of chips we may
perhaps finally see a long long rumored
eyesight HD camera and there's been some
speculation for quite some time now
about touch screen panels making their
way into imax and I think that Apple
really shut that down when they gave a
preview of the next operating system OS
10 leopard and they mentioned that touch
screens really weren't conducive at all
two laptops and that's why they made
sort of a widget friendly a mouse
version of these almost iOS experience
that we've seen on the iPad and the
iphone if it doesn't make sense of a
touch panel on a mobile product like a
laptop I think it makes very little
sense from an user standpoint to have it
on a desktop I think there's very little
value add I don't think Apple is going
to make updates just because they can
not to mention the added cost of touch
panels would
most definitely bring with them so if
you think there's going to be a giant
update I wouldn't cross your fingers
that probably will be very minor so
don't worry about touchscreen updates
hello Apple has not really given us all
the features of Lion I really assume
that touch sensitivity is not going to
be one of the key features so if you're
looking to get an imac thumbs up now is
a great time to do so so now let's go
ahead and move on to the littlest of the
apple desktops the one that's updated
the least frequently or one of the least
frequent let's talk about the mac mini
we RN a mid-cycle refresh again for the
Mac Mini which is I just mentioned is
not updated nearly as often as its imac
counterpart if we do see an update it
will probably be get some sort of
desktop event which I would peg at the
end of March early April time frame as
well we just saw a complete case from
design so I don't think we're going to
see any sort of giant updates to the mac
mini line the most probably logical
update that we might see is the new core
series of chips making their way into
the diminutive little map to give it a
bit more power most likely the core i3
chip there's also the potentiality that
we might see the solid state drive found
the macbook air where the someone state
modules are actually soldered right on
to the motherboard in the mac mini
making it perhaps a smaller package
requiring less room for cooling that's a
potential upgrade another likely
candidate is an up in the minimum amount
of RAM Apple currently ships the mac
minis with a minimum of two gigs of ram
offering full offering four gigs rather
for a hundred dollar upgrade perhaps at
a hundred dollars will be giving roddis
to apple's dedicated users but for right
now at least the next few months now is
a very good time to ask for or go out
and purchase your very own mac mini so
now let's go and talk about the big
daddy of the apple desktops let's chat
about the mac pro like the other two i
just discussed the mac pro is right now
in a mid-cycle refresh all this guy
hardly ever gets an upgrade we're lucky
if we see
something every year and a half I would
be even considered frequent for the Mac
Pro we just saw on updates potentially
12 cores often times with a computer
this powerful the software it doesn't
catch up to the hardware mean the song
for that's being written and available
doesn't nearly come close on taking
advantage of all the quarters in the
power that the Mac Pro offers eat if
there was a hardware upgrade I chances
are the upgrades and the improvements to
the end-user really wouldn't be
experienced to its full potential so if
you're worried about a mac pro update I
would not expect one of those for quite
some time perhaps in the six-month time
frame or longer now is a great time to
go pick up a mac pro eat if you're
looking at a baseline Mac Pro getting
machine that's going to be fully
upgradeable ram hard drive space and a
few other specs and it's really going to
be a fantastic machine so no worries at
all about purchasing a mac pro so let me
recap now in early december is a great
time for an imac it is a great time for
a mac mini and it's a great time for a
mac pro if you're waiting to get a
laptop you might want to check out my
laptop buyers guide they'll be a link to
it down below now might not be the best
time to jump on the apple laptop
bandwagon but if you can deal with
working on a mac sitting at your desk a
desktop option is going to be fantastic
i'm jon rettinger from technobuffalo and
i will see you or at least talk to you
in the next video no i actually film
this video twice because the first time
I eyebrows were so crazy I couldn't put
that online I probably a little bit of
oversharing too much information see the
next one below what's up everyone jon
rettinger from technobuffalo here buying
an apple computer can really be a car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
