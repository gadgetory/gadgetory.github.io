and I want to talk to you about the palm
pre I've been holding out from making a
video discussing it until there was some
official announcement from palm and
spread themselves and today may 19th
there finally was the big announcement
everybody wanted to know when it was it
going to be released how much was it
thing going to cost and the answers to
those questions it'll be released
Saturday June sixth and it will run you
199 on a two-year contract after a
hundred dollars manufacturer rail and
mail-in rebate so the 199 will cost 299
in store and if you want that really
cool wireless charging touchstone
they're calling it it's going to run you
another 70 bucks so you are looking at a
pretty significant investment so let me
talk to you about the palm pre and tell
you I am excited about it what I like
and what I don't like about the device
or what I expect not to like about the
device I will have one on gin six
foreign unboxing and review so be sure
to stick around to the channel what I do
like about the palm pre first and
foremost is it's a new form factor it's
a new phone anything that's new and
evolutionary the revolutionary pushes
the industry much like the iPhone pushed
Microsoft to improve windows mobile and
pushed blackberry to probably delete the
storm the palm pre is going to drive the
industry forward and that is always a
good thing I'm looking forward to using
the webos it does appear to be a very
elegant operating system multitasking is
a huge huge huge thing for me I've got
on the record is saying I'm a huge fan
as well of multi-touch capacitive
screens that's why I love the iphone the
g1's capacitive screen is fantastic even
though it doesn't utilize multi-touch
but the pre wolf capacitive screen and
will utilize multi-touch in ton of
different ways so I'm very excited about
it i also like they're sort of synergy
thing they're talking about which
essentially pull in contact from all
your different online clouds so you know
Gmail Yahoo were ever it'll put in all
of your contacts and keep them organized
and we want to reply to an email it'll
keep everything sort of in a single
mailbox so you can choose to reply
from any Account really thought having
to go back to different mailboxes they
know the iphone has a similar feature
but the pre seems to be a little bit
more elegant implementation of that so I
am quite excited also webos like i
mentioned that multitasking makes you
say these cool little cards essentially
you get a stack of cards you can flick
through and each card represents a new
application or prosecutor running I
think it looks really cool also the art
can have their own version of the app
store but that's not the only way to get
apps out you don't have to just download
them you can put your own apps on their
developing for the device will be nice
and easy I think one of the things that
I always liked about Windows Mobile was
that it was an open platform and webos
is sort of taking that queue and is an
open platform as well I also kind of dig
having a full tactical chorded keyboard
the palm pre me right now does not have
any sort of on-screen keyboard it
realized solely on its physical keyboard
that slides up from the bottom so I
think that it's gonna be a nice
implementation I prefer if I have a
choice of having a tactile keyboard
although the iphones implementation is
very nice and relatively elegant i think
it really will be easier to have a full
keyboard you know what also like you i
want to see what the hype is about I
want to see if it's worth while the palm
pre was the gem of last CES and it's
supposed to be the savior for palm and
probably the savior for sprint and I
really care see if it lives up to the
hype if you do want to get one you can
go on jun 6 to your local sprint store
but it's not the only place you can go
it's actually launching the same day at
radioshack best buy and walmart sir
privately so you have any of those by
you you can go there and pick up your
palm I know a lot of people are saying
looks like a cool device if it wasn't on
sprint and I can't vouch for sprite
service by you or even by me for for
that I've never used sprint the people i
know that have had it have been
relatively happy i use 18 teen with my
iphone is my primary phone but i am very
excited to try sprint out try out the 3g
network and compare it with phones like
the iphone
and the storm and see how it stacks up
those are really its biggest competitors
and see if it's meant for business users
if it's meant for just a casual user how
the internet browser works how the
multitasking works the processor and the
RAM can handle multitasking and I'm
really excited to get my hands on it and
see how it works and overall I'm kind of
bought into the pipe a little bit about
the palm pre I'm I'm excited about it
and I can't wait to get one to test for
myself so guys are you excited about the
pre are you going to get one are you
going to try and wait in line for one
your think it's worth it are you would
you get one if it wasn't on Sprint's do
like the operating system leave your
comments about the palm pre I'm really
curious to know what you guys have to
say I'll certainly be reading all of
them anyway guys this is jon rettinger
for exclusive content and some pre
updates be sure to follow me at twitter
com on for lakers and then one last
thing i want to mention that is
certainly interesting is the prison
being released two days before Apple's
Worldwide Developer Conference so maybe
palm is trying to preempt a potential
new iphone announcement although would
seem if there are new hardware
announcements at developers conference
that bone take a lot of the press away
and maybe steal some of the thunder from
the storm to only have a two-day leeway
maybe they're banking on Apple not
really announcing anything and palm
really maintaining in the media momentum
that's it going to be building who knows
it was just an interesting point anyway
guys jon rettinger I will see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
