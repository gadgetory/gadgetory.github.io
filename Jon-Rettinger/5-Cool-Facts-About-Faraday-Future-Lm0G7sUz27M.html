TechnoBuffalo here CES brings the
biggest names in tech and they're a ton
of conferences after conferences and
it's hard to steal the spotlight before
the show even began the folks of Faraday
future may have just done that they
unveiled their very first concept car
the ff01 30 features a company you're
gonna be hearing a lot about but that I
run through the top five things to know
about Faraday future
so coming number five who are them
they're a brand new factor on the 18
month old automobile manufacturer
they're based in California they're
building a 1 billion dollar
manufacturing plant in Nevada and
they're backed by Chinese money which
we'll talk a little bit about later on
in the list the common referred to as
the Tesla killer but as of now haven't
released any products just shown what
they think the product line is going to
look like coming at number 4 they're
crazy awesome looking concept car is
called the ff01 it's designed by Richard
Kim who designed the BMW i8 the i3 and
the x1 so the guy knows what he's doing
and this thing is packed to the gills
with technology it's got a thousand
horsepower 0 to 60 time Bender's 3
seconds and a top speed of over 200
miles per hour the steering wheel is a
smartphone mounted halo safety system
that supports the driver is head and
neck and it's got a helmet that feeds to
driver water and oxygen plus the
windshield has a virtual augmented
reality math built right in so as you
look out to the world in the road you
get augmented reality right in front of
you and last but definitely not least it
looks like an electric Batmobile
number three the platform is module when
Tesla first eview their concept model
Wes took them nine years to get that car
on the road Faraday's claiming they
could do that in about half the time so
between five and six years and they're
doing that with a completely modular
platform which has really never been
done to this extent so their powertrain
is called variable platform architecture
it lets them quickly develop and release
cars different sizes battery capacities
and motor configurations from one all
the way up to four so if you want
rear-wheel drive won't wheel drive or
all-wheel drive on each wheel and coming
in at number two this is one of the
coolest things I think about the company
is they're kind of a mystery back at
number five I mentioned that they were
china-backed but we don't know who or
what in China is putting all that money
towards the company we'd get a little
bit of a bigger piece of the picture
this week way down strategic partnership
with Chinese media late Evy headed by
billionaires Yin Tang performance
reported to be a primary investor in
their 1 billion dollar facility which is
also happens to be before it's worth 3
million square foot with remaining and
their funding is still just a mystery my
guess is it just some dude on Islands
and number one and the most important
thing to remember about Faraday future
we have no idea when we're gonna see a
car on the road don't expect to place
your order in the next 12 months Faraday
said they can get a car on the road in
five years but if automotive history has
taught us anything it'll take much much
much longer
we don't know it's bulking at the next
Fisker or the next Tesla we were the way
we should have a better picture sometime
this decade so what you guys think about
Faraday future well they're not we're
actually gonna get one to be on the road
it still yet to be determined but it's
cool to see electric propulsion get a
lot more mainstream attention so next
time John rende Justin TechnoBuffalo see
you guys next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
