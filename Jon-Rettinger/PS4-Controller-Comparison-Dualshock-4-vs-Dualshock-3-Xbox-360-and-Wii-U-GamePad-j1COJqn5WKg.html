our continuing PlayStation 4 coverage
now we are gonna compare and contrast
dual shocks three versus four now we
might even throw in an Xbox 360
controller for good measure so stick
around and let's compare dual shocks
alright so here is the Dual Shock 4 this
is your PlayStation 4 controller it
doesn't look at first glance if you
haven't looked at your PlayStation 3
controller in a while it doesn't look
all that much different with the
exception of this light bar and also the
the touchpad here there's some extra
buttons and things like that we'll get
to that in a second but I just wanted to
show you guys this is the dual shock 3
so this is the PlayStation 3 controller
you want to put them right up on top of
each other you can see the difference
the the handles have been lengthened a
little bit it's a little bit heftier
these feel extremely light compared to
Dual Shock 4 and also honestly this just
feels a lot more solid in your hand and
one of the problems I've always had with
Playstation 3 and I don't know if it's
the same with you but I've always
experienced if you have long gameplay
sessions you get a little bit of fatigue
in your hands especially right here and
your pinkies and your ring fingers but
not so thus far with the DualShock 4 it
does feel a lot more comfortable in hand
also the bumpers have been kind of added
to here so you can see these are now a
little bit bigger a little easier to
mash if you're playing something I do
really like the fact that they've made
this actually concave instead of convex
so your finger fits comfortably there as
opposed to having this rounded sort of
feature on the top of the DualShock 3
there's no real place for your finger to
sort of fit and and it definitely does
on the DualShock 4 so here are your
ports obviously now we have microUSB
before it was just a your little USB USB
mini and now we have a speaker in the
middle and your PlayStation button so
let's do some comparing and contrasting
we've now got a speaker on board the
DualShock 4 this is a touchpad that's
obviously not available on the
PlayStation
threes controller and your start and
select options have been replaced with
options and share so now you have
options as opposed to a fully dedicated
start button and then share is now your
new your for sharing so one of the cool
features of the PlayStation 4 is it will
actually record all of your gameplay and
when you get the share button it will
make a video of your previous 15 minutes
of gameplay and you can share that
online which is a pretty cool social
media feature that we are dying to dig
into we picked up Killzone so we're
gonna dig into that later today the
buttons are a little bit closer together
here so you can see the the actual
circle and all of your buttons and your
d-pad have made just a little bit
tighter so these are tighter in and
these are tighter in no no giant cross
in the middle of your controllers
anymore they've decided to do away with
that design which is a okay by me your
analog sticks feel a lot they feel
really solid they don't feel sticky they
don't feel but you know maybe I'm just
forgetting what it felt like to hold the
DualShock 3 in hand when these first
came out over a decade ago I can't
believe it's been that long
here is your external and your headset
plug in and then on the back obviously
not much going on here again the light
bar supposedly as far as we've heard you
cannot actually shut that light bar off
which might be a little bit unfortunate
but we'll see how that does I actually
like the fact that the options and share
buttons have moved sort of a little
farther away from the middle here I
think this is better used real estate
but we'll see if developers really take
advantage of this touchpad I'm very very
curious to see how that comes into play
especially with indie games I think
that'll be really really fun so let's
compare so we've compared the DualShock
3 to the DualShock 4 let's bring in the
Xbox 360 controller because we don't
quite yet have an Xbox one controller
you can see here is the difference it
actually almost has the same silhouette
on the sides here like if you really
look at it they almost look similar
right here on this on the sides which is
very interesting considering a lot of
people really preferred the Xbox 360
controller the slim
not the original giant one that we all
know and love or loathe if you're me I
thought that one was way too big but
this one the the slimmed down controller
I think is a really great great
controller so it's nice to see
PlayStation sort of taking maybe a
couple of cues from the xbox360
controller and designing thusly which is
pretty nice so here is our xbox360
controller not not too different and
then of course just for fun and in
comparisons purposes because this is
next-gen here is the Wii U gamepad
obviously completely different than
anything that you're gonna see on the
Xbox one or the PlayStation 4 but to be
fair you can do remote play on the
PlayStation 4 so I guess well we'll give
it a pass but yeah very obviously very
different if you haven't seen the Wii U
gamepad compared to the Dual Shock for
it that's what it looks like which is a
little bit nuts but yeah that is our
that is our very brief controller
comparison of next-gen controllers and
almost we don't have the Xbox one so
unfortunately we couldn't do a full
three device comparison but we will be
checking out the Xbox one controller
next week so that is our DualShock 4
