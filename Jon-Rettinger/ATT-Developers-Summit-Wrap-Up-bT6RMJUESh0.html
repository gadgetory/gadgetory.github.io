coverage what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here we're
in the bowels of the venetian hotel at
CES 2012 18 tease developer summit just
wrapped up and they announced a ton of
new stuff you probably saw it all on
TechnoBuffalo calm if you're watching
the livestream you may have seen a
familiar face host it but I want to
recap everything that got announced so
I'm gonna read all of my notes on my
galaxy note coincidentally which we're
talk about this guy alright so first
they talked about the PS Vita the thing
we've all been waiting for is coming
februari second if you want to get a 3g
enabled version 18t will be carrying it
there are no contracts required for the
data to plans 250 megabytes for 1499 a
month or two gigs for twenty-five
dollars per month and then they brought
the Thunder with the devices may
announce a ton of devices first Sony
took the stage and let us know that they
are getting rid of that Ericsson
branding they're absorbing ericsson the
phones are now going to be just Sony
they announced the Sony Xperia ion
you've heard this phone be rumored for a
right while it's nice to not have to say
Ericsson anymore so the ion is going to
launch the second quarter of 2012 it's
got a 4.6 inch HD display 12 megapixel
camera 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor
Android 2.3 and as everybody keeps
saying Ice Cream Sandwich will be coming
and it will be coming to the ion as well
according to Sony next Sam sucked at
this age and Samsung brought a ton of
stuff first they announced the samsung
galaxy s2 skyrocket HD is essentially
the skyrocket to essentially gets the
initial skyrocket with a newer HD Super
AMOLED display so the specs of that in
case you want to refresher 4.65 HD Super
AMOLED display 1.5 degrees dual-core
processor and it's going to be coming in
the coming months and of course LTE all
these phones are rocking 80s newly
released and in the wild 4G LTE network
with hspa+ on the back side in case you
have fall down or you're not in an LTE
network
next they announced well this guy the
samsung galaxy note is going to be
coming to AT&amp;amp;T wireless and for a spec
refresher it is a monster you can you
even read my notes on the galaxy note
right there it's a 5.3 inch display can
see as I'm reading it I gotta look at it
with you though it's a 5.3 inch display
Super AMOLED HD it's got a 1280 x 800
resolution that's going to be available
in blue or white and sort of a bluish
black and navy blue if you will it's get
exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T and of course it'll
have LTE got this serve don't call it a
stylist s-pen it's not a capacitive
stylus it's not a resistive screen like
you sign on the old windows mobile
phones takes advantage of wacom
technology so you can write doodle and
there's a button that you lie you take
screenshots and do all kinds of other
features these api is for the s-pen are
going to be open so developers can
create new stuff work we're go ahead and
put that back away samsung also
announced the samsung exhilarate it's
made from all recycled materials and
they're bringing LTE to the masses at a
lower price point this is going to be a
sub $50 phone I'm gonna be running
Android 4 inch super amoled amoled is
blind of course I was epic expected the
phone front and rear cameras and then
pant act at the stage and pantech
brought a lot of pantech eNOS and they
brought a ton of devices the first one
was a pantech element it's a waterproof
tablet and I cannot wait to get this in
the TechnoBuffalo offices to test I can
promise you there will be super soakers
and they'll be pools involved someone
claims to use waterproof we got to put
it to the test 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor it's got an 8 inch x vga
display so it's got something called
enhanced tactic feedback it's going to
be three hundred dollars on contract so
relatively lower priced for a towel it's
going to launch January 22nd Android 3.2
on board and about 16 gigs of storage
and then next was the Pantech Burst and
that is going to be available on january
twenty second i ett is doing a limited
time promotion if you can get the burst
and the element for a two-year contract
for 249 bucks you get a phone and a
tablet all rolled into one package it's
got a 4 inch Super AMOLED display LTE
two colors it'll be available in
titanium and ruby red
and then we got away from Android we
talked about Windows Phone and Steve
Ballmer came up on stage and it was so
excited to his Ballmer ways like you
wanted to stay high five everyone and go
around with the tap on the butt guys got
a lot of energy you could definitely
feel that energy and he announced the
talk about the commitment that Microsoft
has with AT&amp;amp;T in the windows phone then
HTC came out and they announced a
successor to my daily driver the HTC
Titan the appropriately named HTC Titan
two on the two and a couple things you
get LTE first of all which is great it
is running mango and you get a 16
megapixel camera on the back or two
places the 8 megapixel sensor that we
had on the previous version so you're
getting a megapixel Thunder thrown in
there the back is a little bit different
got rid of that metal feel it's now got
a soft touch rubber s feel to it so let
me rerun the specs of the Titan some of
its going to be pretty familiar to the
original model so it's got a 16
megapixel camera LTE a 1.5 gigahertz
Qualcomm built processor and that's a
single core processor and the rest of
the stuff that you'd expect from HTC
Titan to that 4.7 inch 4.6 5-inch screen
so you got a lot of real estate 480 x
800 display then Stephen Elop from Nokia
came on and they teased the announcement
of the Lumia 900 which they announced at
their own press conference and that is a
full recap and I can exhale of
everything that was announced today from
the TNT stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo for
all the news and everything that's going
to be coming I am jon rettinger from
