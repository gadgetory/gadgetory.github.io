to you by audible and Hendrick my
imaginary friend this week on
technobuffalo we're going to talk
tablets we're going to talk about the
kindle fire we're going to talk about
the Nook Tablet we're going to decide
whether or not it's a good time for you
to get a laptop we're going to talk
about the console wars whether or not
xbox or 360 is the right one for you of
course we're going to talk cell phones
iOS and Android this that's the Buffalo
welcome back everyone to another episode
of ask the Buffalo i'm your host jon
rettinger and this is a chance to ask me
anything that you want to know from the
wide world of technology if you want to
know why your mom won't let you have a
TV in your room you want to know which
tab what's best for you you don't know
whether or not you should wait before
you get your next laptop this is the
place to be and where you can get your
questions answered this is asked the
Buffalo let's go ahead and get started
our first question has to do with the
mobile side of the world and this comes
from tad hemin tell he wants to know is
the Galaxy Nexus phone that will be
coming out be outdated by quad cores or
is this phone safe from being outdated
for a while it seems like every few days
there's a new flagship Android device
coming out and quad core is coming
NVIDIA has announced their Tegra 3
processor which is not going to have
just four chords actually could have
five chords which is going to result in
better battery life so we're gonna see
them presumably in December first min
tablet world and then it'll start
transitioning out two phones there's
always something new coming out anything
you have that's new and shiny today soon
as you take it off the lot if I can use
a car analogy it's going to be outdated
so the best thing I can say is to get
something that's good for you right now
that you think is going to last you for
the next few years and a few things that
you need to know when you do that LTE is
becoming standard if you're buying a new
phone right now whether you are on AT&amp;amp;T
or they're not you're on verizon you
want a phone that has LTE even if you
don't have
LTE service where you live you might
have it throughout the next two years
and if you're on t-mobile you want to
get a phone that has support for their
4g network hopefully they're 42.4 hspa+
4g network and sprint your kind of left
in a limbo they're not really going to
have wimax around for the next two years
but it's still kind of here as they
transition to LTE so for sprint you want
to get a phone that's going to be good
for you now and hopefully we'll have
fast enough data speeds over the next
two years so to answer your question yes
the Galaxy Nexus is going to be a
tremendous phone and yes it's going to
be outdated in the spec department but
specs don't make the phone the user
experience does an Ice Cream Sandwich
the version of android running on the
Galaxy Nexus was made just for that
device you're gonna get a tremendous
user experience so even though phones
may have better specs they may not
outperform your shiny new phone our next
question comes from user Eric the flash
who asks such I would try and say with
an accent if I could do accents I John
when do you think the next Ice Cream
Sandwich device comes out and is a
Galaxy Nexus going to come out and other
carriers b-side verizon so we'll see ice
cream sandwich first come out on the
Galaxy Nexus then we should see it on
several of the devices going into 2012
for the first few months so the second
part of your question there will be a
Galaxy Nexus available for other
carriers but not necessarily released by
other carriers and if I could explain
there's going to be a version using LTE
for verizon but there's also going to be
a Penta band unlocked gsm version and
that's sort of fancy tech jargon what
that means is that if you are on AT&amp;amp;T
you're on t-mobile or you're not really
any network that uses a sim card you
could pop your sim card in there you can
get 3G speeds so what you might not be
able to walk into an AT&amp;amp;T store at least
not yet and pick up a Galaxy Nexus
you'll be able to buy one unlocked from
a ton of retailers pop in your sim card
and be good to go our next question
comes from breast and Franco and he
wants to talk about something that we
did a little while back called the
console wars he's asking is there going
to be a new episode of the console wars
case you want to know what that is it
was an epic 12 round battle between the
xbox 360 and the ps3 as they clashed
head-to-head as we declared a winner and
a winner was declared in season 1 and
season 2 it was the dawn of motion
controls and we compared the Kinect and
the PS move and a winner was also
declared since that has ended there
hasn't been a reason to bring back
season 3 of the console wars quite yet
we don't want to do them just for the
sake of doing them we want to make sure
there's something interesting to discuss
so as we head into III in 2012 and
presumably we start seeing new consoles
get announced released like the Wii U
and hopefully the next generation xbox
360 and ps4 the console wars will come
back much like a mighty bear it's
hibernating but it will eventually wake
up again so hopefully that helps answer
your question our next question comes
one of my friends who actually I met at
the London meet up that we had just a
few months back this is luis hollis who
asks do you think apple will bring out a
7 inch iPad to compete with the kindle
fire so if you guys are tech fiends or
you just like to keep up in the tech
world you'll know that amazon released a
fire on the world today this is not the
BlackBerry PlayBook this is in faculty
kindle fire that came out to this week
depending on what day you're watching
this video it is a 7-inch tablet that
uses amazon's obviously really robust
digital distribution system to bring
content to your device for TV video and
of course for books but they're not the
only 7-inch competitor on the market
barnes and noble not want to be left out
announced and released their Nook Tablet
2 very nicely say with the Nook Simple
Touch and the nook color there have been
rumors of apple releasing and iPad Mini
or iPad micro ever they might want to
call it of the 7-inch variety and
actually that was claims that we heard
get validated in the Steve Jobs
autobiography Jonathan I of one of
apple's lead designer so they laid out a
ton of different screen sizes and Steve
Jobs picked this size that he liked
eventually ended up being a 9.7 inch
screen so other sizes do exist you've
heard rumors and grumblings
Apple is thinking about releasing
another model the answer that I have to
say to you is I think if anything the
ipad screen going to get bigger not
smaller I think we're going to see a
widescreen format iPad probably a 10
inch screen coming out zoom bleep with
the ipad 3 I do not think we're getting
smaller in a 7-inch space I don't think
that's a really a niche that Apple wants
to compete in so hopefully that helps
answer your question and speaking of
silly transitions let me go ahead and
take a minute to thank our friends and
sponsors the folks that keeps the lights
on the camera rolling and food in my
belly I want to thank audible.com unless
you've been living under a rock chances

appreciate it and you're getting a
really cool product in return so
audible.com our next question comes from
users splat he asks Apple's MacBook Air
received an update recently and with
news of the upcoming 15 inch super thin
laptops coming next year do you think
the macbook pros will receive a major
facelift soon I you may be referring to
the ultra books that are coming out now
they are super thin pcs that are sort of
reminiscent of the macbook air the
15-inch model 8 referring to may very
well end up being a macbook air line and
may perhaps drop the macbook pro moniker
from the line so presumably we're going
to see thinner sleeker probably
wedge-shaped 15-inch MacBook Pros if you
want to get a macbook pro as a disk
drive now is the time to do it so I'm
just guessing that we are no longer
going to see those disk drives be
present we saw them leave in the macbook
air lime and I think we're going sounds
like a like an airline MacBook Air Lines
if you imagine flying on MacBook Air
Lines I bet it would look super modern
be like flying in a giant IKEA but I
digress I think we're going to see a
15-inch model very reminiscent of the 11
and 13 inch macbook air models that we
have right now just larger so hopefully
that helps answer your question thank
