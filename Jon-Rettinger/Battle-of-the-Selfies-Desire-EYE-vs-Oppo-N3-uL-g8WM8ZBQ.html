to you by lynda.com what's going on guys
the markings hanging from TechnoBuffalo
and today we've got two devices to
highlight how drastically camera quality
has progressed over the past few years
the oppo n3 and the HTC Desire I will be
giving you guys our thoughts on camera
performance indoor/outdoor shots
low-light front-facing cameras video and
lastly which one we prefer more so let's
go ahead and get started the HTC Desire
eye features a 13 megapixel camera in
the front and the back each paired with
dual tone LED flash to give your photos
the right color temperature when using
flash the oppo n3 on the other hand
features a motorized swiveling 16
megapixel camera that looks quite unique
that's paired with a dual LED flash not
dual tone unfortunately the HTC Desire
eye also has a dedicated camera button
which we don't really see on the oppo n3
but in terms of video both are able to
film in 1080p and 720p
unfortunately no 4k video recording is
available for either the oppo n3 also
comes with this thing this is the okk
click it's essentially a Bluetooth
wireless shutter button for the n3 and
you'll also be able to rotate the n3s
camera by using the 4-way button on the
Oh click which is pretty cool
moving on a camera performance there's
not a whole lot I can say in this
department both phones are incredibly
fast launching the camera app on each
phone is almost instantaneous and there
isn't any noticeable lag when taking
pictures which a lot of big phones
struggle with autofocus is good as well
though I did notice that the open was
just a bit slower than the HTC Desire
eye when it comes down to basic camera
functionality like white balance and
exposure I'd much prefer how the Oppo
and three handles that I noticed that in
some cases when I was using the HTC
Desire eye I would run into white
balance and exposure problem which is
quite disappointing White's would
sometimes turn yellow and that problem I
rarely ran into that using Oppo now
putting those problems aside indoor
shots in a well-lit office for example
we're both superb the shots on the
desire eye were definitely more
contrasty than the subtle shots found on
Opel and 3 and the shots are much
tighter on the desire eye compared to
the opposed wider angle lens now I
personally like the more subtle and
wider look produced by the n3 because I
can frame shots better and I can edit
better due to less
photos now outdoors and good lighting
shots were relatively the same however
there's a slight punch to the image on
the HTC Desire eye which I kind of like
now in terms of low-light when shooting
in a dark studio or after the sunset
both aren't that great lack of optical
image stabilization in either devices
really show how they struggle in
low-light shots were noisy sometimes a
bit blurry too and also notice that the
HTC Desire I struggle to focus on a
subject under low-light conditions which
I couldn't replicate on the Oppo and
three needless to say both are okay
they're not the best under low-light
conditions but not a lot of camera
phones are these obviously aren't the
ESL RS but the result still aren't
horrible now let's talk about taking
selfies for a second shall we these two
phones are taking selfies to a whole
different level you've got a wide-angle
13 megapixel on the desire eye and a
swiveling 16 megapixel on the Oppo and
three not a lot of phones can take
better selfies than these two which
snapchatters and instagramers might find
especially useful you've got a
front-facing LED flash to help
illuminate your face and I think that's
what's awesome about these two devices
having the versatility to take really
great photos the photos I got on oppo n3
are very detailed I got the same subtle
look I mentioned earlier and as for the
desire eye photos are wider contrast II
and are sharp although I think images
are sometimes over sharpened so you can
always tone it down under the settings
but if you love taking selfies and want
to be able to take the best selfies
without having to awkwardly turn the
camera around like this these two
cameras are your best bet let me stop
the video for just a quick second and

moving on a camera software in UI HTC
stock camera app is pretty
straightforward there are a few settings
you can turn on or off and sliders you
can move to get the right settings but I
feel like there should be more to tinker
with there aren't any special shooting
modes unlike the oppo n3 and I feel like
the HTC Desire eye is missing that the
oppo n3 comes with a few pre-installed
shooting modes like Auto panorama
expert mode where you can enable manual
focusing or change ISO and exposure
there's also ultra HD mode which will
take 32 or 64 megapixel shots using
software algorithms and be quite honest
I don't see much of a difference in
quality of in file size now other than
those shooting modes you can even
download a few more for free including
raw double exposure in super macro mode
just a thought of shooting raw on a
mobile device is pretty crazy to see and
seeing that on the Oppo definitely shows
an advancement in technology now having
RAW files will definitely eat up your
storage space and will take longer to
edit but if you're really in a
photography you'll be able to do more
with your photos shooting raw you'll be
able to get back the highlights mess
with the shadows and mids and many more
now in terms of video both will be able
to shoot in 1080p at 30 frames per
second and nothing more I noticed that
the autofocus during video doesn't work
as well as other Android devices and
tried like the Nexus 6 LG g3 or the note
4 also now having 4k video is a bit of a
letdown considering these two devices
are more than capable of shooting 4k
needless to say if you're more into
video and not into photography then you
are definitely not the right phones for
you
so at the end of the day I believe the
oppo n3 is the far better camera phone
here from my personal experience I found
it to be more versatile than the HTC
Desire eye just because it offers more
of an exciting shooting experience it
offers a ton more shooting modes that I
can see myself using on a daily basis
oh and come on that's woven action HTC
Desire eye is an awesome phone as well
the 13 megapixel camera is good enough
for the average person and I personally
would rather have the two dedicated
cameras instead of the motorized
swiveling one just because I'm scared
the motors inside the camera module
could break in a few years or so but if
we're basing it off of quality then the
oppo n3 is the winner anyways that's it
