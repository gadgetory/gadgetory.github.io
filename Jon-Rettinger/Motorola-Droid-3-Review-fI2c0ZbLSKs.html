TechnoBuffalo here with a full review
for you of the Motorola Droid 3 if
t-mobile's g1 assured us into the
Android era Verizon's original Droid
brought it to the mainstream
so the Droid name has a long legacy of
bringing some of the best Android phones
out there let's go ahead and see if its
third iteration is the charm so let me
run through the specs very quickly of
the Droid 3 because some stuff has
changed here since we last saw the Droid
first it now has a 4-inch screen with a
resolution of 540 by 960 that's up from
3.7 of the previous generation it's
rocket Android 2.3 it's now being
powered by a dual-core Tegra 2 processor
so that's 1 gigahertz on each core as
opposed to the 1 gigahertz TI OMAP on
the droid 2 512 megabytes of RAM that's
the same on the back it now has an 8
megapixel camera which we'll talk about
at length up from 5 it's got that single
LED flash now that's not the only camera
on here though it's got a point 3
megapixel camera on the front and the
rear camera that we just talked about
can shoot 1080p video at 9:20 by 1080 so
of course that's 1080 at 30 frames per
second it's got 16 gigs of storage built
in there is a micro SD card slot but
it's not going to come with one at least
the initial rounds that we've seen have
not come with micro SD cards all this
extra package comes a little bit of a
weight at six point four nine ounces are
184 grams up from the 5.9 six ounces or
168 grams from the Droid One all right
all that spec business aside now let's
get to the phone review if you watched
all the videos that I do on phones I
always start out with call quality
doesn't matter what the thing has if
it's not good making phone calls it's
not going to be any use to you as with
most Verizon phones call quality has
been absolutely outstanding on the Droid
3 during my 20 call tests I had zero
drop calls the antenna in here though it
was a little bit weaker than I've seen
on other devices generally I'm getting
five salad bars everywhere I go here I
saw that drop down one to two bars now
certainly using bars as the only be all
metric for signal strength not always
hunt percent accurate but certainly here
in this case it looks like there's
something you want to keep in mind if
you're in a fringe verizon area you
might want to try the phone first before
you bring it home but if you're
blanketed with coverage won't be an
issue
speaker quality is actually quite loud
here through that grille on the back so
if you rely on speakerphone you're not
going to have much of a problem alright
so let's talk about the design because
there's a lot of things they're
different here so of course you've got
that four inch screen you still have
that sort of telltale droid hump that
we've seen on the droid one and the
Droid 2 you've got that same slide-out
keyboard which is not spring-assisted
but now we've got some differences here
we've got a full number across the top
all right if you look at the keyboard on
the droid to go ahead and sort of put
these here top and bottom so you can see
I was not the biggest fan of the
keyboard here on the Droid 2 or the
droid one didn't have much key throw to
it they had the sort of membrane issue
feel it didn't really feel very
comfortable to type on you look at the
keyboard here now on the Droid 3 it
still has that same membrane sort of
feel to it but the keys definitely have
a bit more throw that just means a
little bit more classy and you can see
it's sort of the additional Clackamas
even when you push it you can hear it a
little bit more you can see some of the
animations here on the software to it
we'll talk about in just a moment so the
keyboard is definitely improved here I
didn't find it to be the most enjoyable
keyboard experience out there it
certainly wasn't bad if you like the
landscape orientation for keyboards it's
gonna be a pretty decent option a little
useless to me
as is for wedding navigation certainly
it's better than what we saw on the
droid one but too tough to type on in my
opinion you can also get in doing your
navigation with your finger so here's
the keyboard alright so next let's talk
about the design and the buttons that
the thing has so on the left hand side
microUSB for charging an HDMI out that's
sort of a new addition to look at the
left
sided advice from the droid - you'll
notice that the buttons are the porch
rather have been moved and certainly
have HDMI right down below what I'm
tired and trying to charge is saying I
kept trying to plug the mini USB port or
micro USB port rather into the HDMI it's
right next to each other maybe that's
just me
and on the right hand side there's some
differences here - so the volume rockers
in the same spot but a bit different
buttons direction and we're missing one
button right here for the camera that is
not going to be here
bit of an annoyance actually I liked
launching the camera with a dedicated
button some things you're going to need
to get used to I will go ahead and sort
of push that off on the back things like
a bit different here as well it's almost
a it looks like a more solid piece than
we had here on the droid - chosen to
join one had its own problems with its
backing so here's the - there's the
three you can see it looks a bit more a
bit more solid and the phone feels a bit
more solid and with that cell and this
comes a bit of extra weight difference
and you definitely feel that here with
the Droid 3 it all thing up to your head
doesn't feel bad but you definitely know
they were holding a heavier phone if the
keyboard is something you absolutely
have to have you know then that weights
can be worth it to you if that weights
something that you can do without maybe
you don't necessarily need a physical
keyboard the Droid X 2 is probably going
to be a good phone for you to look at
because both of those do not have 4G LTE
or radios built in but something that
we're definitely going to talk about in
just a few minutes all right so let's
talk now about the software hooray we
have no motoblur at least motorola is
not calling it motoblur obviously there
are some custom skinning going on here
but we didn't have to sign in to any
sort of motoblur account when you turn
on the phones which is always awesome
and you can sort of turn off some of the
features here so there's a lot of
animations on this thing you can see
them when I scroll from screen to screen
when I open up the applications there's
just all kinds of little stuff that go
on here that slows down the speed of the
phone unfortunately not a giant amount
but yes like cognizant that you're
waiting for the informations to finish
while applications can
and let me show you some loading
applications here for example going to
egg with the camera since you don't have
dedicated camera button you go ahead and
open that sucker up there goes there's a
little bit of a lag so phone settings
will go ahead and now you can snap a
picture I'll go ahead and snap something
here tries to focus and then it snaps
so let me there it go so let me just
take a picture of something to give it
maybe more of a fair chance so it's
already been opened
we know it's sort of sitting there in
memory let's go ahead open it one more
time open up the camera application it
goes a little bit quicker let's say I
want a picture of a pen so I'll go ahead
and get that pen in there let's go ahead
and select it so it's not sort of the
fastest camera in the world it's not the
slowest I've been reports so that it was
absolutely laggy in the camera
Department not necessarily true it's not
a speed demon when trying to launch a
camera application but it's not the
slowest either something to sort of keep
in mind also on the software Department
this isn't really unique to the Droid 3
I thought I'd show anyway you have a
totally redesigned marketplace here you
see quadrant which I'll talk about in a
moment did I download and go back home
here's what the new marketplace looks
like kind of neat you can download books
movies games and apps today you can get
all your movies here right on your
device and on that 16 gigs of internal
storage or if you want to get a micro SD
card and go ahead and do that as well I
decided only seen this many times before
so I thought you guys might want to see
it alright so now let's talk about speed
this is dual core Tegra 2 this is all
about speed and all about performance
huge omission for me obviously and
probably for you as well is not having a
4G LTE radio well John you're probably
saying 4G is not important to everybody
well if you're getting this phone right
now and you're gonna lock yourself into
a two-year contract it's not important
to you now but it might be important to
you and say it years or a year and a
half you might not have LTE coverage
where you are right now but sort of as
those two years progress Verizon's got a
really aggressive LTE build-out map and
you might be blanketed in 4G LTE in you
know six months and you might wish that
you had a phone I could do the faster
speeds
so really be aware of that when you're
buying this phone if you don't think
under any chance you're going to want LT
even okay look at the Droid 3 if you
think there's a small chance that you
might want it your best bet is going to
be to wait alright so let me show you
the speed to some applications here
let's see how quickly or slowly things
launch answer to make things fair I'll
go ahead and go to manage apps we'll go
ahead and see what's open here so you
guys can see and see what's running
there we go I can see a ram what's being
used not being used not many
applications you're running most of the
stuff that the phone needs to run all
right so let's go ahead and open some
stuff up and open things that I haven't
opened before it's go ahead and try
something like books boom take your
knives agent turned off we'll go ahead
and keep getting it off so books opened
relatively quickly H opening it again
now it's been sort of stored fast let's
go ahead and open see what else you got
here let's go ahead and map navigation
we can ask you for that stuff but it
opens pretty quickly as is true with
most Tegra 2 devices I've seen things
open very very very fast but you know
how does it benchmark if you're getting
a dual-core phone you obviously care
about speed benchmark certainly isn't
the end-all be-all and quadrant which is
one I use to test might not be the most
accurate testing in your book but it's
consistent with how I test all of my
phones on the quadroon score on this
particular phone is 1670 so by no means
setting the world on fire with its dual
core speed so definitely another thing
to keep in mind alright let's go and
take a look at the browsers and for
talking about speed one of the gripes
have had in the past with some Android
phones is that the browser's been a bit
slow not necessarily slow to load but
slow with panning and slow with pinching
and zooming so we got TechnoBuffalo here
we'll go ahead and do a refresh that's
correct it's a Wi-Fi of course it's been
loaded up here on the past isn't
necessarily a browser speed test of my
Wi-Fi network I just want to show you
that sort of a fresh load all right so
you go ahead and let it finish up here
as its loading generally you should be
able to scroll
and I am not able to do anything there
we go so now I can do my scrolling and I
don't have that need a checkerboard
pattern as I as I scroll along which is
nice and pinched the zoom here
is very very smooth and really modern
Android devices have had much quicker
pinch-to-zoom
seriously as I mentioned how smooth it
it seems to be slowing down so flash is
turned on so it certainly accounts for a
bit of the slowdown go ahead and can see
what that looks like enough even with
flash turned on it's not bad with flash
turned off you're going to get certainly
improved battery life but to talk about
you know get a little smoother
pinch-to-zoom but take my word for it
here that it is very smooth and heals
pretty well here on the screen rotation
times if I go ahead and get on its side
so to rotate there we go rotate you have
to have to ask it nicely and it'll do
its little rotation for you ah battery
Oh Tegra 2 and your battery it is a 1540
milliamp hour battery life and you can
guess what I'm going to say verizon says
you're gonna get nine point six hours of
talktime and 300 hours of standby time
push ah I say to that
push ah if you want to get this phone
you definitely want to want to get
either the inductive charging back for
it so you can just plop it on something
and plop it on with charging pads and
let it charge you don't want to get an
extra battery or carry a cord with you
because battery life not so good let me
give you a synopsis of my usage and
maybe yours might bury I've got two
gmail accounts checking and pulling
stuff in every 30 minutes definitely
making about two hours of phone calls
connected to bluetooth in my car for
about say two and a half to three hours
per day
pretty heavy internet browsing this
phone was dead as a doornail
come about 3:30 so if you don't use your
phone that much maybe you might get
through a full day but definitely don't
think you're gonna get through a full
day or even two days without having a
charge this phone cuz it just ain't
gonna happen
so I recommend this phone there's
nothing bad about the phone there's
nothing screaming saying oh you
shouldn't get this you shouldn't get
that they shouldn't get this but there's
not a lot screaming that says you should
get this phone Ryan's got a really
outstanding lineup Avenged
songs and they have an outstanding event
Android phones even coming out I look at
something like the jury charged LG
revolution those phones that are packing
4G now they might not have a physical
keyboard so a physical keyboard is what
you need and you want those speeds you
know this is going to be a decent choice
physical keyboards what you want they
don't necessarily have to have the dual
core you might want to look at something
like the Droid Pro you're gonna get a
smaller package and you're still going
to get that same keyboard if your heart
is set on this phone its heart set on
the phone for a reason it's gonna be
probably difficult to dissuade you but
you might want to wait until the Droid
Bionic comes at least take a look at it
see what's gonna be worth it to you that
you're gonna get dual-core and you're
gonna get 4G LTE it's really not gonna
have a full physical keyboard and as I
mentioned the keyboard here is not
necessarily the best keyboard I've ever
used it's usable and I know I get a lot
of flack for this something like to be
HTC status here has an incredible
keyboard keyboards bad is usable as a
BlackBerry Bold 97-80 you know in the
blackberry torch and the rest of the
BlackBerry lineup so it's usable it's
fine
for my money I prefer keyboard in the
court be a portrait orientation but you
know that's a personal preference so the
phone's blah it does what you expect it
to do doesn't do it overly well timed it
really bad it just sort of works if you
want to bone that's just gonna work you
want to get your mom or dad a phone you
know decent choice so that's a little
bit of a wishy-washy type type review
for you anyway guys hope you enjoyed I
am John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo leave
all your questions down below or things
you want to see about the Droid 3 we'll
be doing some head-to-head with other
dual-core phones and non dual-core
phones I'll help you make your best
phone buying choice I am John Retton
German TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in
the next video bye-bye
