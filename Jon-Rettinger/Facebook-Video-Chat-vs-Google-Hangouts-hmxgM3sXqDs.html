from TechnoBuffalo calm I'm behind the
camera but there's my google my google
profile and Facebook announced their
skype powered integrated video chat
today google+ came out last week one of
the features is google hangout which is
a audio video chat solution as well so
i've been testing it out with the some
of the other buffalos and want to do a
little run through here kind of
comparing the two services technobuffalo
is on revision3 new episodes every
Monday Wednesday and Friday 5 p.m.
pacific time so first we're going to do
a google hangout you can see i just did
a hangout a little while ago here it is
with Shawn Emily and John Q I am going
to start a new hangout and the thing for
me that's a little bit confusing a
hangout it's basically you know have fun
with your circles using your live webcam
so the thing that's a little confusing
for me about the google hangout you have
to have their their extension their
their audio video package installed
which I already do so that's fine i'll
check and make sure my mic works hey
there i am you there's this camera
there's my webcam i'm just using the
macbook pro here built-in webcam
built-in mic so we're all good the thing
that's a little confusing here is you
have to you can't just invite an
individual person or if you can i'm not
sure how to do it it's not a parent you
have to do a circle so i had to create a
circle called circle of sean to just
invite at first it was Sean and then I
added John and Emily to it so now I have
to invite them uninvite every one of my
circles because I don't want these
people in it and now I'm starting a
hangout so no one's in the Hangout right
now and we will see so I'm in the
Hangout and we will now see if these
other people join the hangout or not
because what happens is this posts on
see no credits is hanging out it's in
the stream so if you follow me on
Google+ you'll see in my stream that
hanging out but I don't know if these
people know so make sure they know all
right so Sean just join the hangout
there he is down there so you've got my
video window and Sean's video window and
who's the third Oh Emily's here alright
so Emily's going audio only because
emily is actually under the weather
right now and you know that's that's
understandable Emily how you feeling
help see there you go as if we needed
proof now when shawn says something the
window will automatically change to show
Sean's video stream so the video quality
you know it's all right i can tell
Sean's got a book in the background
there but i don't know what the book is
on the book on top of the stack of books
there what's that book it's nice i could
use that my goodness um you know the
video a little tiny bit pixelated but
not too bad Sean how's it look on your
end now Emily you have your camera
turned off but can you see us I can't
see this you're a lot more pics later
than sean is that interesting well
there's not much to see here anyway now
in the Hangout you also have these these
tools on the bottom you can invite more
people and when you hit invite so I can
hit the button I can choose a stray a
circle or i can type in an individual
person to invite them and it will go
through my gmail address book I can hit
chat and now there's a group chat and
i'm going to send a message it says feel
better em with a little emoticon i'm
going to do an emoticon of a
the tongue sticking out oh it's animated
isn't that cute and then I can also put
in a YouTube video if I want so go to
youtube and we'll search for ask the
Buffalo and I can hit Search and
searches and look it's John sees you
wearing a tie in this video now what's
happening on your end are you guys
getting the video automatically I got a
notification edits edit and is it up to
you whether or not you want to switch to
the video or to switch automatically
know is watching video do you want to
watch the video say yes or no gotcha but
Sean you still haven't gotten it I got
it once i right so are you seeing the
same video I am what video using
terrific I don't know what the answer
that question is but that's okay so now
i'm clicking out and i can also you see
that the window changes automatically
but i can just if i click on myself now
my window will stay up there and i can
leave it up there for as long as I want
and then I can click again turn it off
and it goes back to auto auto switch so
there we go we could invite somebody
else but I think you guys get the basic
right now let's see if our man our man
John kwachas around ah just to see what
happens to the quality when we had here
we go so junky is coming on in we have a
fourth member of the chat with a hey
John you're live in a wood paneled room
John
chances are you guys talking yes yes we
are
alright so I you know some bugs in the
system I don't know maybe I'm maybe the
more awesome you are the less quality
you get because Emily's voice sounds
clear Shawn's video stream is a little
bit pixelated John Q can't hear us but
everything's working fine for me which
would you know we should back up the
theory that the left I I can hear now I
just had to change them wait speaker
settings you can hear now yeah but it's
coming through my verses but you have
some kind of crazy outboard rig set up
there not you hey on oh wait I can't
show you because it's not it's not
letting me use my webcam well as I would
have been able to show you it's pretty
cool so I'm just on I'm on I'm on a
macbook air using built-in webcam
built-in mic built in speakers uh Sean
when you use them and Emily your webcams
off by choice and junk you I'm on a
27-inch imac using the default webcam
not by choice because it won't let me
use this guy and audio is coming from
this guy running into a mixer running to
diabetic but it's not letting you use
the speakers you want to use of course
not notice I'm be here wearing those
headphones plugged into the imac or
they're there through the mixer also
plugged into the mixer gotcha alright
cool um okay so there's a look at google
hangout the whole invite system a little
weird or just sort of you have to be
logged into to google+ to see it on your
stream but then you can invite people
manually via email address if you want
but it's just a little bit wonky are
just take some getting used to at least
anyway
a guy has to again my setups a little
weird but I have to open up settings and
have to keep the settings windows open
so wait for me to get my video to work
at the moment interesting all I see is a
little mini Noah mini Sean a blank Emily
myself so you're not you this area for
you this the big window is covered by
settings I'll do that on my screen so
people can see what he's talking about
does it pull it up yeah it's up now
because now all people you know all I
see is a big clear image of myself and
nobody wants to see that no all right
you're nice alright cool so thanks
everybody for testing and Sean I'm gonna
I'm gonna facebook video chat you so we
can now we can try that out alright feel
better I'm by alright so now we're going
to go over to Facebook
okay sean is available so i'm going to
call them
and I already went through you have to
install a Java app it's like a plug in
there you can see the facebook plus
skype logo then you have to hit start
and I can see myself
Sean it says you don't have a camera I
can see myself in a little window hmm
can you see me I can see you huh so yeah
I'm getting a message that I see myself
and that says sean doesn't have a camera
let's end the call and try again alright
so we'll go back Sean's online and we'll
try it again
hey all right so facebook video you
could resize the window by dragging the
corner and you can't resize remove your
own window when you mouse over the video
window your own preview window gets a
little bit bigger but I can't move
myself and try to move myself just drags
the whole window around Sean are you
seeing and hearing me okay audio pop but
not anything or durable so I'm getting
the sink is definitely off it's it's
still doable we can still you know I can
solve a conversation with you but the
sink is definitely off yes I agree and
now that time it was on so so so be it
uh the you know we talked about this
before the the initiating a call process
a lot of your straight forward on
facebook but it's one-on-one call
calling only right you can't do a
hangout that's correct yeah yeah ah
quality-wise I mean for me it's kind of
six and one half dozen of the other um
for you noticeable difference quality
wise I'm a slight quality difference on
the google hangout there were times
where you would get really worried and
you don't seem to be getting that on
here right that's true yeah you're
staying pretty sharp it's just a matter
of that the sink goes off a little or
your your the frame will freeze for a
second or you know up fraction of a
second and then come back so yeah I
google hangout you're worried pretty
much anytime you did a large amount of
right but there is that blurry yeah it
is okay hey I was trying to be
scientific you know in the testing yeah
all right so there you go kind of a
basic look you know it seems like in
typical Google fashion ah lots of
features in hang out and in google+ for
that matter but finding them sort of the
UI and the the instructions lay
or maybe a little bit you know you could
say unorthodox you could say wonky you
could say confusing you could say
different I guess different unorthodox
are kind the same word with the facebook
video chat you know it's pretty easy to
find that you have to go to facebook.com
slash video calling it's not rolled out
to everybody just yet you can you can
sort of manually install it but once
you've got it installed pretty easy to
use and I actually got a couple of calls
from people before I had it installed
and I tried to accept one and then it
prompted me to download the the jar file
the Java file would install it so that
the facebook set up definitely I think
you know easier to understand and use um
but you don't have you know that the the
capability to do multi person you know
as they call it hang out or you know
conference calling so so there you go
are you gonna are you going to quit
facebook and use Google+ from now on no
I'm not there yet either we'll see
alright cool Sean thanks for the time
get back to work whatever it is you do
over there in that crazy office and I
think most of what you do is wrangle
people like me into meeting our
deadlines that's another story pretty
much yeah all right there you go little
hands on uh walking you through a little
demo of facebook video calling just
rolled out again if you don't have it
installed yet just go to facebook.com
slash video calling and then also google
plus the google hangout feature will
have to try a public TechnoBuffalo hang
out and see what happens if we get you
know more than four people in the room
at one time chaos will reign supreme I'm
sure till next time for TechnoBuffalo
I'm Noah Kravitz that's Sean we'll see
you later bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
