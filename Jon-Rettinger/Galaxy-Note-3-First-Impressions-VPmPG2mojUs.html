are giving our first impressions on the
samsung galaxy note 3 a highly
anticipated phone 5.7 inch screen lots
of things to talk about so stay tuned
after the jump alright everybody here it
is the galaxy note 3 we've been talking
about it we've unboxed it and now we get
to do a hands-on so let's talk a little
bit about this device the one thing that
I will say as a non note user is that
I'm going to grab the pen here I really
like that it's universal I like that you
can put the pen back in the phone either
way I said in the hands on I don't like
how flush this button is and I stick to
that I think it's still just not quite
there I wish it was just a little bit
more tactile or at least raised just
slightly off of the pen surface but it
isn't getting into Air Command I think
that there's some really great features
attached to the s-pen I definitely like
action memo and having that sort of
contextual ability to go to a website or
call a phone number from your notes your
handwritten notes is really really cool
a scrapbooker i think is a really good
idea in theory it's very evernote esque
but i haven't used the phone for long
enough to really decide if that's
something that I'm willing to use long
term or if I want to stick with Evernote
and just leave it at that so it's sort
of a big deal for me to kind of migrate
everything from Evernote over so I don't
know that I would use this in a long
term unless I was really going all in on
this scrapbooker feature on the note 3
as for screen right I don't tend to do
that very often so i don't i don't think
that i will be writing on my screen very
often if you guys do that more power to
you just not something that I'm
interested in s finder is really great
especially if you've tagged a lot of
stuff in scrapbooker this obviously
becomes way more useful the more you use
the phone so the more contacts you have
the more emails you have the more you
know scrapbook things that you've put
into the phone and the more that you've
tagged things you're going to be able to
find more things in s finders so
definitely one of those situations where
the more you use the phone the better s
finder will get and lastly pen window I
actually thought
wouldn't use this out of all the
features in air command I thought pen
window was the one I would use the least
surprisingly I actually find myself
using that more often and putting in I
really like being able to do and I
really like being able to open this and
actually bring up either hangouts for my
chat so it's nice to have that sort of
little chat window there or bringing up
the internet if I'm doing something else
like looking at my calendar so it is
very very handy and honestly a little
bit of a surprise for me that I was able
to use that one of the other things that
I really love about about the note 3 is
the ability to multitask in your windows
so this this sort of second window
feature is just fantastic multi window
is a really really excellent feature so
if we grab messages we can drag it down
here and now we have messages and if I
had something that I wanted to grab I
could copy that could even you know I
can select it copy it and I could just
paste it immediately right in here so my
copy else has already exists so if I tap
to compose a message all I have to do is
just long press paste and there it is so
really really easy to use I definitely
like that feature I like the fact that
it sort of expands itself when you're
using it and then it puts it right back
down here I love obviously that you can
resize everything so multi window really
really great feature on the note 3
especially with the S Pen you do feel
that sort of sense of productivity one
of the things that obviously we've
covered a lot of things in just a couple
of minutes it's really overwhelming if
you've never used a note before having
access to all these features can be very
overwhelming and Brandon and I here at
the office we're joking around that you
almost feel like you need a
semester-long class to understand every
single feature that you could possibly
find on this phone and that's not
necessarily a bad thing it's just there
is so much going on you've got knocks if
you want to protect ie phone I have a
secondary either enterprise or personal
account that you want a little more
protected you can use knocks you have s
health you've got pen
you've got s translator you've got
samsung apps a samsung hub scrapbook
story album i mean there are so many
things so if you have not lived in the
Samsung ecosystem before this can all be
very overwhelming for somebody however I
will say I do like the addition of this
help glossary sort of nice little
encyclopedia to your phone you can look
at the icon glossary it will help you
check out all those notification icons
there of course the new feature section
which is the most important and
definitely actually even helped me in
certain situations I wasn't exactly sure
how to use easy chart to do you know pie
charts and put them in s note pages so a
lot of things in here that are just
extremely I'm not buried but just
granular and so in a lot of features
that you might not even be aware are on
your new note so the help section
certainly certainly handy if you if
you're not used to either a having a
smartphone before because a lot of
people buy these and it's their very
first smartphone so we're still seeing
people get into smartphones for the
first time and this can be very
overwhelming for somebody with all of
the options it has and that's on top of
what Android already offers which is a
very very granular and customizable
experience I love the screen size i
think the screen is beautiful i think
that a 1080p screen while i wasn't a you
know i was a little bit of a skeptic
before why do you need is you know 1080p
screen on us such a small device I do
love it now and I do love how smooth all
the text looks and I really think that
the device itself is really interesting
so anybody looking for a note 3 I think
would be very well served and I don't
think that anybody is going to tell you
oh this is a terrible phone but I
definitely think that it's not for
everybody it can be a little bit
overwhelming especially with the
addition of the s pen and all of its
features if you want something a little
more simple or something you know
without just without the pen obviously
the galaxy s4 is a great choice if you
like TouchWiz and you like being in that
Samsung family of devices but that's our
first impressions that's what we think
of a device after having it for a few
days feel free to leave your questions
in the comments I'd be happy to help
answer
and we're going to be doing a full
review on this beautiful beauty this
beautiful beauty it's sometime soon
hopefully John o is enjoying the phone

device so we've got a lot of people
