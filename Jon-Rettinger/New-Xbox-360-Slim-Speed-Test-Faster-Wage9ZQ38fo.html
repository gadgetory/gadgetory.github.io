from TechnoBuffalo here I've had a lot
of people asking if the new Xbox 360 is
faster than the outgoing model so I
don't give you guys sort of general
speed tests and see how quickly the
operating system works and how fast
things load on it so I'm going to go
ahead and turn it on right now you can
see me push the power button I'm going
to move on up to the TV as well as you
can see how quick or how slow the boot
up is when Zumo not just a bit hopefully
this isn't got a death in anyone either
so there we've got the Xbox 360 load
screen and this is connected via HDMI if
you thinking buddies wondering and this
feat of the operating system tends to be
pretty zippy I think maybe a little bit
faster than what I saw on the outgoing
elite model up nothing giant so I'm
going to keep pushing the UP button here
and let's see how fast things load that
doesn't appear to be any lag whatsoever
so let's check how fast or how slow a
game is going to load so I have a Call
of Duty in there I haven't loaded onto
the hard drive yet so it'll show how
fast the game is actually going to load
from the disk let's go ahead and launch
this up we'll play modern warfare 2 you
can hear a bit of console in the way so
they sort of get the whooshing sound of
the disk thing and there is the low
touch it was very quick so let's go
ahead and jump back out of here
how much checks few other things how do
you want exit yes a lot of people have
been asking how are you going to
transfer data from your old xbox to new
Xbox they don't lose all of your time
and effort that you put into your gamer
score well there was one of two ways to
do it first you can go and pick up and
xbox360 data transfer cable which let
you transfer all of your data very
easily I think it runs again Renia in
the neighborhood of 20 bucks you can
also upload your things online Microsoft
said that system is going to be in place
relatively soon so you can upload all
your information then read down
it on your new console a lot recommend
if you can to pick up that cable it's
probably going to be the most trusted
and easy way to go so you can see things
do load very quickly out here I'd say a
little bit faster than we've seen on the
outgoing model but nothing that would
force you to upgrade or really make
upgrade even an option those you
wondering my xbox gamertag is John for
Lakers and yes that is a badass mustache
that I'm supporting right there look at
him looking with that mustache checking
it out what's up so let's go ahead and
check a few other things we'll go ahead
and let's say I will try Netflix for
example though this is internet
intensive so it's going to be varying
based on your internet speed I am using
the wireless built into new Xbox 360 so
I've got some friends definitely are
playing Netflix
and you can see that it does load you
know pretty fast and you can go ahead
and view whatever you like hello again
this is internet sort of reliant program
so it may not be the fairest of tests
again overall this is probably a bit
zippier than what I saw on the outgoing
elite but nothing nothing that giant and
I guys hope you enjoyed I am John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo and I will see
you in the next video for all of your
xbox 360 news as well be sure to check
