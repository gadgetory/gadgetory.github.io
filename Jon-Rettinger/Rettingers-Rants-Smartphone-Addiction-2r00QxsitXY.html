to you by carbonite welcome back to
their pursuit of retina shred sister
show where rant and rave on anything
from the world of technology and
sometimes outside of it of this week I
want to talk about social etiquette in
cellphones and something that happened
to me that I'm guessing happened to you
this is retinues rants I'm gonna get my
rent he's in a bunch let's go ahead and
get started
last weekend I met up with a few friends
there were six of us in total some of us
we haven't seen each other in years we
always would be really close we met at a
restaurant sat down with a ton to catch
up on and immediately people started
taking out the phone
some put them on the table some were
checking text messages Facebook whatever
it might be checking in on Foursquare
while we were sitting there and I looked
around and I noticed everybody else is
doing the same thing
we went to go see a movie and people
were walking around and checking their
cell phones and it wasn't that I'm
especially boring which I know sometimes
I can be but cell phones are taking over
social interactions and I am as guilty
of it as the next guy it wasn't anything
I was really aware of until I saw others
doing it and it's such a crazy thing for
me because I know in my industry talking
about phones and Technology I am
probably totally perpetuating this thing
about always being focused on your phone
and I realized anywhere I go I always
got my hand in my pocket him I'm looking
down you know I'm checking in I'm doing
something on my phone I realized there's
less and less time for social
interaction when I wake up in the
morning first thing I do is check my
iPad when I go to bed at night last
thing I do is check email when I'm out
and about I want to check in on
Foursquare I'm checking in on Facebook
or whatever it might be I always have my
phone in my hand and I'm wondering at
what point that happened it's gotten so
bad for me personally with electronics I
sometimes you feel like a phantom
vibration in my pocket like my phone is
ringing and I'm constantly you know
checking it and I can't be alone on that
so what can we do to fix it how can we
step away from technology for a few
minutes early says some sort of social
grace so he came up with an idea that I
challenged you guys to try X hang out
with a bunch of friends everybody
stacked their cell phones stack them up
face down the first person to check
their cell phone picks up the tab
wherever you guys are that will make
sure that people sit and enjoy each
other's company and technology takes a
backseat once no one really has got to
make
phone calls really got to check Twitter
they can do it but they got to pick up
the bill if we routed a bar you know
whoever picks up their phone next picked
up the next round drinks take your own
variation on this we found that when we
did it we didn't touch your cell phones
for two or three hours and everything
was enjoyable experience to get to talk
and get to catch up again hear what's
going on with our lives and you know
some of us are married some of them have
kids they seek you everything that was
going on in our lives and I missed that
yet I can remember distinct moment going
out with my wife going to see a movie
and not checking my cell phone not
worrying that was gonna ring or
vibrators to her just it was a phone it
was in my pocket if I had to make a
phone call how'd make a phone call if
I'd had to make a phone call I wouldn't
touch it and I can't really remember
exactly when that became more the
smartphone became so ensconced as part
of my life you know if you can talk to
somebody and they're looking down at the
cell phone while they're talking to you
or Teddy and text message it's rude and
I didn't realize that I did it as much
as I did until I looked around and saw
others doing it so sort of a moment of
self realization light bulb over my head
kind of thing where I realized I need to
change something about how I interact so
I challenge you guys to if you fall on
the same thing as me if you check your
cell phone way more than you should you
think about your cell phone if you see
an axe it in front of the first thing
you think to do is take a picture put on
Facebook and not call 9-1-1 then you got
a problem let me step aside from my
