technobuffalo here at the head tag
comparison of two tablets look the same
on the outside but are different on the
inside we've got the new iPad here on
the left and we've got the ipad 2
sitting right there on the right we're
going to put these two head-to-head and
decide whether or not upgrading is right
for you or whether they're not picking
up a new iPad is going to be the right
call for you to make let's go ahead and
get started so just to reiterate we've
got new iPad here on the Left ipad 2
here on the right let me go ahead and
show you a few things photos are the
only application open on each and
brightness is currently set to max on
both just so you can see the difference
as I go through and talk go ahead and
close both of these guys alright let's
go and talk about screens screens are
the main difference here on both iPads a
lot has been made about its resolution
airy display and that is of course the
retina display at the resolution of 240
8 x 1536 double the resolution found on
that guy the iPad 1 alright so
resolutions higher what is that really
gonna mean to you let me go and show you
a few pictures and show you a few
examples of what the screen is going to
mean so we'll go ahead and open up
pictures and there's a picture one of
the cutest puppies I know that is Lucy
and right off the bat you see a
difference between the brightness and
what these things look like again both
set to max brightness I never thought
the screen on the ipad 2 was
particularly dark or dull but certainly
looking head-to-head you can definitely
see a difference it's akin to going to
your local big box store looking at do
televisions you look at a lower
resolution television right next to a
higher resolution television you can see
a difference when the next to each other
if you take that lower resolution set
home it's going to look fine up on your
wall that's certainly the same thing
here go ahead and zoom in on that little
smoochy face again you can start to see
a bit of difference there as well let's
go and take a look at video since these
are video powerhouse machines and see
what video looks like I'm both so we've
got an episode of deadwood here cued up
let's go ahead play and it's the ipad 3
on top and the ipad 2 down below volumes
been turned down here and you can see
the difference there as well same thing
we saw a picture on pictures it's
definitely brighter and certainly more
crisp when you're looking at HD video
especially you look at them side-by-side
so video certainly the new iPad as
expected looks better but nothing Giants
certainly alone not a reason to upgrade
all right so next talking about screen
let's go ahead and talk about texts
since might do a lot of reading on here
whether it's books or web so we're going
to open up safari on each now let's go
ahead and load up technobuffalo calm on
both and we can see what's text is going
to look like and how things render so
we'll go ahead and start right up where
the first article begins and again the
brightness you can see the same thing we
saw on pictures if we go ahead and click
on an article so so you'll hit the rovio
one for example text is one of the areas
we really can see a noticeable
difference here let me go ahead and
scroll down to where we see text if you
can see a difference there on camera you
know oftentimes all the stuff that I'm
talking about doesn't always translate
that well from camera to whatever you're
viewing but hopefully be able to see the
finest of the font they're looking at
both of them so there's that but what
about apps we all play games we all use
the iPad for all kinds of fun stuff it's
going to take a look at one of the most
graphically impressive games that's
around and that is of course infinity
blade now certainly as developers begin
to develop more for the new iPad will
see better graphics come up this guy
does have support for quad-core graphics
let's go and open up infinity blade real
quickly and just take a look at what
that's going to look like on each and
again you probably see a difference
between these two as development
continues and as we're able to take
advantage of the raw horsepower found in
the new iPad but Infinity Blade 2 on
both that one's all right so in this is
infinity blade it's a little bit of a
dark introduction but you can definitely
see a difference here between the two of
these really impressive graphics
especially for a mobile console those
have been a sort of a short quick look
at infinity blade it's going clothes out
of this next cling let's talk about
speed and opening up applications
whether or not there's really a
noticeable difference or not so I'm
going to close everything that was open
just to keep things even and we've got
the same applications open on each
and there's nothing else open their do
the same thing here on the new iPad
living on the left we'll go and try some
sir familiar applications and again as
developers can take advantage of the
horsepower and I graphics capabilities
so assuming we'll see faster upload
speeds let's go and take a look at
something like pages for example it's a
pretty large program let's see how that
opens up on both I can hit him at the
same time so opened up certainly quicker
on the new iPad you know as you'd expect
so there is something to keep in mind
and certainly as I use both I'm seeing
that this does open applications a
little bit quicker pages just being one
of those examples all right so the other
big difference here aside from the
screen is LTE let's go ahead and check
out some LTE speeds both these guys are
connected to Wi-Fi in fact let's run a
speedtest show how quick the Wi-Fi
network is here and I'm going to put a
head-to-head against LTE so if i can
find my speed test app which is right
there well we'll see what LTE is going
to compare it so go ahead and let that
run in the meantime I'm going to turn
off Wi-Fi on this guy go into settings
and turn on LT I'm going to turn off
Wi-Fi so a pretty nice network speed
here go ahead and kick on cellular data
so decently fast a Wi-Fi network here go
ahead make that a little bit bigger
we're getting 15 ish down about 2.7 up
usually we're a little faster on the up
but that's what it's showing so we've
got verizon LTE here let's go ahead and
run a speedtest on this guy and I saw my
speed test app somewhere there it is and
see what we're getting again this is
going to vary depending on where you
live we're in Southern California with
about three bars of verizon LTE let's go
and check out the speeds here so
generally the speeds we're seeing are in
the seven ish looks like we're a little
bit slower today five something upload
speeds are generally pretty good on
verizon's LTE you can see right here
upload speeds are incredible ok so a
little bit slower on the downloader lots
download fashion on the upload that's
great these are just numbers what does
that mean for real life well let's go
ahead and test some real life stuff as
well i'm gonna go ahead and close out
everything that's open here yet again
just keep things even in fair and i'm
going to go ahead and reset cookies and
cache and all that rest of that business
they at least get am hopefully a fair
test so i'll do that here on the ipad 2
and do it all on camera so you guys can
see nothing those shenanigans going on
here will clear history oops clear and
we'll go ahead and clear cookies and
data cleared and we'll do the same thing
here on the new ipad that i keep wanting
to call the ipad 3 safari go ahead and
clear history and will clear cookies and
data alright so i am on LTE here and i
am on Wi-Fi there will load a couple web
page and see how things look going to
open these up and let's go ahead and
load technobuffalo calm on each go ahead
and push it there there and let go and
let's see if we have any sort of
difference despite that big network
speed looks like we've seen the content
first on Wi-Fi and it's done on Wi-Fi
and done just a second or two later on
LTE so still very very fast alright
let's go ahead and take a look at video
for example let's go ahead and jump in
to youtube and see if there's a big
difference here as well we'll go look at
featured do featured here and take a
look at the Prometheus trailer and see
how things load actually take a look the
new angry birds space kind of excited
about that game watching my second lower
second later on Wi-Fi see if that
matters so still playing now here on LTE
so even though I hit that a second later
that's definitely loaded even faster so
LTE is a huge difference here if you do
a lot of traveling like me you're going
to be really happy to have those extra
LTE speeds so certainly something to
bear in mind in my usage Wi-Fi and LTE
have been almost identically as fast and
we sort of saw that here as well camera
big difference here are the cameras as
well the front cameras are equally
stinky but the back is where the
difference
is we've got a 1080p 5 megapixel shooter
we did a video showing head-to-head
video footage and also showing what
pictures look like you can check that
out certainly we saw a difference but
camera on the ipad 2 was abysmal i
absolutely awful anything even me
sketching by hand would have been better
than the camera on the ipad 2 so if you
use your ipad for a lot of photos or
videos or you think you might certainly
an awkward camera to use you're going to
want to consider looking at the new ipad
battery so we've got pretty much double
the battery in here then we've got here
but usage wise has been just about the
same LTE is certainly a bigger battery
drains if we turn that off the
higher-resolution display it's got a
power more pixels bigger battery drain
it's been almost identical generally I
get about nine and a half ish hours on
each I haven't seen any difference in
battery life from a size comparison and
I can get all technical on you the new
iPads a little bit thicker and it's a
little bit heavier can see it's right
there on the right but nothing
noticeable you feel the difference the
first time you pick it up and after that
sort of just become used to it so don't
let any difference in size or weight
worried about you were you a lot of
reports on overheating on the new iPad
certainly runs a little bit warmer but
hasn't caught fire yet for me so let's
go ahead and draw a conclusion what
should you do with the iPads did you
upgrade to do not if you have an iPad 2
it's not worth the upgrade in my opinion
it's only worth the upgrade if you're a
road warrior and you use a lot of mobile
data on your iPad then LTE is going to
be a really welcome addition otherwise I
just can't recommend the new iPad over
the ipad 2 if you have an ipad to the
screen looks nicer but once you have the
ipad 2 at home and you don't know what
the ipad 3 screen looks like it's not
next to you to compare really not going
to notice that much of a difference i
always thought to be on the ipad 2 is
actually pretty solid the camera i don't
use that much doesn't been that big a
difference to me if you're a big camera
guy or girl and you want to take a lot
of photos then maybe consider upgrading
to the new ipad if you don't have a
tablet already in your zagging whether
or not to pick up the ipad 2 versus a
new ipad definitely go for the upgrade
in the new iPad now you're going to get
the better screen you're going to get
LTE and all for you know just a little
bit more money it's sort of tough to
compare these two and give a
recommendation but in conclusion I don't
believe the I new iPads worth the
upgrade if you have a perfectly
functioning working ipad 2 looking to
jump into the ipad market the new ipad
represents a really great value
proposition for my money it's still the
best tablet on the market i'm jon
rettinger and TechnoBuffalo hope you
enjoyed this versus tablet battle I'll
see you guys in the next video do you
agree or disagree leave your comments
