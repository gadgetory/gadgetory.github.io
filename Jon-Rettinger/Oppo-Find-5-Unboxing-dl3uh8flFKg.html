TechnoBuffalo Earth and unboxing for you
of the Oppo fine this is a 1080p pretty
awesomely specs phone let's dig in check
it out see if it something you want to
pick up for the next few years alright
so here is the box for the Oppo fine
don't look at it this way early boxing
the odo it's pretty nondescript
cardboard there's a lot of awesome specs
packed in this guy but I'll run it
through as we unbox it so we'll go ahead
and pull this handy open tab kind of
reminds me of the Kindle packaging very
eco friendly and we've got that open I
think the tab is officially been told
and we've got the Box open boom we've
got some stuff from cui ster at screen
protector that was nice I here is the
phone looks to be on the big side oh
it's a box you're gonna say it's a giant
phone well that makes much more sense
we're commenting on how big the box was
this looks like a little more modern and
fancy and certainly it is very fancy so
here is the Oppo find 5 and some metal
box which you don't see very often at
all 32 gigabyte configuration we've got
some stuff about the Oppo fine it's go
ahead and I think the slides outer opens
its magnetic well this one the fancier
box I've ever opened I'll definitely
give them credit for that look at that
boom all magnet II and nice takes a lot
to impress me in boxes nowadays but
folks at Oppo definitely did so here is
the 5 inch phone with a full 1080p
resolution so that is 1920 by 1080 or
the 441 PPI ban on first blush this
phone feels awesome in the hand very
curious how it's going to preform uh
pull that off boom nice and glossy and
looking all fancy and whatnot so it is
an IPS screen with a full lamination
technology it's OGS it is running
Android though I'm not sure what version
this is shifting with that's been
updated I believe a few times since so
we'll turn it on and check that out and
found its go ahead and turn it on now
and see if it's got enough juice power
buttons on the left hand side
not used to that at all so it's got two
gigs of RAM being powered by the
Qualcomm 8:06 4 that's a quad-core 1.5
gigahertz chip so the suckers got plenty
of power to do Ram either in 1638
configuration it looks like the folks at
Oppo sent us the Big Daddy
32 gigs no external storage though
inherent also it doesn't appear to be
any sort of removable battery so you are
stuck with what they give you a camera
it has one it's a 13 megapixel sensor
that of course can shoot 1080p video and
there's a front megapixel camera our
front camera as well bluetooth 4.0 the
battery in here is a 2150 milliamp hour
fare it's got DLNA and NFC from a height
standpoint it is five point five eight
inches or 141 point 8 millimeters by
2.71 inches by sixty eight point eight
and point three five inches or eight
point eight six millimeters and it
weighs a 5.82 ounces or 165 grams will
say a screen looks really nice alright
so let me show you what lurked inside of
this awesome box I will force myself to
push that phone off to the side for just
a minute we will pull up this little
Oppo tab or the time it says odo there
you go
Oppo tab and inside we've got a little
book if it says fingertips I'm just
going to say that's little too
coincidental so there's a sim removal
tool and a little opal book and looks
like a some NFC tag that's kind of nice
so just a little bit of information on
the phone we've got a very
familiar-looking wall wart a little
white guy it says I make sure I show
that right Oppo and then there's where
your plug goes got a cord is just
standard microUSB and we've got some
headphones so it's actually pretty nice
with my headphones pulling out there you
can see what they look like with a
microphone and volume up and down on
push them back and that is all you're
gonna have in the box now back to the
phone so we unlock it appears to be that
way so the tour here on the bottom we've
got three capacitive buttons here we've
got a menu button we've got a home
button and we've got a back button for
going back on the left hand side is
where your SIM cards going to live it
appears to be Mike
pros√≠m got your power button and
lockscreen button got it very nicely to
find a volume up and down there on the
right-hand side on the top three point
five millimeter headset jack back here
feels like it does plastic balance has a
metal feel to it
and then there is your micro USB
charging port and noise cancelling
microphone so let's do a version of
android we are running here it looks to
be a relatively skinned version go ahead
and go into what I believe is setting
and let's see we got about the phone
let's see what we are running here all
sort of a nice screen that will show you
everything about the phone so there's a
model number Android version 4.1.10 see
an update to 4.1.2 by the time it's got
connected to Wi-Fi and everything over
all this they're really pretty fun let's
take a look at some of the applications
that are built into it I can't really
see what the UI looks like doesn't look
like they did much from getting away
from stock Android for our additional
application so if they did from the
widget standpoint here if I long press
if I get any widget options go home mmm
there we go so you've got all kinds of
Oppo s2 widgets right there so clock
music contacts photos and other kind of
goodness
so something interesting about this is a
sort of a similar respect phone to the
drug DNA but as opposed to using Beats
Audio this use something kind of similar
actually is found in rolls-royce cars
it's called Dirac HD so very curious to
see how the audio sounds coming out of
this guy those been a very first look at
the Oppo find 5 of course we'll do a
full review let you guys know what we
think about this phone but in a first
blush it feels really substantial
definitely has a premium feel to it
anything you guys want to see though be
sure to let us know and leave your
comments down below I'm John Ritter from
TechnoBuffalo please give this video a
thumbs up we most definitely appreciate
it I will see you in next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
