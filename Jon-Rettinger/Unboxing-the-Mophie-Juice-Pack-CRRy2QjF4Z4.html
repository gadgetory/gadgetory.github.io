lakers calm here with an unboxing for
you of the mophie juice pack it's a
battery extender for the iphone 3g the
folks at mophie were kind enough to send
it over so i'm gonna unbox it use it for
a few days and let you guys know what I
think see you the next one bye alright
guys let's get to the unboxing and see
what's included looks like it's just a
recyclable mophie box comes in just
brown cardboard nothing terribly
exciting so let's see what's inside the
Big John for lakers knife make it
another cameo and open this up alright
we've got some shipping and PR
information a little bit about the
device mophie juice pack let's see what
else we got here
all right mophie loves you well that's
nice thirsty wow that's rats almost like
a prison that's always fun it's going to
open us up alright mophie juice pack for
the iphone 3g a little bit about it
double your power smart battery
lightweight thin design non-slip comfort
grip mini USB charge and sync this
should actually be a very cool really
looking forward to giving this a whirl
so let's go ahead and open her up a
little seal the tops will open that
again let's thank you to the folks at
mophie first go ahead and setting this
over and give me a chance to review it
for you guys slides right out there so
it's like down below there's a USB cord
let's see what we got like it's a mini
USB cord and then the device itself pull
that back like this it also double as a
case and there was some information
inside the juice pack user manual all
kinds of stuff we'll take a look at it's
a big skull and crossbones there what's
that for read all instructions in
warnings poof ominous okay so here is
the device it is just a battery
extending pack essentially what you do
is you slide your iphone 3g right in
there it connects and it will charge
before and also it's got a mini USB
pass-through so guys I'm going to use it
charge it see if it works as advertised
it's got a little LED light on the back
there but you know it's charged which is
pretty cool make sure you know what
let's live on camera let's go ahead and
pop it on and just see how it works i'll
discuss it more in my review but just
for fun let's see how it works
I'll go ahead and slide it right in
there makes a connection so I got a
missed caller and it's letting me know
that my iphone is charging which is
pretty cool and it really doesn't seem
to be adding that much bulk or weight
looks like something like this might be
perfect for long airline flights or for
going out of town on a bus or something
really need the extra power but it is
very nice and it's got a nice heft to it
but again I will reserve my opinion so I
get a chance to review it and see how
much it extends a battery life or
whether or not it is useful so guys jon
