TechnoBuffalo here it's an unboxing of
one of the many Kindles coming out of
Amazon's camp this is the fire HDX 8.9
it's got a crazy high resolution screen
it's got a ton of new processing power
it's got a lot of new tricks under its
hood let's go ahead and open it up take
a first look and see if it should be the
tablet to be in your bag I took here is
the box for the Fire HDX eight plan the
folks Amazon also send us a ton of
accessories then if you stick around we
will take a look at at the end of the
video so here is the box to the tablet
it's got the Fire HDX on the front Fire
HDX on the side some pictures in specs
and that kind of stuff but you know you
don't have to read because we're gonna
do a video on it I've been a really big
fan of the Fire tablets and I still
maintain these are the best tablets to
get your parents or grandparents just
because they can call Mayday not have to
ask you how do I connect to the internet
and no joke this is what I got my dad
let's go ahead and pull the tab and that
is a pretty easy unboxing experience
pricing on this guys are gonna start at
379 for the 16 gig version goes up to
494 for 64 gigabyte versions also a 32
in between get it with or without offers
and with or without LTE wow really thin
I'm actually surprised how thin this guy
actually is shoved aside for a real
quick second I'm gonna tell us a little
bit about what it's got on it but you
know we're gonna figure that out on our
own we've got a microUSB cable to this
point you can guessing you guys already
have like 80 of these laying around we
also have a wall wart same thing I'm
guessing you've got an equal number of
wall warts laying around as well but if
you don't Amazon provides e1 which all
that stuff off to the side and let's
take a look at the tablet itself all
wrapped in plastic one of my favorite
things about my job is take things out
of plastic I know that sounds trite but
I love doing it it's so much fun I still
get that same excitement as I did the
very first time I unbox something dig it
out of here come on I can just tear it
just gonna just play it kid on Christmas
thick oh my gosh
Nintendo 64
here is Kindle Fire attends a Kindle of
Fire HDX 8.9 looking very svelte I went
on a diet
probably the same diet campus as Kia
hamsters and really Finn's go ahead and
power it on and I'll run through all the
specs this guy and there's a lot of
specs crammed under the hood here so hey
smile Amazon logo so you are looking at
an 8.9 inch screen if you couldn't guess
mat 8.9 and the name of the really high
resolution it is 2560 by 1600 if you can
do quick math that is a 339 pippi which
is a lot of pippy's it's also a 30% more
pixels than the iPad air 2 in case you
are wondering this thing comes in at 13
point two ounces so the Fire HDX 8.9 is
lighter than the already superlight iPad
air 2 in case you were wondering you got
this guy all set up and the screen is
gorgeous I mean as it starting to be the
case with most tablets but this one
looks especially nice and amazon saying
we should have way better visibility in
direct sunlight as well which is really
nice if you're gonna try and use this as
a reader let's say at the beach on a
tropical vacation which you know you
deserve being powered by a tuple 5
gigahertz quad-core processor so it's
70% faster graphics performance with 2
gigs of ram and the adrenal 420 GPU for
quicker gaming and smoother video on the
back of it we've got 8 megapixel camera
you also have a firefly and mayday here
as well so the Fire HDX the first tablet
to feature the Adobe Adams experience
which is just fancy talk for supposedly
transforming the headphone listening
experience by creating multi-dimensional
sound that flows around and above you
that's just a lot of fancy marketing
talk for it sound pretty good with
headphones plugged in but get good
headphones otherwise what's the points
and running fire OS for let's take a
look at fire OS 4 so when my favorite
features I'm just gonna go and pull this
down is Mayday Mayday is incredible
it'll help you set up anything you want
to do you get a person that shows up
right here as I mentioned before it is
awesome for parents so you don't have to
be tech support all the time
Firefly of course here as well that we
just saw first debuted with the fire
phone lets you sort of show anything
that'll spark before we have whole
demonstration on Firefly that we do it's
a fire phone I'll put a link down below
if you want to take a look at that
coverage so a pretty
simple and really intuitive UI here so
you've got the silk browser which is
sort of their browser it works very well
it's pretty quick
does JavaScript HTML relatively fast of
course multi-touch all that regular
standard stuff is here as well
Amazon Appstore which is growing and has
pretty much everything that you could
need at least a version of something
that you can you of course you get
access to Amazon's already pretty
awesome the selection of books movies
and TV shows obviously a mess I'm trying
to push Amazon Prime here for you as
well I can go ahead and see on top we've
got you've got games trying to download
more games go ahead and go back all of
your apps or if you want to download
more apps you're gonna be here as well
either on cloud or a device it'll show
you what you want if you just select a
little tall go right there but a lot of
we'll go ahead and go to device you can
see what comes on here instead of what
I've downloaded in the cloud new icons
here as well
photo importer makes sort of managing
your photos a lot easier so if the
camera UI looks like today you make a
pixel shooter on the back which my
finger was definitely covering it just
like a giant viewfinder you can take
pictures with it or video but just don't
be that guy or gal if you can't avoid it
so everything's broken out here very
nice and neatly on that ribbon on top
all your apps you can show up right here
what we've used most will show up in
this carousel very easy to to use and
navigate through all your books and
stuff you can see things we've
downloaded I have my grandfather has one
of the giant old-school Kindles he's got
my account linked up to it and he is a
very avid reader so I always see new
books whenever I check out a new Kindle
device this has been just a first look
and hands-on with the brand new Kindle
Fire 8.9 same Kindle experience you've
seen and we've loved the Fire tablets in
the past looks to continue that trend
albeit in a way thinner package is
really nice to see Amazon do of course
you've got rotation as well I mentioned
in the beginning that if you stuck
around we'd show you the accessories
that came with it as well here's an hdmi
adapter if you want to click the sucker
to your TV some case options as well of
course there's a ton of third-party
options here is the leather origami case
which is going to be $69 so it's not for
the faint of wallet but it is really
cool so I'll go ahead and show you how
that works
I'll go ahead and put this guy inside of
it so over the years I've had a chance
to put a lot of accessories I had a look
at this guy to see
in solid I just sort of dropped it in a
little bit of a magnetic snap and I
figured I had to push in but you don't
it just holds in like that which is
really super easy
I can tell access all the stuff on the
left hand side of course you've got your
power in charge port right inside
there's three point five millimeter
headset jack on the back you can still
access your volume up and down and the
power it looks really nice so origami
you can do all kinds of fun stuff uh
that you can sort of stand it any way
you want you could turn it you can prop
it up you can do a lot of sort of neat
things with the case so they've done the
pretty good job with it so that's a nice
little compliment to your Fire HDX which
I'm really hard to not say Kindle Fire
HDX they also sent does a external
Bluetooth keyboard which I don't believe
it touches I think it's just sort of an
external keyboard but let's take a look
at it this guy if you want to get it
from Amazon's gonna set you back $59 so
they are more than happy to sell you
accessories this is also going to come
with its own charger so this is serve
its own unique thing it appears with its
own battery pack but we'll see more
plastic
yeah unbox you can go ahead and use the
keyboard and get your typing on of
course you got power and Bluetooth there
as well and I guess anything else you
want to see be sure to let us know about
the Fire HDX if you love Amazon tablets
