here's an unboxing for you of the
t-mobile BlackBerry Bold 9700 this is
gonna run you about $129 after mail-in
rebates and of course a two-year
contract we'll go over some of the specs
as we checked out the device go ahead
and dig in of course using the
obligatory knife it's been unboxing week
over at TechnoBuffalo so we're gonna
keep the trend going with the BlackBerry
Bold this is a our review unit sent to
me by t-mobile
so we've got a picture of the device on
the front you may notice something
interesting about it something we saw
with the new generation of curves these
scroll ball is missing replaced with an
optical trackpad is kind of interesting
t-mobile BlackBerry Bold with Wi-Fi
calling so what's included is on the top
some specs on the back of the box let's
talk about those real quickly of course
it has bluetooth international
capability because it's a GSM quad band
phone it's got a 3.2 megapixel camera
which can take video as well its 3G
Wi-Fi GPS and sort of all the rest six
standard smartphone features that you'd
expect it does have a 1500 milliamp hour
battery so should last you a few days
blackberries are generally pretty
battery's sipping and are relatively
efficient so here we've got the
BlackBerry Bold itself take a look at
that in just one minute let's see what
else is gonna come in the box when you
buy your bold you've got your standard
blackberry wall charger with micro USB
you've got the super awesome
cool guy holster which swivels and is
appears to actually be real leather with
the magnet slide that right in there and
you're good to go
USB connection kit or connection cable
and it's like a pair of headphones with
microphone and then your standard
getting started guides and CD to install
the BlackBerry user tools
so I'll push it that off to the side and
let's take a look at the device itself
so it has a two point four four inch
screen the resolution of 480 by 360
which is a pretty nice resolution for a
smaller screen like I mentioned earlier
gone is the trackball it's found on
older generation BlackBerry's and the
previous bolt replace with this optical
trackpad I have not used this yet so I'm
not sure how it's going to work your
standard blackberry features and buttons
you've got your Senki your BlackBerry
key your bat key and your end key and a
full QWERTY keyboard t-mobile branding
your LED sensor up top and microphone
and speaker on the left side of the
device you've got your charging port and
a programmable hard button on the right
side you've got your volume up and down
that's like another programmable button
on the back you've got your LED flash
and 3.2 megapixel sensor and removable
battery door and it sort of has a fake
leather almost rubbery feel to the back
on the top you've got sort of these keys
that we saw with the first generation
storm you've got a lock key and a
speaker mute or not mute so you can
change your profiles relatively easily
let's do a quick size comparison and see
how this thing is gonna stack up it
weighs 122 grams it does feel pretty
light even with the the battery in so
here is with another t-mobile phone the
Nexus One
so blackberry it looks to be a tiny bit
thicker but not much Julie there's a
size difference although with the
blackberry you obviously get a full
QWERTY keyboard some other phones you
might be familiar with if you want to
get a sense of how big or how small the
9700 bold is here it is with the iPhone
but definitely smaller than the iPhone
it looks to be pretty close in size
maybe a bit thinner than the iPhone and
the final eight last phone that you
maybe want to see compared with is the
Palm Pre in this case it's the Palm Pre
Plus this now of course has a slide-out
keyboard and stacked it is noticeably
thinner
so definitely stay tuned to the channel
and the website for a ton of blackberry
bold coverage I am a big blackberry fan
of long been an admirer of their
emailing capabilities I'm curious how
this iteration of the bold is going to
function especially in the wave of a lot
of very modern touchscreen smartphones
curious to see if the bolds tactile
button navigation can keep up so
definitely check those out and we'll do
comparison videos with a few of the
other devices that you just saw I'm John
render from TechnoBuffalo and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
