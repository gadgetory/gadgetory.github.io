technobuffalo here say that there are a
lot of bad things going on in the world
I think would be a huge understatement
the recent global galvanizing events
that took place just a few days ago is
the earthquake in Japan and the
subsequent tsunami that has taken the
lives of thousands of people and has
affected hundreds of thousands if not
millions more since the event took place
this is not a tech video for him to say
you subscribe for text videos go ahead
and hit pause or stop come back and
watch me talk about something different
this is something that's more important
to me than any tablet more than any
phone or more than any computer I am
lucky enough and fortunate enough to
have a little bit of a voice and a
little bit of an audience and I feel
like I've got a responsibility to use
that voice for the good of the community
and the good for of the world in this
case being Japan so I'm going to ask you
this is a call to action to do whatever
you can to help the Japanese people
they'll be a link down below if you can
afford ten dollars or more please donate
to the Red Cross I know times are very
tough right now if you can't afford any
money to give perhaps you can give your
time and if it's not to help Japan you
know there's a lot of other bad things
going on in the world there are worse
going on there people starving in the US
there's famine in the rest of the world
I'm not even asking you guys to donate
to the Japanese cons but I am asking you
to donate a try and help to a cause it's
important to you doesn't have to be
money again it give you time it could be
something you've got in your closet we
all have something at a premium it
doesn't always have to be money so
please give and help whatever you can
that this is a absolutely global
travesty what's happening in Japan my
heart goes out to the innocent people
who lost their life just like my heart
goes out to the people that are starving
across the world to those that have been
affected by global and national
depending on
country you are in I tragedies there
unfortunately too many to name so I'm
asking you to to help to reach into your
pockets reach into your closets use your
own time your own resources to give and
to help personally I am going to be
donating two hundred dollars which is
the best that I can do to the Red Cross
to help the Japanese relief effort I'll
put a little video at the end of this
showing that donation and I encourage
you guys to do the same make a video
response if you like talking about what
you can do or what you want to do and
again it doesn't have to be money it
doesn't have to be Japan if there's a
cause it's important to you there's
something going on in your region in
your country give it time do it support
there's a lot of bad things going on in
the world and I do still believe that we
can make a little bit of a difference
and you guys I felt like I had to share
this with you I'll be back with plenty
more technology videos i'm jon rettinger
from technobuffalo see you guys the next
one ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
