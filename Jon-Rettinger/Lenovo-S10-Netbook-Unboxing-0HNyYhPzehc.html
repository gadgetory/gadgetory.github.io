unboxing for you of the Lenovo s10
netbook cozy that don't know a netbook
is a subclass of laptops that's ultra
portable a little bit underpowered but
ideal for web browsing for blogging and
for general computing needs like word
processing and such a netbook is a ideal
perfect choice I'm very excited to dig
in and see what Lenovo has to offer here
let's go ahead and open the box up the
tape was already broken excellent all
right here we've got the you Lenovo
IdeaPad got a lot of there's some PR
stuff in there throw that box off to the
side nothing exciting in the PR envelope
so here it is Lenovo IdeaPad let's see
what else we have on the box here just
tell you where where's packages in
Shanghai see if it gives you some specs
on the side here nope just some serial
number some cautions and stuff and
that's about it so let's go ahead and
dig in looks like this was already open
there's probably some sort of public
relations insert in there or perhaps
it's already been a review unit alright
so we open it up and we're greeted with
the netbook itself it looks like a box
here with probably the accessories so
let's take this out yep that is the
computer itself it's very light don't
assume it has a battery in it pull that
off and we'll put the netbook off to the
side here for just a moment we'll come
right back to it Lenovo IdeaPad s9 and
s10 this is the s10 like I said setup
user guide and regulatory notice and I
should mention that this is running
Windows XP and some specs on this it's
got a single core Intel Atom processor
at 1.6 gigahertz it's got the GMA 950
integrated graphics accelerator it's
actually the same integrated graph
that used to be in the old plastic mat
books it's got one gigabyte of RAM and a
10-point two inch WS VGA screen and 160
gigabyte hard drive spinning at 5400 rpm
s so this little tiny laptop is actually
not as powerful as one of the high scale
laptops maybe we've had a couple years
ago so really is actually relatively
capable so we got the books let's see
what we got in the box here and then
we'll get to the fun stuff we have power
cord power brick which is a relatively
standard power brick the three prong
plug is right in and rounding out the
box we have what appears to be lenovo is
extended six cell battery this extended
part right here is the extra three cells
so generally you just get this smaller
portion right on the side let's go ahead
and take a look at the netbook itself
put it off to the side here so if you're
interested in the lenovo netbook and
i'll put a link to lenovo on the sidebar
well run you about $400 with the
extended battery so here is the laptop
itself pull the box off to the side has
some get a sense of how it looks here I
think we've got a little bit of plastic
on top will kill that off so perhaps
this is actually a new you know just
open to insert some things it's got a
kind of a nice red glossy look to it
very nice and it doesn't actually appear
to be that big a fingerprint magnet
which is nice for a glossy laptop let me
tell you this thing is very light so
let's pop in the battery and I will walk
you guys around the device all right you
just put the battery in and you will see
that the six cell battery does extend
out a little bit on the side actually
kind of makes it nice and easy to carry
if you had the three cell it would just
be flush and around on the back actually
it does have a very nice weight to it so
on the side you've got your vents for
cooling you've got actually a monitor
port a VGA port which is actually quite
nice so if you want to connect this
a bigger monitor are you something
larger than the 10.2 inch screen the
integrated graphics chip actually will
be able to handle that so it's very nice
there's your simple power port it was
like it actually has a SD card slot for
hard drive expansion here we have a USB
port on the front of the device
you've got your speaker port right there
with some LED indicators for power
battery moving along the other side it's
like you actually have an expansion port
here on the side as well I'm at the
camera focus there we go she got an
expansion port on the side which
actually quite nice for a netbook this
does not have a built-in 3G card but you
really could put one right there you've
got your audio in audio out your second
USB port and an Ethernet port and this
of course does have Wi-Fi built in a B
and G let's go ahead and open it up and
take a look at the keyboard and it
certainly is a small screen and a small
keyboard but I guess that's kind of what
you would expect from a netbook I'll do
a full review on the keyboard how it is
to type and how it feels
let's just do some general impressions
here keyboards have some nice clique to
it the shift key appears to be one row
up is a little bit strange it does have
a very small trackpad I also believe
this trackpad will support some
multi-touch gestures but of course I'll
have to use it to see and we've got a
left click and a right click button so
let's do a first boot up of us and let's
see what it looks like
this hasn't interested on OS in addition
to Windows XP and I'll demo that a
little bit later but let's just turn it
on and boot it right up into XP and see
if the battery has some charge in it and
I should also mention that it does have
a tiny integrated webcam as well for
video chats let's go ahead and power
this on
there's no guaranteed as a charge in the
battery it looks like there is get the
Lenovo logo and here's where you can
choose to boot into this QuickStart os
power by Splashtop will do a walk
through that later but let's exit it and
boot right into Windows XP let's see how
long the boot time is I think this is
the first time it's booting up it should
booting up boot it up it should be
relatively quick this is my first foray
into netbook certainly I've used many
laptops in the past and netbooks are
really are growing craze
so I'm excited to see what all the fuss
is about Lenovo certainly has one of the
better offerings available your Windows
XP splash screen and there you are it
was a relatively fast food especially
for Windows and we're off so I'll go
ahead and let that boot up and I'll do a
s size comparison to with you guys with
a computer that you're probably familiar
with the 13-inch aluminum unibody
MacBook so go ahead and close this up
give a little Yelp there so here we have
the 13-inch MacBook move these both
forward here so you guys can get a
better sense of how they stack up
size-wise
now obviously the netbook is much much
much smaller the 13-inch MacBook is
definitely small on its own right but
it's looks flat-out gargantuan compared
to the Lenovo let's do it with
comparison of the two you can see that
there is not that big whiff difference
and with the extra battery Lenovo has a
little bit of added weight but that 6oo
battery really I think is a must-have
hey guys this is John Rhett enger' with
the real quick unboxing of the Lenovo
s10 netbook stay tuned for all kinds of
reviews and comparisons and some
head-to-head things so make sure you
stick around for exclusive content be
