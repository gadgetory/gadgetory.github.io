technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
this gigantic box it is the Nvidia
shield I'm really excite a cat this guy
it is the flagship Tegra 4 tablet gaming
console kind of everything crammed into
one let's go ahead unbox it and take a
first look so here is the giant box tuna
vidya shield i assume this is a press
box and not the retail vacuum but we
will see on top you've got the Nvidia
shield logo and it kind of looks like
it's got an iron man helmet inside of it
we'll go ahead and pull off this
gigantic cardboard top and inside oh
that must be the retail packaging there
is a nvidia shield to go ahead and pull
this out that would be what do you
expect to get when you place your order
for 299 nose push it off the side for
just a second it's like the folks in
Nvidia hook us up with a few other
things got a fifty-dollar google play
gift card in there and a 32 gig micro SD
card there's some more goodies at the
bottom we got a nvidia shield carrying
case it was nice of folks we're not
going to break our nvidia shield but
that's not the reason you are here this
is the reason you are here i'm really
excited to take a look at this guy go
ahead and slide that top part off looks
like the box kind of opened on its own
and there is the Nvidia shield go and
pull it out and connect it to some other
stuff push off the side for just a
second packaging here is really nice
we've got some information on the shield
looks like it's a user's guide how to
what everything does and all the trigger
buttons registration and warranty also
in there charging cable it's just a
standard microUSB but this have the
Nvidia shield logo on that's kind of
cool and then just a pretty standard
Nvidia branded wall wart with the prongs
that flip out nothing overly exciting
there this though this is where all the
action happens here is the Nvidia shield
to go ahead and pull this thing off this
guy does a ton of things aside from
being through a full function
android tablets go ahead and pull all
this stuff off all right so let me
remind you what these specs are of the
Nvidia shield you're looking here is a
5-inch screen with a 1280 by 720 display
with a 294 PPI and I'll pull off the
sticker so we can get rid of that let
you know it's a touchscreen you've got
pretty much pure unadulterated android
and i believe it is four point two point
two but there is really just one way the
tech that ounce for point-to-point one
is shipping out of the box here so we'll
go ahead and go home which i believe is
that button right there and again
powered by tiger for it's got 16 gigs of
built-in storage 802 11 n is here as
well bluetooth of course no NFC 3.5
millimeter headphone jack these crazy
awesome speakers and all kinds of other
goodness let's go ahead and talk about
what this thing can do so of course it
can play games I can play games
downloaded from nvidia's tegra zone
which are pretty solid games can also
play PC games that can be streamed over
Wi-Fi and this is still in beta I
believe we're not connected to Wi-Fi yet
obviously boy will in just a second take
a look at some of those you could also
stream steam games from your home PC you
could install emulators and play older
games you can really do almost anything
with this guy in addition it is a full
on Android tablet so really can do
anything on it you can do with Android
and it feels really really nice my hand
feels like a flatter xbox 360 controller
all the buttons have really nice search
and they feel much better to do and I
saw the pre-production unit actually at
WWDC a few months back I'll close this
up and see what else we're going to have
on it there are a few trigger buttons as
well so you've gone to on left two on
the right is your headphone jack there's
a charging port HDMI out and if you want
to expand the storage you can do that
right there with that included micro SD
card it was included in our package not
sure if that's gonna be included in
retail and you've got a fan right there
a little bit of a soft touch feel on it
and feels will you be really nice so I'm
gonna go ahead and connect this guy to
Wi-Fi give it some tests run it through
some benchmarks and see if it's worth
your money it's a pretty reasonable
price at 299 is initially supposed to be
350 but Nvidia said consumers said it'd
be a better price point to deal or
less to give them credit because they
did lower you don't see that happen very
often so very curious to try this guy
out and see how it performs anything
you'll want to see on the Nvidia shield
