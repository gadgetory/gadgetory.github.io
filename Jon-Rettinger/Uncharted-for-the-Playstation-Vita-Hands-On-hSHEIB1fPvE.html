technobuffalo here back again with the
PS Vita line from IFA 2011 we're taking
a look at arguably the biggest flagship
title of the PS Vita it's of course
uncharted golden Abyss graphics here
looks absolutely awesome it's sort of
hard to believe that I am actually
playing on a mobile platform and this is
not a demo this is actually meet
controlling it like a controlled Drake
make them run around and I can thought
it we can make them drop it to a golden
Abyss but not to masticate Steven jumped
around game code controls are pretty
good I'm Jen take advantage of the touch
panels on the back the plate there's not
much touchscreen controls i am moving
around did I can make you do stuff
here's I want to move the touchscreen
but it does of course have a touch me
please see what the graphics abilities
are this game socially sure the sandbox
functionality I can pan around the
camera if we go down to like the grass
for example but I can go down to the
grass you can see the level of detail
there Julie impressive and not something
that we've seen on a mobile platform if
you use the original PSP or we're one of
the seven people like me the bought a
PSP go this is going to look like a
completely different experience are
really really impressive from a graphic
standpoint so jon rettinger from IFA
2011 with a sneak peek for you at
uncharted golden abyss and I know
TechnoBuffalo zone video game editor
joey davidson is probably going to be
drooling all over his screen so Joey
