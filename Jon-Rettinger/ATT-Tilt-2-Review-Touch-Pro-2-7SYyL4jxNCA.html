for you of the AT&amp;amp;T tilt two or the
touch pro two as it's known nationally
or internationally right now pricing on
this is going to run you to 99 after
mail-in rebate and a two-year contract
so if those you that follow the channel
you see me do a lot of comparison videos
with the tilt two I'll put it together
with the iphone I've demonstrated the
browser prowess I've demonstrated
keyboard contacts and how the operate
system works as whole this video is
going to focus on both the device sort
of take out those pieces and put them
together and give some final impressions
so first this is a phone no matter how
good the brows or a keyboard right
anything else is it's got to make good
phone calls and this actually has
fantastic call quality it was crystal
clear on my end and the colors on the
other end of the phone reported no white
Noah is no crackling that couldn't even
tell that I was on cell phone so whether
that was my GT reception or a stronger
radio inside you know has yet to be seen
but at least for me it was absolutely
fantastic and speaking of radio signal
strength was actually stronger than my
iphone 3gs and blackberry bold that I
compared it to where i was getting three
bars of 3g guetta two devices I was
getting four or five with the tilt two
so it definitely was gonna believe that
it's got a stronger radio put in the
biggest call quality and the biggest
call feature of the tilt two that
demonstrated in a previous video is the
speakerphone I think that merits sort of
a rehashing when you're on a phone call
you take the device and you put it on a
table face down automatically activates
the speakerphone on the back and you can
see here this whole area is a speaker
grill highlighted by two speakers and
two microphones and then I'll nekocon
the speaker and it's not just your tinny
speakerphone that you're used to on most
cell phones this one is actually quite
loud I step back probably seven or eight
feet I could still hear the people on
the call quite clearly and most
surprisingly they could actually hear me
so the microphones that are built in
here are very very responsive also has a
mute button on the back for obviously
meeting the calls but actually it's very
strong very loud
and probably one of the better speaker
phones that I've ever used now al gone
on record is not being the biggest
windows mobile fan but i have used 5.06
point 0 6.1 and l 6.5 that's found on
the tilt to which they're calling
windows phone so i'm not sure if a
combination of microsoft updates to 6.5
or HTC who actually made this phone
there touchflo 3d skin that from the
operating system this is the first
windows mobile phone that i could
actually use on a daily basis it's very
generous 3.6 inch touchscreen is quite
easy to use despite being resistive it
almost had a a capacitive feel to it
previously most resistive touchscreens
were sort of within a bezel so there you
can get dust in the corner or just
didn't feel very responsive this is
actually a full flush resistive
touchscreen giving it sort of a
capacitive look and it does work quite
well through my few weeks using the
device I never had to take out the
stylus once so it is quite responsive
it's got a good physics engine for flick
scrolling and the operating system again
whether that's Microsoft or HTC has been
completely updated and modernized for
touch scrolling and using it just with a
single finger so gone are the days of
using Windows Mobile we have to use a
stylus and those days couldn't be gone
soon enough for me I hate how to pull
out the stylist sort of start pecking
away tiny little numbers and tiny little
checkboxes is much easier now to you
your finger so kudos to Microsoft to HTC
for updating it and making it a little
bit more usable so pocket internet
explorer is generally the default
browser for Windows Mobile hello HTC
site to make Opera the default browser
for the tilt two and that was a
fantastic decision as I demonstrated in
previous videos the browser is quite
capable although it does not play flash
you can get other browsers that can play
flash such as Skype fire and taking out
browsers and we can get other things
from smooth dough is mobile 6.5 or
Windows Phone has a new apps marketplace
similar to the App Store or blackberry
app world or android marketplace it's
Microsoft's own version and it's quite
easy to use really easy to navigate and
there is
about what substance on there a lot of
which are free sites your windows live
account in case you are wondering so if
you have been holding off on buying your
windows mobile device still there was an
app store there is one out there now
that is readily available overall I've
been very happy with the phone like I
said I never thought that I could use a
windows mobile phone on the daily basis
just because it crashes memory
management just overall wagon asst but
that seems to be affixed with the touch
pro 2 which is surprising because it's
actually using the same processor that
was found in omak generations fuse but
it looks like it's been optimized
drastically for this device so the
reason it's called the tilt or in this
case until 2 is because well the screens
pills I found that to be really useful
for typing or even watching video which
by the way place back very smoothly the
keyboard on the device is probably one
of the best physical keyboards that I've
ever used it's very spacious there's a
lot of throw and there's just enough
room moving to the keys where you're not
going to tap on the wrong one while the
physical keyboard is amazing the
on-screen portrait and landscape
keyboards are awful so don't think
you're going to be doing a lot of touch
typing on resistive touchscreen in this
case on the tilt two is just a touch
brain because it is just not accurate
but if you're getting the tilt two odds
are main attraction to you is the full
keyboard so if you don't mind sliding it
out they're going to have no trouble
typing it does of course have an
accelerometer it's got a light sensor so
you put it up to your head it's going to
turn off the screen let's go out a lot
of modern niceties that you become used
to on phones that really hadn't made
their way over to majority of windows
mobile phones the past so I think this
is the first step in Microsoft really
modernizing their OS I'm curious to see
what other devices come out with windows
mobile 6.5 on it and I'll Microsoft an
HTC continue to develop the operating
system and the skins on top of it out of
a five scale i give this a very solid
for opera browser was great it was not
nearly as quick as rendering or as
elegant e use as a mobile safari but it
is very useful and you get a lot of
niceties with Windows Mobile
don't get with other devices you get an
open platform that can be very easily
tweaked and modified you're getting
really full exchange support and you're
getting almost complete customization
over your device which is quite nice so
