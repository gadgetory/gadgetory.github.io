Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona where
blackberry just announced its latest
device it's called the BlackBerry leap
it'll launch later this year for about
$275 it's actually a pretty sweet
devices running BlackBerry 10 here full
touchscreen 5-inch display it's a 1280
by 720 pixel screen so 720p if you will
and I'll walk you through some of the
features that we've seen before so we
have assistant onboard which is sort of
like BlackBerry's Siri or Google now
assistant so similar to what we've seen
before
swipe up we'll go back you can see of
course blackberry hub on the far
left-hand side here and I were you
looking at all of your notifications in
one place so you get bbm text messages
Twitter all stuff like that that we've
seen before and now let's just walk
through a bit of the hardware onboard
you have 16 gigs of storage that's
expandable up to 128 gigabytes it's got
a Qualcomm processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz on the front here you have a 2
megapixel front-facing camera up top you
have the power button and a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the left
here's where you insert the microSD card
to expand your storage and the SIM card
on the bottom of micro USB port on the
right-hand side you have the volume
buttons in addition to the extra button
that can be used to program different
things if you want you could always do
that to launch the camera but we'll
watch the camera here and that shoots
eight megapixel photos with the back
here and shoots 1080p video I also have
a single LED flash and this nice finish
here it's very textured kind of like
mini bumps almost like a basketball and
then here at the bottom the speaker so
other features that come onboard is
blackberry blend is something we saw
originally on the blackberry Passport
and that lets you manage everything
receive your notification secure emails
and everything directly on your computer
which is a nice touch here especially on
this device and let me just show you the
keyboard here real quick so that's
important as always you start typing
so and you can swipe up if you want to
complete the word this how are you doing
for dinner so really easy to use a
unique keyboard that we like we've used
it in the past before and you don't have
the hardware on here of course that's
important any case that's a quick look
at the BlackBerry leap this is Todd
