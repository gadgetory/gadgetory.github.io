Justin TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing
that I'm really excited about this is
the just redesigned 2010 11.6 inch
MacBook Air let's dig in alright so this
is the entry-level MacBook Air the $9.99
model I've got this in for just about a
week for review purposes on the front of
the box you've got a picture of the air
it's very familiar wedge shape MacBook
Air on the side on the back it sort of
gives you a rundown on the specs so this
model has the 1.4 gigahertz Intel Core 2
Duo chip 2 gigs of ram although if
you're gonna buy one of these I
recommend ordering it online and paying
after hundred dollars premium for the 4
gigs of RAM I think it'll serve you well
over a longer period of time
64 gigs of flash memory 11.6 inch
diagonal LED backlit display the
resolution of 1366 by 768 NVIDIA GeForce
320 m built-in iSight 2 USB ports and
the rest of the stuff you would expect
from a Mac laptop the box is really
small and really light let's go ahead
and use of course the obligatory big ol
knife to cut into this guy alright so
the plastic is open go ahead and peel
this back
yes in the top just comes off in sort of
typical Mac fashion top is sort of a
foamy protective covering to keep this
safe a little tab to pull out key
MacBook Air wow this thing is really
incredibly small do a size comparison
just a minute but for right now it's
pushed off to the side and see what else
we're gonna get you've got your power
brick first ink typical Apple laptop
core that we've seen before and your
MagSafe adapter
you've got your everything Mac
everything else although I think that
this does not come actually with three
installed DVDs supposedly it comes with
the elite install thumb drive let's see
if that's true and yep there it is
back to Mac a MacBook Air rather a
software reinstall Drive that's a thumb
drive and a very small one at that so
kind of interesting since this does not
have an optical drive that's how you're
going to get all your information back
on your computer if you ever need to
restore it so enough of those
accessories aside let's take a look at
what everyone's here to see me included
this is the 11.6 inch MacBook Air and
this thing is really really tiny of very
thin let's go ahead and peel off the
plastic always sort of fun to do
all right so here it is it does have a
full-size keyboard for an 11.6 inch
laptops go ahead and open it up and
there it is a little bit interestingly
enough the keyboard actually extends out
past the screen the screen here is not
the typical screen that we've seen on
the MacBook Pro lines doesn't have that
sheet of edge-to-edge glass that
actually is sort of sitting inside of a
bezel here but it does look to be pretty
nice it is a full-size keyboard it's not
backlit we now have the full-size
multi-touch trackpad on a macbook air
without the button let's do a real quick
size comparison here i'm gonna bring in
the 13-inch MacBook so this is the same
size as the MacBook Pros that are
currently out there you can see sort of
the size difference here so there is the
big guy and first let's put them throw
on top of each other so you guys can see
the difference move these off to the
side so big size difference there just
from in regular dimensions but the real
difference return these things over as
you can see the size quite small this
thing really weighs on nothing you take
a standard a smart phone relatively thin
hold up next to it you can see just how
thin this thing really is let's go ahead
and continue serve our tour of the
MacBook Air and take a look at the ports
and what else you are going to get with
the computer alright so on the left-hand
side you've got your Mac safe adapter
one USB port and headphones in which
I'll see a little serve as audio out
looks like you've got a microphone right
there as well on the right hand side and
moving right along we have another USB
port and your mini displayport are
served micro slave work um
which now you can use to power at full
27-inch Apple Cinema Display is quite
nice battery is sealed on the back you
are gonna get five hours of battery life
with the 11.6 inch model or seven hours
of battery life would be larger 13.3
completely sealed in here go ahead and
turn this back on its side anyway guys
be sure to stay tuned to the channel and
TechnoBuffalo comm for a full rundown of
the macbook air or putting it through
its paces and showing me videos on what
it's like with the instant-on is I like
how fast it handles a website HD video
and be such anyway to be any question
things you want to see letting me know I
am John Rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you guys in the next video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
