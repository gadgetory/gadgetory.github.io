well wherever you are at you want to
make a real quick video let you guys
know about two weeks ago i upgraded my
macbook pro from two gigabytes of ram 24
i ordered to two gigabytes dicks from
crucial was 106 bucks shipped to really
seemed like a no-brainer was a great
deal and i really noticed a marketable
difference the biggest difference that I
noticed is when i'm using parallels i
can give now give windows full 2 gigs of
ram and still have plenty left to do
anything 92 in OS 10 so that's been a
really nice feature I can keep more
programs open without having to closing
down that shutting down the computer
which is nice and its overall my
computer just running a little bit
faster so if you got the hundred bucks I
mean I'd recommend an upgrade for your
macbook or macbook pro you know I
definitely think that it's a worthwhile
move installation was pretty easy it's
very straightforward on the free for the
macbook pro all you do is you take out
the battery there are three screws you
pull them out there the sticks Ram pop
them out it was a busy cake I not that
experience with changing RAM and have
any trouble and it's even easier on the
macbook but if you have to have a
macbook air you can't change so just
something notice anyway for gigs ram
great way to go try it's like there's a
party outside here um so I for all the
background noise anyway guys just wanted
to let you know four gigs ram thumbs up
definitely worthwhile don't forget to
check out the website at wwu or lakers
comm link in the sidebar and we're
always looking for more writers to add
content to the site so if you're
interested send me an email either
through youtube or there's a link on the
website to email me at and I guys hope
you're doing well and have a good night
talk to you soon bye Oh on a personal
note I became an uncle today for
yesterday rather April seventeenth for
the first time
sister had a happy healthy baby girl so
I'm very excited we have a new addition
to my family first baby in our family
since since me long time ago so at the
Lance was modeling anyway guys I'll talk
to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
