John here and I saw that I had a request
from one of my subscribers striker EJ 25
to do a striking striker e2j rather to
do a review on the wireless Mighty Mouse
that he and coupled are you good people
saw on my desk and commented on so I'll
do a quick review for you guys just real
quickly here's what it looked like I'm
sure you've all seen in the Apple Store
if you haven't go check it out it's a
single shell no discernible buttons on
it at all so it's got a swivel scroll
like nipple ball instead of a scroll
wheel that you're probably used to press
your button on the side pressure but on
the side when you push them together it
activates whatever thing you have set
and actually could push the ball in for
another button mister cuz doesn't look
like there are a left or a light right
click there actually are its heat
sensitive the only way you know it's on
is from that glowing green light right
there this little switch here pushed it
up turns it off it can run on one or two
double-a batteries battery life seems to
be pretty good it's great for being
Wireless the MacBook Pro only has two
USB ports which is I think is a real a
real shame so having a USB dongle for a
wireless mouse really takes up half your
port so bluetooth at least in my mind
was the only option
I've been using Mighty Mouse for a
couple days it's a little bit annoying
at times I'm not used to it I was using
Adele organ amma counts before and that
seemed to be just a little bit easier to
use but i'm getting used to the Mighty
Mouse one interesting thing to note that
if you're thinking about getting it when
you try and right-click you actually
have to lift up your left finger first
to right click I guess because it's a
heat-sensitive it can only sense one
button at a time it's a little annoying
I'm getting used to it pretty quickly
but there's definitely a learning curve
with this Mouse the 360 scroll ball is
really nice actually you can scroll you
the left/right up/down you consider it
to be able to scroll diagonally if you
want
anyway it's great for things like iPhoto
and iMovie so that's nice I think help
me to get used to the mouse I think that
I'll end up liking it does look like a
bar soap though I just needs to have a
dial on it instead of that Apple logo
over all right now on a one to ten scale
I'd probably give it a six and a half or
seven it's not bad it's not great it's
definitely serviceable I don't have any
Bluetooth lag at all when I move it it
moves it connects pretty fast so that is
really nice I think I'll get used to it
and they think I'll end up enjoying it
so that's the review for the Bluetooth
Mighty Mouse again any questions guys
feel free to let me know if I could post
a video answering it I'm happy to do it
helps me learn about my computer too so
that's nice any questions let me know
and I'll try and answer them as quickly
as I can
thanks guys for subscribing and for
checking these out talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
