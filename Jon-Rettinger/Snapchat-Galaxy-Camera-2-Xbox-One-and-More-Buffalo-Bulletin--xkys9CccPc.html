bulletin time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap stories
from our site technobuffalo calm every
tuesday and friday if you're interested
in reading more about any story on the
show check the description for links
below or click on the graphics if you
have annotations available on toggled on
I'm Ashley's gather here your top
stories snapchat might be rethinking
their decision to turn down billions of
dollars from facebook as they suffered a
very large hack this week over four and
a half million user names and phone
numbers of people using the service were
posted as people rang in the new year
after Gibson security revealed a
loophole that potentially allowed
someone to associate usernames with
phone numbers whoops the hacker or
hackers responsible claimed they did it
to put pressure on snapchat to fix the
exploit snapchats the biggest draws
anonymity so it's kind of a big deal to
see this much user info compromised
samsung also in the news this week
officially announcing the next version
of its Android powered shooter
unsurprisingly named at the Galaxy
camera too it's got some new retro
design cues it's shed a little weight
and it's more compact compared to the
original but it has the same megapixel
and optical zoom specs it is running 4.3
jelly bean for those of you interested
in which version of Android the galaxy
camera 2 is running on no word yet from
Samsung on when or how much but we're
expecting it to land on a few US
carriers and we will be checking it out
at CES next week in gaming Microsoft's
Phil Spencer made some news this week
after mentioning the Xbox one almost
made it to retail without a disk drive
that's right the Xbox one was almost
entirely digital with Microsoft
apparently kicking around the plan until
post III feedback and concerns about
bandwidth issues made it clear a
digital-only console was not quite in
the cards this console generation it's
kind of amazing that Microsoft was still
in planning mode for the xbox one
mid-2013 but considering the consoles
popularity thus far it looks like they
made a pretty good decision Sega also
making gaming news this week no they're
not bringing back the dreamcast or the
Genesis for next gen boo they're
actually considering more free to play
games on the Nintendo 3ds of course that
will depend on how japanese gamers
respond
to initial d perfect shift online which
will be Sega's first foray into
free-to-play titles it looks like the
3ds is their platform of choice as it's
the second most popular handheld device
in Japan trailing just the smartphone
it'll be interesting to see if any of
these free-to-play games that Sega makes
show up in the American eShop lastly our
grab bag story for the day is an actual
grab bag Apple offered a lucky bag
promotion in Japan on the second of
January and it went like this customers
walked into an apple store and paid 350
bucks or so for a lucky bag which would
have an assortment of goods in it most
bags held the same three hundred fifty
dollars worth of assorted products like
cases Bluetooth speakers and the like
but some really lucky bags had products
like a new macbook air inside them we
probably won't see an event like that
here in the States but it was still kind
of cool to see your retailer like Apple
do grab bags like this for its customers
