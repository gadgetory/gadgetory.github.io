brought to you by audible.com welcome
back to another episode of ask the
Buffalo this is the show or you could
ask any question that you've got from
the world of technology you don't know
if you should wait for a new phone if
you trade in that old clunker that you
got carry around in your pocket this is
the place that you can ask it you can
tell I'm serious because I am overly
animated this is asked a buffalo let's
go ahead and get started alright so with
the new iPad already out the next apple
rumors are gonna be on the iPhone 5 or
maybe they're gonna call it the new
iphone what its gonna have when it's
gonna look like what its gonna feel like
and whether or not it's going to be able
to make me breakfast I think it's gonna
be able to do that one and that's one of
the questions that brian has who is the
first question on asta buffalo he asked
hey John what features do you think the
iPhone 5 is going to have learning the
week around a story saying it's gonna
have a 4.6 5-inch screen I think that is
balderdash push ought to that I think
we're going to see a 4-inch iphone
screen a little bit larger than the 3.5
inch screen actually point 5 inches if
you're keeping track at home I don't
think were going to see the resolution
change the retina display is still
pretty high resolution certainly LTE is
a logical upgrade perhaps a storage jump
from 64 128 gigs is also potential we've
heard some rumors of an aluminum back on
it Samsung is supposed to be putting out
a ceramic backing on the galaxy s3 you
know perhaps we'll see something like
that from Apple as well and hopefully
please let there be redesigned iOS iOS 5
is stale it's boring and I need me some
widgets so make it happen please Apple
alright so our next question comes from
Greg and this is one that I've been
getting quite a bit yes hey John I have
five hundred dollars I don't know what
to choose a new iPad or the Asus
Transformer Prime iPad as an excellent
screen basis has a docking station and
USB I'm looking for a good tablet that
is a no brainer in the world of mo
phones there are a ton of great opera
systems that can provide equally good
user experience I've got iOS Android
Windows Phone 7 in the world of tablets
though there is one king and there's one
king for a reason the ipad still stands
head and shoulders knees and toes above
the competition so without doubt
reservation hesitation trepidation or
any other word that ends a nation go for
the new ipad alright it's time to
transition from move to a little bit of
gaming that was my transition mobile
gaming and looking one to talk some xbox
360 logan at well ass hey John with
Microsoft announcing they will not be
announcing new Xbox hardware so my
politicians thumb at e3 what do you
think that means for this year's e3 in
the future of Xbox hardware I think this
year we're gonna see a lot more Kinect
games perhaps upgrades to the Kinect
hardware perhaps a brand new revamped
connect that can let you do some dance
central better than ever before so when
you do your little shimmy shake it down
when you roll it back up it'll get those
motions exactly dance central time
so all that being said we're not going
to see new Xbox hardware for probably
another year to two years just like we
rock gonna see a ps4 for another year or
two years I think we're probably some
upgrades xbox live as well but nothing
giant they can probably take a nap
through Microsoft's e3 keynote but if
you don't want to take a nap and you
want to take a drive the best way to
entertain yourself on said drives is to
use our friends at audible.com let's say
you want to read the books for the
Hunger Games which i think is about
someone hungry playing with their food
actually my wife read the books and and
love them so I'm probably gonna have to
go see the movie but if you want to read
The Hunger Games you enough time to sit
there and flip the pages old-fashioned
style go ahead and download them from
audible.com you can listen to the books
water in your car whether the gym on
your iPad on your iPhone went on an
Android device I'm really anything you
can go ahead and haul through all three
books and learn what happens in The
Hunger Games I think they fight each
other to the death and if you want it
down with the first book of hunger games
for free you can go ahead and do so go
to audible podcast.com slash heck no
that is audible podcast heck no back to
questions so our next question comes
from Adams cousin Luis Sandler wants to
talk some Lumia 900 yes hey John I was
planning to get a windows phone after
this first release of the HTC Titan to
and the Lumia 900 which is the best
choice I had a chance to fly with both
at CES I'm a huge windows phone 7 Fanny
honest answer is I'm not sure yet I love
the giant screen the 4.7 inch screen on
the Titan too i love LTE and i used the
original titan and i really enjoyed it i
love the industrial feel of HTC devices
but on the other hand lumia 900 has
incredible build quality the screen is
absolutely beautiful despite being low
resolution you know for a bite hundred
which is all windows phones of course
right now but the phone is absolutely
incredible so you have two excellent
choices when it comes down to which one
you know I'm gonna pick the Lumia 900 is
probably gonna be my daily driver but
they're both awesome it's like choosing
between cake and ice cream both equally
delicious but sometimes if
like cake sometimes you feel like ice
cream so what dessert do you feel like
I'm not making an Android joke cuz
they're all desert names no not funny
thank you all for watching this episode
I've asked the Buffalo I hope you guys
enjoyed jon rettinger be sure to check
us out at TechnoBuffalo com for all your
tech news and i will see you talk to you
and fill you in at the next video bye
bye job first question comes to us I
don't know the person's name do learn
how the Hunger Games start maybe it
should be like 100 games more hunger
games and then super Hunger Games would
probably make sense but you listen to
the books and you be the judge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
