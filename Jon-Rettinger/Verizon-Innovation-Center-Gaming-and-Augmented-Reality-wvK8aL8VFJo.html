silhouette but you don't care check out
the view i'm here at the grand opening
of the verizon application innovation
center a penny to the first person who
can guess where we are in San Francisco
downtown San Francisco right down across
the street from the Embarcadero and the
day spectacular setting and this is the
all kinds of tech journalist superstars
walking around this is the grand opening
of the innovation center verizon opened
a hardware innovation center on the east
coast in waltham massachusetts earlier
in the summer today is the application
center waiting for the demos to get
started so let's take a look around so
this really is a facility that allows
development to develop and you know you
get access to things that normally have
access to it and then again we have all
the bride's employees here who are
experts in the field ready of expert
advice as well as physical devices in
some situations as well as you know
brainstorming ideas and things like that
and the staff isn't limited to engineers
we have any engineers at your disposal
awesome but there's other verizon
staffers hopefully this in this facility
there's a engineers is marketing
personality there's a number of people
years gaming and entertainment what's
going on in here we've got in video
we've got samsung volcom Snapdragon logo
well see what's going on inside so we're
here at Andrew Sophie from the verizon
application Innovation Center we're in
the dev lab for gaming right so I so
welcome this is a dev lab this is a
place where developers will be working
on a typical day here at the innovation
center and what we're showing you over
here is the Qualcomm MVP this is a
mobile development platform that uses
the Snapdragon processor now set
dual-core 1.2 get your herd so it
represents the next generation
snapdragon coming hopefully to a phone
soon so Andrew we're running a 1080p 3d
stream basically to 1080p streams off of
the reference platform exactly so is
creating to 1080p streaming
after the the MVP as you said it's
actually upscaling to 1080 right now as
you know things are are improved to be
actually fully on pulling native
rendered in 1080 but right now it is in
1080 it's upscale this example here is
actually taking the opengl content and
being able to actually create a 3d
content dynamically at the touch of a
button so by optimizing for the audrina
GPU in this in this development platform
you're able to add s3 need you know to
your game you can notice that we're in
3d here and then we can pop it off
without any extra work so the important
thing you know no expedition alas 'it's
and create the textures for Adreno or
you know create the texture of
conversion utility and you know they're
you already have s 3d content so no
additional this is a room and you
typically see configure you know for
developers to come in you know work with
a prototype device has something out in
some hands-on time with an engineer etc
we're showing you today on the lab is a
samsung galaxy 10 tablet for govt you
have led to its own egra to power by
Tegra 2 and you're suing example those
graphics are on the screen the
interesting part is Raja using a
Bluetooth controller did this cause to
control riptides which is a method unit
game and this is going to look over some
of the things that are integrated into
honeycomb and our good friends at Nvidia
actually you know put together some
great documentation to help me weed
brood you know the Google documentation
so you know typical thing and developed
would come in here we've helped them
kind of you know probable that Nvidia
documentation point you in the right
direction it gives them some tips on
best practice things we learn along the
way and in the end you know helping
troubleshoot if something isn't going
right so it's a you know just another
day kind of around here helping you know
a new new app kind of get touched a
chord or
to control support alright so now we're
in the developer tools area you can see
your lovely sponsors there and we're
going to talk to Brett is going to show
us a couple of very interesting
augmented reality apps powered by
Qualcomm yeah this is using Qualcomm's
augmented reality toolkit and this game
was made by the the company big player
and it is a augmented reality basketball
game so this is a basketball ticket and
the game board is overlaid on top of
that so as you see when you're moving
this around it it actually reacts in
real time right so this isn't just a
graphic of a basketball court on the
screen this is interacting with the
ticket correct which is what you just
said I had to say it again so I'd
understand it you know i'm a little slow
so fun yeah i mean you can zoom in on
the guy you can see their their
surrounding its built in 3d space and
then it just plays as the game board it
overlays the digital on ok can I harass
him to make him miss a shot you might be
able to very cool so this would be an
idea of something you'd be at the game
you get your ticket and then you know
there's a little I mean it reminds me of
a QR code oh absolutely but much much
more interesting to look at it service
on the same technology as a QR code
using image recognition and then just
display in a 3d environment on top of
that no and just because people are
going to ask you're running on a just
xperia yes it's very played by senator
oh the playwright ok and then in try
stunt guy in charge stunt guy that this
is an application that is not currently
on the market but it's it's you have
this little stunt man that needs to
complete an obstacle course let me pull
this out back a little bit
surface so the point is that there's
these optus different objects that you
have to place to help him complete his
obstacle course so I've got the little
speed boosts and the ramp and when I
hate go he's gonna do his thing drive
through awesome so you have to move the
device around to keep him you move the
objects around move objects or ours yeah
so like these these are the movable
objects and then when you were panning
the device that's just the to check out
the different angle okay you can forget
you can zoom in on the little guy as
he's crashing and burning right away
goes wild and you can I mean the same
thing these are all 3d right real-time
rendered so these are the types of tools
access to the developer toolkit and you
know support from the experts in the lab
or the kinds of things you guys want to
be providing right exactly that's the
point is that we are providing these
tools and helping the developers use
them in order to create and ships
excessive noise very cool I think there
may be a automated reality Buffalo I
don't say humph the Buffalo but you know
let the buffalo roam app in our future
one it will talk back about that
defective heart Brett very cool thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
