TechnoBuffalo here it's a full review
for you of the latest flagship from HTC
this is the brand new HTC One m8 I'm
using it for quite a while and ready to
share my thoughts and help you guys
decide whether that belongs in your
pocket for the next two years
go and get started but I deal with all
my reviews I want to give a disclaimer I
use this as my daily driver for nine and
a half days most of my times with the
International Edition although I did
test using an AT&amp;amp;T model as well the
International one is tested using an 18
t SIM card here in Southern California
Todd Hazleton who wrote the written
portion of the review if you want more
detail on anything I'm talking about hit
the link down below to go check that out
let's jump right in with call quality
it's always how I start my reviews
especially when you think with the metal
phone and be a bit of worried that maybe
antennas aren't gonna work so well
you're holding the phone wrong for
example no issues at all with call
quality again tested with AT&amp;amp;T network
in Southern California so your results
might vary but no drop calls at all call
Claude's absolutely awesome
call quality at new HTC One is as good
if not better than the last generation
which is to say it's pretty baller
alright so for this review I'm gonna
break it down into six categories that I
think are gonna cover the most salient
points for the majority of consumers
looking to pick the sucker up we're
gonna talk about design software screen
camera performance and intangibles
obviously there a ton more we could talk
about but I think those six can best sum
up a phone so even guys a quick speck
refresh case you forgot what's packed
inside of this tiny little body
it's a 5-inch screen in 1920 by 1080 you
can do quick math it's a 441 PPI
protecting it is a Corning Gorilla Glass
3 powering it is a 2.3 gigahertz pretty
beastly Snapdragon 801 processor though
if you're in Asia that'll be bumped up
to 2.5 gigahertz 2 gigs of RAM either 16
or 32 gigs now has expandable storage up
to 128 on the back we'll talk a lot
about this the duo camera of HTC's for
ultra pixel camera on the front is a 5
megapixel wide-angle lens
802 11 ABG and AC at 2.40 and 5
gigahertz
2600 milliamp hour battery NFC and
available in a few colors gunmetal grey
glacier silver and amber gold now with
all that out of the way let's finally
jump into the review let's start with
design I think
some of the best designs for flagships
in the industry their build quality
matches Nokia and Apple and that's some
seriously lofty praise the design on the
original HTC one is classic cold metal
and gently rounded edges industrial feel
great display amazing speakers all
waiting for a film that felt really good
in the hand the One m8 is an evolution
of that design and that's not half bad
it's got 20% more metal they act as a
plastic ring around the outside of it
making the aluminum now wrap around the
edges
the result is exquisite if not a bit
slippery I think some sort of texture
would have really helped I haven't
dropped the phone yet but I definitely
feel like I could very very soon I
wasn't a big fan of the power button on
the original it felt small and kind of
hard to depress HTC fix that on the m8
making it bigger and way easier to find
builing with your finger like this the
larger screen size make it look a bit
more rectangular but the rounded edges
you know make it look if you traced it
very much like a galaxy there's a theme
here with the phone
the original HTC One felt good this one
feels better virtually everything over
the original HTC One or m7 is improved
here the biggest improvement for me
though I think is the death of the
really really bad capacitive buttons
original HTC One I'm usually a big fan
of actual buttons I've talked about in
future videos but the odd place got
either side HTC logo coupled with the
logo not serving as an actual button was
absolutely maddening now we've got
actual honest on-screen buttons and I
know a few you were concerned they take
up too much space on the bottom that's
usually my issue with on-screen button
but suffice to say it's way better than
the alternative that we had on the
original the moral here though is that's
one of the best if not the best design
phones on the market alright so next
let's talk about software so it's no
secret HTC is really squarely up against
Samsung particularly the Galaxy s5 in
this generation of phones I think
Samsung takes the approach that they'll
throw a ton of new features at you and
hope there's maybe one or two or three
that really like I think HTC takes a
different approach they really use
features I think they feel that you're
gonna use the most and everything else
is kind of secondary and the best thing
I can say about sense 6 it kind of gets
out of its own way without making your
experience all about Sense features
they're there when you need them or want
them blink feeds been improved
they've now allow for feats virtually
any topic including I'm just saying Tech
and
Buffalo specifically just don't that out
there arguably the best feature of
blinkfeed though now is that it can be
turned off if you don't want it and not
just exiled to a home screen you don't
actually use all that often I will say
the blink feeds are kind of a nice
little time waster and does work as
advertised so I like a unified inbox but
really used gmail on Android I'm usually
on canine or another third-party email
app I think HTC's default email clients
actually one of the most elegant options
out there but as much time as I use
email this is really really important to
me sense six also brought motion
controls ways to open the camera app
just by moving the screen in conjecture
at how you pick it up the most useful of
which though is when you answer a call
you just pick it up put it your ear and
answers it to neat and it works most of
the other motion controls I didn't
really use except for one that seems
heavily influenced by LG's and that's
the knocked feature double tap the
screen to wake it up super useful works
great at least start international unit
on the 18 T model we are using only
worked about 70% of the time if you
don't like that home button placement
getting them to use it just double tap
the screen since 6 is the nicest skin or
custom UI out there hands down it's
definitely an evolution over 5 but a
really welcome change
let's go from software to screen the
screen here is pretty standard 1080
stuff there's nothing revolutionary just
a beautiful functional screen for those
m7 owners you've had a weird tint with
kind of a bluish color there's no such
tent here at all on the new HTC One m8
outdoor visibility sometimes an issue is
also pretty much improved but you still
need to turn the brightness all the way
up to see it but you will be able to see
it the jump to a 5-inch screen I think
serve the phone very well video games
and text all look awesome but this day
and age it's kind of hard to find a
really bad screen than a good one so
screen is pretty decent and works well
on the new HTC One next let's jump into
camera all right let's just get the big
elephant the room out of the way here
the duo camera on the back
HTC did a really awesome job with the
four megapixel branded ultrapixel camera
on the original HTC One or m7 the
biggest complaint a lot of users had
however it was that it didn't perform
that well in really bright light
situations the photos were of such low
resolution you could actually do him in
and crop the photo
HTC tried to address when those issues
this time around but also ignored the
other one completely still it even added
more functions though so the camera is
much better in bright light situations
but it's still not perfect and that's
because HTC said it chose a better
sensor this time around
also the phone autofocus and snaps
photos really really fast point three
seconds so you can set off rapid-fire
pictures much quicker than before as for
the megapixel count though you're still
stuck with only four megapixels to work
with and that means ooming and cropping
still yield crummy photos I don't care
if they call it mega or ultra pixels so
that could be able to do much with the
zooming their secondary duo camera lens
is capable of pulling in all the depth
data on a photo so the HTC One m8 knows
that objects from the foreground the
background and then you said information
to blur out photos and add sort of the
bokeh effect that you see usually find
in DSLRs
so the feature called G focus is not
perfect but it does work better than
other phones that come to this in the
past like the Xperia Z ones or Nokia's
refocus app HTC is also tatting the
smart dual LED flash it works well it's
really solid instead of just blowing out
subject with bright light it adjusts
itself to make sure the skin tones and
other colors to look accurate we first
saw this tech used on the iPhone 5s and
we're truly well here on the HTC One m8
too the camera UI is still super fluid
easy to use but you see removed the Zoe
function from the default app and put in
another setting that's because the depth
camera doesn't really work with Zoe's if
you open the Zoe camera however you can
still record Zoe's snap photos and even
record longer videos you can even pause
the video then resume filming right
where you left off again though photos
snaps in this mode don't have depth data
it seems silly but that's just how it
ends sensor works HTC is going to
release a new Zoe apt a lot of people to
collaborate and create multi user
highlight reels and I can't wait for its
launch oh it's not out yet however so I
can't talk about it finally though the
selfie guy the front-facing camera on
the front works really really well and I
love the wide-angle aspect HTC put from
earlier handsets like the one m7 and the
butterfly images are far better too
because it shoots five megapixels this
time around and say a two megapixel
shots on the previous generation so
overall though if you're chasing
megapixels then look for another phone
HTC One m8 still takes great shots and
I've really enjoyed performance at the
camera save for some of the lower res
shots also lack of opto and the
stabilization might be an issue for some
folks but for me once you pictures of my
kids are out and about the camera works
really well and performed pretty awesome
next let's jump into performance Lisbon
it's fast between the Snapdragon 801 two
gigabytes of ram anything from
multitasking to games will be super easy
the best thing I can say about the power
here is that I never noticed it which is
to say I was never aware of and you slow
down and for me a phone that gets out of
its own way and lets me do what I want
to do without sort of slowing down is
sort of worth a spot in my pocket but
because I do like to give a quadrant
score I know it's not always the best
way to score a phone but I do use it
through all my phone so it's sort of a
constant there got a pretty beastly
score of twenty two thousand five
hundred so yeah really really really
fast phone next let's jump to
intangibles so I was really worried
about battery life 2600 milliamp hours
is not huge I will say though HTC did a
killer job managing battery I guess
pretty much every Android phone I use
with my usage I'm usually around 30 to
40 percent by end of the day with this
one I was close to fifty to sixty
percent which is absolutely incredible
and I take my phone off the charger use
around six thirty
I've got about maybe four hours of phone
calls usually it's on Wi-Fi at the
office or the house goes back on the
charger around 11 o'clock I've got maybe
twenty or thirty minutes of video
watching some games on their heavy
social media to email apps playing in
every five minutes so a lot of use it's
that's really impressive heg did a
really good job of battery life they
also added battery savings mode that
actually shuts down all three functions
and vast increases battery life even
more you get down to that dreaded five
ten percent level they also listen to
consumers and added a microSD card slot
which for some might be a reason just
alone to upgrade and of course those
killer front-facing speakers they lost
the beats logo on the back they added
actually 20% on sounds and I wish I
could show you or let you hear the sound
sounds like coming out of this but it's
not gonna translate over video into your
speakers but it sounds really really
good if you thought the speakers on
original HTC one sounded awesome
these sound even better and that's
saying a lot all right so let's finally
break this down what's the final score
on the new HTC One m8 it gets a really
really solid nine I love this phone and
I would happily sign a two-year deal for
it which is not something I say very
often it's a perfect example of skinned
Android at its best if you're looking at
the best Android phone on the market
right now this is absolutely the best
one to pick up and you can compare this
with the Nexus 5 I think you're gonna
get a really really solid device of
course a Galaxy s5 is coming very soon
so competition is gonna get fierce but
worry not if you want to pick up HD sees
