TechnoBuffalo here the full review for
you of the beats by dre over ear studio
headphones these are professional
quality DJ asked headphones that are
made by monster of cabling fame we're
going to set you back about three
hundred and fifty bucks if you buy from
Monster if you look at Amazon or that
they're parted realtors you'll find them
for about fifty bucks less so I unbox
this and show you what came in here but
there's a lot of stuff so I'm going to
recap it very quickly you get a very
large box with dr. Dre's picture because
it's Beats By Dre you're going to get a
cleaning cloth you're going to get the
headphones in a carrying case I'll show
you in just a minute
you are going to get two cables you're
gonna get a black one two red one that's
inside of there which you will see in a
second you're also going to get a
quarter inch adapter for a high
performance so if you need to connect to
some sort of high quality IT equipment
and go ahead and plug 23.5 in and you
get the character you also have an
airline adapter some airlines use that
weird two prong plug so you've got
access to that as well and really what
is most important that comes in that box
is the headphones themselves and they do
come in a pretty large case you want to
throw this in a purse or something
you're going to want to plan accordingly
because it is a bit large so go ahead
and open it up and the case is hard as
you can push in as bit resistance but it
will protect the headphones nicely so
open this up and here is the subject of
our review the headphones themselves so
pull these out now comes with a red non
tangle cable and I can tell ya it really
does in tango which is quite nice and go
ahead and really do anything you want
with it it's very easy to undo it's not
like some of the earbud ones which can
take 10 minutes untangle this is very
easy
no in-ear microphone here on the red one
the monster didn't clue it on the black
one actually a built-in microphone so
I'm use it with your phone or iPhone
whatever it might be and go ahead and do
so and there's sort of the obligatory
control buttons built right in so let's
go ahead and push the case off to the
side there's not much else to see here
other than a little bit of a pocket that
actually pulls right out in case you
want to put something underneath it hide
some cash or something in there so push
all this off and let's talk
the headphones I have never really used
over-the-ear headphones before so I was
a bit skeptical is worried first I was
going to look a little bit weird rocking
these things out and secondly I was
worried that there we're not going to be
comfortable well the second fear about
them be not being comfortable is put to
rest very quickly as soon as I put them
on they have this very soft cushioning
material on the side which actually
feels much more comfortable than say
competing headsets made by Bose I've got
kind of sensitive years and I have
things that are pushing up to them for
long periods of time they can start to
hurt and I wore these on a flight for
about four and a half hours and I had no
ear discomfort which is quite nice now
that may also be due to fact that they
actually ear cuffs themselves angle in
form to your head so this will conform
to your ear in siderov ear having to
conform to the headset something that's
very nice it's a little addition it's
very subtle something that I found very
very helpful of course it expands the
head size and for caring as you saw they
just fold right in now these are not
wireless headphones it's powered on two
triple A batteries that is definitely
one of the downsides of the device the
battery compartment is actually right
underneath the ear cuff you go ahead and
slide that off and the batteries right
underneath a battery life was not as
strong as I would have liked when I
first unboxed these I used them for
about an hour I had them aside for about
a week and then I went on a flight and
when I went to turn on the headset of
the battery for dead which was a little
bit annoying actually so I couldn't use
them on the way out there had to use
them on the way back and pick up a
friend that may be due to older
batteries in the Box I put in brand-new
fresh phones able to use the headset for
about five and a half hours and the
batteries were still working something
to keep in mind for going on long travel
you may want to pack an extra set of
triple A's so let's go ahead and
continue to talk about the headset
because there's a lot of cool features
here so there is the 3.5 millimeter
headset jack you take your cable you
plug it in and you plug it into there
you want to listen to pretty
straightforward there's a built-in power
button here on the ear cup you go ahead
and turn that on you get a red light
letting you know that you are on and
activated it's also a mute button built
in tubes if we're listening you can go
ahead and push that so these are noise
cancelling headphones now is again a bit
skeptical about the noise cancelling
I've used some older noise cancelling
headphones and I noticed there was a
weird electronic sort of ringing but I
could always hear very
when music wasn't playing not the case
with the beats by dre in fact when I was
flying the plane I turned the headphones
on so I have the noise canceling did he
listen to music for part of it just to
cancel out all the engine noise up
sitting right over the engine it was
really loud and I heard nothing with
these things on and I slept like a baby
so if you're looking for a good noise
canceling headphones or travel
companions these are fantastic in
addition to putting out music to talk
about a second and a very high quality
and fidelity they're great for blocking
out baby screaming on a flight if you
guys do a lot of traveling that's
definitely something that you want to
look at so let's talk about the audio
fidelity and sort of what they do these
headphones likes according to monster
combined extra large speakers and
drivers of high-powered digital
amplifiers and that's just fancy talk
for high quality audio and the audio
coming out of these things is very very
very good
you actually hear some of the nuances
that music that you didn't hear before
we're listening to acoustic guitar you
can actually hear the fingers coming off
the strings or listening to a live
recording can actually hear the singers
breath I'll just quietly think you don't
really hear on in-ear headphone the
things that you even know we're there on
all the tracks you listen to listen to
some live albums on these and save the
Apple in your headphones that come with
iPods or iPhone to cover Apple product
you get and really you could clearly
hear a difference and you'd expect to
hear different something for this price
point and this size you really want to
make sure that you're getting something
that's worth your money so let's talk
about a look of these things so
definitely have a younger look they've
got swear that dr. Dre ish feel of
course their beats by dre so you get
sort of a more modern hip look they're
very slick looking glossy plastic all
the way around big beats by dre on the
top if you go out to a lot of club do
you mate see the DJ's rocking these
they're not as big and protruding as I
would have expected I didn't feel
awkward where I am or felt like I was
trying to say hey me me me look at me
just like I was wearing a normal pair of
headphones so if that's a concern for
you don't worry I'll put a link down
below if you want to check out the
unboxing video actually put these things
on and you can see what they look like
on a real person's head overall I've
been very impressed with the beats by
dre headphones and after admit I came in
bitterly skeptical for this price point
for headphones I wasn't sure that was
going to be worth it but if you value
audio fidelity you're looking for over
there headphones and
want really fantastic noise-canceling
which for me is hands-down the biggest
selling point of these headphones you
really are getting a very nice set of
headphones and with really good audio
fidelity that looks nice as well you get
a high quality case but the case again
is rather big so whether or not these
are for you is going to come out the
personal preference for my money and if
I'm doing a lot of traveling these are
going to be in my bag even if I'm not
assuming in music they're going to be a
great thing to have to block out from
kids screaming so what do you guys think
about the beats by dre studio headphones
monster's got a ton of other products
you can check out some in your buds and
some different beats by dre definitely
go ahead and take a look if you'd like
