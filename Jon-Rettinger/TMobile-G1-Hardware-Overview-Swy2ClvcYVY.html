Lakers came here with a hardware
overview for you of the t-mobile g1 I've
been using this device incognito I
suppose for the past three days t-mobile
was nice enough to send me one to demo
all the one they did send me was not
brand new it still had the previous
testers information on it but we'll go
ahead and let that pass so here is the
t-mobile g1 run on Google's Android
operating system and operating of course
on the t-mobile network with full 3d
capabilities although the 3G bands are
different than the bands AT&amp;amp;T uses in
the US so if you are able to unlock the
phone it won't work 3G at least with 18
keys Network so here's the front of the
device you'll notice a flush touchscreen
on the front which is capacitive meaning
the touches are registered by electron
transfer from your finger similar to the
touchscreen on the iPhone it's not a
resistive touch screen similar to most
windows mobile touch phones which
actually have a little bit of squishy
feel and that's because the touches are
registered by two layers of film pushing
together so the t-mobile g1 is
capacitive it's flush it's made of glass
and it feels very solid in the hand the
front of the device has four hardware
buttons on the front you've got a send
button got a home button you've got a
back button and an end button and the
middle you have a trackball which is
actually identical to the trackball used
in the Pearl on the curve and it's the
rest of BlackBerry's that feature the
trackball on the left side of the device
you are greeted with a volume up and
down rocker
which you can use to control the ring
volume as well and also the volume while
you're in the call and while we're
holding the device sideways here notice
it's got a bit of an outward slope to
the bottom chin of the device that's so
when you're talking the microphone is
actually a little bit closer to your
face on the left side of device moving
along we've got a dedicated camera
button operating the camera on the back
and I'll go over all the specs when I do
it for review on it I just wanted to
give you guys a sense of what the phone
actually looks like on the back you've
got your width at Google so the phone is
very interesting in the fact that
there's not an on-screen keyboard
like most touchscreens are trying to
nowadays this one relies on a full
slide-out QWERTY key
ah go ahead and show you and you notice
that when it slides out it's not a
straight slide up or down actually
slopes out to the side and comes back in
it's very neat actually see that again
goes out and then back in the screen is
very vibrant it color wise the
resolution wise it felt as nice as the
iPhone I know the resolution isn't quite
as high but it does look it and it does
have a very nice feel and the colors do
pop on it go ahead and close that
overall the phone does feel very solid
in the hand it does have a little bit of
heft to it a little bit of weight but
nothing that makes it feel overbearing
and too big in your pocket size-wise
I'll give you guys a comparison to the
trusty iPhone I'll pull this down so you
guys can see here just least Hardware
ones so here the two phones side-by-side
turn them towards you one that's next to
another we'll put the g1 on top of the
iPhone you can see it's not quite as
wide there's a little bit of room on the
side and thickness wise the g1 is
noticeably thicker than the iPhone they
actually thickness I believe is due to
the keyboard the width of the keyboard
itself is actually about the added
thickness as compared to the iPhone on
the back of it you can see the sliding
path that it takes and me my favs logo
on the back I only get this device for
another few days so I'm gonna use it for
a little bit more and then conduct my
review but overall my experience has
been very positive with the phone I've
enjoyed the operating system
I've enjoyed the hardware of the phone
but I'll get into all that when I do a
more thorough review of it so guys this
is John Rhett enger' demoing the
t-mobile g1 should I check out the
website at www.att.com/biz
and if you guys like the site you want
to contribute to it hit the apply button
on the right hand side and we're always
looking to add some new writers and to
help you guys get some exposure
guys John Rettendon I'll put the links
all those things in the sidebar which
should be probably there then you guys
hope you enjoyed and I will talk to you
soon
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
