Sonia from TechnoBuffalo and today we're
gonna be unboxing the soos Zen watch
this is the first Android wear device
from masseuse and it retails for $199
and you can pick it up from the Google
Play Store or Best Buy or whichever
retailer you like of course prices may
vary depending on when you're watching
this video so digging inside the box
let's see what we get inside I get this
who's Zen watch get the watch right
there let's see what else we get inside
we get some get the charging cradle have
some manuals and booklets more booklets
you have the power brick and your basic
USB cable alright let's move all this
stuff to the side real quick and take a
closer look at the Zen watch the Suze n
watch features a 1.6 inch AMOLED display
with a pixel resolution of 320 by 320
it's got 360 million battery inside
which should get you enough battery
throughout the day it's got a 1.2
gigahertz Snapdragon 400 processor 512
megabytes of RAM and 4 gigabytes of
internal storage it's also IP 55 water
resistant and has 9 axis sensors and a
bio sensor for monitoring your heart
rate it's got a button on the side which
should turn on or off your watch but
kind of seems hard at reach if it's on
your wrist the Zen watch only comes in
this silver rose gold trim model and
comes with this brown leather strap and
actually the brown leather strap looks
really nice and it should age well in
due time
you'll be able to replace the straps
with any other 22 millimeter straps you
have laying around your house so if you
have those you can replace these right
away now one thing I'm not actually a
big fan of are the big bezels those
bezels are huge I wish a sous could have
made the screen bigger to just cover up
the bezels or make the watch smaller to
make the bezels look normal now as for a
size comparison this is the Moto 360 and
a sous zan watch and as you can see the
Moto 360 is just ridiculously thick but
we'll see how this one holds up and
since this is actually running Android
wear it shares similar character risk
six-two other Android wear devices like
the Moto 360 and the LG G watch it'll
feed you notifications and relevant
information from your Android device to
your watch just like any other Android
wear device there is actually a
companion app just like the Moto 360
wooden moto Connect and you can download
that from the Google Play Store you can
customize the watch faces you can bus
your watch if you ever lose it and you
can also remotely control your phone's
camera using the watch and so much more
well put this guy through its paces and
see how it holds up to you other Android
wear devices let us know what you'd like
to see from this bad boy and of course
if you liked the video make sure to give
it a thumbs up make sure to hit the
subscribe button right here and we'll
see you guys in the next one you stop
the video just real fast to thank our
friends and good peeps at Lenovo if
you're like me and you got a hard time
bending down to touch your toes yoga
might not be for you but now it can be
with the Lenovo yoga 3 Pro this is a
crazy cool laptop the features time
different modes like laptop mode stand
mode and tent mode in tablet mode it's
got a gorgeous 3200 by 1800 pixel 13/4
inch multi-touch display Windows 8.1 pro
super thin design Intel Core M 70
processor JBL speakers and way wayworn
the Lenovo yoga 3 Pro does things for
the laptops can interact play and stay
in touch your way with unmatched
versatility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
