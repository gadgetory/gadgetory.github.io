John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
review for you of the Eton Solara
solar speaker set which is made to work
perfectly with your eye devices let's go
ahead and see if this is worth your hard
earned speaker dollar so if you're
interested in picking up one of these
guys it's gonna set you back just about
a hundred and sixty-five dollars from
Amazon or the Apple online store and at
its essence it's very much a portable
speaker system something that we've seen
quite a bit of in the past however this
guy's got a secret tucked under its hood
which really separates it from the pack
so first let's talk about the specs it's
got an IP x4 splash proof speakers so
the speakers on both sides protected
against spraying water from all angles a
10 litres so it can actually take a
decent amount of splash if you're
playing in the pool or if you are
sitting in Jacuzzi whatever it might be
and some water gets on this guy you
don't have to worry you're gonna get
four hours of audio playback at mid
volume a continuous charging of your
iPhone or iPod Touch and we'll see where
that goes in just a minute it is fully
rechargeable so it uses two cell lithium
ion two thousand milliamp hour batteries
and it can actually charge in direct
sunlight because it's secret it's got
hiding is a solar panel right under the
hood right then go ahead and tilt the
back you can see it too right there and
see me talking and actually that will
charge it as well if you have an
indirect sunlight it'll charge the whole
thing all the way up in just about ten
hours the to full range speakers are
driven the total output of 11 watts
which is kind of neat alright so let's
go ahead and get started and start
talking a little bit more about the
device and the design it is extremely
light clocks it in just about three and
a half pounds which makes it a nice
weight to go ahead and bring with you
poolside from a control standpoint
you've got sort of your typical array of
buttons these are probably what you're
gonna produce primarily however you
don't have to rely on using the device
itself it comes with a remote which
actually works pretty well when using
this guy for the past few
and once I had some friends over we had
a pool party at my community's pool and
it was nice to have this thing and put a
poolside and are able to just flip up
the solar panel listen to our music and
not have to worry about falling into
water or electrocuting ourselves ready
to plug it in and find a power outlet I
really just made for a nice music
listening experience and the quality was
very good so let me go ahead and pop a
iphone in here and show you what it
looks like and this will work with
non-ai devices there's a line in the
back just meant for a devices because it
will actually charge it on addition to
playing music from it I'm going to pop
my iPhone right in there and one of the
worries I had about bringing my iPhone
which is my primary technology that I
use a poolside so I was worried that it
might get splashed or might get a little
bit damaged especially if something
that's meant to be used outdoors well
the folks you can actually thought of
that and chips with this little plastic
guard which slides right in and will
protect your device from any sort of bad
water damage go ahead and pull this out
um good turn on as well and show you
that it is indeed charging the device a
sound quality is extremely good it's
difficult for me to review speakers and
let you guys hear the sound first it's
gonna get distorted coming out of the
speakers have been recorded into the
camera then getting uploaded to YouTube
is also not gonna sound quite right and
there's also that little copyright issue
so what I'm gonna do to sort of try and
illustrate the sound quality for you so
I'm gonna play a YouTube video which I
own the rights to video that I just
uploaded earlier in the day we'll go
ahead and hit play Nick is here at least
a little bit of sample of what the audio
is going to sound like you know use them
and I will splice those two segments of
the video together let's go ahead and
get started
I'm gonna go ahead and pause it there it
sounds very good you're gonna have to
take my word for it the bass and the
sound is very rich crisp and clear
otherwise any distortion or fuzzing or
popping noise coming from a device that
I've had on other speaker sets
I'll reviewed quite a number of speakers
in the past some are good some are not
bad this one is probably one of the best
portable speaker from poor performance
that I've seen and then it throws in the
solar panel on top which really makes it
a bit more versatile especially in the
warm sunny months something that you
might want to stock up for once summer
comes back around anyway guys overall
its speaker that I really enjoyed it's
versatile I'm not worried about getting
it wet not that I'm gonna dump it in a
pool but if something splashing should
happen to it
I've actually brought this over to my
parents house and my nieces were there
and put it by the spa so they could play
with it I wasn't to some music and we
had a lot of fun doing a sing-along with
this so I've actually found it to be
extremely useful and I think you guys
will as well so I am John rector from
TechnoBuffalo with a full review for you
