to you by Harry's hey what's going on
guys a mark and sang in from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's episode of
Roma Rhonda will be talking about the
iphone 6s LG's new Nexus device and
motorola's droid turbo this is rumor
roundup let's go ahead and get started
it looks like a new droid device is just
around the corner after sitting out this
week's Motorola event it appears the
follow-up to the droid turbo is very
much into pipelines while a lot of the
devices big features haven't yet been
uncovered one feature revealed in
today's leaked suggested the device will
come equipped with wireless charging
which is something that was missing from
the new Moto X not much else is known
about the device though it does closely
resembled last year's turbo if it's
anything like that device it will sport
a durable design and a humongous battery
adding wireless charging to the mix
makes the next droid turbo a pretty
solid phone one possibility to turbo 2
or whatever will be called will fill in
for the Moto X play which isn't coming
stateside however it would be a bit
strange to see Motorola offering a
carrier specific device assuming it's
specific to verizon after so much talk
about unlock devices either way expect a
new droid device sooner rather than
later Apple's new generation of iPhones
likely won't launch until September but
production may be already kicking off a
new report claims the company is ramping
up assembly lines for new for such
modules to be included in the iphone 6s
and 6s plus according to digitimes which
has a somewhat spotty track record with
apple news the company is expected to
produce between 36 and 40 million
iPhones this quarter and another 50
million in q4 of 2015 for such module
production apparently started slowly
last month but really picked up in July
adding forest touch to iPhones could
open up a ton of new possibilities for
how iOS works moving forward on the most
basic level you'll be able to access
extra menus by holding down on the
screen but we have a feeling that's just
the beginning once developers gain
access to the new feature Apple is also
expected to introduce a tougher metal
frame to avoid another potential been
gate along with a new a 9 processor and
an updated 12 megapixel camera one
recent league also showed new internal
connector cables for the device that
could allow for a more compact design
though the exterior design is still
unlikely to change very much this year
this week we got a first look at LG's
alleged new Nexus phone courtesy of
Twitter tipster on leaks
just like before the Nexus case features
the usual camera and flash cutouts along
with a mysterious third circular hole
it's possible this could leave space for
a second rear camera allowing you to
shoot 3d footage or edit the focus on
photos after taking them it might also
be a fingerprint reader which we're
expecting from the new Nexus after
Google announced support for the
technology as part of its upcoming
android m release the leak also reveals
a connector port and headphone jack
along the bottom of the device and
cutouts for the power and volume buttons
on the right hand side finally it looks
like the phone speakers will be located
in front of course it's just as possible
these renders are based off incorrect
information so we wouldn't get too
excited yet based on previous leaks
we're expecting LG's Nexus phone to
feature a 5.2 inch display a 2700
battery a Snapdragon 808 processor and
run Android M rumour has a google is
also working with Huawei on a larger
Nexus handset that sports a 5.7 inch
frame a 3500 million battery and a
Snapdragon 810 chip so before we end
this video I want to thank our friends
over at Harry's shaving can be quite
expensive nowadays but fortunately our
friends over at Harry's can hook you up
with premium razors at non premium
prices their starter kit starts to just
fifteen dollars and that includes the
razor three blades and your choice of
Harry shave cream or foaming gel I
personally like the gel it feels nice on
my face as an added bonus you can get
five dollars off your first purchase by
using the code techno after using the
code you can also get an entire month of
Shaving for just ten dollars we aren't
expecting Google to nville its new Nexus
lineup until October when the company
typically reveals the latest version of
Android so that means there's still some
time left to finalize the design but not
very much thank you guys so much for
watching this episode of rumor roundup
anything that I talked about in this
video will be in the links down below if
you guys enjoyed this video make sure to
give it a thumbs up and we will see you
guys in the next 10
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
