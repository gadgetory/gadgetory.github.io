brought to you by domain.com hello
internet and book back the pisode of ass
the buffalo wall not physically a
buffalo it is my spirit animal and i
embody it's Buffalo eNOS on this episode
of asta Buffalo we got a ton of stuff to
talk about I'm just back from google i/o
I'm on my way to apple WWDC we got new
tech coming out a new OS is coming out
and all kinds of crazy stuff in between
let's jump right to the questions first
one comes from such off underscore at
john for lakers what is the best android
phone on verizon the best is totally
subjective to the pen on what's best for
you but i will say i am on verizon and i
bought a galaxy s6 edge so for me that
was the best foam but you can use an x 6
on verizon even by one of the unlocked
ones and put your sim card in and be
fine if you want a good deal the droid
turbo is still one of the better phones
out i don't fit up into your question
next one comes from at danger gross 09 @
john for lakers do you think Android M
is worth the upgrade hashtag asked the
bead answer is we don't know yet we
don't know what Android M is really
going to be when it comes out to full
release we've got a very very early
Developer Preview on I could advise
folks out there I'm all for running beta
software don't run the beta software and
use the phone as a daily driver it is
not be a pleasant experience for you at
least I would advise against it use it
if you have extra device if you want to
test it see what new features are coming
out a lot just wanna start developing
applications definitely wait until a
couple beta iterations before even
consider using it every day next one
comes from Fabio Estevez brother of
Emilio who asks at John for lakers do
you think Windows 10 will be better than
Mac os10 the new dell XPS 13 is amazing
but it still has windows again fastest
objective I will say Windows 10 is
definitely better than windows 8 and
windows 8.1 i've been using Windows 10
and its latest beta for about two weeks
I'm really enjoying it I always liked
the Start menu in Windows 8 I used the
surface and was pretty handy I very
rarely went back the desktop mode that's
a bit strange having it sort of in the
Start menu now but you can make it
fullscreen not apps aren't working all
that well right now we can see a lot of
potential of Windows 10 I've been using
the edge browser it's still called
project Spartan though in the current
beta it also works pretty well
the current logo it's going to look like
Internet Explorer logo i'm so i can
think i'm using it it doesn't work well
on if you're a fan of Windows 8 or sort
of debating going to Windows 8 I think
you're gonna really like Windows 10 you
got an idea for next great website
domain com has you covered they won't
hook you up with a great offer save
twenty percent on domain names and web
hosting when you use coupon code
TechnoBuffalo that's all capital letters
one word at domain coms check out I
think domain names think domain.com
expert comes from Adam Victor escu who
asked at drawn for lakers are you
planning on using the google photos a
personal backup collection the answer is
yes i am planning on it and i am i'm
someone like me two switches between iOS
and Android very regularly it was always
really hard to manage my pictures I used
to back up all of my iOS photos on to
onedrive and of course from Android
backed up to onedrive as well now though
I've malls syncing via google photos and
syncing really well so that was one of
the big problems i had from the
switching os's now that is no longer an
issue at all some happy google released
a really well featured very well
performing iOS version of course one on
Android works seamlessly sunday might go
to gallery app on android probably my go
to gallery up now on iOS haven't tried
it yet definitely should but be warned
though it does take a very long time to
upload your pictures and if you want it
to sink from iOS for me it didn't work
without the app open on the screen so
big battery drain come on leave it
plugged in and it sit for a few
hours my back up all of your photos next
one comes from kipper Busby who asks do
you think iOS I don't be a giant leap
forward I feel like every year I get
this question and I say yes this is
gonna be the one that we get widgets on
the home screen we get the ability to
hide icons we get some sort of app
drawer wait the ability to add a dial
director right to your home screen I get
so excited every year it doesn't happen
we get like new fonts and a new design
language so listen fool me once shame on
you fool me twice shame on me for me
three times shame on me for me full time
shame on me and for me five times still
still still shame on me so no more no it
is not going to be a huge jump for I'm
just going to hope I'm hope I'm wrong I
think we're probably going to see a more
refined bug free version of the I
that we've got right now in iOS 8
probably see some hints of what the next
iPhone is going to be probably see some
code for force touch in there but
certainly it's not going to be available
because phone zone support it right now
but I wouldn't expect that much
unfortunately with iOS 9 disappoint in
the past maybe I'm wrong I love to be
wrong but these figures are no longer
crossed much love anyway thank you guys
for watching an episode of acid buffalo
hope you guys enjoyed I love doing these
videos i love answering your questions
to be sure to keep asking them until
next time i'm john render from techna
buffalo and i will talk to you dear
friend a next video bye bye hey filming
yeah can you see the mic it's hardly
noticeable now think people are going to
say it edge like blends in with my shirt
it blends in yeah thought so too it's
hardly noticeable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
