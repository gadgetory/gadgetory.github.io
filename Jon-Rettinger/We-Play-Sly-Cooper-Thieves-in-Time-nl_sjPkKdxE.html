editor technobuffalo calm and i'm here
with Sly Cooper thieves in time for the
PlayStation 3
you
all right before things get going too
far you're gonna notice some jump cuts
in this game and that's because I
actually cut out the action where you're
gonna talk to Bentley you notice one
just before I started talking I just
rather than have you guys so you're
watching two characters talk about
what's going on in the game I figured
you'd rather see actual gameplay and see
what the game looks like in motion so
let's start with some general
information Sly Cooper thieves in time
is the fourth original slide game and
it's the first that we've seen since
2005 in 2005 Sucker Punch brought their
take on the sly universe to a close with
sly 3 honor among thieves that's it they
were done they moved on from slide to
infamous and then the sly series was
handed over to sons are games Sanzaru
games started their take on sly with the
sly cooper collection i think is called
the sly collection it's the HD
collection that's available on the
PlayStation 3 and when Sony and sucker
punch saw that song Zara was up to the
challenge of making sly games they gave
them slide 4 and songs ro came up with
Sly Cooper thieves in time that's what
you're watching right now so this game
is the same for both the PlayStation 3
and the PS Vita it's pretty much an
exact same game on both platforms of
course the PS Vita's environments aren't
nearly as rich in detailed as they are
on the ps3 but the geometry is the same
while the texture is just not as rich
sly 4 has a nice cross Play feature so
if you buy the game on the ps3 you get
the PS Vita version for free you'll be
able to upload and download saves to the
cloud so you'll play for a bit on the
ps3 save your game and pick up right
where you left off on the PS Vita it's
really nice I've had this game for like
24 hours since I actually recorded this
video not on the day that it's uploading
but and I switch devices constantly the
Cross Play feature has been fantastic
for me and just a reminder though you
only get the PS Vita version for free if
you buy the PlayStation 3 version first
just work the other way around the ps3
version sells for 40 bucks while the
Vita version sells for 30 I wish I could
tear them
here's weakling of the West
I don't think vain begins to describe
this guy looking good why it's an
improvement I'll name this one the
homely buckaroo
what could a sheriff puts up posters of
himself Wow fly you made him look even
worse I love a challenge I call it 10 *
loser
this guy's a real egomaniac so if you
haven't noticed yet for some reason I'm
currently exploring a wild west themed
world you start out in present-day sly
universe and the ex the second world
that you encounter is this Japanese
theme world basically the whole deal
behind Sly Cooper and I'm not really
trying to give anything away at the
story too much with these we play videos
but it's slyness gang or going back in
time to solve a mystery so and all the
way you go out of your way to meet up
with your ancestors with slice ancestors
so you'll find Cooper's from different
areas in the world's history rescue them
and then use them in the game if you've
played a lot of Sly Cooper in the past
maybe if you haven't half the fun lies
and playing with the characters and
using their unique abilities so you'll
use Bentley he's the wheelchair wielding
turtle he's pretty awesome he's got
logic gives most gadgets tech and some
side quests and mini-games or maybe
you'll play as Murray the giant hippo
who just is really a big brawler or sly
who's the sneaker kind of more acrobatic
basically it's all about experiencing
their different and unique mechanics and
that continues for sliced ancestors so
while they generally control like Sly
Cooper himself they have the same like
slinky feeling the ancient groupers
bring different abilities to the table
and that's what makes them fun to find
and a lot of fun to use and this early
in the game the only ancestor that I
found is the Japanese ancestor and after
him I'm actually trying to find
Tennessee Cooper who is the I think he's
a bank robber basically in the Western
era of sly's ancestral line
but
ah
playing Sly Cooper complete with its
sometimes terrible voice work and cheesy
humors pretty much like taking an
interactive Saturday morning cartoon
it's childish it's silly it's easy and
it really brings about this feeling of
kind of being a kid again I don't know
we're pretty much in an era of shooted
stuff constantly for games so it's been
really nice for me to fire at the
PlayStation 3 and PS Vita in order to
play something a little more
lighthearted I like simple games like
these that the type of games I grew up
with don't get me wrong I love shooters
too but it's just kind of nice to play
something that's a lot easier to deal
with I guess so embarrasses are not our
official review will be doing that in
written form on TechnoBuffalo calm in
the coming weeks but so far i can easily
recommend Sly Cooper thieves in time to
gamers like me if you grew up playing
old platformers and loving them with
either easy controls goofy storylines
and friendly aesthetics this one's for
you it really feels like an old
playstation game like crash bandicoot
jak and Daxter Ratchet and Clank and it
feels like an old sly cooper game too
it's a nice reminder of the way games
used to be and I'm really enjoying it
for that so far
my name is joey davidson and you've been
watching me play Sly Cooper thieves in
time like I said we'll have our full
review of the game up on TechnoBuffalo
soon thanks for watching
I can't believe this guy has an
appreciation festival forum say ok
there's the banner I just need to knock
those clothes dibs on I'll beautifier
his boss that is the scribble lolly even
a blonde I've been looking for ah well
amigo that you just put yourself in
permanent room in this Tony Lanza</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
