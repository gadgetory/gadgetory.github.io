beautiful Berlin taking in the sights
it's the Brandenburg Gate behind me but
the beautiful scenery is not the only
reason that I am here I came to check
out Vash connected world well they're
showing the future of the connected
world what I want to see most was how
they're gonna try to solve problems and
ideal what they're probably you deal
with on a daily basis things like trying
to find parking spots and it's like
dealing with traffic which is absolutely
insane in Southern California and a lot
of other problems that we can in
everyday life so I'm gonna check out the
scenes and I'm gonna show you what is
new from Bosch connected worlds stay
tuned
so to answer these problems we've got
Bosh's vision of essentially connected
parking so a couple of cool things are
going on here first the parking garage
is actually what's made smart you pull
your car in you poked your registered
area you get out of your car you open
your smartphone you push a button and
your car goes and parks itself and then
you come back and you push a button in
your car comes back to you that is
incredibly cool and there's actually a
real live demo of that that was going on
here this technology that's coming and
it's not just coming to one manufacturer
it's not just for Mercedes or BMW this
technology that's going to work across
all cars which is pretty awesome to see
almost every form of locking is getting
smart and my home
I've got smart locks but car keys seem
to have had some incredible staying
power and Bosch is looking to pretty
much kill them here with completely
keyless cars and way it works pretty
obviously it's gonna use your phone as a
key we've seen that before
but what Bosch is doing they're taking
the problems associated with that and
just kind of making them be like not big
deal issues so first you could send keys
to other people so if your wife or a
valet want to drive the car you could
send a key to them totally wirelessly
through the cloud they'll get it on
their phone it's gonna remember your
seating location so it'll know that it's
John's phone that's being paired at the
car it'll go ahead and call my seat
settings where they are so things like
that are super cool and as you step away
from the car and you leave what Bosch is
calling the locking zones your car
automatically lock you get a
notification on your phone saying yeah
your car is is indeed locked so you may
have heard of blockchain regards to
cryptocurrency but the blockchain tech
is used for way more watch actually
using it for the used car market to make
sure that your odometer is actually
accurate amount of miles you have on the
car is what it's going to say every time
to drive in your car it's going to add
to the blockchain what your actual
mileage is when you go to sell the car
that is verifiable by somebody who wants
to buy it and you get a little tag like
this scan the code and then the person
who purchases the car can actually know
and verify that what you're telling them
is honest and
right pretty cool so I'm just
nonchalantly hanging out in ni 3 but I
Drive an EEV at home and anybody who's
driven an Eevee knows there's a problem
with having like 30 different providers
for different stations and you got to
carry four or five different RFID tags
you've got different apps on your phone
it's really annoying and cumbersome to
just do simple things like charge your
car when you got to get somewhere
another way problems are being solved
Bosch is actually taking the majority of
those OMS that run the charging stations
and especially in Europe and they're
making one app that can control
everything for you and they're gonna
handle all the backend stuff you just
roll up to a station use your one app
and charge your car it's a pretty novel
solution but it's crazy a thing like
something like that didn't exist talked
a lot about my family I have two kids at
home for and two what's crazy about
seeing all the stuff here Bosch
connector world it's all on the cusp of
happening my kids are probably never
going to drive a car they're probably
never be behind the wheel of an
automobile wheels William be a thing
that are there they're not gonna have to
park their car they're gonna grow up in
a world where all of this technology
exists and it's awesome to be right at
the cusp of when that paradigm shift is
going to happen and events like this are
what are going to change the world I
think we are gonna completely take for
granted in 10 or 15 years so what I show
here is like a fraction of what's going
on at Bosch connected world I filmed
another video going to a lot more detail
of things that are happening here it's a
hackathon the connected parking I talked
to some engineers that are making this
magic happen if you want to learn more I
think we definitely should link to the
video down below it live on Basha
channel we can just check out and learn
way more about all the awesome stuff
that's going on here at Bosch connecting
worlds
I'll be the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
