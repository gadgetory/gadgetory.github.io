to you by Harry's just going on guys a
m√§rklin Sangha from TechnoBuffalo and
it's another Tuesday show but instead of
doing the usual comparison video i
thought i'd share what's on my wish list
for the nexus 6 and we're all curious on
what google has for us in the future so
let's get on with the video now the
first thing i'd really love to see in
the nexus 6 is probably a more
affordable price tag we all know how
cheap the Nexus 5 is already coming in
at only three hundred fifty dollars for
a 16 gigabyte version without a contract
but ever since the oneplus one was
announced with its flagship like specs
an incredibly low price of just three
hundred fifty dollars for a 64 gigabyte
variant you can sort of say it's a
direct competition to the Nexus 5 if
Google were to offer a 32 gigabyte
standard or 64 gigabyte next to 64 $350
or somewhere around that price range
then Google will definitely steal back
the spotlight for the best cheap
flagship phone the next thing on my list
would probably better build quality and
I'm not gonna lie I'm a big fan of the
matte finish and high quality plastic
design that the nexus 5 offers
definitely a lot better than galaxy s5
in my opinion having used a one plus one
and a daily basis on the other hand I
think who can definitely improve in this
category the one plus one is still made
out of plastic just like the Nexus 5 but
they added that little umph of luxury
lining the phone with silver plastic
bezels which gives the phone a bit more
of a premium feel now probably the most
important one of my list is a better
camera because who doesn't want to see a
better camera on a nexus phone the nexus
5's camera is ok even with all the
updates that google has pushed out over
the past several months it was only a
slight improvement that didn't really
change the way how i shoot photos in the
Nexus 5 it's not the worst on the market
right now but when you have phones like
the g3 and the galaxy s5 it's pretty
clear that the nexus is due for an
upgrade so Google really needs to spend
a lot of time on its software and
hardware before it can come closer to
competitors let's take a quick break
from this video and thank our friends at
Harry's alright alright made
reservations already stopped by the dry
cleaners what else am I missing shoot I
have to shave this ridiculous short no
hair face of mine good thing I have
Harry's I save five dollars off my first
purchase by using the promo code techno
$15 got me a set that includes a handle
three blades and a shave cream shipped
to my door they
even let me initial my razor just in
case my dirty roommate wants to shave
his back again now what are my date
talking points so did you know Harry is
less than a year old and is already
disrupting the shaving industry offering
a better shaving experience a better
value than giants like chick and
Gillette the company makes amazing
german engineer blades and he cares so
much about the quality of the shave that
they just purchased the 93 year old
German factory that makes them Jeff the
co-founder also co-founded Warby Parker
and there's so many similarities in its
disruptive model which emphasizes great
design meticulous craftsmanship amazing
value in highly personal and dedicated
customer service yeah she is gonna love
that she's gonna love that now jumping
back to the video next would be a
Snapdragon 805 processor with three
gigabytes of RAM it seems like the
Snapdragon 805 chips or the next crop of
processors that are going to take over
the next generation of Android devices
and if that's true especially with
Android L coming later this year with
art now being the default runtime you
should see some buttery smooth
animations and performance throughout
the whole OS with that constant 60
frames per second that Google's
promising last but not least a bigger
battery I've been using the oneplus one
as my daily driver and it changed the
way I use my phone especially coming
from using an iphone 5s the three
thousand one hundred million battery on
a one plus one is just amazing and
hopefully we'll see something similar in
the next Nexus and even though it does
take advantage of wireless charging
technology we'd still love to see a
slight bump in that department a force
would Android I'll support in project
Volta we should expect an even better
battery performance than we've seen in
the past now I did want to mention the
form factor of the Nexus 5 before ending
this video and if Google chooses to keep
the same form factor is the current
Nexus 5 which I feel is the perfect size
then I wouldn't mind that at all there
have been rumors that the Nexus 6 could
include things like a 2.5 k display
microSD slot front-facing speakers and
even a fingerprint scanner but I don't
think these features will make it to the
next Nexus if Google wants to keep the
price down they've also been rumors
Motorola could be in charge of the Nexus
6 which means we might see features like
active display and always listening
technology and I think these would
definitely be welcoming features so I
really hope they make it into the device
when it launches anyways that's it for
this video guys let us know what you'd
want to see in the Nexus 6 and as always
a marked on Sega from technobuffalo I'll
see you guys in the next video
