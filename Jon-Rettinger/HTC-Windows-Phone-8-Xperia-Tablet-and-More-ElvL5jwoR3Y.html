to you by carbonite samsung's got a new
tablet for students sony's got a new
tablet for somebody i guess and HTC has
got a bunch of new windows phone 8
devices or maybe i'm just making the
whole thing up you can't tell that's why
it's not a new show it's a rumor show
it's technol buffalo's rumor roundup
round them all up hey what's the word
everybody i'm noah crowds from
technobuffalo and this is rumor roundup
TechnoBuffalo on revision3 i'm bringing
you the craziest highfalutin made up
rumors okay not really but the most
interesting rumors from the world of
consumer technology for the week ending
today friday august 10 2012 first up it
looks like samsung may be teaming up
with best buy or at least best buy is
going to be carrying the new samsung
galaxy tab 7 student edition bundle in
the very near future reports from
earlier this week have samsung packaging
the galaxy tab 2 7 point oh that's the 7
inch version of the current galaxy tab
the reports have samsung packaging that
up with a keyboard dock and some sort of
a hub type connector for USB devices
something that i'll let you plug USB
things into the galaxy tab so you can
use them I hope the sleeve it's just a
paperweight right these reports also
have the new bundle debuting at best buy
stores on August sixteenth which is next
thursday a couple of interesting notes
about this number one and maybe
samsung's way of fighting the recently
introduced google nexus 7 the asuste
made 199 dollar android tablet at
debuted at Google i/o has been getting
all kinds of rave reviews and two it may
also be a way of clearing out some
inventory ahead of the rumored launch
date and interesting enough from hearing
the same August sixteenth launch over in
Hong Kong for the new Galaxy Note 10.1 a
tablet ified or S Pen tified version if
you will of the 10-inch gal
you know no word just yet on a galaxy
note seven point oh who knows maybe
we'll get the 10 inch tablet with the
pen the 7 inch tablet no pen but you get
a free keyboard dock and then you get
the phablet at five inches or maybe
there's something else coming down the
road it's just you can't keep up with
the tablets these days but August 16
seems to be a big day for samsung
tablets so keep your eyes appealed to
TechnoBuffalo speaking of tablets some
rumors also coming out this week some
leaked photos of what is apparently the
Sony Xperia Tablet some leaked photos
showing a curved design taken from
Sony's last generation of tablets but
this is just a regular slate just with
some curve design elements to it as far
as we can tell anyway it looks like this
device will hit in September for around
four hundred fifty dollars and feature a
quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor a
nine point four inch display at 1280 x
800 resolution dual cameras and 16 gigs
of onboard memory again looking for the
sony xperia tablet to launch sometime in
September also just in time for back to
school speaking of coming back we'll be
right back you see how I did that I just
took the word back and pivoted so all
context was lost but I jumped right into

least it looks like the smartphone wars
are about to heat up again also just in
time for vexille everything that's run
out back to school it's just kind of
never mind you don't need a rant for me
rumours last week or the week before I
can't even keep track anymore had Nokia
prepping to unveil their first batch of
windows phone 8 devices in early
September then we had September 12th
pegged as the iphone the next iphone
release date and now we've got reports
that HTC is prepping a trio of its own
windows phone 8 devices for launch you
guessed it in September reports pointing
to the third week of sep tember for a
possible launch from HTC of three
devices including zenith is expected to
feature a 4.7 inch super lcd2 display
with an eight megapixel camera and a
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
now originally Microsoft had talked
about the first windows phone 8 devices
coming out in November but given the
recent news about the apple iphone
launched in September it might be the
Microsoft is looking to push things up
get Windows Phone 8 out there before or
as soon after the new iphone as possible
whatever the case one thing we know for
sure there will be more smartphones
launched this year that's fact this is a
rumor show but breaking news that's fact
there will be new smartphones probably
from Apple and Microsoft maybe couple
from google on its partners to all right
that's going to do it for the roundup
for this week again thanks for our
friends over at Carbonite the
cloud-based online backup solution for
sponsoring this week's episode thanks to
the kids at rev3 for having us thanks to
you for watching and if you missed it
episode number two of renders rants his
online John renders new show where he
just talks a whole bunch of smack about
something this week John's thoughts on
the apple vs samsung court case that has
everybody who has nothing better to do
because they can't get the olympics to
stream because NBC's Olympic streaming
coverage it's just kind of messed up
talking what now it made sense trust me
play it back it made sense till next
week my name is Noah Kravitz we'll see

your feet on the ground keep making
stuff up alright
