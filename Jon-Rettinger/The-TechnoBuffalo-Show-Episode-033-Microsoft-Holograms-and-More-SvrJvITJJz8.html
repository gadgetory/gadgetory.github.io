episode 33 I'm live your two heads for
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of the
site and i'm joining bags they could
have editor mobile Todd Hazleton
everybody are you doing today Todd I'm
good you've had an exciting week it has
been and surprisingly so considering who
the event was yeah we had Microsoft
yesterday and i'm not saying microsoft
isn't exciting i'm just saying it hasn't
been one of those companies where you're
expecting like crazy ground breaking
news out of like you get it windows
phone announcements are fun and you get
some like some revamps user interface
and stuff like that windows 8 was pretty
big but it wasn't a company that ever
had like one more thing and in fact
yesterday had two more things um it was
really fun event actually and i think i
wrote an editorial on the site but you
know microsoft's not really boring
anymore and I'm not saying Microsoft was
boring but I guess I am it was like it
when you think of Microsoft you think of
cloud storage and enterprise and windows
and you're like yeah you know I use
Microsoft products all over the place
all the time xbox one Windows Windows
Phone here and there and but I've never
just been like wow and yesterday I think
there were a couple moments turning
event well during the event when they
first showed the Microsoft hologram and
the hololens you know we were all on a
skype call as we always are during an
event and you know you and I were an
agreement you know oh this is a dream
it's not you know it'll never get
released and all that and then for them
to come and go well we've gotta release
time frame and we kill we've got some
battles I said yesterday when they
started talking about halal and so I was
like oh Stone Sean like that it's it's
definitely hooked up to a full computer
right now there's no way things in
launcher soon then they're like oh no
it's going to launch in the windows 10
timeframe which i think means Windows 10
time frame and maybe not with windows 10
launches but exactly and later this year
2016 exactly i mean when
time frame could be three years four
years so this does not mean that the
hololens is coming out on the same day
as Windows 10 it could be a year later
it could be a year and a half later we
don't know yet but apparently the folks
that saw it were really impressed by
what they saw though I heard they were
using very early prototypes and they had
to have a pack of battery like a big
thing around their neck and stuff like
that so it makes you wonder I its
prototype phase I I can forgive them for
that right now the the possible
implications though the use cases of
hololens when they showed in the demo
video and this oddly enough is the most
exciting thing to me it was the daughter
and father talking and her fixing her
plumbing right and him drying yo this is
what you're going to tighten in these
two spots and the arrows appeared for
her you take that and you can apply it
to medical mm-hmm you know a specialist
dr. you know thousands of miles away
could you know be going there right
there that's where the problem is right
you know that that was mind-boggling to
me the practice and yes it was believe
me it was a lot of fun seeing the
minecraft kill situation but the
potential life-saving capabilities of
this were mind-boggling to me and you
know to me this is the sort of thing
that you know whenever we watch
futuristic movies this is the sort of
thing that I always knew was going to
come along someday yeah just went yeah
exactly exactly so I'm hopeful I'm
excited for it I think it will be great
you know if they can get out of course
the big the big huge elephant in the
room is how much is it going to cost
right yeah yeah so I don't know it's
going to be interesting to see as for
the rest of the day interesting to say
the least saying
you know for those for those that don't
know my history I did use Microsoft as
my operating system and I I say that
instead of windows is my operating
system because I did actually start back
on tech space das I I'm nano two kids
yeah I use Microsoft for 25 years and
before I switch to max and there's still
some things this is such a small thing
and not worthy being brought up at an
event like that have they improved the
update system at all yeah that was one
of the biggest annoyances to me with
Microsoft products here you'd go to shut
down your computer hi I have 23 updates
to install and you can't turn me off
till I'm done yep that's I mean that
happens to me all the time on my pc it's
it's not and it drives me nuts too
because you don't know how long it can
take sometimes 20 minutes I'm like what
am I you know yeah exactly exactly yeah
so I I want to see you know i'm excited
for Windows 10 but I want to see that
little things like that have been taken
care of yeah one of the things that I'm
most excited about is it I said this the
day before to on I guess it was Tuesday
an editorial saying like Microsoft needs
to take advantage of this ecosystem they
have and actually make it an ecosystem
and I think that's what a big message I
walked away from yesterday is is that
Windows 10 is the heart of this whole
ecosystem so I mean they even said
Windows 10 on xbox which sounds like you
know they're just going to call the
software on xbox Windows 10 but they are
going to make it easy for developers who
are making pc apps support them to it to
xbox which is awesome and then you know
Cortana's going to expand from the
desktop your phone one drive everywhere
they finally have a good photos app it
looks like which is one of the I mean
one drive is ugly I love it because it's
pretty reliable in Microsoft has a good
reputation with cloud storage but it's
ugly and it's pretty unbearable to use
but if you need your files they're there
and it sounds like you know they're
going to revamp it with the photos the
floating keyboard was really interesting
I think that suggests where you see some
tablets some new Windows Phone phablets
and should put just overall tying all of
these into an ecosystem
where you know Skype is now built in a
messenger sort of the way Facebook was
at one time in Windows Phone and I think
that'll serve it seems like it's almost
like they're I message sort of so you
can get your messages across platforms
everywhere powered by skype but not
necessarily inside of state hey you know
one funny thing to me yesterday when
they were showing on the hololens you
mentioning skype made me think of it you
know so they show the woman walkie and
the skype calls like floating next door
yeah where's the camera showing her to
the other person yeah good question even
think about that yeah so it loves
there's a camera the you know they're
coming out with a hover camera that's
going to float with you right she was
out in front of you yeah there's gonna
be all these people walk around with
quadcopters floating in front of them
with cameras so they can do skype calls
yeah but i'll take your call in a minute
i just have to launch the quad attach my
camera yeah I very very very tiny thing
but it's just like wait about how are
they seeing her yeah doesn't work but it
yeah overall yesterday was exciting and
Sasha bahal has a question here about uh
you know asking what we thought
witnessed him but also the question and
where did windows 9 go we've heard
rumors we why it's not called windows 9
and I'll take this one I think those
were debunked right but we can tell the
story the story is that there were a
number of programs that's were written
to ignore anything like windows 95
windows 98 and that all those would have
to be rewritten if they called it
windows 9 now some have debunked it but
I know enough about technology to go it
sounds kind of possible so we don't know
I mean Microsoft stories that it's such
a big update that they want to go with
Windows 10 it still seems a little odd
you know
course but I can see where they're
coming from with this message right like
when do this aid was trashed all over
the place by people who liked windows 7
and i think you know they want to put
this like new you know breath of fresh
air into windows and they're doing that
with all the new features and tying it
into a real ecosystem and i think that's
maybe why they went with windows and it
just sounds a lot sexier to me the
windows 9 like this just crossed my mind
is we were having this discussion do you
think it has anything to do with
marketing OS 10 windows 9 oh we're not
quite where Mack is yeah it sounds like
that I mean that would make sense that
pure pure speculation folks pure
speculation but it just dawned on me
that would that would mean windows would
still sound like it was behind Mac right
I don't know possibility who knows I
think at this point OS 10 is just what
they call it I I don't honestly I don't
know if there ever will be in OS 11 yeah
who knows his closet it wouldn't be
quite as sexy with an OSX I yeah Oh Lord
but no you bring up some very good
points about you know I think a lot of
people had begun to think of Microsoft
is boring it wasn't necessarily that
they really were it just felt like it
because they weren't hitting us in the
face with anything that was massively
innovative and they changed that
yesterday I mean the and also the
ecosystem the fact that you know I could
now potentially stream an Xbox game to a
PC or tablet I still question that
tablet part a lot I really want to see
these specifics on that yeah the
hardware although Sony does it with
their experience so possible brace and
Franco just left a comment and then
apple introduces OS 11 in June knowing
my luck probably well that's actually a
really good point because I think one of
the things that Microsoft has struggled
with in the past is being quick to these
these sort of updates so while it
disgusting yesterday when is it actually
going to hit consumers and we know that
they said some of this stuff like
Cortana on the desktop I think like four
or five or three to five months right
and that's just for the preview and I
think Google and Apple have been in the
past a little more nimble to be like
okay well here's ours and it's out like
so for example we don't have Syria on
the desktop now but that doesn't mean
that Apple's not going to have it at you
so that's a good point well I do think
Google's already has you know Google now
is already in chrome can see how Google
and get that going but no hololens was
definitely the one more thing playing
yesterday it was mind-boggling and I
hope I really do hope it comes to market
I mean we've seen too many times over
the years where things have been
promised and then they don't end up
coming I this to me it I find it so
hilarious that this was announced in
early 2015 when you go back to back to
the future to Marty McFly you know his
sudden 2050 was using a kit lens that
was somewhat like this yeah we're a
little behind but not by much right I I
do think it was hilarious that they
admitted that they've been hiding the
work on this in the visitors and it is
either center-right the basement of the
visitor center so all those people
walking ahead we're like on top of one
of Microsoft's biggest secrets yeah that
that just made me chuckle it doesn't
really mean thing but a mate's me
chuckle right from Sasha Mahal if you
were to choose one of the three to get
which would you choose microsoft
hololens oculus rift or Google glass and
why um well I've used the oculus rift I
just use the latest one at CES and I
really really liked it i thought it was
amazing so i think i'd go with that just
cuz it's the one I've seen but hololens
looked awesome I think they're kind of
like different use cases and a little
bit in the sense that I saw the reports
that hollow lens you can see through it
it's augmented reality as well but
although I gets the Mars come
they had you actually feel like you're
on Mars where you weren't really seeing
through the lens but oculus rift to me
was just incredibly immersive and i
remember at CES was standing on an alien
planet looking at a lia in the face I
was like whoa this is like unreal no I
don't know I'd have to try all the ones
before I said it but definitely one of
those to you over google glass I've
never really really been impressed by
Google s III haven't used any of the
three I think the only reason i would
say hololens / oculus rift is simply
because of the interactivity and the
potential use cases for design and you
know like I said the medical use cases
and so on but also as a gamer I really
really want to I oculus rift yeah I know
I I know everyone's good but Sean you
were at CES again folks I don't get out
well I bet CES everyone comes back to
the art little room and goes Sean you
wouldn't believe what we just saw I'd
love to see it myself too bad so they're
dead yeah and all these was hard to see
us cuz you to schedule appointments so
we actually went one day and scheduled
the appointment for the following day so
it's little right yeah so I always that
cool I can't wait to walk around like a
like an MMO or something one of these
huge games with it yeah yeah exactly I i
I'm just excited that we're finally
getting to this point now until you know
a little blue lady appears in front of
me in a robe and yo tells me your father
you might we work together in the Clone
Wars I also i can't think of the stupid
line but yes until a little princess
leia shows up in front of me you know
and tells me that I'm the only hope yeah
I'm sorry we're not in the future yes
not there yet right yeah we're not
through a little bit off topic but kind
of interesting from verse and Franco
mind-boggling question out of making
deals with carriers where do phone shops
get their supplies you know that's
actually something that's crossed my
mind as well at times i'm talking like
phone shops like a mom-and-pop phone
shop yeah i think they buy them
yeah like did they buy him directly from
the manufacturer or do they get through
a hotel chain I would guess a wholesale
chain I think that's how they do it I
think so too I I think that's why you
see people at CES is like buyers to so
they'll go check out the cases they want
to put near shops and stuff like that I
speaking of that did you notice and
maybe it was just me I don't sell a lot
more buyers yeah yeah yeah and that they
were like mom and pop stores that never
heard of or you know they were computer
repair shops mm-hmm it was really I was
thrilled that means the the markets
healthy but it was just really puzzling
to me I saw so many more buyers this
time yeah I think that's how they do it
through wholesale yeah I think so as
well who knows uh from David Nunez what
do you guys make of the HTC m9 leaks I
thought they were fairly legit until I
saw the m9 max leaks thanks yeah we just
covered the anigh max uh actually I
think it's a night plus was yeah yeah um
same idea though I don't know what to
think of them I think it she sees gonna
have a busy Mobile World Congress um in
early March they said that much at least
but their invites for the press
conference so I think it's about time
we're going to see one of these or maybe
both but if you remember when the max
came out it was several months after the
original one so I think and that was
with the m7 so they didn't do a max last
year so i'm not really sure what to
think except for i think we'll see new
hardware from HTC next month yeah so do
i I just mark what exactly yeah March
time is flying by but I don't know it's
going to be interesting to see what HTC
has a bit sleeve I mean the MA was a
great phone yeah yeah I it's gonna be
there I have to go a long way for me to
look at the m9 and go wow this is ill a
massive upgrade the m8 is awesome yeah
I'd like to see quad HD
um I like to see you know I don't like
HTC's done a lot with their camera but
i'm not sure i'm crazy about what
they've done with the ultrapixel stuff
that you okay imma set up I think I'd
like to see a really good image sensor
on it that takes big pictures to and if
you look at things like what was the
other one that just came out the HTC one
I or the I desire I um it had a 13
megapixel camera but it's not like one
of the best cameras out there it's kind
of far from it so I'd really like them
to invest in a really nice camera on the
back that's not ultra fixed but we'll
see from David noon is where is Joey
it's after csn Oh Joey Joey is coming
back Joey is just extremely busy it's
also it's hard for us to get any three
technobuffalo people together at once
because it's taking three people out of
writing yes have stuff on the site yeah
so I think the show is probably going to
stick it to I like it with three but
it's just it's more sensible with only
two because that doesn't mean I'm
pulling three people away from working
on the site but Joey still around my
promise um let's see here what else have
we got coming we got a bunch coming in
here to do from brazen Franco I can
answer this why not stream desktop games
to the Xbox it makes so much more sense
that way Phil Spencer after the event
yesterday while talking to the press
said they are investigating that it's
just not feasible yet but they are
looking into the possibility of doing
that so it's on Microsoft's radar yeah
if you think about it nvidia does that
they could do that so the technology
exists right yeah yeah it's just let's
let them get something started and then
they can refine it I also think like
they probably I mean obviously they want
to push pc games too but they're trying
here is sort of like push this xbox as
part of the ecosystem to start the only
here is a reason if you own an xbox
here's a reason why you should buy a
Windows PC also and I get that you could
do it both ways
I don't think everybody's going out
there and buying windows gaming PC's
because they can be expensive and stuff
but here's why you might buy a
three-hundred-dollar Windows tablet too
because you can stream from your xbox to
it that's that's what how I whatever
dude yeah exactly well we shall see uh
from saw Raja when do you think the
hollands will become available for
everyone I have no idea yeah I don't
know I'd say two years but what do I
know I two years is kind of what's been
sticking in my head as well especially I
had read about the fact they were having
to wear battery packs to do the demos
yesterday so obviously they've got some
work to do but i guess the ones on stage
were legitimate so i don't know like one
but why weren't the press able to play
with those because they look cool I
don't know she may have had a battery
pack hidden under her shirt yeah who
knows I although I didn't see any wires
running to it right yeah I I was a
little disappointed after she you know
designed the quadcopter on stage and
they brought up a 3d printed one I was
like okay you're basically telling me
that was not a live demo right yeah it
wasn't like girl yeah they implied it
was a live demo and now I'm my oke it
looks just like what she designed yeah I
three from these don't work that quickly
yeah they could have brought something
else out 3d print said and you know she
designed this earlier and look what we
were able to do bringing out the exact
same item I thought was a little yeah a
little questionable but yeah yeah we'll
see I don't know oh let's see here from
off topic from social hall which movies
and games are you looking forward to
this year avengers age of ultron star
wars the force awakens i'm kind of
excited for Mad Max fury road we'll
we'll see I mean it from what I've heard
it's just like a 90-minute car chase
imagine that from a bad
max movie um game was honest I haven't
heard much in gaming that's
exciting me yet the fame will they
showed yesterday looked pretty good yeah
called the full name Microsoft showed it
and it was cross platform to so PC and
Xbox can play together thugs need I
don't know I have so many games I need
to catch up on that I haven't really
like been like looking forward to gates
cuz there's already a lot of ones that I
still want to flip oh I have a stack of
games I need to get through I I've been
playing far cry 4 as you know and you
know I think I'm probably two hours the
game yeah that I've been playing a ton
of Destiny so ya know what I don't know
if we're that excited for new stuff we
gotta get through the old stuff first
yeah it like crazy uh speaking of far
cry 4 from brazen Franco what happened
to the twitch channel it's been a long
time since Joey's last session with far
cry 4 twitch we're not done with it it
simply was a matter of things got
extremely busy that we got into the
holidays then we got into c s and
brandon is actually the one who's
managing the twitch channel and he and I
have been talking about how to get it
going again it's not something we've
abandoned we definitely it's still on
our radar it's just been a matter of
time unfortunately you know it's a nice
concept but it's also you're like oh I
need to write three more articles or go
play games for an hour and yes well we'd
love to go play games for an hour you
know you also all want articles on the
site so it's been a trade off again
without have to be written in energy
confirm that all kinds of stuff exactly
so that the twitch channel is not dead
it's just oughta brief hiatus while we
try to figure out our strategy around a
little bit better ah let's see here Oh
lots of questions came in well doing
that one uh oh interesting from David
noon is Sean Todd what are the top three
things you hate in the top three things
you love about being a journalist more
specifically a technology journalist
hmm yeah that's actually a really deep
question um I love writing editorials I
love playing with the gadgets which
often influences sort of what I want to
write about for editorials and I love
meeting with people in the industry that
means other journalists and all the PR
people because you don't see them all
the time but you interact over email a
lot but I see especially other
journalists it's great hanging out with
people when you get dinner or something
at a trade show top three things I hate
I'd say let's be careful there no I feel
like missing news like if you know for
whatever reason I'm eating lunch in and
use hits and I just didn't see it or
something that's never happened Todd
yeah it always seems like every time I
go to the bathroom news hits that's it
oh and every time I swear you guys have
a pressure plate in my seat because
every time I get to go to the restroom
my im's go off yeah so one of those um
missing an event for some reason you
know like either we weren't on the list
but we should have been or something
like that that that's that can be
frustrating and there oh I like
traveling to put that at the top for
things hmm I don't know I can't think of
many things that I hate because
otherwise I wouldn't be doing it yeah
and that's a very good point I mean I
definitely hate the number of emails we
get I and that's I it's just part of
life but I inbox zero as a dream it
never will never happen um like Todd I
hate when we're not aware of a piece of
news you know when we should be you know
if it's even if we learn about three
minutes later it annoys me that we
didn't have it at that time it's just a
matter of there's so much news at times
um as for a third thing I hate I'll come
back on that three things i love i love
the crew i work with you know i love
the company and the crew you know I
wouldn't be here this is actually the
longest I've ever worked for anyone
other than myself yeah because I had my
camera crew 15 and a half years and I've
been here for five years now and before
that I think the longest I never worked
anywhere else was two years and I only
left that job because the magazine
folded uh um let's see what else do I
love um travel I mean I don't get to
travel nearly as much as some of the
other guys they all think I'm some sort
of lunch been an important around here
but I do love to travel i love seeing
new sights i'm having trouble coming up
with a third love and a third hate the
plane with all the gadgets that's always
fun oh I I know what my third hate is
when we know about something we can't
discuss it oh yeah that stuff it it's
not it's not so much as I hate it is
it's just annoying it's just part of the
business but yo will will officially
learn about so they're like and you
can't say anything I want to tell people
uh no I don't they call that background
so like if I'm meeting with company a
and they're like they're talking about
one product and you're like and just for
some background this one's coming out in
two months but and you like that's
that's kind of off the record I mean
it's very much off the record there's
nothing I can do about that yeah yeah
exactly it and so the number of times we
hear off the record or like temper 30 I
get to say that wife you could have
skipped saying that yeah but no I I love
this job I love everyone I work with
even todd todd no actually you know
about Ralph's of my new theory we blame
everything that goes wrong on Brandon
haha yeah it anything and everything
that goes wrong he and I just I am each
other in all caps Brandon Brandon
even a branded not there that day even
if you had nothing to do with it blame
everything on Brandon hey it works Hey
oh good question from brazen Franco will
there be a review of the zou me or show
me however you say that word me notes
and meizu mx4 s probably not the reason
being simply because it's right now
they're China only so it's not really a
market that we cater to simply because
they just don't read our site and
secondly also being able to get them
yeah if we can get them we will yes you
mais use a little easier show me he's a
little more difficult for unless we buy
them but right and that which is a
possibility but you know it's a lot of
people watching us review those let us
know you know and if there's enough of
you out there you know we can go out and
buy one but you know for right now it's
just not certain that it's something we
need to cover you know we can pretty
much sort of see the demand for these
when we write news on them and stuff
like that and if people aren't clicking
them then we sort of think well is this
something we want to review and if we do
like why do we want to spend that time
with people don't seem to be interested
so that's sort of how we judge what
we're doing right and it's not even if
we have to go out and buy honestly that
the financial cost is the smallest part
of our consideration when we have to go
out by a phone it's also them because we
do have our personal rule that phones
must be used you know for X number of
days before we review them you know so
that's time consuming then there's also
the time consumption of writing shooting
the photos if we decide to do a video
then there's the video production yeah
you know so there's a lot of resources
that go into a review and if it's a
phone that are our customer you know I
call customers readers whatever you want
to call them if our readers are not
showing an interest in that device then
it's not really worth all the resources
that we sink into the review
unfortunately mmhmm yeah I believe me I
we would
love to review every phone out there but
I think also some of us would start to
consider leaping off buildings you know
if we did review you know hey this new
flip phone came in could you review it
yeah actually then we would hire my
father to do the Flip and make him do
the flip phones cuz he refuses to use
anything other than a flip phone I think
it's slightly because he knows it drives
me insane he got so excited when you
guys last one it's a kyocera sup days
like look I got a new phone aren't you
excited flip the pic away just go away
three nothing against kyocera just to
flip phone go away people love him uh
yeah i know from eric brahmand after
making the kinect look like the next
advancement of video games only to have
it be a glorified piece of junk how do
you feel Microsoft will handle the
hololens that's actually a very good
question yeah do you thing is how
connect was like one of the best selling
products Microsoft had when it launched
and it's the same guy that's doing
halliwell what it launched and then
everyone realized hey there's no
software right actually I think you know
it was it was ahead of its time in a lot
of ways not ahead of its time but you
know for for consoles it was sort of
something different and the same guy
that did that's working on hololens and
seems to be like I don't know if you saw
the press conference yesterday the
viewers out there but this guy is like
pretty dedicated kind of mad scientist
not a guy and I think it seems like he's
the right one for the for the project
and hopefully you know it's as good as
Microsoft's making it out okay pet peeve
time you you brought up the hair whether
you just say you look like a mad
scientist that's I mean that's bringing
up the hair okay I'm all for
self-expression but someone really needs
to stay it off stage and be at Microsoft
Apple whoever can go you're about to go
out on stage and represent our company
okay cut your hair
tuck your shirt in I if you want wear a
t-shirt fine but the at least tuck your
shirt in yeah and I just want to hire a
barber to sit there and go nope you
aren't going out with that hair it's
pretty funny it's uh some of the hairdos
we see on some of these things yeah I
what I think I think the hollow lens is
sort of um I think Microsoft is a some
huge aspirations for they they believe
this is and some of the journalists all
yesterday seem to agree that this is the
next step in computing that you know
keyboard mouse aren't where we're going
to be in ten years and so if if
Microsoft serious about that vision then
the hololens can't be glorified piece of
chalk cuz it no sort of their vision
right and I agree with that i mean if
you look at the the keyboard mouse
interface it's been around for going on
50 years now it is time for a change i
think the problem is been you and we've
tried doing touch screen desktops and
laptops but who wants to see here typing
and then reach up you know to do
something hey okay i need to do that
okay i need that's not practical right
but the hololens could change all that I
mean if I'm manipulating shapes and
objects in 3d space that's interesting
now that being said I also don't see
myself typing out a full article like
this right my hands in the air that
that's not going to work right but for a
lot of things yes I can see where this
would be a lot more interesting uh let's
see here to do from another one from
brazen Franco or or someone who mainly
uses mobile data for push notifications
in reading mostly TV in my case is 4g
that huge of a deal I'm from Europe and
they started deploying the network but I
don't see the appeal compared to 3g HSPA
there is a world of difference yeah
world a world of world of difference
HSPA is not horrible but you will see a
definite difference with using LTE
Todd any thoughts oh yeah I mean
especially if you're looking at
streaming data and real music and stuff
like that music works pretty well on
HSPA but if you're going you know if you
want to say stream a YouTube video
actually yesterday because I was using a
Windows Phone that i got like site about
microsoft so switch windows phone it
it's an unlocked international version
so i only get HSPA and I was like
loading a video and I remember saying to
myself just last night like this would
have been loaded already on LTE because
I was thinking oh I can I can live with
HSPA but so there is a really big
difference um when it comes to stream
videos downloading games and stuff like
that if you're in the airport one of the
things that drives me nuts when I'm in
an airport I'm like oh I want to
download that game before this flight I
don't have a LTE connection I'm like
that's not going to happen so first off
like that there's a huge difference yeah
I'm going to go ahead and put this
question out there it will answer it
nicely from David Nunez how do you guys
feel when you are at a microsoft / apple
event and they typically go to the verge
website for their demos no offense to
other sites by concern them your biggest
competitions when news hits those are
the two sites i choose between thanks it
kills a little bit of ourselves ah it
very clearly we have no grudge against
the verge we have no grudge against any
other site would we like to see
TechnoBuffalo up on the screen you
betcha yeah but I mean to be fair to
converge had that story of that Spartan
and that's what Microsoft is talking
about is think for all I know exclusive
to the verge they had their own sources
so yes that's why it was there and yeah
yes yeah so no it it typically leads to
a joke or two but no it it's the nature
of the beast yeah it could be in gadget
could be the verge would we rather see
technobuffalo up there of course we
would but you know and someday we'll
work our way up there yeah and we will
rule the world so duh it doesn't bother
us another thing toots it's worth
mentioning that goes back to what i love
about
you know technology journalism is a lot
of times like I might see androidcentral
had a thing in Times Square they had
like a big advertisement which was
awesome and I we have friends there and
I was like oh that's amazing you know so
it's not as like I don't we don't look
at them is like oh we take these guys
down like we hate them I got it's it's
really great sometimes to see friends
you know quoted elsewhere it's like one
of the highlights for me of CES was I
finally finally got to meet phil from
android central yeah yeah I love Phil I
think he's great you know I'd never
gotten to meet him in person to me that
was one of the highlights I i we love
you know it it's a big world of
technology but it's actually a very
small world of journalists that work on
it and so I yeah we we could walk around
and hating each other but it'd be
pointless and there are times where we
help each other yeah you know somebody
for some reason gets a press release
that another person didn't get you know
it's not confidential ok fine here you
go you know let me help you out and then
you return the favor yeah so it's
actually it's more almost like a brother
ship yeah I'd say so yeah we're like
we're off we're in the trenches together
man yeah we got a report on these phones
um from Sasha Mahal hey Sean what would
you like to see in the 1+2 you know I
really don't know what I would change I
really really love what let's weapon I'd
say a better screen quad HD is the
quality of that screen to me isn't isn't
that great i think it's really like
bright the viewing angles aren't great
that's sort of one of my biggest
complaints about the oneplus one I think
I I am a little concerned though I've
had trouble charging it this week I'm
not sure what's going on I got hey I'm
not sure I'm gonna try a different
charger and see if maybe it's the
charger doing it but little little
concerning um paintable storage too i
probably throw that yeah expain little
storage would be nice but definitely I
think a better screen
think that would be my big one but
otherwise I really really like the
current design of the one plus one mhm
um we've got two questions left if no
one else asks any for the first time I
get through every question all right
here we go now so now we're gonna get
more I know verb raised in Franco what
would you choose between current VR sets
and complete sci-fi ones which involve
full neural immersion it's I would she
turn because I'm afraid of that yeah i
know i go to matrix e I don't want
anything like plugging into the back of
my neck in anything that requires a
surgical implant of a port right no me
trick um I i I'm very excited for what's
currently out there and what's been
talking about what's coming I just want
to see them refine more but I don't
think I anytime you say the word neural
I'm just gonna go oh and the last one we
already touched on this a little bit
from Tyler lacoste what do you think
about the whole Windows 10 connection to
the xbox one I think it's needed to
happen for a long time and I'm glad it's
finally happening yeah i agree i love it
yeah yeah so we'll see how it works out
but i want to secret war town on the
xbox one to sing hey xbox is ok but if
you can Anna and I she's got to make her
way there it wouldn't would make sense
me if she wasn't but you know you're
sitting there and you can get your
updates if you leave it on you wanna
like you're on your home screen that'd
be pretty sweet a brazen franco i'm not
counting your question because it came
in after i said we were almost done the
question is your nexus 6 backplate start
to peel off i saw reports though is
happening I haven't seen it myself
that's just me yep i don't have my arm
