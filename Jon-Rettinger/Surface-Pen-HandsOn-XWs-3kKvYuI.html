to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here the
surface pro 3 was announced last week
it's getting a lot of attention and I
think rightfully so but what's really
going under the radar is this guy this
is the surface pen when we did our
unboxing and hands on I got a lot of
questions about this and how it's
different and what it does and there's a
lot of Technology crammed in this teeny
tiny little pen let me show you what
writing with this and this is all about
alright so we've got the surface pro 3
and the surface pen and Microsoft said
this was designed to look like a regular
pen I don't know what kind of regular
pens you're using but it definitely
feels diameter wise and weight wise like
a normal pen and like normal pens that
add a little clicky thing on top this
also has a little clicky thing on top
and when you click it it's going to open
up OneNote which is kind of handy why
notes really the application of
Microsoft is hoping you're going to use
this with most if you're not doing any
sort of drawing or graphic design so
quick tour around the pen it's got a
little clip if you want to clip it onto
things and if you want to store it if
you get a type cover which you probably
should if you're using a surface you
could store it right in here otherwise
they're a little bit of magnetic spots
on the left and right side you can sort
of keep it there
lightly but if you put a lot of weight
on it or movement it's going to fall
right off but there are magnet on the
side you can store it there ok so you've
got two buttons you've got one down
below you've got one up top you've got a
pressure-sensitive tip and a little
clicky button what do you want use that
as an eraser it is not going to work
again click it it's going to wake up
your surface and launch OneNote so
immediately you can start drawing you
can see that it's pretty close to 1 to 1
there Microsoft says between 0.5 and one
millimeter of accuracy and this is
definitely the most accurate that I've
seen on any other shirt Ablett that I've
used with a pen input it's really close
to mirroring exactly what I'm doing
without much of delay which is extremely
impressive so if you click the top
button to the one close to a clicky part
you are going to get what shows up is a
little bit of a menu option if you go
ahead and flip that down you get
different options for how you want
two selectable color pens you want
thickness the eraser and all kinds of
other stuff but I'm not making contact
with the tablet itself instead of
hovering over it and the cursor starts
to move so bear that in mind you can
draw it again it's close to one to one
but let's say you're drawing you want to
draw on the left side and right-handed
your palm is going to rest right on the
screen well it's got smarts enough to
know that that's not an input and it
won't recognize your palms at all which
is really extremely nice feature I think
to go ahead and push down further the
sensor tip you can get a bit of a
thicker lines if you want so the top
button the one closest to click you can
use to select if you just sort of hold
it down and draw around you gets or that
circle thing that pops up and you go
ahead and select an area you can move it
anywhere you want let's say you don't
like what you just did the button close
to the point you called that down you
can just start erasing things and it
works pretty well we'll do two big
erases if you want or smaller ones it's
a really good one-to-one experience I've
been really surprised with how good it
is now I'm certainly not an artist I'm
by no means an artist at all but I
couldn't see myself writing notes on
this
it's almost seem like using a notepad I
want to sort of write notes real quickly
it works and works very very well so
Microsoft is hoping you can place a
complete pen and paper with this and
this is the first time I've used a pen
and foot that I think I actually could
really really good don't judge this
experience based on what the pen if it
was on previous surface Pro's now this
one is an entirely different experience
and works really really well the quick
sec from talking about this to tell you
about our friends and good peeps at

lynda.com free for seven days by
visiting lynda.com/tekzilla flow it's
like more about this guy Microsoft did a
pretty incredible job of this obviously
their other application you can use
microsoft includes painting applications
and all kinds of other stuff to use with
the surface pen this is just sort of an
example of what you can do with it how
well it works on that kind of thing but
it does work very very well again here
you can see all kinds of other options
you can select but if you're the kind of
person your graphic artist and you want
to sort of decide this is the right
thing for you I think rest assured
that's going to work very well and
you'll be relatively pleased with the
effect and it can sort of it can get
some watercolor effect going on here I
could draw something I would say think
this guy here leering at you that's his
matte face this is a John Wright and red
zone right here but again works very
well really impressive Microsoft is done

surface pro coming I'll touch a little
bit more on the pen but I'll reference
