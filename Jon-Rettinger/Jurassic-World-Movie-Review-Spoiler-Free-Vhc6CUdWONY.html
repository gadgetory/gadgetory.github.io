to you by domain.com what's up everyone
walk back the episode of retinues riffs
on this episode I'm not pissed off about
a watched rap I'm not angry about an
overheating tablet actually I want to do
a movie review I got a show called riffs
right talking about anything in my mind
and I just went in saw a drastic world
so I'm gonna try something kind of new I
did a movie review for The Avengers age
of Ultron and I'm gonna theory the movie
review for Jurassic world I know it's
not tech and I'm gonna get yelled at I
didn't subscribe for movie reviews but I
love movies so I want to share them with
you I should also mention we have a TV
movie channel we upload a ton of
trailers link to that will be down below
so I'm gonna try and keep this as
spoiler free as possible so if you
haven't seen Jurassic world you're good
good to watch this don't worry I'm not
gonna say anything that you didn't see
in the trailer so I'm gonna assume that
you've seen the trailers you guys like
movie reviews let me know I love movies
I love to start sharing my thoughts on
them with you guys so without further
ado let's talk some Jurassic world so
the original Jurassic Park came out I
think in 1993 so we're looking at like
22 years it's the original movie a lot
of you folks out there may not have even
seen the original Jurassic Park it was
friggin incredible when it came out I
remember I was 13 and we'd never really
seen dinosaurs before in movies now you
kind of take it for granted you see
dinosaurs Amon King Kong you see him in
journey to the center of the world and
everything and dinosaurs are like the
new shark they just show up everywhere
but seeing them for the first time on
the big screen
was absolutely incredible the
combination of animatronics and what
really at the time was cutting-edge CGI
was just mind-blowing to see you had
that magic with the first Jurassic Park
and I kind of made it almost a scary
horror movie see this build was kind of
master of sort of scaring you without
showing you things necessarily so you
saw shadows come in and it served that
was truth Rijal Jurassic Park the new
Jurassic world tries to take a different
approach it doesn't try to be Jurassic
Park which I appreciated if people
didn't see Jurassic Park you can watch
this movie and really not miss much it
has to be a new movie it's a monster
movie and they does a really good job
with it so the basic plot and the really
plot doesn't matter much they're
dinosaurs they're really good-looking
dinosaurs and they
get loose and they attack people and
they're at a park called Jurassic world
and that's generally the plot of the
movie so a few things let's talk about
some of the acting so Chris Pratt is in
it he is at his Chris Pratt enos he
pretty much gonna put the star-lord mask
on him and it's exactly the same kind of
character but he does a good job and the
dude is a bona fide movie star you enjoy
watching him you enjoy seeing him my
wife I think enjoyed seeing him maybe a
little more than I did but does a good
job here as own Grady an ex-military guy
who somehow can train Raptors and the
plot is a little bit silly you saw in
the trailer him riding a motorcycle with
Raptors that's obviously in the movie
it's it's silly but
so our dinosaurs being brought out into
existence Vincent D'Onofrio was also the
movie the kingpin himself and I loved
Ben's D'Onofrio he was awesome in
daredevil if you didn't see it you
should absolutely check it out but the
plot that he brings to the story is so
asinine and ridiculous sort of military
angle that almost makes the movie a
little bit silly from a plot standpoint
as a side note there was originally
going to be a Jurassic Park for before
this ad distribute the whole thing the
plot of this cancelled drastic park for
was going to be hyper dinosaurs human
dinosaur hybrids and militarizing
dinosaurs and sort of all those things
except for the human dinosaur hybrids
kind of show up in this movie so I know
it's kind of an homage or they just sort
of liked the idea they initially had for
the fourth Jurassic Park which never
ever happened we've got an idea for next
great website domain.com has you covered
they won't hook you up with a great
offer save 20% on domain names and web
hosting when you use coupon code
TechnoBuffalo that's all capital letters
one word at domain coms check out I
think domain names think domain.com and
rounding out the characters you'd really
don't care that much about you've got
Jessica Chastain know Bryce Dallas
Howard is in this movie and she plays
your business woman who's very stoic and
as business first business first and I
don't have time for family and she has a
sister and two kids that you don't care
anything about it all and that it's her
part of stories gets more interesting as
it goes along but first half of the
movie she is very boring who takes off
her jacket and then she becomes
a little more entertaining in in the
film so moral being the human character
is you don't really care that much about
except for maybe Chris Pratt but
freaking dinosaurs are in it
they god I've always wanted to see I'd
call it a water source the Moses story
you saw in the trailer eating the big
great white shark it looks incredible in
this you get to see flying tear dons
which I always thought were just
pterodactyls different kind of dinosaur
incredible to see them you get to see
people running in screaming through the
parks you've got a hybrid dinosaur
called AI Rex or indominus rex they
talked about that at the trailer and
this sucker is crazy smart it's a
combination of a whole bunch of other
things that I won't talk about and I
want to do any spoilers I also really
appreciated it kind of the homage they
did to the original Jurassic Park the
original t-rex isn't it the one who had
that fight with the Raptors in the
visitor center and the first movie is
there and they kind of sort of throwback
to that a lot oddly enough the dinosaur
should to end of the movie look way more
realistic and dinosaurs at the beginning
of the movie I don't know if they're
trying to space out their budget and
realize like oh crap we got so much more
money make dinosaurs look better and
they do but I still don't think he
looked as good as some of the
animatronic stuff that we saw in the
first movie a Stan Winston did all the
animatronics and special effects for the
first one the studio service spun off
from Stan Winston did the effect for the
new movie and they're obviously very
good but sometimes for the beginning you
can kind of tell it not real now that
seems silly to say because they're
dinosaurs it's obviously not real and
what am I talking about I'm spoiled cuz
I'm still seeing dinosaurs it's the
kidney it's like this is so incredible
to see it is a movie you should
absolutely see on the big screen it's
gonna be ruined if you watch it on
tablet or at least a home theater it
doesn't have surround sound I didn't see
the 3d tends to be feel a little bit
nauseous but probably been a pretty
badass movie to see in 3ds there's a
moral if you want a summer movie that's
gonna keep that edge of your seat you're
gonna be exciting to watch could have
characters that you kind of care about
you want to see like a lot of people get
eaten a lot of people get picked up by
flying tear dons and you want to see
people just die and run scared in
general and some random dude order
margarita
well dinosaurs are attacking goosy
Jurassic world you won't be disappointed
I enjoyed it my wife enjoyed it it's a
fun summer movie and it should be enjoy
on big screen so I got these that that
any spoilers which is really hard for me
cuz I want to tell you everything that
happens the end scene is awesome
make sure you stayed till the end of the
movie thank you guys for watching hope
you enjoyed obviously there are a ton of
people that do movie reviews better than
me but I'm learning I'm trying to get
better because I really love films a
video a thumbs up you always appreciate
it till next time I am John render from
TechnoBuffalo I'll be back with plenty
more tech videos touch the guys the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
