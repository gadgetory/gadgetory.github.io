technobuffalo here's here like me I hate
doing housework the folks at iRobot
supposedly have a solution for you you
may have seen their rumbas Roman about
different households those are back in
cleaning robots what we have right here
the folks I robot sent for review is
called a scuba not like scuba diving but
SCO ova this is a robot that is going to
mop your floors and you can use this for
a most hardwood floors including tile
linoleum and hardwood so without further
ado let's go ahead and dig in alright so
I did literally break the seal here on
here to open this up it's go ahead and
get to the unboxing i'm not sure what
model the folks from iRobot sent over so
i'll put the pricing down in the
description and i'll put a little text
overlay so you can see what model this
is go ahead and pull out the styrofoam
without growing too Scoob all over blitz
there we go all right side here is the
scuba so a little bit about this it can
use a water or water vinegar it also
sort of scuba approved formula I'll go
through and clean your hardwood floors
uses two tanks one that's going to keep
your dirty water and one that's gonna
keep it clean water I don't want to
reuse the same stuff supposedly uses the
water so and there are the feeding fluid
so judiciously you can clean tons of
square footage so you don't have to
worry about always refilling your scuba
when I saw this demonstrated one of the
concerns I had was a if you're cleaning
upstairs they're going to fall down
steps is it going to go over rugs and
ruin rugs it actually has sensors to
make sure it doesn't go downstairs I
have sensors to make sure that it's sort
of cleaning the entire area the floor
she's a sort of a guiding system to
check square footage and to make sure it
really hits
area might take some time but ultimately
is going to get almost all of the square
footage which is kind of neat all right
so enough of me yappin to go ahead and
see what you're going to get in the box
all right so we've got meeting with
scuba instructions how to set it up how
to empty it and all that kind of
business so it looks like you would move
the scuba tank open the dirty and clings
it kind of just dump it out replays the
tanks and sort of what you'd expect go
ahead and pull this thing open and here
we have a scuba which looks similar to
its vacuum cleaning brother the Roomba
go ahead and pull this off push it off
the side for just one minute like we did
with the phones will come back to it see
what else we're going to get looks like
we've got a wall charger here also going
to get something blue looks like we've
got they have pretty hefty battery pack
this thing weighs a weighs a ton about
similar size to say an xbox 360's power
brick in case you're wondering for a
size comparison the brushes on the
roomba was supposedly move quick enough
that actually will sterilize your floor
I believe without using heat so kind of
an interesting we've also have looks
like this is the wall sensor so it knows
when to come back or where to stop it's
actually I think this might be a virtual
wall too so you can set it in an area
that you don't want it to go I'll come
back and check in with what this guy is
that we've got some sample scuba fluid
hardwood floor cleaner natural enzyme
formula and it looks like that is about
it push the styrofoam off let's go ahead
and look at the scoob's as i'm calling
it alright so we'll go ahead and pull
off the bubble wrap hopefully without
dropping it which is always kind of
risky without the battery pack it
doesn't weigh that much assume it's
gonna be a bit heavier with that in
there we go all right so
styrofoam is almost off all right so
styrofoam was off let's take a look at
the scuba it looks very similar to the
bottom of the room but I get your
brushes that are so we're going to go
through I look like the two tanks live
right here on either side fill them up
you got some sensors a little wheels to
make sure it can turn and go around it
will actually navigate around corners as
they don't have to worry about that I
think one thing it's definitely gonna do
is scare my cat and probably frightened
your animals at home so i'll be sure to
watch that when this thing go at all
about could be kind of funny for some
blooper footage anyway guys I am jon
