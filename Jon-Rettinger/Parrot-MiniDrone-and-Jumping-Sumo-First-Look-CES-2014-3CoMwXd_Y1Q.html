to you by Toyota
hey guys Ashley we are here at pep comm
CES 2014 I'm checking out the this is
the parrot mini-drone
the tiny little cute awesome toy version
of the ar.drone that you've seen that
you know and love it is also controlled
by your smartphone or tablet
it's obviously extremely stable in the
air it's really cool even though this is
just a little prototype you can feel the
wind underneath and it's kind of amazing
I love it this is gonna be available
later this year is that right later this
year and again I like to look at these
things that sort of like Willy Wonka and
the Chocolate Factory candy doesn't need
to have a point
neither does cool stuff like this it is
just a cool fun toy and I can't wait to
get one they also not only do they have
the mini drone which is delightful it's
my new friend here at the show they also
have a really cool jumping sumo the
parent jumping sumo which is a jumping
robot with a camera attached you're
gonna be able to get a live camera feed
of what your jumping sumo sees and it
could jump up to 80 centimeters so
there's a lot of really cool fun toys
happening this year at Peretz booth at
CES 2014 this little guy is pretty
amazing now sometime this year by the
end of this year all right I'm gonna put
it on my Christmas list that's that's my
plan thank you so much goodbye my friend
