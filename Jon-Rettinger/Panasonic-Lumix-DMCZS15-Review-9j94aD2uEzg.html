TechnoBuffalo reporting from my office
today's review is the panasonic lumix
DMC gs-15 if you're wondering what I'm
drinking in this mug it's not tea today
it's lemon ginger echinacea juice stay
tuned to find out if the CS 15 has what
it takes to make a splash in the
entry-level point-and-shoot market
hello everyone and welcome to my review
of the panasonic lumix DMC gs-15
if anyone out there has a cold echinacea
is nature's remedy moving on the
panasonic lumix DMC is ES 15 is the
company's entry-level higher-end
entry-level point-and-shoot camera
so this shares a lot of features with
the zs 20 but it keeps the price down
this is a $280 camera well start with
design the Lumix zs series is known for
being very basic and plain on the
outside if you took a zs camera from
2006 and told me it was a 2012 model i
wouldn't think twice about it really
Panasonic the only thing that they've
done over the years is slimmed down the
size a bit and swap a few buttons here
and there but if you look at the
external design we still have
old-fashioned switches and dials that
throw us into camera and playback mode
there's a small mode dial there's a
static four-way directional pad without
any sort of circular control and we have
a basic 3-inch 460,000 pixel display now
underneath this camera houses an 895
milliamp hour battery it did not give me
the best battery life and there's a
wimpy built-in flash up top here but one
of the great things about this ES 15 is
that it has a profound 16x optical zoom
reach for the skies baby the lens also
has a 25 millimeter wide angle
capability which means you could fit a
lot more into your shots but overall the
design of the zs 15 is very basic now as
far as shooting features on the GS 15
most shooters who buy this camera are
gonna be throwing it into intelligent
auto mode and this camera has a great
auto mode although the GS 15s
automotives not as robust as something
like the Canon Powershot SX 260 HS is it
still gets the job done we have a few
nifty features like intelligent handheld
night shot there's also intelligent HDR
this camera has face recognition and for
the most part I found auto mode to be
the safest mode to shoot in if you're
going to venture outside of intelligent
auto mode this camera has a fantastic
burst shooting mode you can shoot up to
10 frames per second at full
solution and there's even a 60
frames-per-second mode at reduced
resolutions manual mode is fairly
standard with a 15 second shutter speed
ISO that goes up to 3200 and there's a
super limited aperture range with this
camera it only goes from F 3.3 to F 5.9
of course there are a bunch of scene
modes on the GS 15 and the camera has
great creative controls with things like
high dynamic range low key high key
shooting toy camera and retro to name a
few you could also shoot video HD video
in those modes as well I did run into a
few speed bumps with these ES 15 when it
came to shooting features first off this
camera is a bit slow it's a bit slow to
zoom while you're recording videos it's
a bit slow to autofocus as well also the
manual white balance is a terrible
system on this camera rather than
evaluating the scene and having the
camera make internal adjustments you
have to rely on a warm cool slider to
get the job done I found the SX 268 just
to be superior when it came to adjusting
white balance also shooting features in
video mode were very limited overall the
Lumix DMC SES 15 offers a basic menu of
shooting features and now image quality
image quality with the Panasonic Lumix
DMC SES 15 the zs lineup has always
given me great image quality throughout
the years the CS 15 is no exception
especially in bright light this camera
is great in bright light in both videos
and stills it has a 12.1 megapixel high
sensitivity most sensor which is the
same technology found in the higher
priced as ES 20 and FZ 150 as you'll see
in my bright light samples in the full
review on TechnoBuffalo comm the quality
the macro quality the colors I found to
be better than the canon powershot sx60
HS just by a hair
however when the lights turned low so
did the quality on this camera it was a
lot harder with that manual white
balance to get a good accurate color
reading in low-light I was impressed
with the high ISO performance but what
good is that when your pictures all look
yellow or red also exposure in video
mode in low light was very low I found
it lower than the Powershot SX 2 6 th
s's a lot of the times what I had to do
was select incandescent white balance
mode and use a long shutter so can you
get that quality in low light with the
CS 15 yes you can but it takes a lot
more to do so so what's the buffalo call
with the panasonic lumix DM CZs 15 this
camera is a good camera I like its
bright LED image quality it's got a
great optical zoom and it's got some
essential shooting features that will
really help a lot of shooters out there
however I think you could get a better
deal on last year's Canon Powershot SX
230 HS if you're not sure about the
Canon either I should be getting some
Sony's in pretty soon check out the full
review at TechnoBuffalo calm I've got
image samples and video samples I'm Mike
Perlman for TechnoBuffalo drink your
echinacea kids I'll see you later
