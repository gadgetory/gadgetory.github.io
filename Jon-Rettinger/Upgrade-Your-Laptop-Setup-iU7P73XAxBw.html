recently and I realized that my bag is
too heavy so I wanted to do something
about it so in a video whose theme is
thin and lightweight should have a
laptop that's thin lightweight and
powerful I figure that makes sense so I
do want to give a thank you to LG for
sponsoring this video and I'll talk a
little bit about the LG gram 17
lightness obviously being the key this
is a 17 inch computer that feels like
the battery is not even installed in it
that's not true cuz you're gonna get 19
and a half hours of battery life but
you're not sacrificing anything out on
display front it's 2560 by 1600 images
look great
the aspect ratio is 16 by 10 so if you
edit photo that's perfect for that this
has all the ports I think that anybody
could really need right now it's even
got a full size HDMI port it's got USB
type-c
got a headphone jack and USB a ports all
built in so not to worry about carrying
extra stuff with you keyboard super
comfortable it's got an integrated
fingerprint reader into the power button
so you make sure things are secure with
Windows hello support it also spec it up
really well ours has an i7 16 gigs of
ram a 500 gigabyte SSD so you're not
sacrificing any sort of power for the
portability you want something that
gives you a really nice sized screen
that's lightweight with pretty killer
battery life and all the ports you can
need the LG gram is going to be an
awesome way to go throw out and check it
out link to it down below
so I'm trying to lighten the load for
everything that I'm carrying abusing a
name case bag for years cuz it just held
everything and it did an awesome job
when I emptied it I really so heavy the
bag itself actually was so I wanted to
fix that I went with the air daypack
figure the coke it's called air it had
to be light it feels really durable
which was important for all of traveling
and I'm doing it's got a kind of a
coated exterior so if you live a place
where it rains or there's a lot of
moisture in the air your stuff will be
protected and also it's harder than you
might think to find a bag that can hold
a 17 inch laptop and the air daypack
does it nice and easily and because a
gram so light you didn't even know it's
in there it holds everything that I need
and most importantly crazy crazy
lightweight so when all these flights
I've been taking I've been watching a
lot of video I've been a loyal follower
and fan of bows for years the QC 35 s
were always my jam and always what I use
when I traveled and when I was at home
but there's still microUSB and I kind of
wanted to limit the amount of cables I
was bringing so I wanted something that
used USB type-c I know everybody's super
excited about the Saudi headphones I
really like the aesthetic of Microsoft
Surface headphones so that's what I've
been using they do a couple things
really well first I think they look
awesome the sound quality has been
really good noise cancelling when I'm on
an airplane I don't hear anything else
around me I like that I can control the
amount ice canceling to just by turning
the ear cup and the turn the other ear
cup to control the volume they don't
pack down as small as something like the
Bose did but they're not heavy so they
might take up a deist about a room in
the bag but they're not adding a cific
and amount of weight to what I've been
used to another cool thing that they do
instead of just telling you how much
battery percentage you have left it'll
actually tell you how many hours of
listening you have left so you can turn
them on it'll say you've got 15 hours of
battery life remaining that's been nice
when I'm on a flight I don't know what
50% necessarily means that that's gonna
get me five hours or six hours the
service headphones are 350 bucks which
is definitely expensive but is price
comparable so to the other high-end
noise canceling wireless headphones so
if you're in the market for headphones
you want that premium
look but also you want sort of
noise-canceling you can control so if
you're sad films are a really good way
to go so as I was going through and sort
of packing my travel bag I realized
probably like you I packed a lot of
electronics and things that need power
and I don't always have outlets with me
wherever I'm going and that's where this
comes into play it's the charge check
portable power outlet that has 40,000
milliamp hours of power it's got a full
like AC Jacky just plug normal things
into it's not the smallest thing in the
world but it's got ports for everything
I can pretty much charge everything in
my bag at once with this so if you're
traveling internationally and you're
worried about maybe some adapters or if
I'm just sitting at you know my kids
soccer practice I'm trying to do work at
the same time so it's 329 bucks and this
is something that would bring do you
wanna be able to charge everything with
you and maybe you don't have access to
power outlets it has been an incredible
thing to have and 40,000 milliamps they
can just charge everything swallow stuff
has been awesome for travel it's light
and portable when I get back I still
need to use the same setup I like to
have an external mouse I've been using
some version of the MX master for years
recently I'm transitioning over to the
MX master vertical it feels weird to
like almost shake hands with your mouse
and kind of relearn how to use it but
I've had some carpal tunnel syndrome
issues for a while I even tried mice
that have kind of roll balls to get
around it and the vertical mouse does a
nice job of sort of giving me the
functionality of like a normal MX master
mouse but also making sure my wrist
isn't going to hurt
and also battery life has been awesome
on it and keeping with the theme of USB
see everything you can charge this via
USB see it's 100 bucks so it's not the
most expensive in the world I've
absolutely loved using the MX vertical
mouse
so the LG gram obviously has a keyboard
built-in but when I'm at home I like to
have an external keyboard it gives me
more functionality and my go-to for a
while has been the Logitech Kraft so
it's sturdy it offers a lot of
functionality to if she's got all the
keys for both Mac and PC it's got that
dial up top which I've used just for
volume but also you can customize what
it does so I've got it set to turn to
adjust volume press it take screenshots
it can adjust what it does depending on
different apps you're using you can pair
with different devices everything I've
needed a keyboard to do the craft has
done for me the key throw feels good
it offers flexibility depending on what
OS I'm using at the time and also I
really like being up quick access
controls to volume the craft has been
awesome surprising kind of ranges I've
seen it go as low as a hundred eighty
bucks depending on when you buy bowling
too it also down below so because the
grams got that huge 17 inch screen I
decided to not opt for an external
monitor but I did want to raise it up so
it was more at eye level so stands you
can pick I want the one that was going
to look awesome so we went with the
stand from Johan it's 160 180 bucks
depending on what color wood is I could
go with but it looks incredible it makes
a laptop look like it's floating it can
do double duty also as a stand for your
tablet but it'll raise up the screen and
honestly they'll just look good doing it
I've always wanted power in my set up
but more and more recently as I've
traveled portability has been key so a
bunch of products here some are good to
take with you all the time some for very
specific situations and some that are
best left at home hopefully there's
something in this video it's gonna help
make your travel easier make your bag
lighter and make you ultimately more
productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
