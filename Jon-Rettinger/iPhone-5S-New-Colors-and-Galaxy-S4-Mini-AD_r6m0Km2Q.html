to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back to the episode of
rumor roundup just to show we take all
the rumors from the week put them in a
bowl mix them up whisk them put them in
the oven on 450 and serve you delicious
rumor brownies up this week we're gonna
talk about the rumors of a new microsoft
surface iphone 5s parts are doing a very
slow striptease and might be coming soon
in multiple colors galaxy s4 mini shows
its tiny head yet again and HTC is
saying no Nexus addition one plan but we
might think otherwise this rumor roundup
go ahead and start rounding them up
so earlier this month we covered a rumor
that suggested Microsoft's new and small
the tablets going to launch in June at
the display size between seven and eight
inches now didja times the ever-reliable
did a time since then confirmed the
supply chain makers that's a new device
will have an eight inch screen provided
by Samsung a processor from Nvidia and
will indeed launched in June we're just
guessing is a good chance though the
device will run on a videos new Tegra 4
chip which means it's also gonna need to
run windows are teens and the more
powerful Windows 8 operating system so
boo didja time said it also learned that
Microsoft will launch another tablet to
display the size of 10 inch range during
a third quarter at the very earliest
which means it could be on store shelves
in time for the holiday season the x is
one of those company at reports a ton of
rumors you know eventually you say it's
gonna rain it up days one of these days
you're gonna be right so giant grain of
salt but yes it makes sense that would
be like me coming out and saying apples
exclusive story Apple's gonna release a
new phone this year yeah no duh so
several new parts are allegedly being
used for the iphone 5s build to the
Internet's Thursday some parts include
the motor assembly that's used power the
vibrating mechanism on the phone a
tweaked loudspeaker part a Wi-Fi flex
cable ribbon and the SIM tray slots
super exciting I know we can't really
discern much from these leaked parts
other than as we've seen in the past
they suggested apples at least switching
off the internal design of the iphone
for the next generation smartphone the
most compelling photos whoever those of
the SIM card race we see a brushed
gunmetal color and another khaki color
tray that aren't par-3 merced apples
going to launch the iphone 5s of
different colors so maybe there'll be a
khaki color to match my pants galaxy s4
mini is showing its face see it again we
actually recently published a gallery
that includes several photos of
samsung's as of yet still unannounced
galaxy s4 mini so we now have a few more
pictures to add to that batch thanks to
smart news BG can't early tone too much
for the photos except that it appears
and maybes got a different finish in the
full version of the galaxy s4 the does
whoever still have the faux metal stripe
running around its borders maintains the
home button at the bottom of the screen
so the s4 mini won't be as powerful as
the older brother of course it expected
to pack a 1.6 eager hurts dual-core
processor one example a smaller 4.3 inch
display with a 92
x 540 resolution latest rumor suggests 0
samsung's going to unveil the s4 mini
sometime this month all over many
pictures we've seen of it just released
already it reminds me of the Lumia 928
which we saw even in freaking ads before
nokia fine guy ran to releasing it so
hopefully Samsung's knocking followed
the same trap so earlier this week at
Google i/o Samsung in boobs got together
released a totally unlocked and all
awesome native Android version of the
galaxy s4 dubbed the google edition
ranked totally stock android for 649
bucks that again includes a unskinny an
adult rated version of G Abel's at
sparkle jelly bean so several pundits
wondered this med that HTC two might
follow it similar footsteps and launched
a pure Android device however it looks
like it might not be the case if you
believe what HTC says and I quote it's
GC is not currently planning on
releasing next edition of the HTC One in
a email statement when you guys think do
you want another phone that's heard of
Nexus stuff like galaxy s4 with stock
Android sounding mighty appealing but
650 bucks is a lot of scrilla let me
think I made it to thank our friends and
