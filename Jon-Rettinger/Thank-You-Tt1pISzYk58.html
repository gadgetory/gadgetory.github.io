technobuffalo here I don't get a chance
to make these videos as often as I like
but TechnoBuffalo just hit some really
big milestones I don't want to share
them with you and thank you guys for all
of your support for watching the videos
for reading the content for commenting
whether good or bad and just for overall
just supporting us and everything that
we do we just hit seven hundred thousand
subscribers on YouTube which is a
staggering number that I never in I just
I never ever thought that we would hit I
mean i remember when i first hit 100
subscribers it seems like just a
monumental figure and every time we go
up by a hundred a thousand ten thousand
a hundred thousand i still have that
same sense of awe ditz it's makes me
it's very humbling and is so almost
surprising and that people care what we
have to say about technology but stuck
what we say it's about technology it's
to privilege and it's one that I take
very very very seriously I love what I
do I'm a consumer electronics just like
you guys so the fact that you listen and
support means that means the world to me
let's not only with me with my dream but
lets me pay a staff and lets them live
their dream so so thank you for that but
that's not the only my Austin that we've
hit on the social media side we just
passed a hundred thousand likes on
Facebook which is incredibly exciting
our managing editor boy Troy has taken
over our Facebook initiative and have
much more dynamic facebook page Evan
checked it out you should link down
below but it's technobuffalo its
facebook com rather / TechnoBuffalo make
that facebook.com slash technobuffalo we
have interactions we talk to the
audience that's a fun way to share posts
and I'm really proud of what that's done
but that's not the only thing we passed
a hundred and fifty thousand two plus
lens on google+ which has been really
staggering the growth on google+ you
know as google chance to sort of force
it on us has been been a huge huge
growth for us you can't often see him
because usually behind the camera but
Ralph Lorena's has been managing
all of our Google+ initiatives and it's
been just really huge to see that grow
and see people interact on on there you
should check that as well link to all
these things are going to be down that's
and that's not the only one we're about
to hit 80,000 followers on our twitter
page for TechnoBuffalo which is equally
staggering and all these numbers sort of
grow and grow and grow but our
perspective always stays the same we're
not owned by any large company you know
we don't have any huge media marketing
budget we're just us we are what you see
and we're trying to grow and I
appreciate all the support and the
patience you guys give us we don't get
everything right but we try and we learn
and the feedback you guys give is always
invaluable so I'm not I didn't make the
video if people leave comments saying
hey we love what you do you know that
kind of stuff that's not necessary I
just want to thank you guys for for the
support from honestly the bottom of my
heart not only do you let me provide
food for my family and a roof over my
head but again I wake up with a smile on
my face every day and I know what it's
like to work in a job where that's not
the case it makes even more appreciative
of what you guys have given me and
ultimately given TechnoBuffalo so thank
you here's the next seven hundred
thousand subscribers and rest of the
milestones and here's a twenty fourteen
