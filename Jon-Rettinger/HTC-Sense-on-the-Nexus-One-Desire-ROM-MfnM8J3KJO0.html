technobuffalo here and I want to show
you something it may have not seen
before that is HTC's Sense UI running on
the nexus one now before I start and
give you a tour of what's new and what's
here there are a few people that I need
to thank first and foremost I want to
thank Carlos graves you can follow him
on Twitter at Carlos graves from droid a
dog calm and fantastic Android resource
for really holding my hand through this
whole process I am a novice when it
comes to rooting and a bit of hacking
and he was really patient walking me
through it so Carlos thank you this is
the HTC desire rom it's a new phone
coming out from HTC it's essentially the
same guts as a nexus one but just with
the sense UI sitting on top of it this
rom came from modaco a paul one of their
admins posted it and if you won't do
this yourself which is not for the faint
of heart I promise you you can follow
some instructions that the good folks at
redmond pie posted and i'll put a links
to all these in the sidebar including
links to carlos's twitter page and droid
dog so let's go ahead and get started
here you'll notice this looks very
different than android 2.1 that you see
in the past first let me show you that
this is in fact still running android
2.1 it's not a skinned version of two
point oh so we'll jump right into
settings and you notice a new settings
menu here as well go to about phone and
we'll check the software information you
can see right there is still is running
the newest version of android 2.1 update
1 the update one was the update that
gave it to multi touch capabilities
which are still present up throughout
this now this rom is just a alpha
release this is by no means a final
ramen are still some bugs in it but for
the most part it's been really stable
and really reliable really the one of
the one bugs i have seen is that light
right the indicator light seems to
always stay on let's go ahead and get
started one of the biggest things that I
like about android 2.1 was the live
wallpapers and with cents you while you
can actually still have those live
wallpapers let me
so we'll go back into settings I'll go
up to the top and go to personalize you
get a whole bunch of new wallpapers here
and you can pick different scenes that
you like in the background and you still
have the option for live wallpaper so if
you were wondering we'll go ahead and
set that sense UI itself is a bit of a
battery killer and of course live
wallpapers are as well but they still do
work i'll show you what that is in just
a minute still works just as normal live
wallpapers in the past and you guys got
sort of a sneak peek at one of the
really cool innovations that in HTC's
new sense why and that's pinch to zoom
in the operating system previously we've
seen pinch-to-zoom utilize in web pages
and picture galleries but now it's
actually follows through without the
operator throughout the upper system so
let me show you take two fingers and
actually pinch in and you get almost a
Mac like expose of all of your different
home screens of which there are now
seven there's one down there I'm not
using but you can jump right to any of
these so I want to go back to the home
or check out whether I can jump right on
over to whether if I want to get back
any of them I can hop right in or I can
just zoom right out zoom right out
things sometimes doesn't always work
there is awesome there was a little bit
inaccurate but it really is a nice way
to jump around home screens with
standard android 2.1 you had the little
icons on the bottom that you can jump to
hear on the sense you can move via that
new pinch to zoom or you can see that
little bar on the bottom right that
start to move along as i scroll and
again there are now seven home screens
so let's go ahead and show you some of
the other cool new features that are
found in sense UI let's jump right to
the camera and you also notice a sort of
a new menu trade well you don't have
sort at 3d folding back effect you have
a 2.1 we also notice a lot of new
programs and applications in here God
peep it's a built-in Twitter client
you've got new set up stocks application
in quick office you've got an FM radio
tuner in here which I tried to test and
it does not work I thought maybe the
next one had a hidden FM tuner in there
even with the headset plugged in to use
as an antenna it doesn't work and you
still get the htc's Teeter game which is
sort of like a labyrinth marble
so let's jump into camera go ahead and
find that for it and I'll show you what
the camera icon looks like and just some
some new tweaks here which are pretty
hella handy I think so standard camera
let's go ahead and show you what you can
do here go ahead and pull out that
drawer you go to photo or video hit that
icon right down below you actually get a
whole bunch of effects that you can do
aquafx Solarize negative stuff yet
nothing that fancy but you know they are
sort of handy start rinsing a bit blue
as you can see in there a few other that
have the standard features you can have
a few more settings I can go through and
show you everything is to be a probably
a four hour long video but i just want
to show you that some of the camera
functionality at least will be different
on sense UI go ahead and quit out here
and i'll go ahead and continue sort of
the tour android has a fantastic
keyboard HTC decided to put their own on
here and they've had some of their own
keyboard since you first saw sense and
the HTC hero let me show you what that
keyboard looks like case you haven't
seen it there you go it's very easy to
use quickly easy to type on and supports
landscape orientation as well and it
still has the same auto correction
features that you've sort of known to to
love in android to show across the top
and just tap them and you are off to the
races so let me continue the tour here
there are a lot of widgets that you can
choose from a lot of HTC custom which
i'll show you some of the few that i
have right here running on the nexus 1
i'll show you what some of the other
ones are as well so here's your built-in
twitter application you can scroll right
through and see all your different
tweets if you want to open one
particular you can just click on it and
you get sort of a functionality across
the bottom you can scroll at see your
tweets your mentions direct messages
favorites and all the like and
notifications will show up in the
drop-down menu as well we'll go ahead
and close out of that will continue with
some of the widgets that I've got right
here we've got a friend Fiat sort of
pulls in all your friends tweets I'm not
useful it is but something kind of fun
to have and i wanted to show
demonstrated you've got weather of
course you can
sort of scroll through different
locations London Paris Here I am in
irvine now one thing that i should
mention is that when you set this up you
do have of course english options but
there is not an option for united states
english the closest was the UK so some
of the words have sort of the UK
spelling of things and i'm still playing
around figuring out how to get this from
celsius to fahrenheit i was able to get
the clock from 24-hour time to standard
12 at least 12 standard in the US let me
show you some of the other witness that
we've done here's HTC stock widget so
here we have up pictures in the picture
gallery let me show you how this is
handled standard android 2.1 had a
really cool sort of 3d picture effect
since you I doesn't have sort of the
same cool effects but it's pretty useful
here some pictures I took just about
side you still have the pinch to zoom
and to go the next picture you just sort
of do a sample swipe and videos show up
right in there as well you're the sample
video I took just sort of outside of my
balcony plays pretty nice it was very
short with video and I'll play right in
that same that same screen and if you'd
like as well go to go back to phone the
pictures for free flowing there so
here's a picture of cat Mercedes and you
have some options for for sharing this
quick that one more time so if you want
to send this wherever you like instead
it to facebook facebook HTC Sense sort
of a custom Facebook widget for HTC
Sense flickr gmail order a mail account
you have set up messages you want to
send it as an mms picasa or if it's a
video you can upload it directly to
youtube this is all sort of one touch
you set up the account you click it and
it automatically upload and up for
YouTube it will upload in the background
so you have to keep the YouTube window
open here all the time or something that
annoyed me with a few other devices go
ahead and close that here so that was
pictures then we've got sort of a blank
screen here on the 7th and let me show
you what some of the other widgets are
go to widgets
and you've got sort of your array of HTC
options bookmarks calendar clock
Facebook footprints which is geo-tagging
french stream i showed you mail just
pulls in your mail messages music sort
of get the android music and HTC music
news to pull in all your news feeds
people it's sort of a quick dial shows
you a thumbnail of their picture if you
like and you can call them photo album
the sample it what that looks like let's
go back stock settings on the same
things weather and YouTube so let me
show you one or two other things they
have noticed it in kind of interesting
one of my concerns when I flash this rom
which again was quite a hassle was
Android Marketplace Android Marketplace
still going to work with the sort of
cooked rom and it does work and work
just as I'd expected with this is what
is if this was native so Android
Marketplace Warped no problem and things
are here summer in dollar summer in
pounds so let's go ahead and check out
the internet since does use a looks like
a bit of a different browser so here
we've got on technobuffalo load speeds
were just as fast as you'd expect with
tmobile who is i'm using on here 3g
network or Wi-Fi pinch-to-zoom is
certainly still there landscape
orientation there as well it's actually
relatively quick as far as rotating
speeds it's renders fast scrolls fast
and pinch to zoom works very quickly do
it and quit out of here a few other sort
of different things to be aware instead
of having it's a 3g it's gonna have an
h4 hsdpa so the icons across the top are
going to look a bit different than what
you might have been used to with android
2.1 the lockscreen you guys saw when i
first turn this on is definitely
different as well sort of the HTC Sense
lockscreen you to slide that down and
your home screen is revealed now i'm
sure they're a lot you can see the cloud
you can see the cloud sort of go across
the home screen we saw that with the HTC
hd2 if it's raining you'll see water
drops will show up
they're cloudy you'll see the clouds if
you just saw its snow it was these sort
of snowflakes the HTC Sense UI is really
full featured and goes all the way down
through most parts of Android it's I'm
going to really enjoy the nexus one has
a processor speed and the RAM to handle
running all these widgets to handle the
live wallpapers and have things run very
smoothly now I have not tested battery
drain I assume this is going to be a
complete batteries suck but right now
it's been been working pretty well I've
had it for for a few hours and things
seem to be running nicely and again this
is just an alpha build of the wrong I
assume as so the community starts to
build and go from alpha few other alphas
and finally into beta and a release that
you're really going to see a an improved
experience right now I think I could use
this on a daily basis to probably use
this quite happily so guys once again if
you're considering doing this is
certainly not for the faint of heart I
don't think I could've done this on my
own without Carlos's help and his
definite hand holding something to keep
in mind and at the very least to sneak
preview of what you can expect with the
HTC Desire which I'm guessing is set for
just a European release judging by the
language options and I guys hope you
enjoy it for more coverage of the sense
UI on the nexus one be sure to check out
the youtube channel and of course
technobuffalo com where you can get all
your tech news even create and monetize
your own text sub blog talk and create
friends talking about technology with
our own custom-built social network
anyway jon rettinger from technobuffalo
i hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
