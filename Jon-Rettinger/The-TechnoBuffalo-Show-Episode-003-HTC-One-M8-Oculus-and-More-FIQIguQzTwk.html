TechnoBuffalo show I'm on your three
hosts for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site I'm joined by executive
editor mobile Todd Hazleton everyone an
executive editor of gaming joey davidson
hey what's up guys our apologies for
being late everybody we had some
technical difficulties for those of you
watching live you can see there's to
todds in the room and we can't figure
out why so it's double the todd yeah one
of those Todd's is a real big jerk yeah
but we're not saying which one anyway so
there's been a lot going on this week
and we're just going to start briefly
here Todd HTC One m8 any initial
thoughts you care to share with the
audience yeah I'm digging it so far I
have it here we'll have our review up
all right later this week we've been
trying to spend some more time with it
so we had our hands on and we walk
through some features yesterday for you
a lot of comparisons but we're still
going to spend some time with it there's
a various reports on the camera like a
camera they actually it changed it in
some ways by adding that depth lens
sensor right there and then the older
people up some more you tease what's
that oh vine is what is really amazing
but most of the complaints I've seen is
about the camera so I want to play a
little bit more with that bright light
sort of wash this stuff out hmm which
has been a problem because ultrapixel
actually let's in more light so it does
really well in low light situations but
when you're outside and stuff that can
get kind of messy so how's the image
stabilization been on it so far no it's
not good it doesn't have 0 is actually
no that's that's the problem with the
the one mini as well right they took it
off that they didn't put it in the one
max but the original last year's model
hello is so is it fer fer a parent who
takes pictures of a running toddler
while doing like this the whole time
it's really difficult to get a smooth
picture of them so that's not cool yeah
but the the experience is amazing so far
super super fast like that's cool
Snapdragon 801 it's not just I was
reading other articles yesterday too
it's not just an overclocked Snapdragon
800 idea we're saying that but it's
really built on the 800 with it and you
can it you can really notice it flies it
only has two gigs of RAM which I thought
might matter since people were kind of
looking forward to three gigs that's
what the galaxy s5 has it's tough but it
seems totally fine or at least the note
3 has it yeah okay well and that
question came from Jordan Edwards and we
have one more ma question then we'll be
getting to the other big story the
second question comes from and Todd you
can probably speak to this one the most
do you think the HTC One m8 is going to
change the fate of HTC I hope so i think
because obviously you like to see as
many competitors in the market as
possible not hate to cgc go somewhere
it's going to be about marketing and
this time they're sort of leaving it up
to us right there leaving not just me
but I mean us as consumers to tell our
friends like hey she sees this great
product they put a lot of time into
design and all that kind of stuff so
they they're not relying so much as on
like pushing out as many products as
possible they think they can make enough
money just on sales of premium products
in creating this you know focus around
their brand name you know moving forward
to and so one of the ways they're going
to do that is I talked to AT&amp;amp;T yesterday
they're gonna keep selling the original
one for a little bit but not in stores
only online and then we'll see HTC
introduce their desire 8 16 I think
United States sort of a lower price
point so you're not leaving the store
without an HTC product which is one of
their concerns and then they're keeping
the one mini in stores too so good
strategy moving forward because what
they had told me is there concern was
someone would look at the one last year
say and say yeah it's a little too
expensive and then walk out with a
competitor's product so I think they're
on the right track to keep you in there
with their products I think that the one
mini definitely deserves a minor
facelift if if if they're looking to
keep it on the market for much longer
storage capacity battery life all that
stuff is starting to show its age so
yeah I'd like to see them continue with
that the desire it succeeds a really
sweet phone I don't know about their
plans on major US carriers but
I saw a death back at Memorial Congress
it's actually awesome so I hope hey
we've got one more question Todd you
might be able to answer can you clarify
the question of the on-board storage
memory and what it ships with at the
base two hundred dollar price but having
a hard time getting clarification on
whether it's 16 gigabytes or 32
gigabytes that's a good question because
HTC wasn't really clear on that with us
yesterday either we had a lot of the 199
price points and then they said 249 on
some carriers I have an AT&amp;amp;T model here
with 32 gigs of storage and I'm guessing
this is going to be the more expensive
one but remember they added expandable
storage this time around two so you can
add up to 128 cakes and I know that a
lot of people like the local storage but
you can move apps to that and everything
so it should be pretty good okay well
we're going to move on to another
subject I'm sure we'll probably come
back to the m8 for those of you that
weren't aware yesterday a major story
broke around what time was a tot around
five thirty year time yeah like 545 vs
yeah somewhere later in the day and a
bombshell came ripping through the world
of technology in the announcement that
Facebook had purchased oculus now I one
question I'm seeing in here is some
people are asking exactly what is oculus
so with Todd you've actually played with
it Joey it's more in your field so i'll
let you to debate which one wants to
explain what oculus is no board Todd you
want to start our final personal reality
headset and there you go we played with
the most recent version so yes Joey
probably know the name better than I do
I forget I'm still Cove foot boat and
its really awesome and what the latest
version does is you you put on this
headset it has sensors that run
alongside I guess early cool lights
maybe and so when you're moving around
in a game you can add there's actually
perception and depth perception so if
I'm looking at my computer say in a game
and I move closer that computer comes
closer and in the past it would sort of
move away from you all time so you
really feel like you're in this new
environment and at CES I had this the
virtual reality headset on from
and I was playing this cockpit fighter
game and I'm looking around you can like
get in and look at the controls and
everything look at it and you feel like
you're in this totally different
universe it's really unreal so that
company it seemed was going to push some
of the boundaries in gaming in some
areas and I'll let Joey really explain
that but is now acquired by Facebook for
two billion dollars yeah 400 million in
real money and at one point three
million facebook shares so monopoly
blocks basically oh yeah pretty crazy I
eric frederiksen and i use the other
gaming writer who's obviously not been
on this show yet I he I had a real
lengthy conversation this morning that
we actually turned into an editorial
which I know Sean you've seen it should
go live later today it will Tuesday the
day of her court Wednesday what what
what year is it Wednesday sorry so it
it's a crazy bit of news it's really
interesting in the editorial that I just
mentioned and I take up the position of
frustration I'm not really happy by the
news this news isn't exciting to me Eric
took up the position of being a little
more pleased with it so he's actually
happy about it um for me I knew that
oculus VR was going to get purchased it
was a Kickstarter back project they
brought that that kick-started to
fruition so the dev kits are out there
in the wild dev kit too i believe is
shipping right now Crystal Cove is
shipping this summer it's for PC gaming
so far only but the Facebook acquisition
implies just a crazy in chip of policy
and and actually use for this thing
there they're going to be using it for
social interactions and some of the
ideas being kicked around by some
friends in talking about this just in
the last 24 hours or twelve hours or how
long it's been imagine like strapping a
GoPro to my head Todd like I go skiing
sometimes in the winter and I pop a
GoPro on my head and then you're like
Rome totally going to sit here watch you
do this
yeah there's sounds awesome that sounds
awesome the gaming thing that I think a
lot of us were hoping for so I don't
know I'm kind of up in the air about it
yeah I can see taking it out of the
gaming room and say you know
grandparents you know it say for
instance Joe your parents want to see
Connor and they could put on a helmet
and you could use some sort of camera
that would let them see him in a more 3d
image I mean they could just drive 30
minutes well yeah I'm speaking generally
and then then the other scenario i see
is all those people from high school
that have friended me on Facebook that I
have no desire to speak to what so ever
write us all hanging out in a room for a
reunion right because their husband just
you know recorded their birth live and
posted that on to look and naivety ha
culous I gotta watch this is it auto
place as you scroll facebook it's
horrible but so amazing what's up your
bird was saying to like classrooms which
I don't understand what are you doing
with looking around a room of people
with cameras that have them with VR on I
don't know well it's I I can see it in
an education scenario say like yo NASA
want to do an outreach to a school in
Africa those kids could never go to the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory but a NASA
instructor could take them around the
JPL and show them that so there are
educational advantages to this that I
could agree with right and and and the
hardware is not so unreasonably
expensive and of course it'll it will
come down over time but i mean it i
think that the numbers i've heard
floating around are like 300 bucks and
of course you need a pc and an internet
connection but it's not so unbelievably
expensive that's old donation projects
like that can't happen they can and will
so that that part of it is interesting
but i think the frustration that you're
seeing this morning in the wake of last
nights news comes from gamers who wanted
a gaming focused piece where and I've
like that's all but evaporated at this
point it's a facebook says they're gonna
continue let them operate independently
and everything I don't know how to do
that I I there's two pieces of proof
here facebook bought instagram right I
feel a lot of Instagram users would say
that Facebook's been fine since that
buyout I don't know how many people have
been negatively affected except for
those that just genuinely freakin hate
Facebook and one nothing to do it like
the average instagram user I don't think
has felt that input impact however the
only thing Facebook has done in the
realm of gaming so far is their gaming
service and developers there on that
platform have been almost unanimously
unhappy they changed the the products
and procedures almost overnight without
consulting any benefit or any developers
they take a massive cut of profits that
are made from developers and it's just
like you want to access to our giant
user base you're just going to have to
bend to our our will hear and I think
that's kind of scary yeah we had one
question come in here what and this
comes from Kyle Peterson what are the
benefits of the purchase of oculus what
should we expect because of this
purchase the only benefit I I see
initially especially for oculus is this
gives them a lot more capital to work
with oh the equity news is huge yeah you
know and so they can advance the
technology more since it really wasn't
out in the public yet apparently
something really is amusing Joey someone
asked what are you hiding behind that
sheet I was saving that question for the
end of the show sorry I even noticed
that Joey has been giving me grief about
the sheets that's before the first step
like you go and we'll come back anyway
so I kills really isn't out in the
public yet you know yes that is their
dev kits out there and so on so I really
don't see where it's going to negatively
impact the majority of consumers at this
point
they're not going to know anything of
oculus other than the facebook-owned
version so i think yes the technology is
going to get some major advancements due
to the purchase of facebook but it's not
going to be the same product it was and
we just can't know yet if that's good or
bad I think what's really interesting
about this purchase that might be an
immediate negative effect and and Eric
and I talked about this a lot so if you
are interested in this but do encourage
you to check that out later and talk
with us too because we'll be hanging out
there as well the developer response to
this acquisition has been really
negative and problematic specifically
the the guy developed minecraft so
Markus notch Persson persone person
never actually had to announce his name
out loud naughty notch basically as soon
as it happened he just popped over on
Twitter was like so minecraft for oculus
rift is cancelled I don't like Facebook
um I I will say this i thought notch was
extremely quick in that the man does not
like facebook he's not a lone man there
are plenty of people out there who
really really don't like Facebook all
right whether or not that's entirely
warranted as a subject for a completely
different episode i think but the fact
of the matter is some developers
especially indie developers that might
have possibly created the most
interesting and unique oculus rift
experiences are jumping ship early
really early I imagine that that
Facebook's negative image and negative
brand and the mind of developers and
even youth culture to a certain extent
most hood youths are not on the
facebooks I know they're on Twitter and
Tumblr and things like that but but I
think that's because facebook is a very
negative image in that side of the world
so that's a problem we have another
question from Jordan Edwards and do you
think that Microsoft shut about oculus
are not Facebook I I I think actually a
lot of us would prefer to have seen
oculus stay independent well if react
about this time
amazon any way any one company was gonna
buy oculus rift not saying that this
company would have but if any one
company was going to buy them that made
gamers happy it would have been valve I
can't think of any other company that
would buy them that people would would
not be pissed off about I think that
xbox one owners were really pleased with
the oculus rift position if it was done
by Microsoft but there's a giant slice
the internet that really hates Microsoft
right now so that that would probably be
problematic for them too should
Microsoft have purchased it I don't
think it would have been a bad move but
the higher ups and Microsoft are in the
middle of all kinds of crazy shake ups
there are people in that company that
don't even want gaming to be part of of
the microsoft suite of products so you
know I don't know if necessarily would
have been good for business for them
steam vr that has a nice ring to it
valve is working on their own VR I think
that's yeah all right let me just get
this question out of the queue Jake
behind the sheet of some really ugly
shelves holding dolls prefer those for
those listening on audio you can't see
that behind me there there's a sheet
hanging well the sheet is hanging there
too just so people don't have to stare
at some ugly shelves with a bunch of
toys and other stuff on them nothing
nefarious they actually it's where I
hide the bodies of the writers that just
please me or get bottles yes um okay so
next question here from Gabe Lasky why
would Facebook by oculus rift what will
it use it for it that is the giant
question right now mm-hmm well social
gaming and and education stuffs what
Zuckerberg said in his blog post but I
mean I don't see Facebook's use of it
being gaming specific Todd um no I'm
just saying what Zuckerberg said he's
leaving it and he wanted he's not
changing the gaming focus that's all i
signal farmville no I compares it
compared to the the sex scene and
demolition man hi I saw a tweet that out
right
uh I think of the social interaction
possibilities are pretty limitless here
I think that on that side of the
spectrum if it if it was an oculus rift
and it was just another VR platform I
think that we wouldn't be as frustrated
because the the possibilities for social
interaction with virtual reality are
pretty cool but it's just the fact that
this might be a little damaging to the
gaming side of oculus regardless of what
Zuckerberg says there's there the gaming
world will have to feel this and whether
or not it's indirect control or if it's
if it's just as a result of the Facebook
brand even being on it people quitting
like like notch you know yeah here's one
question uh what about Oh ash is from
Gabe Lasky what about oil should they
about oculus they don't have the money
yeah add 2 billion was low ball I heard
yeah and heard that that that two
billion was was a little less than the
oculus VR people would have one and I
don't think I had had the money for that
so I actually I saw an interesting tweet
yesterday I unfortunately can't remember
who said it but they said this was akin
to when Yahoo offered 1 billion for
facebook years ago and you know what
Facebook is grown into oculus has a very
bright future in front of it I mean
unfortunately I didn't have time at CES
to run over with todd to check out
Crystal Cove but when he and Brandon got
back to our little work area I can't
remember the last time I saw either of
them that built up and excited for
anything they literally what do you
really feel like you're entering another
world it's very cool crazy to think
about yeah yeah it's pretty cool I think
if anything this move might have even
further solidified at least for gamers
their excitement for project morpheus
from Sony almost every message board
I've come across read it everywhere
neogaf everywhere its people are just
like well great now I know that I'm
putting money into Sony's platform and
not oculus that was pretty too and they
said at least Sony's got something now
so yeah I mean I don't think that it's
quite as
dire and all hope is lost as that like
that that kind of makes my facebook just
through like the the giant pile of
oculus rifts and is currently backing
over them with a truck like I don't
think that that's why me they buried him
next to the might as well right right t
cartridges out in the desert no I don't
think it's quite that bad ah but I do
think it for people who are really into
the sony brand right now and there's a
lot of them because whether you love
sony or not it's you have to admit that
they've been really kicking butt and
taking names on the PR front so this is
more more good news for them and they
didn't even do anything this time that's
got showed up now from future game dev
should we expect oculus to change
anything since facebook bought them well
they're saying no but the proof is in
the pudding yeah uh early buzz is that
Facebook will leave them alone if that's
the case then that's awesome yeah i
think i'd like to go around the table
here I Facebook is not known for being a
hardware company you know the the
purchase of whatsapp made since the
purchase of Instagram made sense
purchasing a strike Lee hardware company
puzzles me greatly well let me because I
might be able to direct this into Todd's
wheelhouse a little bit better but
facebook has been facebook has been
known to take cracks at platforms before
didn't they then they run a deal with
HTC forever ago where they were trying
to get a facebook phone out in the
market they've done 3 so that this this
to me salsa and the first the salsa the
cha-cha was my favorite oh my gosh uh
well so they've this isn't their first
foray into being platform owners so to
speak mm-hmm I think that this is
probably their best bet a facebook phone
didn't make too much sense but oculus VR
is like just about the number one name
in virtual realities future right now
and Facebook got ahead of the curve by
buying them so yeah no II era
what do you think Todd do you think that
there's that there's a platform desire
for them that's why they went after this
I don't know I don't it's hard because
it sort of the same question is raised
when you look at amazon and maybe them
creating like this game console to write
like why enter it and i think once you
have this huge user base in amazon has
their prime subscribers and people who
own their products and already know how
to use them and facebook has all the
users and i think they say like well
what can we do to keep making money off
them to keep moving forward when
facebook bought whatsapp one of the one
of the analysis because i read was
saying basically didn't just buy
whatsapp they bought a company but
nobody else at it so that everybody was
still talking about Facebook right so
like what if google had bought oculus
and then facebook down the roads like
you know we should have done that too or
we should have made that kind of move
and I think really it's more about
Facebook having all of these
opportunities now what they do with them
I don't know if that ever is gonna
matter which is unfortunate but I mean
when you look at the purchase price for
whatsapp right like how it's going to
take them years and years new decades to
make that money back so you have to
wonder why yeah but we use your base you
can kind of do whatever you want so I
don't know yeah the two billion purchase
price honestly as crazy as it sounds
feels to me like a bargain price well
you gotta remember that Facebook just
gave away facebook shares they only
spend 400 million in cash which is
that's a lot of it is a lot of money
let's not you know mince words here but
well for some people hmm mean just my
monocle job pulling woman quarter
million in the in the grand scheme of
Facebook what were they even valued at
as an IPO in the billions not millions
so small potatoes really III think it's
I think it's money well spent in their
mind at least at this stage in the game
if the platform emerges as awesome as it
has the possibility to a lot of people
are saying it will facebook how
is basically a ticket on that train
right now so i think that was money well
spent and then it just turns around all
of its users yeah right a question from
Gabe Lasky can I keyless be an accepted
future gaming concept or just a cool
gimmick Arzo I don't think until they
can get the an attractive product in
consumers hands at a reasonable price
with compelling software it's not going
anywhere it's it's akin to 3d television
if the install base needs to be there
and the price will dictate the desire
for this install base to come aboard so
it all depends on that there's like five
or six factors that have to merge into
one spot in order for this to become the
next wave of gaming so I agree with you
there but I wouldn't say it's just a
gimmick either I like 3d TVs i think her
kind of giving you yeah i mean it's a
let's not call it a gimmick let's
currently in my mind it's a sideshow um
there's not it's not a thing yet yeah
exactly i have a 3d television i didn't
buy it because it was 3d it was just a
darn good price on a television I needed
and I haven't used it once for 3d yeah I
have no desire to now I just the way it
is um okay so let's see here we have
there's an amazing amount of questions
and we want to thank you all for sending
those in some of these we very answered
here's a good one and let me pull this
one up here for so do you think that
Sony Morpheus is going to be better so
he does have a huge capital spend for
those that don't know Sony's project
Morpheus is there 3d headset that
they're currently working on I think
it's less about the capital that they
have to spend and more about the
developer trust that they've earned over
the last two decades sony has for a very
long time now had the ability to
tract really good third-party developers
and publishers and if anything is going
to sell project Morpheus it's going to
be that and I hate to be cliche but it's
going to be that killer app that that
that one or two pieces of software that
are just balls-to-the-wall amazing
that's what's going to be the
breadwinner for project Morpheus and
will it come maybe could be minecraft
now that notch is done with oculus rift
he could be with that on project morphus
and that could be a big money earner for
them so the other day the the three of
us were talking I'm not sure we want to
say which game it was uh that we were
all bored with a certain game okay sure
and I just got to think it you know how
much cooler that Kate would be if it was
Villar yeah Barbie horse adventures for
the wii right I talked and I didn't want
to reveal what the game was uh yeah I
bet let's let's come out of the dark I
don't care it was titanfall world we're
all horribly bored with tight I'm not
whore horribly bored I'm I it's starting
to wear thin I think um but that's you
know if anyone wants to know about that
I guess you can ask in the Q&amp;amp;A but yeah
I think uh I could totally see titanfall
being a ridiculous experience with VR
exactly yeah I was just saying here
think I did play a few rounds of
titanfall last night before dinner and a
it just crossed my mind yo yeah I was
saying I was like how this still isn't
you know really getting to me but say
here thing about was like man this would
be awesome I was a mech played a game
like Daisy with it like big all right
weird like explore and like I don't know
a very crazy tight our Skyrim Todd guy
around yeah imagine the skyrim in other
schools game uh then you fall out
whenever that's coming yeah if fallout
made used to VR that be unbelievable red
dead redemption to shut up you don't
look you just have to mention the name I
don't want to put it on any platform and
I do like yes red dead i'm in
you could play it on your your TI 86
plus calculator yeah I'm down let's do
it gay you almost all just saw me spit
coffee Rockstar announces a new line of
games for the ti 86 high school dropouts
at all-time highs closely gonna get him
you gotta borrow the TAC math class uh
here's an interesting question here is
Facebook trying to compete with
Microsoft and Sony for a piece of the
gaming console market it's not a console
though it's an add-on well it's it's
nothing right now it's nothing facebook
facebook could be perceiving it as a new
computer monitor of all things you know
i don't i don't know how they're
perceiving this thing is it is a
platform for them is it a console is it
just display technology i don't know the
facebook would not be smart to get into
the console market like that not at all
yeah I don't think uh and we've got a
question here from a very loyal listener
who has kindly treated to me how to
pronounce his name let me look over here
session Mahal such Sachin Sachin the
hall all right finally got me figured it
out anyway uh Todd you already spoke to
this a little bit but for those that
joined light a you've you've used it you
know you've explained that when you move
forward that things don't move away from
you has been the experience with VR in
the past now I I think one of the
questions I had I never got a chance to
ask you did you feel any sort of nausea
or anything for music like it does feel
weird because like I was in a spaceship
in one instance right and like I'm
looking around trying to like shoot bad
guys and you're flying and there's a lot
of movement and you
and it really surrounds you so you feel
like you're this place but you're not
moving i don't know it it's a little
nauseating but i think for me the
trade-off was just how unreal or real it
Phil just being in there when I took it
off it was kind of strangest be like now
I'm in this room still and I'm just
sitting in this cherry blossom in
depression said how it's very it's
around everything's like you look down
and it's your peripheral vision
everything it's it's weird and very odd
Ron dual or the other other caning right
herb and he he's reported to some motion
sickness but don't tell Ronis he's got a
weak stomach don't tell him I said that
though the Wi-Fi mad it a game like
titanfall right where there's so much
going on your slick I just want to kind
of walk around lowdown uh I don't know
I've the virtual reality i abused has
not caused me motion sickness yet so oh
and one last thing real quick to such
and happy birthday happy birthday is on
Friday ah well this is an interesting
question dethie rift will drop because a
lot of people lost interest in it no mmm
if anything's gonna drop the price in
the rift it's gonna be Facebook's
backing not but not the Lawson interest
that extra equity in capital could let
them drop the price a little bit to
bring in even more devs for the dev kits
otherwise I don't see it going anywhere
yet they haven't even like the mass
consumer product isn't even ready yet
you know there's no need to drop a price
so up okay so i think we're reading
ayala hey what were the vanilla comments
someone mentioned it up so 001 vanillish
is a Pokemon he looks like ice cream
cone and everyone made fun of me for
liking Pokemon so much but Sean and
taught both love polka
on don't let them lie big liars yes
we're big liars okay so guys we've had
some innate questions coming in so we're
a shift gears back there for a second
from Gabe Lasky Todd is the ma truly
worth the upgrade for the budget
concerned average consumer uh well it's
not it's not really a budget phone so I
would say no because flagship hi Martha
thank you back two more bucks but I mean
to be fair if you're upgrading you want
like worth the upgrade those words I
would say yes it's worth the upgrade I
don't know what you're coming from but
you consider your signing a two-year
contract then you kind of want to get
the best on the market right now and I
easily put the m8 up there so I don't
know you're willing to spend but I think
two hundred dollars with a contract is a
very good price i hain't contracts so I
yeah tell me about we well John I didn't
show yesterday we did learn that um
Canada has gone rid of its three-year
contracts thank goodness that's awful
office yeah a phone after two years
starts to get a little British man I
couldn't imagine keeping it for three
it's true ya know like I love what HTC's
doing and bringing the software to the
m7 last year's model and that's still
like a great bonus tell em on my desk
right here then it's still beautiful I
would still totally be prob with my wife
uses one my superior my brother-in-law
so many people have it I don't know
which what phone is that Todd I missed
it the HTC one m7 the risers 10 the
better version of mine thanks guys
rugged and uh interesting question for
Luke Broadway I felt like Zuckerberg had
spent facebook's money over the past few
years like he's a drunk man in Vegas
some called investing but I don't feel
like he's bought these companies with
plans make them better in any way your
thoughts well what companies is he as he
bought Instagram whatsapp in oculus and
there's been a couple other
miscellaneous little ones they don't
seem like that
purchases to me oculus rift seems like
the oddest it's not like he went out and
bought draw something for several
million dollars that was a mistake like
the week after think about that we all
just are no was thinking about them
right yeah yeah I am told us today they
bought it huh a nice move guys see you
later um you got so old so quick like we
added new words you check out all these
colors you can buy for three dollars
yeah we got about that yeah I don't
think it's been that bad I the one thing
that I think is weird as I'm still
trying to make heads or tails of how
Facebook is making money off of these
acquisitions yeah that's big questions
especially with whatsapp wait what is
the one still puzzles me wait how do
they make money off of Instagram a dad's
bad partners what adds exactly they're
doing a good girl that's a Jay they
don't really good job in my head you
know even your host we haven't I haven't
seen many but they left brands post like
you might have michael kors go by and
you'll just see like a purse or
something and it's kind of they just
disguise them i think they're doing a
pretty good job as well good for them
but I monetizing them is the weirder
part than buying them I feel like he's
him he is a drunk man on Broadway so to
speak or I'm in Vegas to speak but I
don't think his purchases are entirely
incoherent so you know joy everyone's
been saying although integrate ads into
games and you know they're actually like
that's a horrible thing and what was it
last week you and I were discussing our
love of crazy taxi yeah man that had
some of the best time Crazy Taxi had
some of those heavy-handed add
integration ever yeah I I mean ads on
billboards and games is nothing new I
play a lot of sports games and their ads
on on the outsides of the arenas and
fields and whatever else so it's not
going to change if anything Facebook
might be might get a little better at
tailoring it to you whether or not that
appeals to you i'm not sure but crazy
taxi soundtracks beloved
mm yeah yeah yeah yeah everyone knows if
you've ever been near a crazy taxi gave
you know that a simple question what are
you drinking coffee uh as everyone
TechnoBuffalo can the test of my blood
type is Colombian one asked I think the
TechnoBuffalo count asked what it's like
living in Delaware yeah John for lakers
asked what it's like living in Delaware
on them actually if you comment what is
it like living in Delaware well uh
dillards pretty awesome man we have
really good craft beer I don't know if
you guys have ever heard of dogfish head
I know Todd probably has a very work oh
there's lots of awesome beaches I know
you're in California so you like
whatever beaches bro I got them but so
the way and I'm central to New York DC
and philly to so all that plus tax free
shopping girlfriend I go out buy
something it's the exact price it says
on the board kick some ass where we're
all situated I'm in a little town called
Kirksville Missouri odd I where are you
now dirty right across I just left
Manhattan you're not too sure this city
joey is in Delaware and the majority of
everybody else is in irvine california
well Ron's in Japan Erickson Minnesota
and Jacobs in New York well roughly or
spread out yeah we're all I'm everyone
thinks I'm the oddball because I have to
drive three hours to get to an airport
yeah that is weird man I'm 30 minutes
from Philadelphia so 30 minutes from
three airports yeah that's strange to
what newark and a bunch of other places
and LaGuardia I'm three hours from two
airports you see I think everyone makes
fun of Delaware but I'll argue that
Kirksville Missouri it's much further
away from everything
sorry Missouri sir II Barack what the
southern Missouri ins say mr. ins Luke
those southies down there Ali deal
actually there's a canal that cuts the
state of Delaware and everyone from
below the canal we call them uh people
from slower lower but then like people
in slower lower just kind of like
adopted the phrase as if it were hate
speech and so they use it themselves to
kind of take some negativity off of the
word uh what happened to the console
wars they are still going on and I
believe episode two is just about done
so keep your eyes out for that the
console wars do continue we've seen them
they saw I saw it yeah it takes a lot of
production time to get those does the
next one's pretty good so get pumped
whoo Oh see well actually here's a
question out of the norm and now we'll
take it perhaps i'm looking to start a
website do you guys have any
recommendations on website builders
wordpress simplest thing in the world to
use wordpress is pretty simple if you've
got the money in your kind of a hipster
Squarespace is good too i am i've used
wordpress to you start my oats pretty
easy and then i have tumblr from my own
yeah i don't know what you want to do it
here say yes when did Squarespace become
a hipster spot I don't know man that's
just what I think of I think of some guy
starting to butcher shop I'm gonna start
a website it's called Squarespace i'm
also a hipster like I picture I don't
know I I can't say that I ever said I'm
going home Squarespace hipsters but
hipsters John watch yes he's still wrong
we're trying to get Q on the show too so
outside all right yes yes John junk
watch does still live in Toronto how
could i forget the queue okay how could
you you can't forget the queue um okay
let me look here real quick where we are
coming to the end of the
show does anyone have any final thoughts
on the whole oculus situation I'm
excited at this point I'm really excited
i think someone in the question section
said that or in the comments excuse me
on youtube said that one of the founders
of oculus palmer looky i think his last
name is your lucky i'm not sure how it's
pronounced said that deb facebook
accident acquisition will drop the price
of the oculus rift to pretty drastically
and this guy Damien proposes maybe
ninety nine dollars 250 bucks if that
number is for real that'd be awesome I
mean a hundred dollars for virtual
reality that would be pretty awesome but
I don't know if that's a hard time
believing that I'm gonna have to for
this week's flashbackfriday I'm gonna
have to go back and dig up some of the
virtual i'm using air quotes here the
virtual reality they kept trying to
convince us back in the 80s yeah it was
amazing what they thought it's so
lifelike who yes everybody's arms look
like giant blocks don't don't pay
attention to that but I you know the
thing I I and that's one thing you know
coming as the oldest member of the type
of Buffalo step and I've seen technology
a lot of the technology coming around
now from the first day of us around and
virtual reality has been a promise for
decades and I think we're finally
starting to get there but we're still
not quite there yeah yeah I don't know I
think it's gonna be close i think this
is the best chance its had in a very
long time and i think it's it's poised
to do better than than 3d gaming so I'm
interested to see where it goes someone
keeps asking what's going on with the oh
yeah Garrett long in who knows I mean
it's still there's still some
interesting games going on the latest
bit of news that I heard and this seemed
very contradictive to the the model that
they proposed the beginning was that
there were moving the free-to-play
requirement from all games so no longer
do devel
first have to put out a game that is
free to try I'm not sure if that's good
news or bad news thing for the platform
but that's the last I heard I can't
imagine it's doing as well as everyone
had hoped it was going to do oh not even
close someone wants to know what the
name of my beer is I have not named my
beard yet I will try to think of the
name coolio who my beard Julio the the
beard comes and goes so don't get too
used to it being around I'm one of those
people I can never just despite you know
make a definite decision on my facial
hair situation but uh alright well
anyone have any final thoughts for today
uh no of course I know it's Philly Gabe
man Todd do you ever do file thoughts no
no stay tuned for our HTC One m8
