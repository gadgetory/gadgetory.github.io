you i am jon rettinger we're gonna talk
about this little fellow right here or
actually this you know i'm just gonna
talk about the box it's a white box got
a sticker on top we can talk about the
box if you want otherwise we're talking
about this guy the all new HTC One m8
what is called the HTC One because it's
just too many letters so you can ask me
any questions you want about the m8 and
I will answer them honestly if you have
any other questions you guys want to ask
you're welcome as those to our
editor-in-chief shot audience doing the
moderation so I'll see the comments and
questions pop up right next to me so say
hi to sean you ask questions he loves
people let's say hi to him hi everyone
dariat guns got his rugged beard Shaun's
gone for the homeless look I are be
sticking leaves in it next yeah he's got
the little satchel over three children
so I'm just gonna answer questions we're
just talking well here's the first
question comes from Alex Miller let's
say I haven't heard anything about the
new one what is the best selling feature
in your opinion so I love the way the
phone feels hey man I really really I
think HTC's got the best build quality
I'm going in the Android world I think
the best compliment that I can give it
and I was going to enrage some people
but if you close your eyes pick this up
and I said you just picked up the new
iphone 6 you would believe it I mean
it's it's up to apples level of build
quality I think they've done naturally
tremendous job with it but my favorite
feature i think is right there on the
back the duo cameras are absolutely
awesome and not just a gimmick they
really work well even if you never use
sort of the after focus stuff for the
unfocus as they call it the camera
itself is really good we're still
testing it do our reviews but the really
quick shutter speed is nice for
capturing a very quick moving infants so
hopefully that helped enter your
question mr. Miller well let's make this
very clear this is not constitute our
review these are simply answers to
questions and there will be a full
review coming out of the room so we just
let everybody know we've had the device
under embargo cities friday but I just
didn't feel as enough time to do a
review so we'll have a first impressions
a post and video going up written five
o'clock pacific time today sort of
serving as our sort of early impressions
and then next week we'll do a a 42 for
you guys and here's our next question
from one of our regular podcasts
participants and i'm never going to get
his name right so he knows who i'm
talking about do you think HTC made the
right decision by going with the dual
cameras for the latest HTC One m8 why
are why not you very touched on this a
little bit John but we'd like to expand
yeah absolutely again you don't have to
ever use it so yeah the improvement
ultrapixel camera for digital HTC One
check that was very good we're still
doing the tests low-light in particular
something we're still so really really
working on but yeah I think the
absolutely made the right decision with
it and I give HTC credit for it for
calling out Samsung you know that the
giant in the room during their keynotes
Lionel that's not related but just that
if they're that up I like the comment
about dimples here here's a question
from our very own joey davidson coming
from the HTC one mini I've been super
bummed about the device's battery life
how's the battery on the One m8 well mr.
yaoi dad gavotte ssin I think that's
right davit in' i bet i've actually been
really good that's far i haven't haven't
used the power saving mode am so gotta
do that pod lead on this week for the
review but i will say in my usage this
is sort of how I use the phone and yes
she is probably the best day cuz for the
first full workday with it I took it off
to charge around six thirty in the
morning it's checking two email accounts
every five minutes throughout the entire
day connected to Wi-Fi mostly at the
office and at home but using it probably
more than I would ordinarily does it
seen a new playing games answering phone
calls about an hour and a half a phone
calls social media and downloading apps
and such on it I don't do auto
brightness electing my brightness around
seventy-five percent by the time i plug
it in last
night at around eleven o'clock at
forty-six percent battery life left and
that's without ever having to use any of
the power saving stuff so it seems to be
pretty good so far i wanted to use a
couple more week days to make see the
seeds at number sort of continues
yesterday we had a software update that
came through in the morning so you know
see as the days go on it that's i prove
suppose we had better improve its in
there as well okay with this next
question comes from someone named mr
yadav does the lack of Beats Audio have
any impact on the sound the only impact
it has it doesn't have a logo on the
back boom snap here is way louder way
more clear the original HTC One they
claim twenty percent louder I don't know
if its twenty percent I thought the
original boomsound send a great this one
just sounds better so I don't think that
has any effect at all other than maybe
it's not dr. Dre endorsed okay this next
question comes from Sumer Chandra could
you please explain to me the difference
between the new blinkfeed and the old
one um I can't quite inch that one yet
because now honestly I turned blinkfeed
off but I need to be using that
intestine as part of the review from
what I've read you can set custom feeds
for any topic you want um you know it's
really the big difference what I do like
though is that you don't have to decide
blinkfeed you can actually just turn the
blinkfeed panel off completely which has
been a nice feature ideas of it so
probably not the answer looking for the
time of your our full review I will test
it link feed that's why I don't think
three or four days enough time to review
there's so many questions it's really
use I like to use the phone like I
actually use the phone and not just be
like dr. test for review like actually
trying to use it as a real device
exactly this question comes from
Dominique Weber and we very answered
this partially hey John have you gotten
your hands on the dot view case yet and
how long have you had the m8 in the
office so we had the innate since Friday
um Todd who's at the event in New York
has the doc case and actually going to
film a video on it today so I haven't
had a chance to actually use it doesn't
look really cool though I'm not the
biggest fan of cases that sort of open
up you got to open up to use but I do
like how it works okay
to try it I will have some coverage on
it and then I'll have used it by time we
do a full review of next week so some
coverage on it in there as well alrighty
uh this another question from Chandra uh
does the it may feel slippery it does
actually feel when I first picked it up
now is actually my first thoughts that
is a little bit slippery on it but I
don't obviously putting a gross patina
on the back room where I use it the less
slippery feels to me I might be it used
to it my first impression was definitely
that it is a little bit as a preset or
it could just be that gunk e-tech feel
that you're getting on the back of it
bail I don't I got bit by a radioactive
spider the other day and I started
getting these little hairs on my finger
so I don't know that's been helpful that
could be part of it that could be aa
we've got another question here is the
HTC available in canada yes they did
mention that onstage I'll just take care
of that one for ya all the carrying
cases like tell us bell and rogers so
and i think they announce something like
200 some carriers today so yeah there's
going to be a really you're going to be
able to get anywhere you want basically
yep and while each ask that question
don't sign a three-year contract i hate
the Canada makes you do that Oh sign a
three-year contract for any phone if you
can avoid it yeah yeah exactly this next
question comes from Gabe Lasky and is
the new since six as smooth as since
five your opinions on the looks of the
UI I don't know if I'm in the minority
on this one but i really like sense i
actually if I had a choice and I had the
choice last generation between sense
version of the phone and a Google Play
ocean I really like sense if it's
there's not a giant differences here
versus sense 5 from what I've able to
tell so far it's sort of little tweaks I
really like they did at the camera being
able to serve and you'll see this in our
hands on video and I showed it a little
bit in our duo camera overview you click
the settings option you get is very very
easy to understand menu options don't
camera to jump to so I think these
simplify things I like that HTC took I
think the opposite approach of Samsung
with their their UI their skins
do you want to call it our custom
operating systems I think Samsung throws
a ton of features at you and hope that
there's one or two that you really like
it are going to use I think HTC spends
more time trying to figure out what
features they think people are really
going to use and not adding things that
they consider to be extra the motion
controls are kind of nice I really do
like to tap to unlock kind of thing
don't call an off girl chill get all
pissed but those features have been been
really nice and and welcome so I'd
probably say those would biggest
difference was since six and just a bit
of housekeeping here because I see one
question getting a lot of votes if you
have a if you see another question the
queue that you really are interested in
please give it a plus and I'll let us
know which ones you're really wanting to
hear the answers to the most and with
that in mind Gabe Lasky has another
question that's gotten several votes do
you think the new HTC One does not look
as good as the previous version is it a
little thicker I believe it's actually a
little thinner i can get the actual
version right in here i'll bring a whole
interv time is out here um let me just
requests that sack everyone wants to
work in office where you can just type
in phones magically or brought to you so
welcome back to to that question and
also compared but I think it's a little
bit a little bit thinner the older HTC
One had sore plastic ribbon right down
the middle this one is now all metal the
metal sort of wraps around and that
might account for I feel a little bit
slippery too oh one sec I got unlock my
door guess it's true folks that John
just locks his door and keeps us all out
of AO any moment until be right back at
you can sue secure in the background
though here is the older generation HTC
One and here is new HTC One so you can
see the difference there so it looked to
be about the same thickness but the new
one has sort of a curved side to it so
it feels a little bit thinner and a half
so hopefully the help thank you from
alrighty next question here comes for
shandra again is the new HTC One West
grade yes yes yes yes I've seen the
leaks too it looks like it's very
evolutionary in a small upgrading to use
the phone you hold the phone to realize
it's a much bigger upgrade than you
think originally yes yes yes yes I guess
it's worth the effort okay so John what
you're saying here is you think it may
be worth the upgrade yes worth the
upgrade I don't say worth the upgrade
very often for a lot of phone this one
is definitely worth the effort here's
some good information for you John and
I'm thrilled this is more of a statement
just let you guys know as of December
2013 there are no more three-year
contracts in Canada we now have two year
contracts for phones rather than the
horrible three year well two years is
long enough and is probably long that it
should be but thank goodness number
three years and Canadians were giving
screw they're getting screwed data costs
against group contracts I'm happy our
friends up north now get more realistic
I totally agree totally agree if this
question comes disappeared on me this
question comes from Asterix central if
you could improve one thing about the
HTC One m8 One m8 what would it be and
why hmm the question I probably would
have liked maybe a bit more texture on
the back so it would have felt less
slippery but honestly oh no no no no
wireless charging give me wireless
charging at I don't care if the phone
slipped out of my hands but I want
wireless charging it's not have that
give me wireless charging thank you very
good also i also i find it really
annoying that phones when you turn them
on make noise like dude you know that
you all HTC logo Samsung's got it like I
turned my phone on in the morning with
my wife is sleeping and act like wait to
walk out of the room to do it we stop
doing that well they don't want you to
forget who made it it is really annoying
cut cut it out stop the madness this
question comes from echo x86 t have you
encountered the purple tough licked at
some HTC One phones on either last year
or the new HTC One m8 this is actually
asked on Twitter
the same person but no there's no purple
hue at all I didn't experience it on the
last generation that I know people did
the screen looks great on here I don't
think the screen looks as good as some
of the same time displays and I want to
see those sometimes have a little bit of
a hue to them but the screen looks great
on the m8 all right this next question
comes from Tex nackles when will the
google play edition become available and
will it come to the UK I believe it's
available right now to be I believe it's
for pre-order yeah yes available to
pre-order right now I would assume it
come to the UK I mean I wouldn't see why
would not come to the UK but I don't
know I don't know the answer tight that
always import it which would probably
kinda expensive or you know cream market
kinda exactly okay because notice by a
tortoise by a carrier version by the
developer version whatever I just put on
a custom role then here's one question
working a lot of votes on and
unfortunately I don't know if we can
answer this yet this comes from Bradley
Richards how does the new dot view
casework LEDs or using the main display
so I can't answer that one does not use
LEDs in the case the case doesn't have
its own battery pack or anything it
actually activates the screen and the
screen lines up the dots with where it
knows that the holes in the case are so
it just uses the screen to show all that
stuff and the light just shines through
the holes in the screen alrighty and
Chandra is asking all sorts of great
questions and getting lots of votes here
do you think the dual camera can figure
is actually useful or a gimmick we kind
of already answer that one I think it's
absolutely very very very useful and if
you don't like it you don't have to use
it sound like it's forcing a gimmick
dinner throat I think it's really useful
it's kind of a cool feature to have
alrighty this next question comes from
clear you concerning the increase in
size of the new HTC One would you expect
a viable mini version to be introduced
yes for sure sure there'll be a mini
it'll be a max they'll be in between e
and a camera but no I absolutely think
this will be
a new version of a coming soon and the
smaller version I just launched stuff
out of my desk all right okay there
there's a lot of questions coming in
here this one comes from probe gamer
dynamics is it is it an iphone / samsung
beater so first i just made my scream
pig's eye can see what you guys see here
it looks like Google it's really like a
soft focus on my face I look like I'm
right out of like a 1990s like Showtime
after-hours movie but kissa I feel like
I'm you pick some romantic music um that
was just rubbing her butt yeah I do
think it's an iphone i will start the
iphone first i think people generally
know if you want an iphone or if you
want an android device i think most
people generally know which one they're
going to get if you're on the fence and
you want to go through and look at both
devices i think this one sacks up really
really nicely with the iphone i think
where there's probably more competition
is between HTC One and the upcoming
Galaxy s5 you'll walk into a store they
only want an android device they may be
heard about both and they want to sort
of look at them side-by-side and I think
in new HTC one's going to stack up
really really nicely with the galaxy s5
I'm just picking it up you know you
could feel the meadows most of plastic
you know but Samsung's got a huge
advertising budgets they got it giant
name recognition they're putting out
what I assume is a very nice phone of
course with blogging impressions to
actually get a chance to use it um but I
think it can really really compete for
for market share and probably for HTC
sake more mind chairs looking forward
this generation all right we've got a
lot of questions coming in on Twitter I
just happened to look over my Twitter
feed in there including me on it so i
can read some of these to you a quick
one here from frankie wrinkle is the
front facing camera better than the back
because of the higher megapixels so big
misconception here it's ultra pixel on
the back not megapixel so don't don't
put stock in that number it's a bunch of
pixel stacked on top of each other to
make one ultrapixel camera on the back
is great it works really well i'm still
testing it to the pictures as i can see
so far look awesome camera on the front
though also looks awesome as
angle so you didn't sort of get you and
5-year besties and yet take your selfies
so I mean they're both very good if you
want better quality image to that camera
is this true it probably most phones is
higher quality and one more question
here from twitter from a technical does
the black bar along the bottom of the
screen plus the on-screen buttons look
or feel like a design flaw let me show
you let's take a look do we only get the
black bar when serve you're an app so
you can see my son right there but if
you have no black bar right there if i
go into to like chrome for example you
know then then sort of you do get the
black bar but I've always said I'm not a
big fan of on-screen buttons when I was
even less of a fan of the buttons on the
old HTC One where they were capacitive
and sort of on the other side and is
also black bar they're not on the screen
I would take the new one over the old
one any day so I serve q equals okay we
have one quick question here from a
Nathan Oh dong does the m8 m8 have NFC
yes yes yes absolutely this hey I think
honestly isn't the iphone about the only
flagship phone without NFC now yep Oh
Apple uh what colors are the US carriers
going to get and that disappeared for me
just as i was going that's a good one i
don't know i would assume all three
colors but that one I really don't know
the answer to I don't want to just make
something up yeah this question comes
from lon win is the new HTC one's power
button more cumbersome to use than the
original one since it's slightly taller
or have you avoid using it with the wake
gestures some good questions I didn't
like the power button on the original
HTC One at all this one it is a taller
device so you know you have to sort of
lift your finger up to get it but it's
way easier to find a way easier to press
so I prefer it but I mostly honestly to
turn the phone on I mostly just use
awake gestures and that's been easier
for me up cuz I don't like the button I
just think it's much easier just to
double tap screen
alrighty then i D this question comes
from Luke Holly oh darn it move up there
do you think HTC are ever going to
develop a SmartWatch now with all the
Google where announcements they said
they're worth Dan's not much so yes yes
definitely hey I don't see how they can
at this point yeah all right this
question comes from Asterix central let
me move it up there for you what is the
average scenario where you'd use the 3d
effect on the dual camera i don't think
i would use the 3d effect on it okay and
you can watch our camera video again the
trade it is that one might be a little
bit gimmicky and they might have done
because they could I don't think how to
use it maybe is like a background can
serve a parallax effect but other than
that I don't think i would use it that's
iana that's the honest answer alright
this question comes from Nathan Oh dong
xperia z2 or HTC One m8 which one feels
better in the hand um I like dizzy too i
think it feels really really nice and i
know i got a lot of flack for this but I
still stand by it they'll waterproofing
aspect of the z2 makes the screen not
look as bright as a screen should so i
would i would take the the m8 and try
not drop in the toilet that's probably a
good idea with every phone okay this
question comes from gabe Lasky how does
the camera stack up to the current
awesome phone cameras on the market
we're going to do a full comparison
comparing the pictures i don't i haven't
used it long enough to feel comfortable
answering that i will say the pictures
I've taken on it do you look very good
all right this question comes from
Bradley Richards I'm not sure we know
the answer to this yet can you still use
some touchscreen gestures through the
dot view case I yes you can't actually
they showed today in the press
conference if you want to answer a phone
call you get an arrow that goes down is
your swipe your finger down and you can
indeed your such gestures they're very
few that you can use but yes you can
without ever been open a case okay this
question I I know this is going to start
a fire stone but firestorm bits the most
of
good question right now would you prefer
the HTC one over the iphone good
question I actually when I started using
the HTC One I switched from an iphone 5s
and there are few things that I missed
on iOS four say Messiah message and i
miss gallery sinking in the iCloud I've
sort of gotten around that using dropbox
sync and then sink that's my computer so
those are my big things that i always
miss when i switch away from the iphone
saying i prefer it over the other I
don't know if I prefer it or not I'll do
a comparison certainly of the two and
sort of you guys can decide I think they
both offer sort of different things but
I don't think I preferred over the
iphone but a guy when they happen for
the iphone over this I've served that
fantage a question alright this is
another question from cure you do you
think the new HTC One was a big enough
jump from the original and if so is that
a viable option upgrade from its
predecessor yes on both of those fronts
I didn't think so until I actually saw
the phone and got the phone or hand it's
a big update from the processor it's not
just sort of them as evolutionary as it
was looked in the leaks so yeah I do
think it's a big jump and I do think
it's a nice upgrade from the original I
think the original is a great phone so
if you're happy with it maybe you want
to wait a year um you know I don't think
you'll be disappointed waiting a year
but if you're itching for a new phone i
think jump in with both feet will be
very happy alright here's another
question from echo x86 HTC is brought
back the micro SD card slot after
leaving it out of the droid DNA an HTC
One is expandable storage still a
necessity with all the cloud options
available I think so it's only comes at
16 and 32 gig configurations so I think
it's nice to have as important to some
people I think HTC took a lotta and I
know I thought to HTC's PR they take a
lot of flack for not having an SD card I
think they are really sick of hearing it
so I think if you want to use you've got
the option if you don't then rely on the
cloud they did something weird though
with the we talked about this in the
first impressions video coming later on
today um you know when you put a my nano
SIM into an iPhone or really any other
film uses an since got a little tray
they have to put it any put the train to
the phone you got the same tray for
the microSD card which was just weird I
i thought i had like a dual-sim phone
for a minute before i figured out that
was for the SD card that that is a odd
design choice yes very strange this
question comes from Luke Haley uh how
are the front facing speakers loud very
very very very loud I kind of wish that
maybe there was like a stand in the back
deck it's sort of put it down a table
and have it face at me but it makes
sense that speakers facing at you when
you're surviving ups are shooting out
one way or you know on the back being
muffled by the table or couch there on
our another question from Luke a lady's
asking a lot of great questions how's
the phone compared to the nexus 5
display smoothness in the UI etc I like
it more than nexus 5 I think it feels
better but I can see why people might
like sir that rubber back of the Nexus 5
I prefer the I like it but I haven't
really used it long enough and I want to
make sure I compare it that's what we do
serve differently I don't want to just
be like i like this one more i only used
it for you know three or and a half days
so i'm not quite sure how to answer that
yet but we will do comparisons versus
the Nexus 5 alright those questions a
little bit more business E but I think
it's a worthy of taking a look at here
even after having a superior phone
compared to all others last year HTC HTC
still had a bad quarter last quarter do
you think it will change with the HTC
One m8 and so phone sales don't just
make a business model I don't know what
their marketing costs are I don't know
what their you know cost of goods sold
is I don't know what their salary is so
because they had a bad quarter zoom the
phone didn't do very well I would assume
that they're going to sell a lot of them
consider launching on like every carrier
in the world but you know phone sales
don't always equal get on that positive
quarter so I can't that question yeah I
it there's so many factors to take into
consideration yeah uh this this is
actually a question that was a big
question around the office what is the
name this comes from Peter Blanco what
is the name consumers will call this
phone they
like last year the one m8 the m8 i think
this is going to be confusing for the
average consumer super confusing i think
they're called HTC one that's pretty
much i'm calling it I don't know why
they designed to go HTC One m8 that's
just if you want to have a number to
show it's different than the up and
seven then just call it the m8 i think
it's very confusing you know I don't
want to do I actually kind of wonder if
they weren't trying to go for a feel of
the HTC One mate and they would have
said that then I know I but they didn't
so but it it sounds so much like made I
kind of wondered that they didn't say it
so yeah okay there and folks we some of
these the stuff we've already covered a
little bit earlier such as the battery
life is great let's see here can you
this question comes from Buddhist koya
can you shoot slow-motion the new HTC
yes alrighty then that was easy enough
uh from Gabe Lasky why did I she see
choose not to use a 2k or 4k display on
their newest flagship battery that's my
bet battery battery battery a million
times battery technologies gotten crazy
good battery technology has not changed
yeah unfortunately I'm not finding it
right this time but I did see a question
have you seen how fast it charges yet
it's got a quick charts got quick charge
in it I haven't tested the picture i
honestly i plug it in at night at night
turn off a go sleep so that's i'll test
that as part of the review alrighty then
folks we're going to be wrapping up here
so we probably only have time for about
two more questions I'm quickly going
through these to see what else is in
here this question comes from shari
shadaab any new improvements on the
native music player and this again all
these questions you can see why three
days is not enough time to do a full
review on it i have not tried to me to
play area but i won't want you before
you next week yes and that's exactly why
we do take longer to review we want to
look at every corner of the phone before
we rain yeah i mean look at all these
like really likes
manusia type questions I mean there's so
much you know into it you just can't
know a phone that well in just a few
days all right folks this is going to be
the last question of the day and this
question comes from Raj karma do you
think it's better looking than HTC one
which was already a very beautiful phone
yeah the question HTC one's the original
one was it was a really nice-looking
phone and still is a good-looking phone
and still holds up I think from a design
standpoint to probably have a Lucian
Airy design I think it's as good looking
as the other one you know you kept from
color options I think the back the back
sound look very similar so that's a
subjective question but you know I do
like I do like to me the new one looks
let's take one more question I feel I
feel feeling you for one more we got one
minute left so all right if he's feeling
all frisky here ah this question comes
from Billy Jacob Kanda do you think it
was a mistake not to include three
gigabytes of RAM in the m8 I mean just
to say well we've got three gigs like
the note 3 even when it comes to
performance and people get really caught
up on the specs like I need three gigs
and 2.8 oh it wouldn't it's not going to
matter to kids is plenty to do what you
need to do and if you need to do as a
power user I think you'll be fine I
think that's why Samsung put two gigs in
the s5 it also is a cost you can't add
all these things you can't add a 2k or
4k display and three gigs I Rams but the
cost to be one hundred ninety nine
dollars it's just it's just not
realistic yeah exactly exactly all right
