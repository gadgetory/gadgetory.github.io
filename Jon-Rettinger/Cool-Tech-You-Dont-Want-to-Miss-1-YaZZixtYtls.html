technobuffalo and we get the really
unique opportunity to review all kinds
of devices phones cars computers
anything and everything in between but
they tend to be bigger flagship devices
that you guys are really looking for but
there's a lot of devices that are
smaller on the cheaper scale that really
do impact our lives on the day-to-day
basis that we don't get to talk about so
that's what I wanted to do today put
together a video of a couple things that
are cheaper on a smaller scale that
really have impacted my life over the
last couple of weeks and month with the
help of our very own mark the burst
burst diner it's Gordon get started so
first off we have the syrup genie mini
it's a very small portable motion
controller that basically gives you a
motorized pan you can put almost any
camera on it whether it be a full-sized
a7s mark to the way we have or a GoPro
or an iPhone whatever it may be don't
want thing to be aware of is that if you
are putting a bigger camera on with a
heavier lens if you don't put it on a
tripod if you put it directly on a table
or something which it can pan there it
will tip over forward so in most cases
also using a really light camera you
will have to mount it on a tripod so
from unboxing set up was extremely easy
and the app was extremely intuitive the
UI is great it's a very very simple
process to set this whole thing up it
connects through bluetooth 4.0 took me
about a total five minutes to get up and
running in terms of physical design the
product looks fine it's very slick very
small very portable the only thing I
don't like is a cork top and bottom
purely a personal preference thing I'm
just not a huge fan of cork on product a
cool little feature that takes this to
more of a pro level is the 2.5
millimeter camera control interface
which basically allows you to use the
app as a built-in intervalometer rather
than having have one hanging off the
camera or dangling off your rig and I
think that's really the key here this is
really a run-and-gun tool to me it's
fantastic for filmmakers we're looking
to get into time up so i'm making a
massive investment in to get some motion
and some panning motion without having
to build a whole rig out it's also great
for people who are on the go and who
just want to pull camera set up in their
backpack but still want that higher
production field rather than just having
static time-lapse shots or even if you
just want to do remote motorized pan so
you don't rely on your own hands where
there could be some fluctuation than
speed and motion
alright now that Ron is done boring you
with camera equipment just kidding I
think it's actually pretty cool too i
want to talk to you about one of the
things that I think is neat video game
so you know I love them but this one in
particular has really caught my fancy
the witness just drops you on an island
and expects you to figure everything out
and if you know anything about game
design then you know that the best way
for a player to have a good experience
is not to hold their hand is to help
them understand what neural pathways
they need to activate all it does is
leave you in a playground for you to
figure out figure out the puzzles on
your own and what puzzles they really
are these puzzles force you to wipe out
your predispositions about what the
solution might be they force you to stop
thinking so visually and start thinking
more mentally really to start thinking
critically to work on your deductive
reasoning to understand why something
doesn't work here and does work here
forces you to look at your surroundings
and I really got to tell you go download
it pay for it by it play it you won't be
disappointed while we're talking about
gaming I got to tell you about discord
this is one of my favorite new platforms
period if you're familiar with slack
it's basically slack but specifically
for gamers text chat audio chat if
you're playing on a PC or a Mac it's
fantastic there's apps for PC Mac
Android iOS and it works so well let me
tell you a little bit about how i use it
i set up a discord server for my destiny
clan turns out we play a bunch of other
games too so we set up multiple channels
for each other to talk to each other so
we're not bothering the people who only
played one game and not or another we
use it to talk about news and stuff that
comes out but we also use it for
scheduling the other really nice thing
is as i mentioned they have mobile apps
too so instead of using whatever it is
that you use to actually talk to people
in your lives whether it's hangouts or
SMS or group SMS or or in this case
skype if you're a gamer discord makes
that so so much easier and their apps
are phenomenal and last but definitely
not least is the unique q500 4k drone
now this is one of the most affordable
drones on the market that in my opinion
still gets the job done it comes in
somewhere between 900 to 1,000 dollars
depending on what retailer you buy it
from and it is an absolutely
feature packed drone so for starters one
of my favorite thing about this drone is
that everything is in the remote so you
don't have a separate screen on your iOS
device like you do from DJI you don't
plug anything in the screen is built
right in to the remote controller it has
a 4k camera on a 3-axis gimbal that can
also shoot various frame rates at 1080p
and will shoot up 12 megapixel photos at
first given the price point I really
wasn't expecting much but on first
flight there were a couple things I
noted the motors are a little bit low
power but I think this is a fantastic
drone with low power motors you would
think that's a downside fighting wind
and stuff is harder but the benefit is
that flies much much smoother it's very
approachable for someone who doesn't fly
too many drones that someone would be me
we compared it to our 3dr iris plus
drone which we tested a couple months
ago and over all the flying experience
was just way smoother the gimbal
combined with the slower speeds and the
weak or motors while you would think it
would be worse actually allowed us to
get much smoother shots I think that's
the key you got to remember if you're
filming with drones speed is not the key
the key is smooth flying and the unique
has this in spades so those are a few
products that really sort of impacted
and changed our lives that are on the
lower budget of things or that you may
not have heard of that I've flown under
the radar I'm very curious to hear what
you guys like what you guys have been
using whether it be apps budget phones
or anything in between let us know in
the comments down below we're very
curious to hear give us a thumbs up if

will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
