to you by domain.com what's going on
guys a marks and Sango from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's episode of
rumor roundup we're going to be talking
about the galaxy s6 yet again we're
gonna talk about lenovo sleek super
phone and apple potentially introducing
its own web TV service so let's go ahead
and get started we're less than a month
away from an official look at the galaxy
s6 but a new set of leaked photos may
have just revealed Samsung's big
surprise now the latest pictures
published by French site nowhere else
offers a close-up look at metal frame
for the galaxy s6 now there's absolutely
no way to confirm whether this leaked
metal frame is the real deal but it
looks very convincing now looking at the
photos that the design includes cutouts
for a samsung style camera along with a
rounded design similar to the one m8 and
iPhone 6 if you look closely at the
bottom of the frame it looks a lot like
the iphone 6 like this one moving on to
galaxy s6 is also expected to feature a
qHD display Samsung's own 64-bit Exynos
chip an upgraded camera a redesigned
fingerprint reader and it should be
running a more toned down version of
TouchWiz which if it's true I'm really
excited to see how that software it
looks now I personally love to know for
and if the build quality is the same and
software is as close to stock Android
then count me in samsung count me now
the second rumor is coming all the way
from lenovo the chinese company may be
gearing up to release a new smartphone
during mwc 2015 after photos and specs
are the lenovo vibe z 3 pro leaked out
this week now according to bo digital
Lenovo's new smartphone will feature a
5.5 qhd display and powerful hardware
under the hood which could be packing
the latest nab dragon ATM processor from
Qualcomm other rumored specs include 4
gigabytes of ram 64 gigabyte of storage
a 16 megapixel camera with OIS and a
huge 3,400 milliamp battery now looking
at the leaked images the vibes III pro
looks very similar to Sony's recent
experiences with the metal and glass
combo now overall it looks like a pretty
sweet device and we really can't wait to
get our hands on it let me stop the
rumors for just a quick second and think

check it out and finally it sounds like
Apple's web TV service is gaining steam
Apple has apparently held some friendly
chats with TV programmers about a
potential subscription-based streaming
service now this service would be a lot
like the one dish began selling last
month with sling TV which bundles a
handful of channels for live TV now
recode said Apple has been already
showing demos of the rumored service to
executives which means Apple is just
waiting for TV programmers to jump on
board we've been hearing about Apple
changing the TV game for a year so who
knows when Apple and TV is going to
happen Apple executives in the past said
they've cracked the TV code but so far
the company has nothing to show for it
up up down down left right left right
right anyways that's it for this episode
of rumor roundup anything that had
talked about in this video will be in
