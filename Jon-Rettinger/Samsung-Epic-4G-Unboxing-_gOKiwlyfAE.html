technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
the brand's new epic 4g for sprints
let's go ahead and gig in and see if it
lives up to its name so the epic 4g is
sprint's version of the galaxy s line of
phones that we've seen permeate through
all of the major US carriers however
sprint subversion is very very different
than the rest first as the 4g moniker is
going to denote it is spread second
forgy capable phone i'm next to the evo
so if you're in a 4g area you were going
to be getting blazing fast internet
speeds and it's also the only galaxy s
birth it's got a full slide out physical
QWERTY keyboard but enough of me yap it
let's go ahead and dig in take a look
and of course we were going to assure in
the finger slicing big ol knife so this
was just came from the folks at sprint
we're gonna go ahead and dig this in dig
in this one's much easier to cut there
we go go ahead and pull out the box it's
like there's a business card on the
front from the PR folks sprint I'll go
ahead and pull it off here it is the
epic 4g so go and take a look at the box
and of course we'll run through all the
specs if you want to pick one of these
up they aren't available now it came out
on the thirty-first of august and it's
going to set you back $249 on a two-year
contract and a hundred-dollar mail-in
rebate alright so we've got a picture of
the epic 4g on the front leather you
know that of course does have a full
qwerty keyboard all kinds of pictures
showed me what the phone can do Facebook
Twitter all kinds of sinking business
more pictures of phone on the side let
me know it's a super amoled screen we'll
talk about that in just a minute and
here are some more specs and what the
box includes I love seeing forgy capable
Sprint is just for a testing 4G speeds
around here so sometimes they'll pop up
and sometimes would go away but whenever
they do have them it is blazing fast all
right let's go ahead and dig into the
box just comes right off here it is go
ahead
pull us out push it off the sign for
just one minute familiar galaxy s
branding on the side let's see what LS
you're going to get with your new 4G
capable phone little tray well tab
underneath got a box which has probably
all your manuals nice it's Prince
actually including our real physical
manuals here so I'm getting started
guide basic guide to learn how to use
your android phone again this is running
a samsung variant of android least their
skin on top of it called touch woods
we've seen another galaxy s devices
here's the USB to power and here is the
USB cord that's going to go into set
power brick and looks we also have a
microsd to regular SD adapter which is
pretty nice there are a lot of computers
that have SD card slots you can go ahead
and push that in and be good to go
alright so let's go ahead and run down
some specs on this guy because it is
packing quite a bit so first it is a
capacitive screen of course with a 4
inch screen the resolution of 480 x 900
and this Super AMOLED so what's
sensually what that's going to mean is
you're going to get sort of darker
blacks you're not to get the wash out
look in color when you're in direct
sunlight just going to look better and
brighter and also a conserved battery
which is kind of neat and the AMOLED
technology means a touch-sensitive
mechanism as opposed to being on top of
the glass is actually sort of integrated
into the glass alright so we have a 5
megapixel camera on the back with of
course a LED flash this does take very
very very good video use other galaxy s
devices and it really does a nice job HD
capable which is always very nice this
is running Android 2.1 again with
Samsung's custom TouchWiz interface on
top of it I also is running their
hummingbird processor which is very very
similar to what we have in the iphone
for the ipad and new ipod touch if you
want the sort of techie name of it it's
a cortex a8 hummingbird it's very fast
really capable with galaxy s2
Isis just blazed through whatever you're
going to need also we have a full slide
out qwerty keyboard have a chance to
actually use this before and the
keyboard is quite nice you also have a
front facing camera for video calls
which is kind of neat and something it
also makes the epic 4g stand out from
the rest of the galaxy s lines let's go
ahead and pull off this you can take a
look at what up the phone looks like
you're going to have capacitive buttons
across the bottom typical array of
Android ones left side you've got your
volume up and down right side you're
going to have a camera button and a lock
and power button top got your micro USB
3.5 millimeter headset jack and on the
bottom just a microphone so let's talk a
bit more about the specs and what we are
going to get in here so it does have 512
megabytes of RAM and 512 megabytes of
ROM so it's got plenty of room for
storage course it's got bluetooth micro
USB 802 11 BG and n which is pretty nice
from a battery standpoint it's got a
1500 milliamp hour battery we're gonna
get 6.5 hours of talk time or two
hundred and sixteen hours of standby
time alright let's see how this guy
stacks up to its other 4G friend here
we've got the app the epic and the evo
right next to each other Evo's got a
little bigger screen but no physical
keyboard and go ahead and stack them you
can see the size difference right there
and if I want to look at another galaxy
s device without the physical keyboard
here is the captivate when see they look
very similar distant cousins you want to
see what sort of thickness that QWERTY
keyboards going to add there you go it
does not add that much this is probably
one of the best variants up at galaxy s
so you're getting a front facing camera
you're getting 4g you're getting the
option to use a slide-out QWERTY
keyboard if you want if not of course
you've got swype and actual on-screen
keyboards that work very very very
nicely and let's bring in last but not
least the iphone 4 for comparison
purposes you can see the size difference
here to kick that off to the side I'm
actually very impressed at how thin the
slide-out QWERTY phones are getting
especially one that
packing a 4g radio so of course they to
210 channel will be doing a ton more
coverage here and we can you know take a
look device any questions you have go
ahead and send them in the comments down
below and all the updates will be on
technobuffalo for exclusive content
