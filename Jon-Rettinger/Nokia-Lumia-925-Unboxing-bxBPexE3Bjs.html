we're doing a quick unboxing of the
Nokia Lumia 925 let's check out the most
recent version of the Lumia 920 on
t-mobile so here's the box the Nokia
Lumia 925 this is t-mobile's variant of
the 920 I'm actually pretty excited
about on boxing is because it is a
gorgeous phone from the picture so let's
slide the top of the box off here and
obviously here's the device itself but
before we get into that let's jump into
what's inside so we have of course our
SIM tray ki got a user guide in here not
too many manuals which is always a nice
thing and of course our wall charger and
our micro USB port for charging and
syncing and all that good stuff so I'm
going to throw this off to the side and
let's get into the phone because that's
the important part that's the thing
everyone wants to see this is 16
gigabyte model there is no expandable
storage so you are stuck with 16 gigs on
this bad boy if you pick it up it also
has an eight point seven megapixel
camera on the back and a 1 point 2
megapixel camera on the front you can
see this a little bit different than
other Lumias that we've been checking
out not the full polycarbonate body that
we're used to seeing this now has a
lovely aluminium band around the entire
edge of the device I'm booting this up
right now but while it boots I'm going
to go ahead and peel off that tape so
let's see if we can get a nice peeling
sound everybody loves that's their
favorite so obviously again this is on
t-mobile let's check out some of the
other stuff happening sim door there's
your sim trade or your micro USB again
this is a point of contention with me I
don't necessarily care for the cable on
the top of the phone but I guess the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack is okay in
that respect it's going to ask me to get
started I'm not going to bother with
that but i will show you dedicated
camera button of course we have our
sleep button and our volume rockers so i
actually like the separation and they
are just haulin
to be able to feel them which on the
Lumia 928 on verizon these were not very
pronounced at all and honestly a little
bit difficult to press in when you are
just sort of feeling the phone in your
pocket so I'm actually very glad that
they ended up raising these a little bit
speakers on the back the device itself
is slightly curved just a little bit on
the back there so when it does sit you
can see there's maybe a little bit of
space right in here so that speakerphone
can get out and project which is pretty
cool I'm just going to tap recommended
but I want to tell you guys a little bit
about what's inside this phone because
that is what is important to everybody
this is a 2,000 milliamp battery
hopefully with Windows Phone 8
optimization it's going to last you a
full day no problem it's a 4.5 inch
screen 1280 by 768 pixel display so that
comes out to 332 PPI obviously windows
phone 8 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon so to taking advantage of
Windows Phone 8 optimization for dual
core we also have one gig of ram on
board I'm really excited to test this
out take it for a spin but for now we
are going to stop recording this lovely
unboxing because it's unbox that's out
it's here it's here for all of us to see
and we will get into our first
impressions of the Lumia 925 in our next
video thanks for watching what's up
