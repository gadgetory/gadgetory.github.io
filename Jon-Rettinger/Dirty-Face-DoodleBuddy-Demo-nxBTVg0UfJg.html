technobuffalo here and I want to give
you a quick demonstration of a pretty
cool free download from the App Store
for your iphone and ipod touch it's
called doodle buddy before i give you a
demonstration let me give you a little
bit of a background the iphone as you
may have heard me mentioned uses a
capacitive touchscreen meaning there's
no squishy feeling and it makes its
connection through a transfer of
electrons from your finger to the screen
that's why you can't use it with gloves
you can't use it through your shirt it's
got to be a fingertip or some sort of
skin on the phone on the other side of
the spectrum there's something called a
resistive touchscreen that you may have
seen on a lot of windows mobile devices
these are the touchscreens it kind of
seemed like if they're a little bit
squishy and they make their connections
from two layers of film and as you push
down the film that connection is made
and that's where the touch is registered
now the reason I'm bringing this up is
well the resistive touchscreens use a
stylus and people sometimes like a
stylist for drawing give it a little bit
more accuracy than they get with just
their finger and it really wasn't a
pretty decent or fun drawing application
out there for the iphone incomes doodle
buddy this free application so let me
show you what this looks like go ahead
and launch it up there's doodle buddy
sometimes it's fun just when you're
wasting time you want to draw a picture
or something so you can send
advertisements obviously because it's
free so we're going to go ahead and
continue so you actually won the cool
thing you can do right here is actually
invite friends to draw with you but you
know we're gonna head start drawing
alone which actually sounds a little bit
depressing they'll tap that and here you
go this is sort of your canvas and your
options you can pick your pen and your
pen color and the size that you want it
to be that little dot right there
increases in size i move that slider
over so we will pick right about there
seems good how about i go with brown and
now i can go ahead and start drawing
i'll show you what the other options are
in just a moment let's say i want to
draw a face i'm taking my finger draw a
big circle so there's sort of a face now
there's a little stamp button right next
to it here i can pick a whole bunch of
different
so let's go ahead and pay again I've off
you can see that I was not blessed with
any design or artistic ability
whatsoever so boom eyeball boom I ball
looks like something out of Spore more
than a picture of a person but what are
you gonna do let's give it a mouth give
it a kind of Percy sexy mouth there go
back to the drawing will go back to my
brown a little bit of nose and that's
good some hair hey just something you
can have fun with and if you go back you
can see these other options you can
start doing some smudge tools you can
erase I'll show you some of the smudge
stuff to want to smudge your mouth make
it look like she just had a really a
long night and I want to let's say maybe
put some feet down below here for I'm
not sure what reason now write down then
there's a pound sign hit that pound sign
you get some options you can change your
background you can change the white you
can pick a photo or you can go right
from the camera so there are decent
amount of background that you can choose
from you can see right there you can
change it to white or you can go ahead
and pick a photo for your photo library
or just take one with your camera to
actually kind of neat some of the
settings that you get you can clear just
by shaking which I'll show you you can
say with your photo album you can draw
with another user and then general
options really are just turn the sound
on or off and the sound is this really
annoying scratching don't you get when
you're drawing and I'll let you hear
what that sounds like in case you are
curious let's go ahead and go back to
the drawing pick a color super annoying
so you don't like your picture you want
to race it just do a little at your
sketch sort of shake and your picture
goes away just a short video of a pretty
cool application sometimes it's fun just
to do it all or get some stress whatever
you want write a note to yourself just
sort of a fun thing to do hope you guys
