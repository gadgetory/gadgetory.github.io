loved Nexus devices nay Android devices
of all time when the Nexus 6 came out we
were all wondering maybe you would have
been a little bit better to have a new
Nexus 5 with new specs because the six
was huge
well I'm gonna have to worry anymore we
know what that device looks like and we
know its name it's called the 5x the
Nexus 5x is in just about every way the
direct successor to the Nexus 5
everything about the build just reeks
about the original Nexus 5 it's got a
polycarbonate back it's got the same
kind of look and feel and it's got that
same kind of this is too powerful to be
this light as I hold it in my hand feel
as the original Nexus 5 did the build of
the device itself is actually really
really strong it's got basically no flex
everything feels sturdy and it doesn't
feel cheap it feels inexpensive your
finger also lands right where that
fingerprint reader is which we'll get
into very shortly but it's such a nice
little welcome thing to not have to
shimmy your finger up like you do on the
Nexus 6p
so marshmallow on the 5x it's about as
good as you could expect it to be its
stock Android after all everything from
now on tap to native API for the
fingerprint reader so everything works
at LastPass it's great as this will fit
a handful of the gestures the fun stuff
that you can do with the Moto X pure
because right now all you can do is
double tap the home button or the power
button to get to the camera but it's
still a fantastic software experience if
you want to see more about marshmallow
boom we've got a video for you right
here
so the fingerprint reader on the 5x yeah
it's really good even training it is
really really fast it really only takes
five or six taps to do and it works
basically every single time and it works
the way that Google intended it to you
to when you pull it out of your pocket
you touch it and it's already unlocked
by the time it hits your face your
lockscreen is basically obsolete plus if
you were worried about cases don't be
the cutouts were perfectly fine you got
to dig a little deeper with your finger
but the sensor works great all right
around the front of the device we've got
a nice big screen and that screen is
it's pretty good I miss AMOLED that's
the major thing I really miss AMOLED and
I know that I can't blame that on the 5x
so given the context of the device the
display is pretty strong the viewing
angles are really good actually the
color reproduction is pretty good and
the pixel density is nice and high at
4:24 it's not the best display that I've
ever seen but it's definitely a good one
battery in this thing started off pretty
strong like really strong and then it
took a pretty sharp turn towards the
ordinary I was able to make it through a
full day but any longer than that you're
kind of pushing it luckily it is really
really easy to top off with crazy fast
charging with the charges that it comes
with the 5x can make it from 15% to 30%
in literally just four minutes with a
full hour it can be back up to almost
full right above that fingerprint reader
you're gonna find the brand new twelve
point three megapixel Sony sensor that's
inside the 5x and it is no slouch it is
much better than the sensor that was in
the Nexus 5 and it's even way better
than the sensor that was in the neck
six from last year which was also pretty
great you have laser autofocus which is
great in theory but in practice it wound
up focusing on the wrong subjects on the
wrong plane more often than not but it
did do that pretty quickly even without
oh is the photos from the Nexus 5x were
actually pretty fantastic almost
everything was pretty sharp when I could
get the focus to focus on what I wanted
it to focus on and the colors were
pretty strong everything from my day to
day usage with the five X's camera was
perfectly fine even without OIS and yes
the sensor here is exactly the same as
the sensor in the Nexus 6p the only
difference is that on the 6p you can
shoot all the way up to 240 frames per
second while on the 5x you're stuck at
just 120 but even that is nothing to
shake a stick out my major gripe with
the 5x has been some pretty inconsistent
performance from out of the box it went
from well exceeding expectations to
pretty thoroughly disappointing to
meeting them at exactly where I would
expect them to be this kind of made the
review difficult to put together because
the performance was so inconsistent so
across the board
I wonder removing a ton of apps that I
thought might be the culprit and
eventually it did get better but I
wasn't even really able to pinpoint what
exactly it was so while normal sort of
everyday usage wound up pretty
reasonable there were a lot of times
that I've noticed what I would refer to
as GPU jank when I turned on GPU
rendering on the device more than once I
wound up missing a photo opportunity to
the camera not opening quite quickly
enough and that's something that I had
really thought was something of the past
after using Samsung's line I have a
really bad sneaking suspicion that the
all-around sluggishness on the 5x is due
to the 5x is software accelerated
encryption this was an issue on last
year's Nexus 6 lots of users found
themselves disabling encryption in favor
of better performance and
to me I'd probably do the same thing
with the 5x with marshmallow the
encryption is now mandatory all
manufacturers are required to support
full disk encryption so I'd be surprised
if we ever saw a toggle in the settings
that said despite all of that once the
device kind of settled into a groove I
found myself pretty relatively happy
with the performance of the 808 that's
under the hood despite some of those
rough edges for me with so many devices
in the price range of 399 the 5x comes
in at 379 what it comes down to is the
features if having Nexus imprint is a
must for you then obviously the 5x is
probably your best bet if that doesn't
matter to you quite so much as having
gestures and customization then maybe
the Moto X pure is a little bit more
your speed the 5x is a great phone it's
a really good phone I feel like Google
finally made the right compromises to
get a price point that they wanted to be
competitive so that it's in that sort of
budget range it's a great great great
phone and I think it's a pretty solid
Buy in fact the build quality is kind of
exactly what I want out of the device so
now that I'm using a 6p a whole lot more
I find myself wishing ahead a 6p in the
body of a 5x anyway let us know what you
guys think about the 5x and if there's
anything else that we missed I had a
great time reviewing this thing for you
guys and I hope you guys enjoyed
watching it as always thank you for
watching
be kind to one another and I'll catch
you in the next video oh by the way it's
a really solid Buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
