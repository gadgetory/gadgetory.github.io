to you by netflix a titanfall bundle for
the xbox one free Pokemon X or Y and the
future of irrational games and bioshock
also we play Donkey Kong Country
tropical freeze and check out this
week's new releases let's get out of
controller hello and welcome out of
controller the weekly TechnoBuffalo show
that covers all your gaming news reviews
demos and new releases and an easy to
digest capsule form I'm your host Ashley
skeptic it's always a big weekend gaming
so let's hit the news anybody still on
the fence about picking up an Xbox one
for titanfall this might be a pretty
good deal for you microsoft announced a
titanfall bundle yesterday set release
on march 11th win the game drops for pc
and xbox one the best part is this
bundle includes titanfall basically for
free it cost 499 bucks price of a
standard xbox one console including a
controller headset and a kinect but it
also comes with a digital download of
the game i do wish though that they'd
included that glorious titanfall
controller with the bundle but i guess
this is a pretty good deal regardless
you can pick up the bundle for a limited
time like i said starting march 11th at
microsoft says select retailers whatever
that means last week ken Levine shocked
the gaming community by announcing his
studio irrational games to be closing up
shop to start a smaller studio with in
2k games leaving many questions
surrounding the future of the Bioshock
franchise and that bioshock game for
playstation vita that ken Levine
announced in 2011 unfortunately we got a
no update on the vita game which means
it's unlikely at this point we'll ever
see it fortunately 2k games announced
they're still very much committed to the
Bioshock universe and bringing you more
stories we don't know whether or not a
new bioshock made at a new studio
without its original creator is a good
or bad thing but i guess we'll just have
to wait and see if you've been kicking
around the idea of picking up a nintendo
3ds or two TS well jeez what are you
even waiting for seriously though
there's a pretty nifty deal starting
next month it looks like if you buy
either a 3ds or a 2 dias and register
that and one of six games
you'll get a free download code for
either Pokemon X or Y which is kind of
sweet offer the six games are mostly
pretty amazing ones animal crossing new
leaf Yoshi's new island donkey kong
country returns 3d mario kart 7 Super
Mario 3d Land and then there's that lego
city undercover the chase begins game
which isn't very good but those other
ones are great of course this is all
based on a Toys R Us leak dad so keep an
eye for the promo to go official
starting next week let's play as a
feature on our gaming channel where a
member of our writing staff plays a game
and talks about it over the footage this
week Joey's playing Donkey Kong Country
tropical freeze in fact we've got not
one not two but three videos of our
favorite ape leaping through the jungle
on Wii U also i have to say i bought
this game a couple of days ago and its
really tough a little bit not for the
platforming faint of heart that
multiplayer is insane maybe you need a
break from all that video gaming you do
maybe you are binge watch a show you've
always wanted to check out this is where
Netflix comes in really handy Netflix
lets you stream great movies and TV
shows directly to your house you can
stream all that content with the Netflix
app for your xbox one ps4 xbox 360 ps3
Smart TV and under we Apple TV Roku you
get the idea it's everywhere and you can
watch as much as you want without any of
those gross commercials interrupting
your shows so that Breaking Bad marathon
you've been thinking about do it we've
got a special for anyone out there
wanting to try netflix a free 30-day
trial if you head over to netflix.com
