from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of one of the hottest phones of the year
this is the Samsung Galaxy s3 and now in
just a few months ago I had a chance to
play with it at CTIA 2012 and came away
really impressed I'm excited to use as
my daily driver and open up this box
it's international version meeting it's
got a quad core Exynos processor in here
no support for LTE but it does have
HSPA+ I'm almost ripping off this
plastic as I'm looking at it let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing
all right so here we've got the
international version of the Samsung
Galaxy s3 in a plain white box nothing
really on the side on the back this is
where all the specs are going to live 16
gigabyte version will run through all
this stuff a little bit later Super
AMOLED screen Android of course writing
Ice Cream Sandwich 802 11 a B G and n
for Wi-Fi and all the rest of that
goodness
that we've got in here but enough to
talk about the BOK let's go ahead and
dig in thanks to our folks and our
friends and every electronics for
sending this to us go ahead and rip the
plastic open boom go it off to the side
let's see what we got in the Box got a
sticker will rip that sucker off should
have two stickers actually one on top
one on the bottom alright alright so
we've got the white version is also a
marble esque blue it just fed some
delays with so white is the first
version that is available push it off to
the side for just a moment so we're also
gonna have in the Box we've got two
books I'm gonna Massacre my Spanish
trying to prance that but we have that
in there we've got a micro USB charging
and sink a ball got some ear gels for
presumably headphones that are in here
we've got a international power adapter
because as an international advice we've
got the I believe 2100 milliamp hour
battery and then there are the
headphones people always say I don't
take the headphones out in video so I'm
gonna go ahead and do that sure what
they look like real fast and we'll get
to the phone I promise so headphones
your gels volume up and down accept
calls and the microphone built-in but
that is not what you are here to see
what you're here to see is the phone
this is the Samsung Galaxy s3 take a
quick look around it and I'll pop in the
battery and we'll run through the specs
but let me go ahead and rip off this
plastic and a satisfying whoosh boom
what's that satisfying hoping was gonna
be we've got a couple more pieces to
peel off on this gorgeous HD Super
AMOLED screen
boom Samsung Galaxy s3 inspired by
nature let's go ahead and pop off the
back and put in the battery I'll run
through all the specs once it's powering
up all right so go ahead and pop the
2100 milliamp hour battery in and we'll
get this party rocking and rolling there
we go
micro SD cards gonna live there SIM card
lives right there plastic back goes
right on it here it snaps it back on
samsung has said this has been designed
and inspired by nature who's to feel
sort of pebble ask we's that for a
little while and be sure alright so
we'll let it boot up and I'll go ahead
and run through the specs to this guy on
different versions for all parts of the
world here
all US carriers exception of 18 t
actually have announced this for
sometime of June of availability
presumably though we'll see et make
their announcement soon pricing is gonna
vary somewhere from 200 to 250 this is
the international version to pick up for
about 700 bucks and there are some
differences here I'll talk about later
it's running Ice Cream Sandwich with
TouchWiz 4.0 through dimension
standpoint 5.3 inches by 2.7 inches by a
pretty thin 0.35 inches and it weighs
four point six nine ounces even with
that beefy battery in there it's got a
four point eight inch that's measured
diagonally
Super AMOLED screen the resolution of
1280 by 720 with Corning Gorilla Glass 2
on it had a chance to demonstrate
Gorilla Glass 2 while we were at CES Kim
was really impressed this thing can
handle a tremendous amount of pressure
I'm not saying don't throw it out of a
two-story house but if you did say throw
it out the window a two-story house it
actually might be okay now that 2100
milliamp hour battery that we talked
about is going to be good for 11 hours
of talk time now here's where things get
a little bit different the international
version has a quad core Exynos processor
1.4 gigahertz on each core that's the 42
12 you're keeping track at home I take
cortex a9 if you're gonna be in the u.s.
it's going to be a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon chip similar to the
HTC One X as I mentioned this is
international so we've got quad core in
here but we're not gonna have support
for LTE unfortunately we are stuck with
HSPA+ but quad core for HSPA+ seems to
be a pretty
season trade-off taken find English
somewhere here Latvia Irish Icelandic
English United States there we go I'll
go ahead and hit start and run through
the rest of the specs Ram thinks to get
a little bit different as well
the us-canadian Japanese versions are
going to have two gigs of RAM this one
has one Giga RAM available in 16 32 or
64 but expandable with micro sd this is
a 16 gigabyte version camera a megapixel
camera on the back with 1080p recording
can shoot at 30 frames per second Scot
face smile detection image stabilization
and of course that very very very quick
almost zero shutter lag that we've seen
on other Ice Cream Sandwich devices 1.9
megapixel camera on the front it council
shoot 720p video at 30 frames per second
boo tooth 4.0 the US version will
support LTE but not have a quad core
processor similar to the HTC One X
alright so may go ahead set this guy up
for Wi-Fi and come back to a quick look
at the phone itself alright so we've got
this guy all booted up and I am
expecting this to be an absolute speed
demon when I use it at cj one of the
first things that I noticed as I swiped
my finger across it it felt very smooth
even at the edges it felt first but you
don't really feel that sharp drop-off
just a very subtle thing that I was
immediately aware of while using the
galaxy s3 so first blush the screen is
obviously gorgeous Samsung is really
known for their beautiful screens what
I'm not seeing and I'm really happy to
not see that isn't it sort of blue hue
on this guy with previous AMOLED screens
has been sort of a blueish sometimes
green look to it but when you look at
the white spots here it looks pretty
true to white so a quick tour of the
phone you've got one big home button in
the middle which to go ahead and hold
that button down will open up
multitasking and go ahead and pick which
application you want to run to or want
to close it and swipe it right off the
screen if you double tap it you're gonna
get Samsung's answer the Syria they're
calling s voice but for some reason ours
is in Spanish we'll do a test of this
though on upcoming video go ahead and go
back and you saw was pop up on the left
and right side we got a back button in
your menu button
there as well I should go ahead and pull
up menus and obviously we'll go back
taking a look at apps you can see what's
going to be onboard
here a lot of Samsung themed things a
lot of s applications s planner s
suggest some video hub stuff and here
you scroll through icons horizontally
Dropbox actually give you 50 gigs of
Dropbox tour just pretty nice continuing
to see what else they've gotten here
this is an Ice Cream Sandwich device so
widgets are accessed from the top right
there telling you can hold a widget and
move it to your home screen and you can
see some of the stuff that Samsung has
done here I've done quite a bit before
we even get to the sort of Google
sanctioned ones which we're at right now
so a lot of widget Isis will go back
let's go to a blank part of the screen
and you can tap it hold and see what
pops up there at the home screen home
screen lock screen or home and lock
screens you can see how that behaves
pulling down from the top gives you one
of things that I love about Samsung
devices they sort of shortcuts here at
the top so a Wi-Fi sound rotation I look
bill to switch profile is right there
you can actually scroll now you can see
mobile data Bluetooth driving mode or
sync on the left hand side of device
we've got a volume rocker up and down on
the right hand side power and lock
button we've got your front facing
camera and sensors there's where the
speaker is going to live on the top
three point five millimeter headset jack
and noise cancelling microphone on the
bottom that's where your charging and
seeking poor it's gonna be noise
cancelling mic there as well and of
course you got that plastic back there's
a camera speaker and LED flash and
speaking of camera let's go ahead see
how quickly that camera launches this is
the first time ever opening it up so
holds an icon let's go ahead and go back
let's close it let them launch
multitasking here already try to
there you go it's close camera now it's
been opened at least once and let's see
if quickly it opens all right
tap and hold then drag let's not show
that again I want to see how quickly
goes without having a warning pop-up so
we'll close it hold this down close
camera area and go back home let's go
ahead and launch the camera again so it
launches pretty quickly it's going to
take a picture or something let's say
you wanna take a picture of this box
pretty quick some other settings here
got things for instance when my favorite
thing to add is Cream Sandwich you have
a burst mode so you can shoot very very
quick pictures
I choose resolution white balance ISO
metering anti-shake image quality GPS
tag and all kinds of other stuff in here
some things that we'll talk about in the
review as well that I wasn't able to
show on the unboxing could actually
track your eyes to tell you whether or
not you turn the screen off it's got
face detecting and all kinds of other
detecting sort of features on here so
certainly I'll make sure to show that to
you guys in the full review I know you
guys I'm John rent you from
TechnoBuffalo this has been a quick
unboxing of the Samsung Galaxy s3 before
I go make sure you're a real quick size
comparison other devices so here is the
iPhone 4s quite a bit difference being
at 3.5 and at 4.8 inch inch screen and
you look like distant cousins here both
clad and white there is the side shot of
these two guys and certainly see how big
difference this is but also how thin the
galaxy s3 is let's bring in its Samsung
brethren this is the Samsung made it in
Galaxy Nexus flip that the right way see
the size there as well a little bit
thinner but very similar in stature and
profile and it's great Big Brother the
Galaxy Note you can see what these two
look like on top of each other and it's
side-by-side I can't do a little fan
there at the scene so I'm John render
TechnoBuffalo it's been an unboxing and
first look at the Samsung Galaxy s3 see
you guys next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
