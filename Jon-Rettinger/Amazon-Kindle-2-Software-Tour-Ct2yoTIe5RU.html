gonna give you a walkthrough of the
software on the Amazon Kindle - hope you
enjoy alright guys so here is the Kindle
powered off I'll go ahead and turn it on
slide the switch on top takes a second
and it blinks a few times and lights up
so what you're greeted with when you
turn the Kindle on is what's called the
Kindle home screen this lists all of
your content that you have here and you
can navigate by that little black bar
that follows it you can see right there
I'm reading too fat to fish Kindle 2
users guide come standard on it the
Oxford Dictionary and the archived items
and something you want to read and say I
want to read the Kindle 2 user's guide I
just use this little joystick down here
push it in glows and opens right up and
I'll open right up to where you last
work which is actually a very cool thing
so you can be reading a book close it
go and open a magazine come back to your
book you'd be right on the same page you
are in addition to right where you were
on your magazine extra members right
where you're at which is a very nice
feature so let's go back to the home
screen let me show you what your options
are here in the home screen there's a
lot of stuff that you can do with the
Kindle and if those of you that are
watching this for the first time don't
know what the Kindle is let me preface
this software tour by saying it's an
e-book reader it's another way to read
books magazines blogs and such on any
other device so let me go ahead and show
you this so we'll go ahead and hit the
menu button and this gives you a full
list of menus right here is where you
turn your wireless off on Kindle one
there was a switch for that but now it's
right here
you've got shop and Kindle Store that
I'll show you in a moment search you can
actually search for any content that you
have on your Kindle words or topics
settings not much in the way of settings
really just change your email address
registration of the Kindle and that's
about it experimental experimental is
actually where some of the cool stuff is
let me show you then first you've got a
basic web browser play mp3s
text-to-speech so this does have
Sprint's EVDO 3G connectivity here
that's how it downloads books again
which I'll show you in a moment so this
takes advantage of that by using the web
so you can view the web here so I'd open
it up and opens up a pretty basic
browser here's some sites that are
already formatted for Kindle open
Wikipedia
I'll show you guys what that looks like
real quickly so it's actually a very
quick load it's a very useable browser
if you're in a pinch and you've got your
URL bar right up there you can type in
whatever you'd like using the on-screen
keyboard on the Kindle and there you go
you've got Wikipedia right at your
fingertips
so that's the browser and it does have a
very rudimentary mp3 player on here I
don't have any mp3s but if I did it
would play so you can enter URL go to
top you can set bookmarks and there are
some general settings here for the
browser but I'm going to ahead and gloss
over those so I can get to the other
good stuff about making this a 30 minute
long video so we'll go ahead and back to
home screen so one of the big things
that the Kindle has the ability to
wirelessly download all of your content
so you never actually ever have to
connect this to a computer you're not
tethered to a computer to get your
content you down on everything right
here on the Kindle so let me show you
what that looks like we'll go ahead hit
menu we'll go shop in Kindle Store
connect to the network and it pulls up a
full list of Kindle options this is kind
of the store home spring here it
recommends some books for you based off
of other stuff you've purchased you can
navigate by books newspapers magazines
blogs national bestsellers kindle top
sellers news and noteworthy books let's
go to Kindle top sellers here and all
the books I've searched for I haven't
found one book that's not in Kindle
format so something to keep in mind that
really everything you want will be here
so the first book that's in Kindle top
sellers the book called assassin's
apprentice let's say I want to download
assassin's apprentice so I'll go ahead
and hit the middle button of the five
wage or sticker right there
loads up and here your greed with a
description of the book the option to
buy it custom reviews you can kind of
scroll down and keep reading all
different custom reviews which is
actually very handy you can see
more and it'll load up more reviews and
you can really get a sense of what
people thought of the book so let's go
back to royal assassins one other really
nice saying that the Kindle has is
ability to try a sample think of it like
iTunes when you go to the iTunes Store
you can play 30 seconds of a movie this
will give you the first chapter of a
book so you really get this chance of
whether you like it or not so let me go
ahead and download a sample and you can
see how quickly these one chapter
downloads and compare that to a full
book try a sample and you buy everything
here using Amazon one clip you set that
up online and you are good so right now
it's we're sending you a free sample
automatically appear in your home screen
so I'll go to home we'll see how long it
takes for it to show up it actually is
very quick I downloaded a full book in
just under 60 seconds they definitely
keep that in mind you're probably
looking at anywhere from a minute to a
minute and a half or a full book
depending on your network connection and
there it is royal assassins it's a
sample right next to it so I'll open
that up and there's the book so as long
as we're in here on text let me go ahead
and give you guys a software overview of
what your options are when you're
reading a book so this is a grayscale
screen it's actually I believe 16 shades
of grey and the reason it's gray and not
backlit is to make it easier on the eyes
just like reading a regular book so here
I've got an example here's a brief
history of time by a Stephen Hawking so
you look at this here it's just standard
text black and white and it's very
similar to the way things look on the
Kindle so that that's at least the
rationale behind that so when you're
here depending on your age your eyesight
you can't throw option to set the font
whatever you choose so right down at the
bottom there is a font aa button you go
ahead and click that move this back up
and if you do with a whole bunch of
different font sizes here you can kind
of pick what you like the best to go all
the way up to the biggest you can see
how big that gets and different sizes in
between
I found the middle font to be quite good
for me now you also notice right below
there it says text-to-speech Kindle also
has a built-in text-to-speech meaning
it'll read the book
- you don't expect any sort of audiobook
functionality it's not gonna sound like
an author's eloquent voice as you'll
hear in a minute it's very robotic and
you can choose the speech rate whether
it's slower the default or faster you
can choose whether it's a male or female
let me show you guys what this sounds
like should I turn that on the menu and
I will start text-to-speech
so you get a sense of the Texas speech
sound like it sounds really robotic and
definitely qualifies and this is an
experimental feature I don't think I
would ever use it even if I was in a car
but that it does st. usable to you you
can use the external speakers on the
back of the device or you can plug in a
headphone using the three point five
millimeter headset jack so when you want
to turn a page you got two options you
can either hit the next button on the
left next button on the right and when
you hit that you'll see a flash and the
page appears now one of the cool things
about the Kindle is the batteries only
being used when it's changing what's on
the screen so right now it is not using
a single set of battery to display the
content obviously it's using some to
connect to the 3G radio but if you turn
the radio off and you're just reading a
page you're not using any battery life
meaning
battery life on this device is fantastic
I've been reading pretty much straight
since I got it on Monday as you guys can
see I still almost have full battery
life which is really impressive and
that's even keeping the 3G radio on just
definitely something to keep in mind as
you guys start to use the device so I'll
go ahead and go back to the home screen
and that's about it guys just a real
quick software overview of the Kindle
and how it works
I'd really enjoyed using it it's been
very easy on the eyes so far I'm gonna
save the rest of those comments for a
full review coming up and stay tuned for
a few videos on Kindle tips and tricks
and the final review video now one thing
I did want to bring up is that there is
a Kindle software for the iPhone and the
iPod touch and people have been asking
me of getting a lot of questions why did
I get a Kindle when I can just read a
book on the iPhone so let me tell you
guys something
in here I cannot read that much on the
iPhone it hurts my eyes after a while
it's great for reading an email or
reading a blog but it comes time to
reading a full book it really is a
strain on the eyes so it's a nice
compliments that Kindle it's certainly
not a replacement for it in my mind and
even screen size alone is quite
different you know and the screen size
cuts off right there and there's a lot
more room and this really looks like a
native page this has some glare and
reflectiveness that does I'm gonna hurt
my eyes at least anyway guys hope you
enjoyed this software overview of the
Kindle 2 for exclusive content follow me
on Twitter twitter.com slash John for
Lakers I will see you guys in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
