to you by citrix go two assists the
number one global market leader and
remote support what's up everyone
welcome back there / soda asked the
Buffaloes to show her you could ask me
and event lucy any question you've got
more the technology and sometimes
outside of it first question comes from
at ace underscore neptune at john for
lakers do you think that the note 5 will
show the lack of SD card expansion a
movable battery presumably as the s6 and
the s6 edge is your question and yes yes
i do i think this is the start of a
totally new design language for samsung
the note 4 which kind of just came out
is the last of the old guard so to speak
with the removable back removable
battery and expandable storage it is a
brave new day for samsung so either get
on board look elsewhere next one comes
from at gs3 who asks at john for lakers
do you see one plus being able to have a
successful launch of their next phone or
will the invite system stay in place so
a lot of people are upset about 1 plus
it invites us and they get ur for a
reason not because they want to be
exclusive but it was a capital problem
they didn't have the money to build a
ton of phones and ship them out whenever
you got one of those codes that's when a
phone was built so they weren't putting
those out until they knew money was
coming in slope is if they got enough
money coming in from the original phone
they can maybe do a wider launch for the
1+2 presumably they'll call it but i
would not cross your fingers on that i
would expect after probably has some
version invite system but i would also
expect that it's going to be way easy to
get one of those invites whenever that
does eventually come to market next
let's go to lumber maku who s at john
for lakers but he think will be the next
Nexus manufacturer so a rumor came out
late last week that it was not gonna be
Samsung it was not going to be HTC it
was not going to be LG is not going to
motorola's you're probably saying to
yourself self left and the answer is
koala way suppose that Google as tap the
Chinese manufacturer to make the next
Nexus phone may be called the Nexus 7 or
Nexus hallway ever decide to call it so
that opens up a whole world of security
questions certainly but also interesting
that Google is looking towards China for
the next manufacturer androids got a
huge huge
huge presence in China but Google's I'm
finished relationship with China as a
whole but Android certainly has done
very well there so I don't know maybe it
makes them stop real fast thank our

definitely not least this question I got
quite a bit when I've asked myself
really since last week at a little
Mendez 88 @ John for lakers the question
quite simply m 9 or s6 the question for
me is m9 or s6 edge I've loved HTC
design I think they've done an
incredible job in the new design
language dating back few years ago to
the m7 with that unibody design that
cold industrial feel I really like sense
only gotten better Samsung's design i've
been very hard on it seemed like they
designed one phone with four years ago
and just kept using that same design
language up until or kind of last week
but things have changed and that s6 the
s6 edge looks really awesome to me there
that guy movable bad an expandable
storage isn't the deal personally to me
I understand why it's an issue to some
if you carry external battery or if you
like swap SD cards I totally get that
but for some it's not going to matter
and if it is going to matter to you want
to look towards the HTC m9 since it now
has expandable storage but no removable
battery but for me though I love that
look of the s6 and like being able to
sort of have the curve on both sides
what you can do with it it just seems
really cool and I love the way it looks
with the glass of the protruding camera
hump I can't really do it out how to
pick one though without having seen both
of them yet I was not at Mobile World
Congress Todd and Ron both were I think
you're probably right now give my money
to the s6 that could change we get both
in the office so thank you guys for
