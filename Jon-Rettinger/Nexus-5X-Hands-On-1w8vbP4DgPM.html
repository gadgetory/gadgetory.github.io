from technobuffalo here and today we're
taking a look at the brand new Nexus 5x
it's the spiritual successor to the very
popular LG built Nexus 5 this model of
course also being built by LG but a lot
of things are new here let's all right
the screen but is a 5.2 inch full HD
display so that's 1920 x 1080 it's a 423
PPI powering this guy is a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 808 processor hexa core 64
bit if you are keeping track at home
it's got two gigs of RAM on board
available in 16 or 32 configurations it
is a really light phone unlike the
original was weighing at 136 grams and
on the back we have a 12 point three
megapixel camera it's f 20 in case
you're wondering sensor on the front
living right there is a 5 megapixel
sensor this can shoot 4k video of course
you can't play it back on the screen to
4k resolution because it is 1080 USB
type-c on the bottom with fast charging
so that is enabled and of course android
marshmallow six point 0 on the back got
a new fingerprint reader that Google is
calling up imprint supposedly it works
very quickly the placement here is
pretty feels pretty good if you go ahead
and hold the phone you would ordinarily
your finger naturally gravitate to the
back oh I am wondering how this is going
to work with with cases but suppose
we'll see when that comes out it's going
to be available in black white or ice
blue pricing is 379th or 16 gives you 4
29 for 32 don't know exact released it
yet but hopefully we will know very soon
so I can't show you a little bit of a
software here we've got Android M other
the kitchens here are now on tap with
you get access to google now information
inside of other applications go ahead
and jump into settings and just proved
that is indeed running at six point oh
and there you go android 6.0 and what do
you guys think about the new Nexus 5x up
to hear your thoughts on it so next time
I am John render from TechnoBuffalo and
I will see you guys next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
