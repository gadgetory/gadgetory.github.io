from TechnoBuffalo heareth our September
ritual it is an unboxing of the latest
from Apple this is the iPhone 7 we're
gonna be opening up a matte black
version it's a new color replacing Space
Gray there's also a jet black version
available in only 128 256 gig sizes this
is a 128 matte black box looks pretty
similar what we've seen for previous
generation Apple devices and I got a
super excited to bring out singular
stabby and cut some plastic old-school
style but Apple changed it up
there's no pull tab so disappointing for
seniors daddy pull off the plastic
nothing exciting here at the box picture
of the phone and if you're debating
going to get black let me tell you from
someone who's seen it fingerprints like
crazy on that thing and be super prone
to scratches I think this is probably my
favorite color designed by Apple in at
California they've got welcome to iPhone
and that's it and here is the phone
itself some big differences with the
phone versus last gen on the camera
standpoint it's been way improved oh is
is here on board as well they 12
megapixel sensor than f 128 aperture
it's also way faster than last gen the
810 infusion processor is the big
standout upgrade here supposedly 40 x
fashioned a9 with you with 50% better
graphics so way faster nothing else
exciting the box we've got a wall wart
and we've got some new Lightning
connected ear pods with an adapter on
the back for lightning 23.5 so it's all
one little piece and then just a
lightning cable and this is the phone
all done up here in matte black which i
think looks really sweet some other
notable changes here the home button
while still kind of being there now
takes advantage of the taptic engine so
doesn't actually move but it simulates
that movement we've seen that with the
four stuff touch trackpad on other Apple
devices ip67 is here as well for water
resistance so if you happen to get out
in the rain or maybe drop in a toilet
for a minute which is gross but your
phone should be okay
other notable differences here as well
no 3.5 millimeter heads a jack so kind
of supporting to a lot of folks
stereo speakers are here and supposedly
they're two times louder
than the last gen the map black looks
really nice and I'm trying to get
fingerprints on it and I'm not seeing
anyone kind of pushing my hands on it he
also hides the antenna bands really well
so we didn't like the look with the
antenna bands of the last Jan or yes to
Gen before that to the 6 and 6s the
matte black version and jet black to
hides it really well other than that not
that much difference visually between
the two phones we're into a comparison
between the 6s and the 7th term whether
or not you should upgrade it's going to
turn this sucker on set it up and see if
the experience is like on the brand new
iPhone 7 so if you things that are
different versus previous iPhones we
paid full price for these phones if you
want to buy one from eBay or Craigslist
100% bear this in mind you have to
activate it with the SIM card in the
phone so if you bought one you want to
put in your semi activated it will not
work and then you're going to need the
zip code of the person who bought it and
the last four of their social in order
to get the phone to work so definitely
bears head in mind if you want to buy
one from someone you have to activate it
with them on the spot and you can pop in
your Sam and be ready to go beyond that
the center process is relatively
familiar except for the home button you
get three different options to set up
tactic engine they all felt kind of the
same to me but you do push the home
button Elmo feels like the whole bottom
part of the phone is moving it's a very
different type feel versus what you're
used to probably used to what I imagined
over a week or so but it's definitely
different other than that the experience
is iOS 10 and its iOS e as iOS has
always been whether you love it or hate
it it's here and it's certainly gonna be
the best version of it now I really want
to test the performance of the phone and
the camera I think are the big upgrades
here so it was a kind of hot color I'm
diggin matte black kind of a nexus 6p
ish look to it let us know what else you
guys want to see about the iPhone give
the video a thumbs up to let us know you
want to see more apple coverage til next
time
