TechnoBuffalo here it is time for the
annual iPhone unboxing this year though
we've got two up first
I've got Apple's gigantic new 5.5 inch
iPhone 6 plus let's go ahead and dig in
and see if bigger really is better so
the box for the new iPhones relatively
nondescript don't even have a picture
really of the device just sort of a
raised image of the phone is embossed on
it you really have no idea what color it
is except for the side of the box if
you've got a gold version it'll show up
as gold there if you have a silver it'll
show up a silver or Space Gray will show
up at Space Gray we are unboxing a 64
gig Space Gray model I'm gonna bring
back an old friend we've got senior
stabby here the obligatory the
unnecessary gigantic unboxing knife to
go ahead and cut the plastic and try not
to cut any fingers I had a chance to
play with both these devices at Apple's
announcement events about a week and a
half ago in Cupertino I came away really
impressed with the look and feel of both
the 6 and the 6 plus so really you can
pick whichever phone is best for you if
you guys are looking to pick one of
these up if you do buy an 18 t version
full retail price it will be unlocked
just as a small PSA alright so we got
the plastic off we'll go ahead and slide
the device out of here and there is the
giant iPhone again this is the 64 gig
Space Gray 6 plus looking really nice
it's kind of a lighter s Space Gray than
they had last year pushed off the side
for quick sex we're also going to have
inside of the box we've got now a much
larger envelope you've got iPhone 6 plus
2 Apple stickers and some phone info
nothing else are really exciting here
ear pods the same wall work and you've
got the same lightning cable not
reversible no new design on that wall
work as well push all that off to the
side and here is the iPhone see if I can
get that nice whooshing noise and
appreciate probably the one second this
phone's not going to have giant
fingerprints all over it that was pretty
uh pretty satisfying I'll go ahead and
power it on it will run through all
specs on it the big story on the six
plus is the screen it is just grown
quite a bit
it is now a 5.5 inch screen it's a
retina HD display with a resolution of
1920 by 1080 you can do math quickly in
your head I mean it's got a 401 PPI
which is an increased 50 over last
generation device the thing weighs 6.07
ounces or 172 grams it is 7.1 millimeter
sick and if you're keeping track at home
that's point two millimeters thicker
than the iPhone 6 the screen has a
couple new things in it it's got dual
domain pictures for supposedly wider
viewing angle powering this guy is the
latest generation a8 chip with 64-bit
architecture also has the new m8 motion
coprocessor also on board the folks that
I fix it toward the sucker down they saw
the batter is 2000 915 milliamp hours
just for comparison it was 1560 on the
5s they also found the same one gig of
ram found on last generations phone the
back is still a megapixel you're
probably saying John they didn't do much
about it now has optical image
stabilization and focus pixels which
supposedly make for really really quick
auto focusing optical image
stabilization obviously will stabilize
your video but also I should take great
low-light shots as well because it can
keep the exposure open for a little bit
while longer you can of course do 1080p
video at 30 or 60 frames per second the
front-facing camera is a 1.2 megapixel
sensor the colors are the same as last
year space grey silver and gold do they
vary a little bit with what they look
like versus the 5s available in 16 64 or
128 no more 32 pricing is going to be
$2.99 three and a $4.99 on contract so a
quick tour of the phone here it's very
familiar iPhone you've got that new 5.5
inch screen you've got your home button
with touch ID and of course that'll be
used for Apple pay as well on the
left-hand side of the device you've got
a volume up and down and your profile
switch I really like that Apple has on
the devices on the right-hand side you
now have your power and lock button nano
SIM card which all phones are going to
have a redesigned speaker grille on the
bottom you also have Lightning port
through five millimeter headset jack a
noise cancelling mic on the back and
sort of an issue of contention for some
you've got two antenna bands the top one
is for NFC
which Apple is going to use for Apple
pay but right now it's locked down so if
you want the user to share picture
something to bill to do that and the
camera now has a little bit of a hump
which you put it flat on the table
it definitely has a little bit of a
rattle to it the glass now curves around
the side of the screen so you swipe back
and forth should make things feel really
nice you don't trip have that rough edge
that you had on previous devices and we
of course we're gonna run this thing
through all its paces we'll do hands-on
camera tests full review and show you
