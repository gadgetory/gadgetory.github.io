you of the airport extreme base station
enough you guys have been following but
i'm letting everybody know my this piece
of crap finally died he's been a long
process of dying for about three months
out and finally just keeled over
wouldn't work anymore so figure 25 to
buy a new router might as well give the
airport extreme a shot since i got
wireless and in the laptop and that's
why I let's head and the Apple TV and
stuff so anyway I'll go to whirl try it
for a little while and let you guys know
what I think anyway any questions about
it I feel free to ask and I'll try and
answer them when I do my review alright
later guys bye all right guys let's
unbox it okay first I'll show you the
box here it is airport extreme 802 11 n
Wi-Fi wireless work with your Mac or PC
got some information right there this is
the new one which got updated with
gigabit ethernet apple logo extremely
fast when I were talking a little bit
about it Apple logo and nothing up there
all right open it up
throw the plastic away it's like sitting
right on top there's the router set to
the side so you also in the box here
some documentation looks like there's a
physic to just see in there by some
instructions power cord with I guess
looks like a little power brick not
terribly big but still a Briton on the
left take a look at the router itself
also for another look at the router my
buddy echo fish on their part my
subscriptions you can see his name did
another review of it he's used it for a
while so check that out um so here it is
it looks good good angle it looks pretty
sleek really know nothing on except for
that one little line go all the way
around the thing there is an apple logo
on the top of that it's all white looks
like probably a little power thing right
there they'll turn on on the back we got
the power a USB port for networking hard
drive or printer I guess gigabit
ethernet ethernet where your modem cable
modem wherever gets plugged into and
three ports this does not have four and
a lock so that's it guys to stay I'm
boxing for you on the back there's an
apple logo looks actually pretty similar
to an apple TV so i'll use it i'll let
you know wedding i think you guys have
any questions about it let me know i'll
