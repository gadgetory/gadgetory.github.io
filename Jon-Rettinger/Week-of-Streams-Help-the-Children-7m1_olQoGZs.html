where families can go over the kids are
Gwildor kids are getting treatment so if
for example a family has a child who's
getting treated for cancer and they
can't necessarily be with the child all
the time they're far away from a
hospital with a few min would be they
can stay at the Ronald McDonald House
with their child they can be there with
them hold their hand through the service
through the services and through the
treatments and so that the child never
has to feel abandoned your family can
always be there with them it's really a
fantastic charity and it's a great thing
that Ronald McDonald House does and I'm
