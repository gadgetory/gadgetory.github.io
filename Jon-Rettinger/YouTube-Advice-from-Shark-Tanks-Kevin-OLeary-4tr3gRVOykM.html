from TechnoBuffalo we are here on the
field at Marlins Park and as cool as the
surrounding is that is not the most
exciting thing here I am standing next
to mr. wonderful himself
hi Kevin great to bear it's wonderful I
think you taking the time to talk with
us I get a ton of questions as an
entrepreneur myself but certainly
someone who has spoken to probably more
entrepreneurs and you care to remember
how to start a business and what it's
like so in our line of work we're online
we don't have a tangible good
necessarily to sell what advice did you
give to somebody that maybe doesn't have
a typical assembly line can't break down
their cost of goods sold necessarily
they want to start a business and the
product that guess is just themselves
what what advice can you can you offer
you know clearly businesses are driven
by one simple fact you're solving a
problem for somebody and people are
willing to pay you for that service and
take yours for example the reason you're
so big is if I want information and I
want it independent in other words I
don't want the manufacturer telling me
how great the product is I want you to
tell me because I know and I trust that
your arms length I'm willing to actually
go and look at it because you are
delivering something tonight once I want
something independent I want information
and that's why you're making money
because my eyeballs are worth something
to advertisers you're selling
advertising and I keep coming back it's
the contents good so a social media a
big way to disseminate information now
people are getting their news from
Facebook Twitter and less terms typical
news mediums for the folks out there
they're trying to make a living based on
social media disseminating information
and serving is almost citizen
journalists any advice for those kind of
people out there to keep true to their
message but also try and make money as
well it's kind of a fine line to walk
well there's you know it's great idea
dissemination of content but the way to
make money with it is to curate it in
other words I don't have much
but I go online for all my information
and so if you can curate for example the
other day I was looking for a new watch
I don't want to go look at every
manufacturers watch site there's a very
famous blogger out there who curates
all the content every day that's put up
by the watch companies around the world
I go to his site because he gives me the
very best stuff that's curation of
content you're kind of doing the same
thing that's the next big thing in
social media is knowing what I want
curating content giving me exactly what
I want I'm willing to pay for that now
you're willing to let people know your
information as that as a user who's
using a site are you okay with sites
collecting information about you I am
because I want them to do something for
me
they know what I want they know what I'm
buying they know what I'm interested in
serve up stuff of interest to me reduce
the amount of time I have to spend
online actually it's very valuable for
me and so I'm not against giving them
the information here's what I want
here's what I knew here's what I buy now
take it and serve up stuff to me that's
useful if you don't I'm not gonna go to
your site anymore it's that simple so
I'm okay with it so I just watch the
presentation as an entrepreneur I know
that's your field to disseminate what
you're trying to sell we're trying to do
in 90 seconds or less I get that for
somebody who like you who gets pitched
all the time what advice can you give
for someone who's putting together that
pitch I know when I win the first pitch
from that end for my first 90 seconds I
got laughed at I was 24 years old with
the liberal arts degree and no business
experience at all what advice can you
give to somebody like a younger version
of myself or was ever out there that
wants to get into business well here's
what you have to do and this works all
around the world for everybody in every
language it's very simple tell me your
idea in 90 seconds or less you got that
one already number two tell me why
you're the right person to execute the
business plan what do you know that
makes me believe that you can actually
do what you say you can that matters but
here's the thing that really is the core
no your numbers in business the numbers
are everything
what are your breakeven marches how big
is the market how many competitors are
there how much money can I make it you
achieve a certain volume these are all
questions you should have answers to if
you don't I will personally eviscerate
you
that it I've seen you do it many times
so personal questions Twitter your
favorite piece of tech white my most
favorite piece of technology is old
school stuff I believe this but I buy
vintage 70s and 80s power amplifiers
that's what I'm into so if you have an
old Macintosh with tubes or I just
bought an old techni piece that's made
of old transistors sounds amazing I have
a lot of vinyl records I buy a lot of
cartridges I'm into old tech and what
phones or phone with phone or phones do
you carry with you you iOS Android I am
everything so what happens to me is you
know one of the benefits of being a
shark is I get sent everything from
everybody to try it so I have I try
every new piece of equipment that comes
out currently I've just moved to the 6s
because there's an app out there that
lets you download a technology that
turns into a broadcast camera just the
success 1080p the networks are using it
I set up on a tripod and I broadcast
live high def network primetime
television from the success thank you
very much for the time I appreciate it
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
