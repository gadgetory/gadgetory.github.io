brought to you by Netflix ps4 PS Orbis
Sandy Bridge Ivy Bridge Foxconn sharp
Apple TV rumors round them up
hey what's going on everybody and
welcome to the roundup its Tecna
buffaloes rumor roundup on revision3
with me
Noah Kravitz editor-at-large for
TechnoBuffalo this is your roundup of
the week's tech rumors for the week
ending today Friday March 30th 2012 and
I also want to give a big shout out to
mark her and the newest member of the
herd mark
unfortunately shutting down sprint feed
fortunately joining TechnoBuffalo and
not only is he a member of the vaunted
West Coast offense but he's now our
newest mobile writer joining the likes
of Todd Haseltine and Brandon Russell
anyway another that talk let's get to
the rumors first up PlayStation Orbis we
all know that we're not going to see a
next-generation gaming console from
either Sony or Microsoft until sometime
in 2013 unless things change drastically
but that doesn't stop the rumor mill
from churning the latest this week says
that the next PlayStation is not gonna
be called ps4 as you might think but
instead looks to be called PS Orbis
what's enormous Orbis loosely translates
to circle or ring in Latin and
apparently when you put together
Orbis and Vita you get circle of life
which is a nice little bit of Latin
wordplay there apparently some specs
being kicked around rumoured specs
including a GPU capable of 4k resolution
that doesn't mean games will be in 4k
let alone that anybody will have a 4k TV
by next Christmas time but we may see a
CPU or GPU rather capable of 4k you know
make yourself future-proof also most
likely no ps3 game title compatibility
and no support for use games which is a
bummer oh that's how the industry is
going we spoke of GPUs it's kind of
transition speaking of next-generation
Hardware in so it looks like they're
finally set to unveil their next
generation of processors code-named Ivy
Bridge right either been rumors about
delays until June but then not delays
delays not delays well the latest this
week is that the delays will be over
next month April 22nd could see the
first unveiling of Ivy Bridge CPUs with
a formal announcement possibly set for
the 29th so I notice from trickling out
the week of the 22nd and then the 29th
kind of a big
unveiling but we may not see the money
shot so to speak the mobile ship sets
that lots of people including Apple
enthusiasts are waiting for to make
their their way into next generation
laptops like the MacBook Pros which are
overdue for a refresh we may not see
those mobile chips until June the
beginning of June our own steam veteran
chief Sean piane has a rundown over on
the site of the latest Intel Ivy Ridge
rumors - check it out because it sort of
falls into two categories mobile and
desktop and then broken down into two
release frames right now so you're gonna
want to take a look at all those specs
you've been holding off on a desktop or
laptop computer purchase because you're
waiting for the latest and greatest from
Intel alright we're gonna take a break
here a word from our sponsor and then
when we come back what a fox kind of
sharp have to do with Apple TV possibly

try bloomberg businessweek reported
earlier this week that the hot hi group
who's a group out of taiwan that owns
Foxconn in addition to some other
companies is reportedly gearing up to
make a 1.6 billion dollar investment in
sharp now why would hot high why would
Foxconn want to sink all that money into
sharp especially at a time when analysts
are predicting a fall-off in flat panel
TV sales over the course of 2012 two
words Apple tea with that's three words
three words Apple TV it could be that
Han High is making this investment
specifically to bolster fox cons
capacity to build large-format flat
panels suitable for HD TVs we're talking
you know up to 55 60 inches that kind of
thing
large high def panels why would fox not
want to do this perhaps to make their
biggest customer happy Apple accounted
for some 30 percent of the entire Han
high group and projections are for as
high as 50 percent or slightly more than
a half even of Han highs revenue to come
directly from Apple this year and if
these Apple TV rumors are true
Apple is gonna want to do what they
always do and this is why Tim Cook is
now the CEO of Apple because he's a
master of supply chain negotiations
they've done it with flash memory
they've done it with hard drives before
what Apple does is they lock up these
big contracts to make sure that they
have the market cornered or at least
they have a very strong steady supply of
components whatever the hot component is
at a good price but in large volumes so
that way they can crank out whatever
their newest product is way back when is
the iPod and then the iPhone and then
iPad is if Apple TVs next it makes sense
that Apple is going to want to get a big
steady supply of large high quality HD
TV panels to put into this product so
that if the rest of the market tanks if
you know other production facilities
ramped down if there's a shortage of
high quality panels whatever it is
Apple's got their supply chain all in
order so when they tried out the Apple
TV and everybody goes ooh I want one
they'll be able to ship them out right
quick also just to throw another wrench
in here Sharp's predicting massive
losses for fiscal year 2011
something like three and a half billion
dollars in losses so why would hot I
want to pump all this money into a
company that's losing money hand over
foot on TVs again it all seems to kind
of point to one thing
where'd I say it was three words Apple
TV but hey it's just a rumor
we'll have to see what happens all right
kids that'll do it for this week's
episode of the roundup my name is Noah
Kravis you've been watching
TechnoBuffalo on revision3 and as always
you can follow the rest of our exploits
on youtube and on social media as well
as on the site and right here on rev3 so
next time my name is Noah Kratz

you later bye-bye this episode of
TechnoBuffalo
