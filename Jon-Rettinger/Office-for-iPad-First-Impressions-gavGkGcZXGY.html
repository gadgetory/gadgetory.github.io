TechnoBuffalo here Microsoft is getting
into the app game and we've got
PowerPoint Excel and word for iPad let's
go and take a first look and see what
they look like so all three of these are
free downloads you can go ahead and view
your office documents for free if you
want to edit though Microsoft is really
pushing a 365 subscription that's pretty
much what this is it's a Trojan horse to
get you into Microsoft subscription
service let's take a first look at all
three applications go ahead and open up
probably when you're gonna use the most
this is word if you haven't signed into
365 it'll prompt you to do so or you can
choose not now and then just few
documents so show you what it looks like
you get all the templates that you get
on standard war at least most of them
now they tried to pick the most popular
open up a new blank document and it
looks just like word the keyboard pops
up you can go ahead and type you can
select text as like you would on any
text editor on an iPad go ahead and
select it select all you can do what you
want to it bold italicize underline pick
the font you can see what the fonts look
like it's a very typical word experience
if you want to insert things go ahead
and do that right there I've ever used
Microsoft Office it's going to look very
familiar I'm actually really impressed
doesn't look like much changed I'm
making Microsoft's offering a finger
friendly so real quick first look at
Microsoft Word next let's take a look at
Excel if you do a lot of spreadsheets
you're gonna really like this guy so you
got some templates there as well and it
looks like very typical Excel so let's
go ahead and try and do something here
we'll go ahead and fill in a cell let's
type make that so b5 make the one below
it b7 pick one over there if you want to
do all of you or a function some go to
equals it does pull up the same
shortcuts that you get on the desktop
version so go equal some I will pick
this one and we'll make a little plus
sign and it deleted it so certainly
there's a little bit of way to work with
the formatting but as you can see what
it's going to look like and how it's
going to function all the inserts and
formulas and stuff right there too if
you don't know what they are you go
ahead and just grab them directly from
there so not as seamless as you saw on
Word
you got to sort of make sure you
deselect and select if you want to start
doing some function so it can be a bit
complicated but it does work when you're
done with all these documents whether
you're in Word Excel or PowerPoint of
course you can choose to save them
Microsoft hope you're gonna save them to
the former SkyDrive now called onedrive
but you can save it to your device as
well and of course you can open up
documents from your onedrive they look
at the last one here and it is
PowerPoint they got a demo again you can
open up what you've got or select a new
one a PowerPoint demo is probably
easiest way to start it downloads it
opens it up and here is a PowerPoint
demo you can see we can do with all the
slides and again pretty simple you get
your insert insert pictures tables or
shapes transitions it's really important
for PowerPoint different slideshow you
pick from where you want it to start or
hide it and then of course you can
review if you want to put notes on there
so you can see kind of quickly you know
what a presentation would look like
things start popping up lorem ipsum tap
and hold to use a laser pointer so I can
go ahead and sort of move around a big
look lorem ipsum and you can move around
you could play through cat uses it
really is just a big cat toy so
subscribe to 365 and your cat will be
very entertained and you go through and
sort of do the rest of the motion takes
you to transitions that are there as
well go and end the slideshow if you
want to add slides again it's the same
sort of format you pick the title slide
or title and content custom layout and
certainly can do whatever you want to do
that you can do in standard PowerPoint
so overall this really doesn't look to
be that pared down from PowerPoint Excel
and where you get on the desktop but
certainly using this as opposed to this
can be a bit more complicated but if
we're in a pinch here of you know
business travels when you want to go to
edit a document or create a document be
able just to save it natively and awards
it's gonna be a pretty good choice it's
a very competitive market of course
apples got thrown offerings in there a
ton of third-party spreadsheet and
PowerPoint asked and we're processing
applications out there Microsoft was
hoping though that they're free offering
free with giant quotations so Microsoft
here is obviously hoping that their free
offering can compete and at least get
people to subscribe to office 365
because then you can edit and of course
download all the desktop applications as
well so what you guys think are you
gonna use these not use these that love
