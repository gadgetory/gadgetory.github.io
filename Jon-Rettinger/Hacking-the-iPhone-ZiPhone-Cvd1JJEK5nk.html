guy's know i tried to hack it back when
it was one point one point one
successfully the hack work had the
installer app going and tried to update
it to one point one point three and
everything fell apart how to restore it
well I've been able to hack one point
one point three using a program called Z
iphone you know I can't really tell you
guys how to do it but I can just provide
a link to the program and I guarantee
it's really easy I'll put it up in the
sidebar for you anyway guys as you can
see or as I'll show you here i'm running
1 point 1 point 3 i'll show you hold
down the hold on icon here if i can get
to one make them do the little jiggly
dance so you can see it still doing a
little jiggler you can see the installer
app on there as well it's been hacked
again oh it's just nice nice to have
some applications back as well as some
new ones here one of the cool ones that
I got is they brought cover flow to the
iphone so you guys have here all your
applications so you can just scroll
right through you know stocks you just
hit it and all that stuff um after kind
of neat um nothing else really that
fancy that I have now that I didn't have
before I have all the great features as
a 1 point 1 point 3 like the virtual GPS
and they easy rearranging of icons you
