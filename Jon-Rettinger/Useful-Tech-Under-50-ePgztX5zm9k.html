there is tough let alone finding useful
technology under $50 price point here
are four products that I actually bought
myself no press apples here these are
things that I actually used I think you
guys might find surprisingly useful the
first one is by Griffin it's their break
safe magnetic USBC cable think of it
like an external max a for either a
MacBook or any other USB sea power
device it connects and it pulls off
without worrying about somebody knocking
over your laptop your tablet or even
your phone
I do wish the dongle that plugs into the
computer or the tablet itself was a
little bit smaller but you take what you
can get for 40 bucks I travel quite a
bit and often times I find myself
without a cable or I just forgot the
cable that I needed enter the in charge
$12 cable it's a teeny tiny keychain
sized
it's gonna cost you about 12 bucks it'll
mean that wherever you go you've got
something to charge your device with I
am notorious for losing things I
misplaced my wallet my phone bags almost
anything that's why I found the gen 2
tiles to be extremely useful there are a
lot of Bluetooth tracker devices out
there but how the tile is to work the
best for me essentially it's a Bluetooth
tracker I've seen these before the app
is really easy to use you can attach it
to your keys attach it to anything you
don't want to lose open the app it can
find it in absolute seconds and to buy
one tile from the 25 bucks for me it's a
no-brainer it's better than replacing
all my credit cards
the last one is recommended to me by our
own romper unit when he ran out of
storage on his laptop
it is the SanDisk Ultra fit 30 bucks
gets you a teeny tiny 128 gig external
USB 3.0 Drive it's almost exactly the
same size a lot of tech unified receiver
meaning is super small you can either
plug into your laptop or just leave it
in your backup worried about it breaking
off it's been extremely helpful if you
don't want to spend 30 bucks you can
drop it up at 17 and get 64 bits of
storage this might not be the most sexy
flashy products out there these are for
really useful products I keep with me
everywhere I go up that I've used that I
bought myself I found to be extremely
helpful so you guys have any other
product in the 50 bucks you like to use
leave them down below and we'll include
it in upcoming video and if you like the
