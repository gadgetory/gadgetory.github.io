techno but flew here it's an unboxing of
the just released 2010 Apple TV let's
get started alright so this now
miniscule guy is gonna set you back $99
a significant price drop from the
previous version let's go ahead take a
look at the box and this box is indeed
quite small so you've got a picture now
of the black Apple TV on the front
nothing on the top not even though Apple
logo but there is one on the side and
you've got one on the right-hand side
which is telling you that it's got 802
11 and Wi-Fi and of course an HDMI port
and talking about some of the specs on
the back what the Apple TV does
essentially it streams content from the
iTunes Store or from your computer
directly to your television think of it
as an iPod for your TV so you can rent
movies you can rent TV shows and you can
actually watch now Netflix and other
streaming content right on your
television so let's go ahead and take a
look at the previous generation first
and see how this big guy transformed
into this you can see that there is
definitely quite a difference the new
Apple TV has abandoned physical storage
although it does have an 8 gigabyte
flash module in there it's not user
accessible all content that comes to
this Apple TV is going to be streaming
only so enough of me abran let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing of course
we will bust out the big old knife for
this one go ahead and cut on in I've had
an Apple TV since they were first
released and I've used it quite a bit
and I've been waiting for an updated
quite excited to see this and see if it
lives up to the hype it's be nice to
have netflix on demand as well right on
my TV that having to go through a video
game console or a different set top box
so i'll pull off the plastic looks like
it's got a bit of a sleeve there which
we will take off and there is the Apple
TV sitting right on top and this guy is
very small I mean incredibly small very
light
streaming 720p video similar parts to
what we see in the iPad at the a4
system-on-a-chip go ahead push it off
this side for just a moment we've got
the new Apple aluminum or aluminium
depending on where you are remote with
the standard array of buttons got the
up-down left to right menu and playing
pause and that is very thin as well go
ahead and see what else we're gonna have
in the box we're going to have a power
cord the power brick is included and
you've got a little bit of an Apple TV
set-up guide and that is about it I'll
do a tour of the new Apple TV the operon
system how it works and see if it's you
know holds a candle to the older version
whether or not it's worthwhile in the
meantime let's go ahead and peel off the
plastic bottoms got a bit of a rubber
feel to it
the Apple logo feels like it's a little
bit soft touch rubber go ahead and peel
off that plastic it's wondering where
the ports were and that reveals the
ports let's take a look at the ports on
the new Apple TV and there are not many
to look at you've got an Ethernet port
but of course this has Wi-Fi
you've got optical audio HDMI there is a
micro USB port actually being used for
diagnostic tests right now however that
may have other uses in the future and
the power cord and that is it this guy
is very small let's just do a real quick
size comparison with the new Apple TV
versus the outgoing model of Apple TV
and you'll see that this is really no
comparison here size wise and thing is
just miniscule so I'm gonna go ahead and
set this up I will see you in the next
video if you have any questions or
things you want to see on the new Apple
TV be sure to let me know I'm John Rhett
endure from TechnoBuffalo I'll see you
the next video
buh-bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
