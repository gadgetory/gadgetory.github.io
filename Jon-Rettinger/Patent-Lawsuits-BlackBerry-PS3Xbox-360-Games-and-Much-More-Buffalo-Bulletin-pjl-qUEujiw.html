Wii U commercial last gen gaming
goodness for 2014 and Amazon's holiday
delivery apology it's about Fogelson
time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story on the show check
the description below for links or click
on the graphics if you have annotations
toggled on and available I'm Ashley
sceva here your top stories Google
finally got sick of being pushed around
and filed a lawsuit against rockstar the
patent holding consortium jointly owned
by Apple Microsoft blackberry Sony and
Ericsson in 2012 rockstar purchased a
portfolio of nortel patents and have
used them to launch a barrage of
lawsuits against Google and other
android oems some argue that Google
should have purchased the patents so
Margie that Rockstar is bullying Android
I'm arguing the patent system is
completely out of control but nobody
important seems to agree with me
blackberry served up more bad news this
week officially canceling their
blackberry live 2014 conference the
official reasoning is blackberry wants
to try a new strategy involving smaller
shows around the world as opposed to one
big show in addition blackberry
co-founder Mike Lazaridis sold off 3.5
million shares of the company announcing
he's no longer interested in regaining
control of blackberry la cerita says
lack of confidence in BlackBerry's
future has got to sting a little for the
folks up in waterloo in gaming nintendo
is attempting to win consumers over with
a new Wii U commercial sales have been
exactly what Nintendo hoped they would
be for the console but there's a general
consensus that it suffers from confusing
messaging so this new ad hopes to make
it crystal clear that the Wii U is a new
console with unique functions great
titles and is a totally separate system
from the original Wii the announcer even
says just look for the you on the box
suggesting even intend o realizes the
consoles name might be too similar to
its predecessor also in gaming our own
Ron dwells got a write-up on why you
shouldn't throw out your ps3 or xbox 360
just yet 2014 still has some stellar
titles heading for last gen consoles
persona 5 south park the stick of truth
murdered soul suspect and more I'll make
the list of games were planning on
playing next year on our PlayStation 3's
and Xbox 360s anyone who didn't get a
next-gen console
a season will definitely feel better
after reading our list lastly our wild
card story for the day have some good
news some bad news and some other good
news amazon reported a record setting
number of signups for their prime
services holiday season with the site
shipping enough items through prime to
deliver at least one gift to every
household in America the bad news the
sergeant last minute online ordering
combined with the shorter shopping time
frame this year have left some folks
with delayed packages and missed
deliveries for the holiday but Amazon is
at least owning up to some of that
responsibility and have issued twenty
dollar gift cards to affected customers
so I guess that's nice that's the
