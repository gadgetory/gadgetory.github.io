month review here for you on the apple
iphone so like i said i've had it for
three months pretty much since launch
day which i believe was jun 29th and i
wanted to give you guys an assessment of
what i liked about it what I haven't
liked about it and I'm going to keep it
up so everybody was already you knows
you know the iphone looks like what the
interface looks like it's a little bit
glared there but you've seen it you know
the recently the iTunes Wi-Fi store was
updated so first time I start with the
things I like about the phone the
internet browsing on it is amazing as
you can see in the iPhone used one and
two when I load a bleep ESPN the
browsing is a second to none no other
mobile phone that I've seen his
commitment close it's it's real rich
HTML website so you can zoom in and
scroll and that's unbelievable I've
never seen anything like that I've been
through a lot of phones of China mall I
BlackBerry's windows mobile haven't
tried symbian which was close but not
nearly as good and he also I've got a
good sense of perspective on it the
browser is unbelievable the mp3 port
jeff part of it so the ipod part is
amazing as well for watching videos the
thing is is great to the widescreen
really makes videos pop out at you and
for music it's great just like any other
ipod the quality is good and the
controls are nice with the touch screen
so you know that's what i like about it
i like the like the widgets i like like
the way the phone i like to have the
operating system worked it's very
elegant it makes it fun to work and when
you push send and like how the thing
pops up i delete a picture i like how
the image looks like it's actually going
in the trash it's very fun to use even
though things take an extra step or two
it's still very nice and very enjoyable
some things I don't like about it I've
been through this before but I do a lot
of traveling for work small eyes on the
road and always have to stay connected
with email the email application on this
is awful it's really really really bad
and here's why when an email comes in to
get the header dulce new email for
John Appleseed so click the email from
Johnny Appleseed and it'll just spin and
if you're on edge it'll spin 4 45 50
seconds before the text the message
comes up times even longer time is well
you can tell you it can't be downloaded
from the server even if the email is
just a sentence long that sucks when you
need to be quick reply or need to get a
quick message out if you're on Wi-Fi
something that's quicker and you just
don't know when the how longs it take to
read your emails so that's really a big
big big downside of this and since I'm
on the road a lot I stay connected with
friends and colleagues with instant
messaging and to message on the iphone
is really non-existent outside of you
know hacked third party apps around
there before the software update and
using safari IM programs which are
barely usable as far as I'm concerned
they really know I am on it so the phone
is not the business mans travel
companion that some make it out to be so
you know it's been 23 months and I
really had a chance to blow it and get
to use it i love the iphone and i
haven't actually have to decide yet for
going to keep it or not if i'm going to
change for a windows mobile go back to
blackberry because i really need that
email and i have to have an I keep
hoping that Apple is going to fix your
email program and that's why I've kept
it this long every day I keep hoping
that they're going to fix it so you can
kludge am I going to keep the iphone
probably you know maybe i'll get
something between this and iphone too i
don't know i'll let you guys know but
anybody looking for a phone that's a
great mp3 player that they can browse
online with now the iphone is a great
way to go I'm sure everybody's going to
say why not just get a ipod touch and
get some other phone because even if I
turn this iphone all jar i'll still get
the iphone too and i'll be stuck with
two players do the same as I assume
iphone too will fix all the these bugs
and add a chat and all that stuff and
all the features that I want her with in
apples ability to put in to this current
iphone and it's a little frustrating
that they haven't yet I didn't hack my
iphone and if I did I would have been a
little upset that the the program's got
locked out after one point one point one
somebody guys want to give you quick
updates
on the iphone like I said earlier two
great phone foam wise it's a good phone
call quality is great the camera
actually is really good as well no mms
is a little annoying also you can't have
a mess on the phone up enabled mms since
my old nokia i had you know i think
three four years ago so it's definitely
quirky and it's got its ups and downs
but overall it's been a great phone i've
enjoyed having it i hope to continue
enjoying to have it soon the apple fix
these things soon so here's hoping
anyway guys feel free to ask questions
and whatever you guys have and thank you
for subscribing and thank you for
watching actually last thing i want to
talk about was the price drop that
happened to think about a month ago on
this everybody was wondering what i
thought about it her people were asking
at least it didn't really bother me it's
with an apples right to drop the price
of the phone also disappointed that they
did but what you're gonna do it happens
it's part of being an early adopter I
guess so anyway guys thanks for watching
and hope you found this somewhat useful
thank you for subscribing everybody that
did thank you for all new subscribers
but who have just signed in and have a
nice afternoon evening wherever you guys
are and i will have two guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
