TechnoBuffalo I just wanted to show you
a quick example of the Galaxy s5 camera
and the interface here now it has this
auto sorry I almost dropped the phone
it's hard to keep balance
that's an auto HDR mode so I'm going to
tap this button right here and you can
see well I'm gonna put this camera down
so you can balance it
all right so we're balanced so here
we've got the HDR mode off and then if
we tap it it goes on you can see in here
it's kind of hard but a quick color
change it's sort of adjusting from the
darker to the bright you see how it
lightens up like that so that's what
it's doing and it's doing this in real
time which is really really neat
meanwhile it also has selective
autofocus and actually a lot of focuses
in point three seconds so faster than
anything else out there
you get really quick pictures I mean I'm
going through a super fast BAM so pretty
sweet and then if you go into the
settings menu here you can see there's
tons of options so tap to take fixed
metering modes aiyah ISO effects
recording mode location tags guidelines
voice control pretty much anything you
could ask for and then mode here is also
the sort of simple controls that we also
saw on the Galaxy camera and other
devices like that so I just wanted to
give you a quick look here at the camera
interface on the galaxy s5 because I
know a lot of people are going to
probably wonder what it's like this is
