TechnoBuffalo here with a full review
for you if one of the vices that I was
looking forward to most this year it is
of course the HP Bilt touchpad let's go
ahead dig in get to the full review and
see if it's worthy of the huge hype
that's been bestowed upon
so let me recap the specs is very
quickly of the HP TouchPad it's got a
nine point seven inch and of course
that's diagonal display with the
resolution of 1024 by 768 it's getting
all its power from a dual-core Qualcomm
Bilt Snapdragon chip at 1.2 gigahertz so
that's 1.2 gigahertz on each core
alright so let's go ahead and talk about
the OS
this is webOS 3.0 and there's a lot to
talk about
so all that swiping and gestures that
you loved or might not have loved about
webOS it's all here you can go ahead and
swipe up from any of the bezels with the
one exception at the top one where the
front-facing camera is located but it
works anywhere so I've got some open set
open up web page swipe up like you saw
you can go ahead and access your deck of
cards there's also a physical home
button here on the bottom of the device
when you have it all the way up and
portrait orientation which does exactly
the same thing so I open this up hit the
home button and it'll take me right back
to where I was there's not much
additional functionality you get with
the home button you can use it to take
screenshots for example much like you
can on an iPhone or an iPad you know
hold this down quick button combo it
takes a screenshot spit superfluous and
unnecessary
I found myself never been using that
home button but it is there
notifications are a bit different they
show up in the upper right hand corner
I've got a Facebook one that's popped up
right there you can see what it is they
also show up on the lock screen if you
like them too so gonna see what it looks
like right there there's notification
swipe off and there it goes very
unobtrusive I love the way webOS does
notifications they really do it right
there completely out of the white but
you can access them whenever you need to
all right so let's talk about this
screen the screen here is absolutely
beautiful go ahead and open up a
TechnoBuffalo image video he absolutely
pumps images absolutely pop if you're
looking at a website the text is crisp
and clear the screen on this is
absolutely great beautiful if you were
worried about getting a washed-out
effect or wording it might look like
well Motorola Xoom for example not to
worry you going to get a
beautiful beautiful viewing experience
here on the touchpad alright so now
let's talk about the browser since
that's where we are right now anyway
the browser here is probably one of the
best I've seen on a tablet and that goes
for any tablet in existence is extremely
smooth I very rarely saw that
checkerboard pattern from loading
pinch-to-zoom
was extremely smooth and one of the best
things about this tablet is its ability
to play flash on a place flash extremely
well once again the best implementation
I have ever seen of flash on a mobile
device let's go ahead and go to YouTube
and we'll go to the native YouTube we'll
go to the YouTube channel John for
Lakers so we'll go ahead and queue that
up and it will start playing the video
and if you like to browse YouTube videos
you can browse them just as you would on
your desktop computer that really isn't
a YouTube application here because one's
not necessary you can use YouTube and
watch video just as you could anywhere
else and as I showed you at my unboxing
it does actually play Hulu or this
hasn't been blocked yet from playing
Hulu so if you have one of these might
enjoy it well last before that gets
blocked so go ahead and let it start to
play get a second to queue up and you
are going to get your video played in
New York and get the same controls that
you get on your desktop browser you got
the full scrubber effect across the
bottom and go ahead and make this
fullscreen button turn the volume down
so I don't make anybody deaf it's a good
time actually to mention here Beats
Audio speakers they're - located here
the audio that comes out of the sound
absolutely fantastical it's not going to
do it justice to hear it come from the
tablet to the camera then upload to
YouTube which is gonna sound an average
where Beats Audio really comes to play
though is when you have headphones
plugged in the audio that you get out of
this is absolutely outstanding all right
so here's Flash playing you can see John
kwacha make it fullscreen
you get a pretty nice viewing experience
stutters for just a second then it opens
up in full screen now this I found a
little annoying
you can't watch youtube videos in any
orientation you want you can only watch
it the way it wants you to which is like
this it's not a giant deal but something
that I found very annoying while
watching a video you know laying it
doesn't have to keep turning around if I
didn't have it set up the right way so
there is Flash content no stuttering
really smooth if you like to watch a lot
of flash videos this is absolutely a
wonderful choice alright so let's go
ahead and exit out of this so conclusion
browser pretty awesome so there's junk
watch good and pause it and if you want
to exit out of a full-screen you have to
exit out of it and then you can go ahead
and do a pup we'll go and get that out
of here also kind of a fun thing too if
you want to close an application
obviously you can swipe it off the
screen but you can also bounce it off
the screen which I found to be kind of
fun if you have pull all the way down
it'll snap right up like that I don't
know it was enjoyable to me alright so
let's talk about apps apps are important
to use apps are important to me apps are
the lifeblood of tablets and here we're
looking at the HP app catalog and
unfortunately there aren't many apps
this is the same criticism I had with
Android Honeycomb there just wasn't that
much out there developers having that
that much time with the api's certainly
HP is making a huge push to get apps on
this thing but there just aren't many
right now in fact one of their flagships
apps that they showed when they first
launched this device or four showed it
rather in February you can see something
applications right here some of them are
optimized for touchpad it'll show up
when they're not just won't say for
touchpad but I was really excited to go
ahead and check out the Kindle Store I
was one of the apps that you know they
showcase and they first launched it it's
even here on the device it's like go
ahead and launch it I'm gonna read my
books
boom thank you for downloading Kindle
well hard at work bringing it to you
they just give you an icon that takes
you to splash screen so it's not ready
yet and that's sort of a microcosm for
the app situation for the touchpad it's
not ready yet it's got a lot of
potential maybe I'll have a ton of apps
but there just aren't that many right
now the apps set there are however
there's a dedicated Facebook app for it
a tablet which works very well although
I prefer the web just native web version
of Facebook you're gonna head and have
that here and there are some Twitter
applications and the stuff that you'd
use on a pretty regular basis alright so
let me go ahead and jump back to a
browser window so I want to show you the
keyboard
keyboard here's one of the things I
really liked about the touchpad you can
see it right here and it's pretty
standard fare it's a keyboard but what
makes it much easier for me lease is
having the full row of numbers across
the top I never realized how often I use
numbers and eliminating a keystroke if I
were going to hit a function button and
then hit the numbers made it much much
easier a little bit of knowing though
this tab button the same thing as a tab
button on an actual keyboard I can keep
moving you down I kept thinking I had a
hit tab if I wanted to get like the
exclamation mark or something you know
that was just me you get access to
symbols and it's not any faces and all
that stuff
I keep words pretty good you can see the
letters that you type over it and just
works well I've watched a Google but it
does you know it doesn't work into
keyboard it's got the multi-touch
capabilities you know I would have liked
to have had the letter should have
hovered up as I have my finger over it
but it's pretty good and it works well
when you have it in landscape
orientation as well if memory serves me
correct and we first saw this at the
palm event they were showing us do you
could actually resize the keyboard to
different sizes that however does not
appear to have made it into the shipping
version of this so maybe we'll see that
in future updates go ahead and get that
guy off the screen let's go ahead and
check out email and this I'll use you
know palm or HP is now synergy
applications or I'll sort of bring
everything together its email it works I
like you have these sort of sliding
panel so you can move things over and
get more room depending on what you need
or don't need what you want to see it's
a very elegant interface and the email
just works pretty well on here so it's
all I'm gonna talk about that go ahead
and swipe that sucka
off the screen let's go ahead and talk
about just type something interesting
here and just type and just type is HP's
version of Universal search and it
searches universally but there's
something funny in here that I wanted to
show you so I go and type something it's
just type bbbbb and you can search on
google and there other sort of
functionality you can put in here will
hide the keyboard Twitter YouTube and
all that stuff but if you look at that
YouTube logo it is super pixelated
alright so there you go you can see that
YouTube logo it is just completely
pixelated it's funny that that made it
into the shipping build I don't know
doing those little things that I want to
to point out all right so let's talk
about build quality here of the HP
TouchPad feels pretty solid it's nice
and good in the hands it is probably the
biggest fingerprint magnet of any device
I've ever used not just the back but the
screen as well if I turn this off in
addition to the reflection of my
overhead fan you're gonna see
fingerprints and usually they wipe off
pretty easily this one you really got a
scrub if you want to clean it all up a
package comes in a you know totally
heavy by tablet standard 1.6 pounds when
you compare it to the iPad 2 or the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 you realize that you are
carrying definitely a heavier tablet so
let's talk about battery life it's got a
six thousand three hundred milli amp
hour battery life
she's a battery indicator there in the
upper right hand corner and battery life
is actually pretty outstanding I was
able to get through three days pretty
easily of watching intensive video email
coming in constantly battery life was
not a problem on her even while viewing
video and doing intensive stuff I do
wish there was a back camera on here not
that I used it very often but I like to
have the option to not use it at least
this is completely missing any sort of a
rear camera it does have a front facing
camera but it's really not user
accessible there isn't a camera
application where you can snap a photo
of yourself for example you have to just
use this for video conferencing with
Skype which why don't we did the testing
does not work with the new Mac client so
if you want to Skype video with someone
who's using a Mac you were going to be
out of luck until a software fix comes
out we did test it from mobile device to
touchpad so from an iPhone to a touchpad
for example it worked and from a PC to a
touchpad it also worked as well
something to keep in mind so let me wrap
this all up into a conclusion the
touchpad is really a microcosm of HP in
general a lot of potential you know
there's a lot here the operating system
is smooth its slick but there's just
something about it that makes you
realize you can't use it on an everyday
basis whether it's the lack of app
support whether or not it's the heavy
size
you know it's just not something that I
think I can use every single day
especially at a price point that's
exactly the same as the iPad 2 in the
Galaxy Tab 10.1
one I was trying to decide what the
value-add was for the HP TouchPad so if
you want to get a tablet assuming you
don't have any feeling one way or
another towards Apple or Google or rim
why would you get a touchpad and I
couldn't think of an answer especially
if at $500 price points you'd be much
better suited going with an iPad to
going with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and
getting that sort of more robust
ecosystem and a more polished product
now maybe we'll see revisions and
software updates come up that'll address
some of my gripes maybe we'll see
developers really make a big push here
but I know if I was a developer and I
was making an application and I had a
choice to write it for the touchpad
writer for Android or writer for iOS
I'd be very hard-pressed to spend my
time writing an application for the
touchpad I think we're gonna see really
a lot of that in here now if this was
$50 cheaper or $100 cheaper
I'd say absolutely it's a great tablet
to get $100 less than you'd be competing
with something like the Asus Eee Pad
Transformer and you're gonna have two
really good choices but I just can't
recommend it for the price I can't
figure out the value at is things like
the touchstone doc are kind of neat and
the touch to share at the pre three but
that's not out yet and I can't show you
that so you're left with a wireless
charging option that's gonna cost you a
couple bucks and it's habit what that
works well but maybe not as well as
other tablets on the market so HP once
again it's close almost there but it's
just not quite a hundred percent so
maybe you'll stay tuned for the touch
pad 2 or maybe future software updates
but for right now I just can't recommend
it to my audience I'm John Rhett endure
from TechnoBuffalo do you agree or
disagree I'm very curious what you guys
have to say and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
