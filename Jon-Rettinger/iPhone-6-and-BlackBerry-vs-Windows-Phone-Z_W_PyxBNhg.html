to you by gamefly hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley it's gather any question you
might have for the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo com
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise you can send me a
tweet at any time of the day or night at
technobuffalo or at Ashley escoba but
make sure you use the hashtag ask the be
so I can see it usually I'll answer
between three and five questions every
episode let's get answering because this
is ask the Buffalo Antonio cool jack
says hey Ashley since Apple has
redesigned almost everything in iOS 7 do
you think that later they will do the
same to OS 10 thanks well I think this
64-bit architecture is a step toward an
arm-based macbook pro so this will be a
very interesting kind of next couple of
years for Apple I definitely think that
they are going to integrate parts of iOS
7 into OS 10 I mean we've already kind
of seen that with gestures and the
trackpad still a full OS it's just got
some shades if you will of iOS so I
think that will definitely be seeing iOS
7 in Mavericks and going forward but our
user at kg shot says both bb10 and
Windows Phone have low app counts but if
you could only use one which would it be
and what device it's a really good
question now see the thing about
blackberry 10 is there something really
like two devices on the other thing is
is I actually really like Windows Phone
so I'm a big fan of the Lumia line I
haven't used the 1020 as much as I would
have liked to that being said I would
have to say just out of devices i have
personally used I gotta go with the
Lumia 925 for tmobile it's a really nice
phone I love the design the beautiful
sort of aluminum outer lining is really
gorgeous the polycarbonate I mean it's
just a really lovely phone and honestly
I really like live tiles I love Windows
Phone I think it's the oh the littlest
greatest OS that no one's using right
now but that's gonna change because I
really feel like over time micro
soft as good at two things number one
throwing money at developers until
something is successful exhibit a xbox
number two they are very very good at
being patient and on top of that they're
going to be integrating I have a feeling
windows with windows phone so especially
now that they own nokia this is
definitely going to be i think 20 2014
might be the year of the windows phone
twitter user mark best 17 asks now that
the 5s is out is it worth to upgrade
from a 4s to a 5s or wait for the next
iPhone 6 I get this question a lot like
should I wait should I get one now the
thing is is if you wait you're always
gonna be waiting for that next phone
like next you're gonna say well should i
wait for the iphone 6s but the thing is
if you've got the means right now I
think the 5s is a really good device and
really on the upgrade cycle the S models
are the ones you want to go for for your
iPhone because really you get the design
change in the base model so the five was
a different design and then you get the
optimization and the sort of little
extra features in the s model so for the
forest we had Siri and in the 5s we have
fingerprint scanning and I think the six
will be some kind of design change so I
say the 5s you should go do it do it
Josh asks hey Ashley what do you think
about nokia thinking Apple copied them
with the iphone 5c in multiple colors
also stating from a tweet thanks hashtag
Apple imitation is the best form of
flattery I did see that tweet from Nokia
and honestly I think the thing is is
yeah of course I mean I wouldn't say
that it's copying but at the end of the
day I mean there's only so many things
you can do with the design of a phone if
that makes sense and the thing is is I
hate to break it to nokia but apples
kind of been making colorful devices for
a really long time just not on the
iphone you've been doing on the ipod for
a while so i don't know that it's like
imitation of those phones but i do think
that using polycarbonate really good
idea i think that nokia sort of paved
the way for many different manufacturers
to start experimenting with alternate
solutions beyond just well let's make a
black slab out of plastic you might care
who does it first and good for you and I
think that that's okay too but man I
care about who does it best at the end
of the day could be Apple I don't know
gotta see the iphone 5c first calesian
