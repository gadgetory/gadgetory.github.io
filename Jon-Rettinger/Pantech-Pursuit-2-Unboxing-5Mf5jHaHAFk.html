TechnoBuffalo for the unboxing of the
pantech pursuit to slider fallen let's
see if this bad boy unleashes a bunch of
fury in our exclusive unboxing alrighty
let's cut to the chase and just rip this
box open here packing peanuts they are
very useful for putting in somebody's
car filling someone's car with and
having them open the door you need a lot
of them stuff to do that let's zoom in
right here we have this colorful little
AT&amp;amp;T box
pantech pursuit - and let's go over some
specs here with this phone it is
actually only 50 dollars with a two-year
contract and this phone it's not at the
high end of the spectrum I have to be
honest it is a 3G slider phone it has a
two point eight inch touchscreen display
q VGA and texting and driving
it can wait please don't do that I'll
kick your butts
okay be finding this nice little sleeve
here what do we get you get a USB cable
to get pantex rather obtuse charging
module here and a Quick Start Guide so
we're not really given an ample amount
but that's okay all of our action is
going to lie within the phone's rip this
off a cute little design when I say cute
I mean wow why'd I use cute that was
really lame but it is a nice little
phone it is a 2.0 megapixel camera I
really kind of like this design it's
neat
I'm a huge fan of green let's check out
the QWERTY keyboard here okay it's about
the size of you know a blackberry
keyboard the keys are a little different
though as you can see they are not as
chiseled as a blackberry there are more
along the lines of a Motorola Droid
keyboard we have three buttons here call
and end physical call intend buttons
that's really great
I'm a fan of that I like tangible
buttons and we have a back button right
in the middle volume rocker right along
the side let's let's do a little slide
test here smooth ok flickable yep we can
flick it ok not bad some phones tend to
get caught up a little bit you know the
jerky Motorola Droid experience but this
does not do that and that's neat let's
wrench off the back panel here and while
I'm doing that I'm going to spoon feed
you more delicious specs ok this phone
has a QSC 60 to 70 arm9 230 megahertz
processor you thought something awesome
was going to come after the QSC 60 to 70
arm9 but now it's a 230 megahertz
processor so this phone is definitely
not a speed racer it's not a speed demon
and it's definitely not what John Rhett
enger' likes to refer to as a screamer
ok let's talk about onboard memory it
has 217 megabytes of onboard memory with
the addition of an SD card micro sd card
and it has the slot no micro SD card in
the box so there's another bit of a flaw
but that's ok
we're talking up to two up to three
hours of talktime here and up to 250
hours of standby time so this battery
let's let's take a look at what it is is
a 1000 milliamp battery so that's not
the best battery life I would like a
longer battery life especially a little
phone like this which shouldn't use a
lot of processing power so that will
just have to wait for in the full review
now for data transfer rates we're
talking up to three point two five
megabytes and that's a pretty low number
as well and the nice thing about this
phone is the touch screen no it runs on
gsm/gprs edge 850 900 1800 and 190
megahertz
networks so let's let's take a look at
this let's see if we can power this on
here you find the power button is that
the power button this is the power
button has to be is this the power
button
that's the power button and there was
much rejoicing yay okay so we've got
multiple color choices as well I forgot
to mention that so green if you're not a
fan of green like I am there are other
options out there within the wonderful
world of the rainbow
we have Bluetooth 2.1 there's USB 2.0
connectivity there are drag-and-drop
shortcuts oh I don't have a SIM card SOS
calls save our seals calls only can we
get out of this I don't want to get out
of this okay I'm gonna have to drop my
sim card in this so unfortunately we are
not going to be able to take a look at
the interface until the review so you
just gonna have to wait for the review
as far as an OS this is running drumroll
please
brew MP operating system so a brew MP
operating system personally that's
something that I really haven't heard of
before it's kind of obscure but it
should kind of match the level of
hardware found in this phone so that is
another kind of setback it's a $50 phone
to your ATT contract so we'll just have
to wait and see how the pantech pursuit
2 does in our full review here at
TechnoBuffalo thank you for tuning in
this has been the unboxing of the
pantech pursuit - i'll snap at you later
this is Mike Roman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
