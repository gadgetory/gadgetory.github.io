lot to you but they recently released
their find five android smartphone and
this is the video review so let's check
it out the fine 5 is rocking some
serious flagship specs it has a 5-inch
1080p screen 2 gigs ram a one-and-a-half
gig quad core processor Android 4.1
jellybean NFC Bluetooth and the 2500
milliamp battery so it's not messing
around
the design of the fine 5 is really
masculine without seeming macho which is
a big bonus for anybody out there
looking for a manly phone that doesn't
quite look like a talked a track with a
bunch of added ugly plastic it's strong
clean lines are really impressive the
volume controls for the fine v sit on
the right hand of the phone the microUSB
charging port is on the bottom and the
power button actually sits on the left
hand side which was a welcome change
from the all buttons on one side of the
phone design we've been seeing recently
there's a three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack on top and a 13 megapixel
shooter with a dual LED flash on the
back which sits above a speaker grille
so the screen is probably the very best
part of the fine 5 it is stunning
ACOs done a really great job of
celebrating it here with an almost
edge-to-edge design and you'll never
feel cheated or disappointed when you're
looking at the fine 5 screen if you have
meteor palms that edge to edge design
might be a little bit of a problem but
overall it's a minor inconvenience the
processor in ram would suggest that this
is a really speedy phone but if I'm
being completely honest there is some
lag from time to time while using the
device I'm not sure if that's due to the
UX being optimized improperly but even
putting the device to sleep has a little
bit of a delay to it sometimes which is
a little bit odd especially when looking
at the fine 5 specs on paper navigating
the device is usually smooth but I
figured I would mention that lag as it
does pop up from time to time speaking
of which let's talk about that UX and
the rest of the fine 5 software so the
Oppo find 5 runs Android 4.1.1 jelly
bean right out of the box we don't know
yet when or if Oppo plans to upgrade to
Android 4.3 but they have been pretty
good about regular patching for bugs
is on this phone so we're hopeful about
an update to Android sooner rather than
later ah pose UX on the other hand is
quite frankly pretty garish the widgets
are too much of everything and they
clash with the elegance of the phone's
external look the lockscreen is also
super annoying with a revolving door
type of deal and no initial instruction
on how to unlock it
so sure it'll take you a couple seconds
to figure out but it can be a bit
inconsistent and that's never good for a
simple task like unlocking your phone in
happier news there isn't a lot of
pre-installed bloatware on the fine 5
which is really nice and that's likely
because the device ships unlocked
without any carrier partners to mess it
up with third-party apps yay the fine 5
employees a 13 megapixel camera which
landed around above-average on a scale
of Port excellent it was good enough at
snapping decent photos and recording
1080p video but we weren't totally blown
away especially now that we're used to
using custom camera software and
hardware combos from HTC and Nokia
overall it's not the best camera out
there but it's not the worst by any
means if you want a killer camera the
iPhone 5 has that wide selection of apps
the HTC One has its video highlights
feature and even the Nokia Lumia 1020
has that pure megapixel power as for
call quality and data call sound really
good on this device the speakerphone is
super loud and HSPA speeds here in
Irvine were more than sufficient for our
needs
looking at benchmarking the fine v
pulled numbers in the low 7000 range
which isn't anything to write home about
especially considering other 2013
Android flagships like the galaxy s4 and
the HTC One we're pulling almost double
those numbers and clocking in around 12
the 13,000 ouch we're sorry to report
the battery life on the fine 5 is not
the best you're probably looking at 6
hours max if you're a power user but if
you're a light to moderate user with a
solid Wi-Fi connection most of your day
the phone will make it until you get
home it's possible that part of this
poor battery life is tied to the custom
UX and how it handles everything but
whatever the cause is if you've been
using a phone like the HTC One with mega
battery life you'll be pretty
disappointed in the fine 5s battery life
overall the Oppo find 5 is a phone that
looks great on the outside and on paper
but
performs under what it should be the
good news is that that Oppo is really
involved with and supportive of the
Android dev community and so this is a
really great competitor or even an
upgrade to the Nexus 4 I'm sure if you
had CyanogenMod running on this bone it
would provide a really great Android
enthusiast experience so I'm gonna give
the Oppo find five a score of seven oh
