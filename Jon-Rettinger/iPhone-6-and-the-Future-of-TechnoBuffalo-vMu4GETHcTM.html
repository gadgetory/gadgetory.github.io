to you by full sail university what's up
everyone it feels good to be back and
you asked the Buffalo chair i am your
host jon rettinger and this is the show
where you could ask me any question
you've got from the wide world of
technology or even sometimes outside of
it if you want to ask a personal
question and want to something about
gaming cell phones tablets this is the
place you do it and how do you ask those
questions you say well every tuesday on
TechnoBuffalo duck calling put up an
article saying ask your questions if you
do that in the comments otherwise you
can tweet them to me anytime at john for
lakers or at TechnoBuffalo just use the
hashtag ask the be up this week we're
talking about iphone 6 next-gen gaming
consoles where I guess current gen
gaming consoles and some personal
questions this is asked to Buffalo let's
start asking the Buffalo
the first question comes from twitter
user at philips kid asks at john for
lakers what would you like to see in the
iphone 6 that's a good question i really
like to see one thing the iphone 6
bigger please make it bigger rumors have
been circulating about two different
iphone sizes allegedly Apple is going to
drop the plastic iPhone 5c in favor of a
4.5 to 4.7 inch iphone and a giant 5.5
inch iphone I wouldn't think Apple is
going to jump that big to the 5.5 inches
but I do think a 4.5 24.7 makes perfect
sense I think to say this like a broken
record every year with iOS but in
addition to a bigger phone size also
like to see some sort of quick
notifications fast rates to my
information windows phone has the
awesome live tiles android of course as
really customizable widgets make the
phone your own experience Apple really
doesn't have a kinda have to open the
app at the old Notification Center sort
of see that quick information i love way
to do that somehow from the home screen
so those are my real wish losses for the
iphone 6 a new design would be nice to
think the iphone 5 iphone 5s designs get
a little bit on the sales side improve
camera probably improve speed but bigger
and improved design in a new OS would
make me quite happy fellow this one's
kind of a company question it comes from
user at 09 s royal at john for lakers
where do you see it technobuffalo and
follow up to 10 years time how big a
part of it do you plan to be that's
really interesting question never know
what the future holds and certainly I
hope the techno Buffaloes here and five
titanium they've been working really
hard over the past four to five years
sort of built a foundation for the
future there aren't that many
independent tech sites out there anymore
moster owned by larger companies so it's
been fun to sort of build an independent
brand I hope to still be involved you
know right now I'm 33 and ten years and
will be 43 I hope that's still young
enough to be relevant in the industry
but i hope the TechnoBuffalo you know
continues to grow I've really served
drive to grow TechnoBuffalo to be the
voice of the consumer you know we don't
have giant millions and millions of
dollars like a CBS style budget you know
we just have what we work with we work
try and bring you the best content we
have and everything else is secondary
where the voice of the consumer we're
just like you love technology and we
have
opportunity to write and talk about it
and put it on video so we continue to
grow that and I really hope my goal is
that people think of technology or want
to know about our product a first place
a thing to go is technobuffalo we've
been growing pretty significantly over
the past few years when it comes to
traffic or still a new company so we've
got a lot of them mark the chair and
really hope where the next five to ten
years we can get that mind share so if
we that helped answer question let's go
from personal to gaming user at c kv
underscore 1996 asks what next-gen
gaming console do you own and what would
you say is good about it so at the
office we have both the xbox and the PS
so of course we have the Nintendo Wii U
as well at home i currently have a wii u
and a playstation 4 i've always had xbox
console we've always gamed on the xbox
consoles always prefer the controller
this generation kind of threw me for a
loop i really really like the controller
on the playstation 4 and in all honesty
with a son at home i haven't that much
time to play that many games like did
played it really really awesome and I'm
kind of embarrassed to admit it but the
lego marvel game was absolutely awesome
and that was really only game i played
totally through so i'm actually using my
ps4 almost exclusively for streaming
whether i'm watching Netflix or Amazon
or Hulu or vuda which is a great way to
watch movies I found its really really
quick the contents are queues up right
away there's no really big long buffer
time it starts playing quality improves
as it goes along but it's really really
fast i just use the Apple TV only for
that certainly the ps4 is way better
specs has been a more seamless
experience but I found them where I use
it the more I'm hating the battery life
on the controller you know I watched two
episodes house of cards and something my
fully charge controller is almost all
the way down to one bar or less so I'm
considering picking up an xbox one it
sounds kind of silly to say to use an
xbox one for streaming so I don't worry
about a controller I hate to say Xbox on
I can wave my hand to launch netflix I
don't like that I gotta have connects or
there and staring at me and always on
still creeps me out but that was sort of
a long answer how i'm using my consoles
the wii u I still I still relieve a soft
spot for Nintendo i love the mario game
looking forward trying donkey kong i
can't wait to mario kart comes out next
gen zelda I've ever had a much time to
play that we
you would serve gathering dust over the
past few months over that helped answer
your question let me take a quick break

incredible privilege the fact that i get
it come every day and see what's new
