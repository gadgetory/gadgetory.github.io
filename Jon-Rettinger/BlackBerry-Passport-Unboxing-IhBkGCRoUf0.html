TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest from blackberry this is the
square one to the passport I have been
fascinated with this device since it
first got rumoured and linked and then I
made official and now it is finally here
and I can't wait to get my keyboard
lovin mitts on let's go ahead and take a
first look at the blackberry Passport
so I don't assume this is gonna be full
retail packaging this is sent to us from
the folks at blackberry PR you've got
the BlackBerry logo emblazoned on the
top and really nothing else go ahead and
pull this off and boom they're sitting
is the passport that is a phone unlike
any other a lot of phones you might not
be able to tell what they are this thing
you will be able to tell from a mile
away that this is a passport feels
really nice I pushed it off the side for
a quick sexy delsar going to have in the
box we've got a book telling you how to
use it in like 18 different languages go
ahead and see what else we're gonna have
i'll included a back cover shell just a
nice little bit of a soft touch rubber
we've got a screw protector in there as
well got a pair of earphones everybody
always tells me I never open these
things up so go ahead and do that it
look like simple earphones with a noise
cancelling mic get some shots of that
further in the box we've got lots of
things with this thing you've got
definitely not a US I believe this is
the UK wall adapter and then this is
probably different countries adapters
here there's one for the US and then
this one I know buddy used this one in
me this is Europe and this is the UK you
guys correct me if I'm wrong but so
there's that and then we've got a micro
USB cable but that's not why you guys
are here
you are here to take a look at this guy
and this is a phone really unlike
anything else that would be seen it is
Specht up nicely so first let's if you
get that whooshing noise I like only on
the top part boom it is on the sheath go
ahead and see it's got some juice to
power on and I'll walk you through the
specs it's kind of interesting so of
course you've got a full-on
Square screen here which is kind of
interesting so I'd assume the text
across it gonna look really good but
maybe kind of shrunk going this way it
is a 4.5 inch screen you're probably
saying oh it's 1080 or right it is not
1080 it is 1440 by 1400 it's a really
really high spec screen that's got a 453
PPI in this guy it's got three gigs of
RAM 32 gigabytes of flash storage it
does somewhere have a micro SD card slot
probably up here that is hot swappable
so you can go ahead and put that in
whenever you want I think it pops off
like this that's also where your SIM
card is going to live as well the whole
back part doesn't come off and the
battery is not removable just as in the
more you know go ahead slide this thing
back on on the back we have a 13
megapixel camera that can shoot 1080p
video up to 60 frames per second 720p
video camera on the front a 2 megapixel
sensor it's got 802 11 a b/g/n and AC a
dual band
34 15 milliamp hour battery this guy is
available as of today for 599 and
dollars and that's totally unlocked and
contract rates are pretty reasonable
price for a really wellspect phone a
quick tour of the device so you have a
full physical keyboard here because the
device is so long the keys are really
nicely spaced out kind of interestingly
the spacebar sort of snubbed in between
that bottom row so I'll take a look at
how that's going to perform in our hands
on also the keyboard supposedly QBE is
almost like a trackpad so for browsing
your website you can just scroll up and
scroll down for how that's going to work
which is a kind of neat on the
right-hand side you've got volume up and
down and then you've got a a mute button
in between on the top you've got your
power and lock button 3.5 millimeter
headset jack noise cancelling mic
speakers and there's your charge and
sync port found on the back and of
course there's we have your camera I'm
gonna go turn this guy on get it all set
up now I'm gonna use it for a few days
and we will do a hands-on you guys
watching this video about a week after
we filmed it so we'll have some hands on
that hope you'll be able to go up the
same day that you guys see this give you
guys some impressions on what it's like
to use a blackberry Passport
also mention that it's running
BlackBerry OS 10.3 which has built-in
access to the Amazon Appstore so every
app you can get on on a Kindle device
you can get on your BlackBerry passport
you can also of course get access to
BlackBerry's own app store and Android
apps can be siloed right onto here so
you really get access to ton of apps
almost three unique app stores you can
get on your blackberry 10 point your
device let's go ahead and take a look at
we'll be back in the next video because
this is such a unique shape I thought
we'd do a quick size comparison show you
what it looks like next to some of its
frenemies
let's bring in first the LG g3 it's a
5.5 inch show and you can see through
what those look like certainly a much
taller device and the passport is way
wider than the g3 so there are those two
let's bring in the latest from Apple
here is the iPhone 6 4.7 inch screen
almost exactly the same height certainly
the width difference we're gonna see it
with every phone and the largest of the
iPhone family here is the iPhone 6 plus
that guy in and see what those look like
you really get a sense of how wide this
is you guys watching hope you enjoyed
