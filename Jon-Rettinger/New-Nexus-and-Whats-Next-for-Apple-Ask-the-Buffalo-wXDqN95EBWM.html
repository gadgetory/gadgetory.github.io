world so after my family is talking tech
and what better way to do it than to
talk tech with you guys let's take you
some questions disaster Buffalo i'm jon
rettinger let's get to it our first
question comes from Gary Fox at
Foxcatcher who do you think will be the
manufacturer for the new Nexus device
who do you want it to be so every rumor
is pointing towards HTC making the next
Nexus device but i should say making the
next Nexus device because legend a there
will be two and i want to c GC do it i
would have also liked Justin Sony get a
crack at the Nexus line but I'm really
happy to HTC back making Android devices
as Google intended next let's go to at
Bob hog who asks do you think smartphone
innovation has hit a plateau smartphone
innovation yeah I'll wait it's super
plateaued it is like the first new thing
we've really seen is kind of from LG
with the g5 with the friends or the
modular phones but that is a very first
foray nothing really new has happened
you know the last real innovation that
we saw was 3d screen to stereoscopic 3d
and it was innovative sure horrible to
use hurt your eyes and not practical yes
innovation isn't always better I think
the next innovation we're going to see
and I've been hoping is gonna be battery
technology just better battery actually
locally here leave you see is a new
battery technology so I'm hoping that'll
make its way to phones and ask to plug
my phone and every night cuz I forget
sometimes and that's sucks at kike one
asks where do you see TechnoBuffalo in a
few years time and here's time is tricky
um on the video side like to see us
getting 150 200 thousand video views per
video I think that's a good gauge of
success I'd also like to see on the web
sites i like to see us finally gets to
20 million page views a month and 7
million uniques to be really hope you
feel good but less sort of met Ricky I
want to just to keep having fun I love
doing this and I hope that I can still
have fun doing this in a year as long as
I can do that I can still pay bills and
paying staff then I'll be a pretty happy
guy next to jump over to snapchat I'm on
there over at jon rettinger mr. Sean
yuck asks do you think we'll see a 4k
display from Apple at WWDC make one bold
prediction for WWDC and 4k display I'm
not sure the question certainly means we
only have a 5k imac
I'm hoping the high resolutions on
phones let me be a qhd we'll see
potentially with the iphones item that
zakhmi double w DC if you want one bold
prediction for double wdc here it is and
Mark mark the down gaming Mac our last
question comes from snapchat again Eric
Johnson 16 asks are you excited for the
Rams be playing in LA I am beyond
excited for the Rams back in LA so my
earliest memories the kid was going to
rammed games they played in Anaheim with
my dad and I loved it with my two boys I
cannot wait to go hoping to get season
tickets in fact over the weekend the
official Rams joder counts is that a
picture of Nate and daddy rocking some
Rams gear we put a video on snapchat
even the guys at the office have drawn a
picture of me and that's that's how they
see me so yes I am beyond excited for
football back in LA I love do you thank
you guys for asking questions keep them
firing away will try and do more of
these as questions start coming in
anything you guys want to know I'm
pretty much open book personal or
company or tech just leave in the
comments send me a tweet hit me up on
snapchat Instagram whatever I have a lot
of ways you can get a hold of me the
