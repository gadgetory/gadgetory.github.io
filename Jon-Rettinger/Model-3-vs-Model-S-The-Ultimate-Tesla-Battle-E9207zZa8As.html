TechnoBuffalo usually it's on like a
much smaller pocketable scale but behind
me we have the biggest verses we have
ever done literally and figuratively
we've got a Tesla Model 3 and it's big
brother the Tesla Model S there's about
$28,000 separating the entry level
points from these cars and that's a lot
of money that's another car price value
difference you get a lot with the Model
S you're getting a ton with the Model 3
so we're gonna walk you through the
differences between the two and figure
out the twenty eight thousand bucks is
better left in your pocket or put it
towards a big brother
so before we start let me clarify a few
things about the Model 3 a lot of people
think of it as the $35,000 Tesla and
someday conceivably it will be but as it
exists right now in the early days of
the Model 3 shipping you could only get
it optioned up with bigger battery and a
ton of interior options that we'll talk
about so the lowest price you can get a
Model 3 4 is $48,000 it doesn't have
things like autopilot built in the one
we have behind us has every option box
checked and comes in at fifty eight
thousand dollars so as you evaluate the
model three you can look at it from the
lower end at thirty five to the high end
at 58 it's gonna go even higher when the
dual motor version hits sometime in the
next few months so a huge spread on the
model three it definitely changes a
value proposition of the car so let's
start with how you get in to the cars
Tesla's always done door handles
differently with the Model S they popped
out you kind of did a handshake with it
and you opened it it's different here to
model three these are kind of
Lamborghini Huracan esque type doors you
push in and then you pull out it's a
cool novel way to open the door without
having any extra wind resistance with
handles that actually protrude out but
no one to get into the car that's where
things kind of get interesting Tesla is
totally done with is the traditional key
that they have with the Model S and even
with the Model X instead you're gonna
use your phone it's gonna create the
Bluetooth could
it's gonna sort of handshake off to let
it know that this is indeed you it'll
open the car when you walk away and that
connection gets broken it's going to
lock the car your phone essentially
becomes the key if you don't have your
phone with you and you want to give your
car to valet you've got a card and it
looks and feels exactly like a credit
card it's really thin that is your key
and you come up to the car and you tap
it on the pillar and the car unlocks and
you sort of place it gently behind the
cupholders and that lets the car know
that you are indeed authorized to drive
it and off you go it's been weird having
that so the car we have is not ours
actually the folks at Errol and I stuff
to let us borrow the model three for a
few days so you couldn't pair it to a
phone so I've been using that key card
it's weird and it doesn't work through a
wallet presumably though you don't have
to worry about that have to use your
phone the card is neat and if you lose
it it's gonna be way less expensive to
replace than getting a new key but
that's not the only place that the doors
here are different instead of normal
handles you push a button that
electronically opens the door of course
there's another spot underneath there's
a real handle in case power is dead in
your car but it's weird ways to get in
and out of this car so the biggest fear
a lot of people have with V's range
anxiety like running out of juice both
these cars have 75 kilowatt hour battery
pack so of course the model 3 weighs way
less you're gonna get more range Tesla
advertised 310 miles of range versus
about 259 on the Model S but that's
assuming a hundred percent charge which
really shouldn't do with electric cars
and Tesla really doesn't want you to do
that every day so when I took the model
3 and fed it to about the 80 85 % they
recommend I had a real-world range of
275 miles which is pretty impressive it
definitely gets you anywhere you want to
go and of course you could always plug
it in at night it'll charge it about 20
to 25 miles per hour on a regular 240
outlet and you can charge it a
supercharger but with the model 3 you're
gonna have to pay for it but you can
charge up to 200 miles per hour almost
so at about 30 to 40 minutes you can
have your car pretty much filled up
depending on how open this tells our
next few super charging is free with the
Model S if you've never driven an
electric vehicle the torque on these
things is crazy I always get the analogy
think of it like an electric drill as
soon as you pull that trigger that bit
is spinning at max
same thing is true with the tires here
so 2 0 30 and 0 to 60 sprint feels crazy
fast the model throughs didn't get to 60
and a little bit over 5 seconds and then
the model asked despite being a bigger a
heavier car it's gonna do it about a
second even better at a little over 4
seconds so incredibly fast and a zero to
30 it could pretty much beat almost
anything in either of these cars this is
really was impressed with the model 3 I
drove a Model S for three years I know
how fast a car can feel I also know how
big the car can feel this felt like a
small sports car behind the wheel of the
model 3 I loved the performance even
though it's technically slower on paper
it felt faster for making the drivers
eat any Model S you can configure right
now in the beginning of 2018 it's gonna
have the air suspension that's gonna
mean you could set the car to raise and
lower but you're gonna make getting in
and out pretty easy to do the model 3
doesn't have air suspension it's a coil
suspension and the car is really low to
the ground and then the seats are low
inside of the car making the
ingress/egress
which I guess is fancy for in and out
kinda hard to do I'm not I'm not super
old but it was hard to get in and out of
the car but I will say once you're in
the model 3 the seats are crazy
comfortable the Model S seats
I never thought were the best this is
entirely new redesigned seat and it
feels really good to sit in the driver
seat and the passenger seat and speaking
of seats there's still plenty of room in
the back in my normal seating position
and I'm like five nine ish there was
plenty of room in the back for
passengers to sit and I have two kids so
my concern was well then I like to put
car seats in the back you can definitely
fit two car seats on either side in a
booster seat in the middle but it is
definitely going to be tight our model 3
is an earlier bill that's been like
1,100 sarn't that many on the road in
fact you may never see a model 3 to even
know how big the car is so to give you
some sort of comparison it's about a
hundred and eighty five inches and just
so you know the 3-series that you can
see pretty much everywhere is 182 inches
so it's just slightly bigger than a BMW
3-series whereas a Model S is pretty
decently larger 12 inches at 196 inches
and where you're going to feel that
difference in size first of all comes
from storage the Model S is a hatchback
and the model three has a trunk the mile
s has double
storage space it's 15 cubic feet versus
30 cubic feet and that is a huge
difference I wish to model three had the
hatchback I loved it when I had a Model
S but the opening for the trunk is
pretty big and the trunk is still pretty
big as well the front though is is super
small it's like barely four like an
attache case or like a laptop back in it
so don't plan on putting much in the
trunk up front the standard wheels on
the Model S are 19 inches so not the
biggest tires it's a much smoother ride
on the 18 inch wheels on the model 3 in
this case we have the arrow ribs that
improve aerodynamics it is a much
harsher ride when it harken back to
3-series analogy it feels like a BMW
suspension your feeling every bump in
the road it's not bad it's more of a
sporty feel if you want kind of the
luxury feel then the S is gonna be a
better option if you want that sporty or
sort of bumpy or type feel on the road
mouth food's gonna be pretty solid
choice so I think everybody who's seen a
Model 3 in person or seen pictures or
watched videos had the exact same
thought when you see that 15 inch
touchscreen that protrudes out from the
middle that looks damn distracting and I
was actually pretty impressed at how not
distracting it was or at least less
distracting than I thought when you're
just driving normal looking straight
ahead it doesn't really bother you it's
definitely in your periphery but it's
not like you're looking and averting
your eyes that much often times not
looking at my speedometer but any
information you want is gonna be on that
15 inch screen and it can be distracting
in certain situations for example auto
pilot the only way to control your speed
or car length is to use that touchscreen
so you guys take your eyes off the road
and beyond the distraction just of
averting your eyes there's a big
reflection issue too and I was kind of
going into sunlight there was light
reflecting off the screen into my eyes
it's also a fingerprint magnet as well
and this happened to two different
people outside a passenger seat as they
got out of their car both of their knees
bumped that 15 inch screen it's mounted
really securely there's no give as you
touch it but the more people that hit it
I mean perhaps it could come loose and
also a difference between the two cars
we talk about those in - screens so
the main one in the Model S is 17 inches
it has of course the normal - you get in
most cars but the one on the model 3 is
incredibly more responsive than what you
have in the Model S and also in the
Model X it's just quicker it's smoother
I would even bet it's even higher res
but I can't quantify that it just works
better the UI though and learning how to
do everything on the Model 3 has a big
learning curve that's coming from
somebody who drove an S and now drive an
X I know Tesla's UI and I took me a
while to figure out how to do certain
things so be prepared for a pretty big
learning curve when it comes to the
Model 3 also super cool that I wish the
S had the air vents if you look at the
car it's got one continuous vents going
all the way across and even control that
vent of course for that 15 inch
touchscreen we can also split the air
and have it go anywhere you want that's
awesome that's cool new technology that
I wish the Model S would have an example
of how I think the ass is kind of
starting to feel outdated I sometimes
sort of the really intuitive and cool
design that have gone into the model 3
autopilot on most cars is pretty much
identical experience a few exceptions
how you turn it on and I don't know why
Tesla did this on the Model S and acts
as a separate stock on the left that you
just press down twice it engages auto
pilot on the model 3 you got to use the
same gear shifter that used to go into
drive and neutral and reverse you press
it down twice and that's going to engage
autopilot once you're in the experience
is the same it is not self-driving
though don't think any Tesla's self
driver gets off in an accident well the
Mallis first came out it was the most
futuristic looking car I had ever seen
when I got mine and I sat in it I looked
at that 17 inch touchscreen I felt like
I was driving the future and since that
first Model S came out doing design
change that we've seen exterior wise is
the nosecone is gone and you've got sort
of a more integrated sleeker looking
front rather than that the car is pretty
much the same it seems got a way to say
it but compared to the model 3 the S is
starting to look a little bit dated
obviously that's totally subjective but
looking at the price point of the Model
S you don't want a car that's gonna look
dated in fact it kind of being out done
and
tech areas by its little brother that's
that's a way less expensive Tesla's
known for a few things I think push the
envelope on technology and also build
quality issues on their earlier cars
that they ship the S had issues been a
first ship the ex had a tiny issues when
it first ship and the model three is no
exception
again our thing here is like eleven
hundred there on about two thousand now
but there are some fit and finish issues
that you don't expect from a car at
least ones options up to be almost sixty
thousand dollars there are some door
panels that are misaligned there's some
chrome it's not aligned properly there
are some pieces by the speaker that I
don't know why they're there the speaker
grille themselves look like it's 3d
printed there's some really cheap
plastics all around the issues that a
plague test with early builds are
definitely here with the model three but
is not impacting the drive and it's not
impacting the performance but when you
are driving a big gap between the two is
road noise since it's an electric car
you there's no engine you hear a little
electric whir but there's way better
noise dampening in the S than there is
in the three you hear a lot of wind as
you go whooshing the 60 in in the model
three some other cool interior stuff
that the model three has that the S
doesn't it's got a really easy dock up
front to put your iPhone or a USBC phone
so the big question though is which one
is better it's obviously gonna come down
to your use for me I've got two kids
maybe the idea of a third one somewhere
down the road I don't think I could live
with the model three I Drive my kids to
school I could put car seats in the back
but it felt too small for me to drive
that's like coming from a larger SUV if
you don't have kids and you want a small
fast car
save your money you're not getting that
much difference with the Model S if you
want to spend that starting price about
seventy six thousand dollars for and
evey you might want to consider waiting
for an update to the Model S coming at
some point the my life still is a real
soft spot in my heart but Tesla
definitely cannibalizing themselves by
how awesome the model 3 is so what'd you
guys think if you've got the money to
spend which car are you going for and
why even the comments down below and
again a big special thank you to tarou

my rents any car you want including a
model three fully to them down below let
us know what you guys think if you like
