from TechnoBuffalo and today we're going
to take a look at hyperlapse from
instagram which was just released today
for ios hyperlapse essentially allows
you to create high quality time last
videos right from your iOS device so
let's jump in the video and see what the
apps all about and the great thing about
hyperlapse is that you don't really need
to sign up for an Instagram or Facebook
account to use it you can just start
filming immediately and just be on your
way the whole interface is really simple
which I really like you can tap to focus
and properly expose your shot before you
film and there's only one button on here
and that's your record button as you
record your video the app will show you
how many seconds you recorded and how
that translate into a hyperlapse time
the default speed is at 6 times though
you can go as high as 12 times or as low
as 1 times if you want and once your
video is recorded it's automatically
saved to your camera roll and if you're
not satisfied with what you just film
you can choose to edit it later or
simply just delete the hyperlapse so you
just shot you can also choose to share
what you just recorded on Instagram or
Facebook we did notice that the app does
struggle when exposing on the fly so
that's definitely something the note
overall it's a little different from the
time-lapse we're used to seeing on an
Internet since the app automatically
stabilizes your footage you can record
while walking running jumping or
whatever you want to do it'll try and
stabilize the footage for you and turn
your videos into a cinematic time-lapse
now when comparing the hyperlapse app to
iOS 8 time-lapse feature you can
definitely tell there's a difference
between the two the hyperlapse app
stabilizes the footage really well and
having the option to choose your speed
is a really nice addition iOS 8 is built
in time-lapse features basic and you
don't really have any options to tweak
anything and that's about it
the app is pretty basic it doesn't
record sound and the footage isn't the
highest quality but it does produce some
really neat results which can easily be
shared with your friends and family it
would be cool if in the future multiple
hyperlapse could be stitched together
but right now the app only lets you
share it one at a time unfortunately
hyperlapse is only available for iOS
users and we don't know whether
instagram is planning on releasing it
for android in the future anyways that's
it for this video guys be sure to
download the app and let us know what
you think of hyperlapse
and as always a Marklin Sangam from
TechnoBuffalo i'll see you
in the next video thank you guys for
