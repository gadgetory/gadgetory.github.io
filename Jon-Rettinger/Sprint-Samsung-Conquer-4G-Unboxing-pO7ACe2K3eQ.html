taped upside down sticking off the edge
of my samsung conquer 4G for Sprint box
she doesn't know but I do find out after
the break
what's going on everybody I'm Noah from
TechnoBuffalo and this is the sprint
samsung conquer 4G a sub 100 sub $100
Android phone with features that not so
long ago would have been top-of-the-line
dual cameras 4G speeds Android 2.3
Gingerbread lot going on in this phone
one gigahertz processor Qualcomm
Snapdragon I'm not going on you upside
down business card it's courtesy of my
friend at Sprint PR who loaned us the
conquer 4G for this unboxing in the
subsequent review I wanted to keep the
card here so we'd know whose property
the phone was want to turn upside down
so as not to expose either her personal
information or her lousy taste in
college sports teams now I'm just giving
you a hard time you know who you are if
you're watching and I love you
really though your your I understand
it's your alma mater and stuff but
really those guys now not this season
conquer 4G from sprint samsung $99
online and now it's through sprint with
a two-year contract launches August 21st
there's launched RT but available August
21st and again you know the whole idea
that the commodification of high-end
phones and what Android is done in
competition and everything I mean
amazing a 4G foam with dual cameras 400
bucks on contract and again you know I
see this all the time it's not the
upfront price to get you it's those
monthly fees but still great to see the
you know high-end features at low in
prices the batteries out here yet in the
box you get the phone itself you get all
these goodies from Sprint and Samsung
and all that stuff
better get a recycling envelope you do
please recycle your old phones all your
old electronics dispose of them properly
don't throw them in the garbage don't
throw them in the landfill they give
them to somebody else who can use them
resell them trade them in or recycle
them properly don't just throw me the
landfill I guess the battery must be in
the phone already hopefully there's some
juice in it you also get
your microUSB to USB cable and then your
USB based modular adapter for charging
and then a micro SD card is inserted in
the handset here's your micro SD adapter
make it a little easier to manage your
media files looks like we don't have oh
yeah there we go turn on augh it's very
lightweight device 4.1 ounces officially
feels very light in the hand it's a 3.5
inch display you can see the SP HD 600
from Samsung Mobile still waiting on his
Galaxy S 2 is to hit the US end of this
month August 29 at the big event New
York City I believe will be there
checking the Buffalo we'll be covering
it live so far as I know stay tuned for
that also
stay tuned overtook the Buffalo
back-to-school giveaways shooting this
on Monday August 15th we start a bunch
of back-to-school content today with a
bunch of giveaways lined up for the next
four weeks very excited about some
really cool stuff we're giving away so
check that out for sure free to enter
free to win but you have to get lucky
anyway
the phone itself it's got a three and a
half inch screen 320 by 480 you've got a
1 gigahertz processor to the Qualcomm
Snapdragon Android 2.3 2.3 Gingerbread
its 3G 4G Wi-Fi you've got on the front
a 1.3 megapixel camera for video calls
other good stuff on the back 3.2
megapixel camera with LED flash and
video recording
I got micro SD card slot with a 2 gig 2
gigabyte card free installed
pre-installed sorry I got distracted by
free what visual voicemail trial to me
work gigabyte card installed 32 gigs of
memory it supports say one I'm having
trouble with certain syllables gigabyte
Android gigabyte Android I can do it
1500 milliamp hour battery the phone
itself
you've got your touch screen like I said
the front-facing camera on the bottom
four hard buttons not capacitive touch
buttons on these but hard buttons which
first coolest capacitive touch buttons
are the hard buttons a little safer you
know an accidentally pocket dial or you
know pocket press on them which some
people prefer I've got the Sprint ID
logo down there this phone supports
Sprint I
supports his one word for it I suppose
on the side this folk chrome banding
here the black and silver motif you've
got one shortcut button taking me to the
camera I would think so yes
there's the camera take a picture it
lasts longer let's go front camera click
a front camera there I am hi everybody
my name is Noah a professional
technology reviewer so there's your
front facing camera on the other side
you've got your rocker switch for volume
and such things straight off millimeter
headphone jack your lock power switch on
the bottom your microUSB port is on the
bottom your microphone sensor and there
you go really really lightweight this
thing we just slide her into your pocket
got it you know it's not the most
luxurious feeling phone and apparently
the the the touchscreen very sensitive
but you know a little grippy plastic on
the back little textured you know it
feels like a commodity but like a
high-end commodity if that makes any
sense
not the luxurious feel but you know for
a commodified kind of mid-range low
price phone it doesn't feel too bad
let's see special applications aka
bloatware you've got the Sprint ID stuff
sprint hotspot you can use this as a
hotspot device sprint mobile wallet
let's go quickly some reason I'm only in
3 G's coverage here and I believe I have
4G last time I tried to use a phone in
this very location I had 4G let's turn
that on please
turn around so the big news this week
it's only Monday big news so far Google
buying Motorola Mobility the divide the
deal has to be approved and maybe an
antitrust inquiry and all that kind of
stuff but Google buying Motorola the
very intramural mobility the Motorola
split off into two divisions while back
around the first of the year I believe
so be very interesting to see what
happens with Android and partners like
Samsung well Google is said that Andhra
is going to remain open but you would
have to think that they would give first
priority to the company that they own
right that you know they would have to
give the nod to Motorola / Samsung and
HTC and Sony Ericsson and everybody else
when it comes to everything from updates
- you know preference helping them write
drivers for their phones - maybe even
the Nexus line so I don't know be
interesting to see how that works out
got swipe pre-installed here go to the
voice search no sure why not
really what I want to do though is I
want to yep
TechnoBuffalo right all right all right
and there's the post for the
back-to-school giveaways hype these too
hard but you know seller ometer kick
into action there you go it's an Android
phone but it's got Gingerbread it's got
4G gets got dual cameras and it's 99
bucks on contract through Sprint when it
launches so I'd imagine through some of
the other third-party retailers online
you'll see it even cheaper good stuff
I'm sprint and Samsung macaca 4G if
you're in the market for a phone with
you know big specs but you don't
necessarily need dual-core or gorilla
glass or you know aluminum carbonate
poly magnesium you know shell body
construction 5000 you want a phone
that's relatively inexpensive but big on
features conquer 4G look much much more
on this device including a review and
all the new devices including the expert
the sprint expert from Motorola just
unbox a little while ago and of course
whatever happens with the whole motor
role at Google deal all that stuff
things are heating up it's mid-august
it's exactly mid-august right now I have
girth Nou Leos from here on out kids
it's going to get a subbers just going
to heat up if you get closer to Labor
Day and then on into the fall and early
winter season as far as new products are
concerned so enjoy these last couple
weeks of summer and then buckle up be a
crazy ride we got you covered on
TechnoBuffalo till next time my name is
