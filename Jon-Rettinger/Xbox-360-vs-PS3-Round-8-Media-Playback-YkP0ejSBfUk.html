the square is once again tied up in the
later round we'll be comparing the
gaming performance but before we get to
that in this round we'll be taking an
in-depth look at the media playback
features so once again hold on to your
hats and get ready for some heavyweight
game console action
it's LP from TechnoBuffalo and welcome
to the next installment of the console
in this round I'm going to try to cover
all the essentials relating to the media
playback properties from supported video
formats to media server streaming and
media center features and ok for the
past 7 rounds it's really been the pink
elephant in the room and there's
probably about a thousand comments about
this in this series of videos
what about blu-ray and let's get to that
first as you guys probably know blu-ray
and HD DVD duked it out a couple of
years ago and the defeat of HD DVD meant
for the standardization of a single high
definition media the Xbox 360 HD DVD
add-on sold initially for a ridiculous
180 bucks
but anyways I'm not going to be digging
up a dead format for this comparison so
you can consider HD DVD gone and
forgotten I've seen and read a lot of
comments saying
who needs blu-ray when upscale DVDs are
just as good well this ain't exactly
true the truth is if you have a decent
1080p TV set bigger than 32 inches the
difference is significant even compared
to the best upscale DVDs upscaling is a
process that mathematically matches the
pixel count of the DVD signal to the
physical pixel count of your TV rather
than just stretching the pixel aspect
ratio the signal is recalculated to suit
the native resolution of your TV set
which results in a nice and clear signal
that adds to the resolution artificially
so the amount of pixels in the source
content is not magically transformed
into HD it's only the signal but I do
admit some upscale deviants look great
but the majority of DVDs look nothing
like HD especially if you're watching on
a TV set larger than 40 inches to brush
up on the basics of high-definition most
of your DVDs are in 480p or 576p to make
an example your ntsc dvds usually have a
resolution of 720 by 480 pixels the
resolution is the same for your old 4 by
3 aspect ratio TV meaning that the
pixels are stretched and resized to
achieve widescreen now with
high-definition 1080p content the
resolution is 1920 by 1080 pixels which
is the exact same pixel aspect ratio of
your full HD TV set now this means that
there's no scaling no stretching and
every store pixel on the media will be
displayed natively at your TV set while
standard definition DVDs have
350,000 pixels a blu-ray with a 1080 B
signal has over 2 million pixels which
is exactly 6 times the amount you find
on your standard definition 480p DVD not
only the sharpness improved in 6 times
the resolution every pixel as the
possibility of more colors and shades of
grey translating into more color depth
the amount of colors on the media cannot
even be produced on your average LCD TV
but if you've had the opportunity of
seeing a blu-ray playing on an old
screen you've probably seen his
potential thankfully sony was kind
enough to send me a 40-inch prototype
oled screen for this particular review
so I know what I'm talking about ok that
was a blatant lie I wish they did though
picture quality is one thing but motion
processing is another this can get a bit
tricky so put on your smart caps most
theatrical movie releases have a frame
rate of 24 frames per second which is
directly incompatible with your standard
TV with a refresh rate of 50 or 60 Hertz
the frame rate of the video source has
to match or has to be equally divided
with the refresh rate of your TV so up
until recently the native frame rate of
film has needed to be converted for
video to suit the refresh rates of old
TVs to make an example for ntsc dvds 24
frames per second content is converted
to 30 frames per second with a process
called 3 by 2 pulldown where an
individual film frame is converted to 2
&amp;amp; 3 alternating fields a video that runs
sequentially and it results in an
unnatural jittering in the motion so if
you're watching a DVD or blu-ray for
that matter off a TV that only supports
50 or 60 Hertz it will have some slight
jittering in the motion this is even
more noticeable on high-definition
content but blu-ray brings an excellent
solution to the issue that has plagued
video content since the days of Betamax
blu-ray as native 24 frames per second
support for newer TV sets that are
capable of 24 Hertz playback 24 frames
per second playback offers the
unadulterated constant motion of film
but before you run off and buy a TV with
a 24 Hertz support I recommend getting a
TV that supports a multiple of 24 Hertz
because of the different technology 24
Hertz on a TV set can flicker a bit so
what you want to do is get the highest
multiple of 24 as possible if your
wallet can handle it get yourself a TV
capable of 120 Hertz playback the signal
will be convert
in a process called 5x5 Caiden's where
every individual film frame has shown
five times which results in near-perfect
motion so if you still have the smarts
to say upscale devious are just as good
as blu-ray I'm going to personally come
down and whip your ass I'm kidding of
course you truly need to be a keen-eyed
video file to take notice of these
issues but once you do there's no going
back
blu-ray is also the obvious choice for
audio files as well
it comes with support for the high
definition audio formats although
currently the amplifiers capable of
these formats are more expensive than
the ps3 itself and what benefits does
blu-ray bring to gaming as I mentioned
in the GPU around the extra space
equates less need for compression of
textures and other content so a game
like Final Fantasy 13 will be on a
single blu-ray while on the Xbox 360 it
will require four DVDs so no need for
swapping discs on ps3 anyways it's quite
clear that Sony has the edge on disc
media format with jewelry even if the
PSP would lose the current console war
Sony is still won a war which will echo
well beyond the current generation of
game consoles much like the install base
of ps2 helped the DVD succeed the
install base of the ps3 has already
established blu-ray as the standard
format of high-definition content it's
been up to debate what the digital
distribution will compete with blu-ray
my personal opinion is that while
digital distribution will become
increasingly popular for renting movies
I don't see myself filling up my hard
drives with HD content I currently own
about 800 DVDs and about 50 blu-rays and
I'm not looking to buy ten terabytes of
storage to replace my physical disks
it's not gonna happen I enjoy having a
physical disk I enjoy the cover art and
I even joy the box it comes in I guess
it's that new plastic smell knows both
the ps3 and xbox 360 have movie rating
services that work great but because the
content is streamed from online the
movies are compressed to quite an extent
and you can notice some compression
issues in high action scenes but I'm
guessing the average consumer is willing
to pay the same money for the slightly
compressed content me I'll probably
physically walk a couple of blocks to
rent a blu-ray which I can get for the
same price as the streamed and
compressed high-definition
tonight we'll never forget but as I
mentioned I have about 800 DVDs and I
have no intention of replacing them with
blu-ray discs so decent upscaling is a
benefit both systems of scalers capable
of upscaling to 1080p and I can say the
both systems do an excellent job but the
ps3 takes the slight edge here as well
with better detail and color separation
that sets it apart from the DVD
upscaling on the Xbox 360 the one media
format personally for me that the game
consoles have replaced our CDs these
days I mostly play my music off my ps3
it's just so easy and fast and here's
where the ps3 is simply put excellent
it's a miracle-worker when it comes to
ripping CDs it can rip even copy
protected CDs with amazing speed it only
takes a couple of minutes to rip an
entire CD and you can even choose the
preferred format and bitrate CD ripping
is also possible in the Xbox 360 but it
pales in comparison against the speed
and features of the ps3 from the
standpoint of functionality accessing
media content on the ps3 is extremely
fast and this was one of the reasons why
ps3 took around 6 it sometimes just
takes too much time to get the content
on the Xbox 360
I also have to give the ps3 a small
complement for music visualizations
which are subtle and easy on the eyes
which I can't say about the Xbox 360s
almost epilepsy inducing graphics but a
major benefit to the Xbox 360s music
playback is the fact that you can play
music in game every game the ps3 and
xbox360 can both be considered media
center devices you can store and watch
content from your device's hard drive
but since the hard drives on the devices
are quite limited it's possible to
extend your digital media library and
stream content for example off your PC I
personally use Nero media home with my
ps3 and Windows Media Center with my
Xbox 360 streaming content using Nero is
pretty straightforward when your media
server is enabled on your PC an icon
will appear automatically on the ps3 and
you can access the content using the ps3
zone interface I use this feature a lot
and it works mostly without a hitch
you give me an explanation as to why the
media center functionalities of the ps3
are very good the xbox360 has a major
benefit which is this as you can see the
Xbox 360 supports the full Windows Media
Center experience and it works great
with Windows 7 the interface is slick
stable and it overall works great
navigation wise it's almost perfect both
the Xbox 360 and ps3 are capable media
streaming devices but the Xbox 360 may
have the slight edge with the slick and
streamlined media center application
media center capabilities go
hand-in-hand with format support and
thankfully the ps3 and xbox360 both have
extensive format support both systems
can handle h.264 and FX and the most
common formats but it seemed that the PS
we can handle the formats a bit faster
when playing back some formats there's a
subtle lag when rewinding on the Xbox
360 slightly disappointing with both
systems is the fact that files with MKV
wrappers are not supported DivX an X
video probably the most common format
you can find online but when you
download content from online avoid using
illegal torrents because if you do do
what you want cause a pirate is free you
are a pirate you're being a pirate is
allegedly do what you want cause a
pirate is free you are a pirate and
that's all I have to say about that if
you are the type to store pictures on
your console the ps3 offers interesting
ways of looking at your snapshots here's
some shots I took with my cell phone the
other day and as you can see there's
some very cool ways of looking at your
pictures on the ps3 you can look at
pictures on your Xbox 360 but it's not
as elegant and interface as on a ps3
if you haven't been living under a rock
you've probably heard about 3d coming to
game consoles at CES 2010 pretty much
every TV manufacturer launch or
announced their new TV models with 3d
support the ps3 is backed up by Nvidia a
company which already came out with 3d
vision technology about a year ago I'm
not sure if the ps3 will use this
existing technology but in relation to
media playback blu-ray gives a major
benefit to 3d as blu-ray 3d will become
the standard format for 3d movies and
the ps3 supports this out of the box
so the PS we may have a slight head
start on 3d but some I have a feeling
that by the time 3d hits the mass-market
there will be a PlayStation 4 and there
will be an Xbox 720 not to mention the
Nintendo Wii 3d but
the ps3 is more future-proof when it
comes to media playback this installment
is coming to an end and there's probably
no surprises who takes this round the
media center capabilities of the Xbox
360 are excellent it makes up for some
shortcomings in functionality and speed
of use but as an overall media playback
device the ps3 takes the Xbox from 60
mostly thanks to you guessed it blu-ray
the Xbox 360 has good DVD upscaling but
of course there's really no competition
in video playback the PSP supports more
formats and has better overall media
playback functionality the ps3 is up one
point and in the next round we'll be
comparing the best looking
multi-platform games on both consoles
stay tuned for the next installment of
the console wars I'll be signing out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
