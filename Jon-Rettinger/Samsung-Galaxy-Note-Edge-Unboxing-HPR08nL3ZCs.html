TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing for you
of the latest from Samsung
this is the Galaxy Note edge it's got a
few tricks up its sleeve it's a close
cousin of the Galaxy Note 4 say for a
rounded edge on the side which use the
secondary screen I'm really excited to
take a look at this and see if it's just
a gimmick or actually provide some
utility go and get started so here's the
box for the Galaxy Note edge gone is the
fake wood we've seen on previous
generations this is the T mobile
versions going to be coming to Sprint
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and Verizon got a bit of
an e hidden on their Samsung Galaxy Note
edge specs on the back but you're not
here to read here for me to tell you
what's inside the box with them specs
are so let's go ahead and pull this
sleeve off we've got kind of a mirror
image right there US is sent from us
sent to us rather from our friends at
Samsung I'm really excited to see this
Todd eagleton had a couple times had the
opportunity have his hands on it with it
but I have not let's go ahead and pop
this off dramatically I was you could
just feel the drama and here is the
Samsung Galaxy Note edge and there is
what its namesake is that is the edge
feels really nice in the hand I push it
off to the side real fast I will come
back to you a promise my sweet edge baby
she's also going to have inside of the
box
we've got welcome Start Guide
merchandise return label some t-mobile
Terms &amp;amp; Conditions we've got a Samsung
wall wart with us be adaptive fast
charging so that's nice up new there
we've got a white charging and sync
cable
we've got words wonder what this thing
is this is actually to remove the tip of
the s-pen as well some extra s-pen tips
and some headphones with inline
microphone and different size your Jeff
gives you got giant or baby ears but
this sweet thing is why we are here it's
go ahead and pull this off oh that was a
pretty satisfying whooshing noise let me
go ahead and try and find the power
button on the right-hand side it's not
going to be there it lives on top
go ahead and boot this guy up here and
run through all the specs on the Galaxy
Note edge all right we got the sucker
all booted up and look dad's got a
screen on the side it's 160 pixels but
before I just start talking about that
crazy thing going on let me run through
all the specs of this guy right here so
this main screen is a 5.6 inch screen
the resolution of 2560 by 1440 if you
can have a good memory or do quick math
that's a 525 PPI it also makes it point
1 inches smaller than its close cousin
the Galaxy Note 4 we'll do a quick
comparison with that at the end of the
video it is a quad HD screen it's Super
AMOLED so colors look really bright the
galaxy note 4 screen I think is one of
the best screens that I've seen in
recent history so I assume it's going to
look as good here Android 4.4 it
launched power and this guy is a 2.7
gigahertz quad-core processor it's got
pretty much every spec you could think
of including three gigs of ram 32 gigs
of internal storage but of course you
can just go ahead and expand that with
external 128 gigs on the back you have
camera that is a 16 megapixel camera it
also has smart optical and stabilization
you can do 4k video also has a camera on
the front which lives right there the
2.7 megapixel camera I can do 90 degree
selfies or if you want to get a whole
bunch of friends at 120 degree wide
selfies 3000 milliamp hour battery here
with fast charging all the latest
Wireless stuff you'd expect a total 11
ABG and AC with 2x2 MIMO so it should be
really really fast
all right but enough about the specs
let's just talk about this crazy screen
on the side here so you can set it up a
lot of different ways and how opened up
API is do a lot of different things here
so maybe I'll just turn it a little bit
to get a better angle so you can see
what this thing does so it is a curved
screen which is really neat so you can
use it just like icon shortcuts and you
can sort of jump in two different things
want to jump into messaging I'd go ahead
and tap it just like I had an icon on my
home screen opens it up right there
nothing sort of revolutionary I guess
from the icon segment but you can do a
lot of other stuff with it if you swipe
from this way you can see sort of
different options that you've got set up
Samsung's got some predetermined ones
for you you can go ahead and keep
swiping
you've got some weathers and t-mobile
stuff and tech messages to go ahead and
swipe down from the top you can jump
into some kind of cool stuff here so
let's say you want to see how big
something is hey go ahead and make that
a ruler let's say you want to set it as
a stopwatch and go ahead and do that I
can do all kinds of cool little things
here with it Sam some kind of built
right in I think it's really neat when
my favorite show is probably alarm
functionality can use it just as an
alarm clock and just have that part on
at night it's pretty neat if you swipe
up the other direction that's how you're
going to get access to these settings
you go ahead and hit that little gear
icon this is where you can see what it's
going to show is your edge screens you
can manage your panels do all kinds of
other stuff right here including that
cool night clock mode I mentioned it's
going to rotate hundred eighty degrees
let's go into the other panels are going
to have available to us and there are
quite a bit of them so you can see
you've got some from music you've got
some for stocks you've got some for
social media some for sports probably
but I would use it for and a few other
options here as well and hopefully more
will be coming and you can still
download more as well from Samsung if
you choose to so a lot of things you can
do here with that screen I'm not sure
yet of it's going to be sort of useful
or just kind of a cool novelty to have I
will say though while the curved screen
is very cool you have to make a few
sacrifices to have sort of that nice
novelty first you do not have the power
but on the right hand side it now lives
on top which is kind of hard to reach
are they 5.6 inch screen also make
holding it a bit awkward you might
accidentally hit or touch when those
icons are start scrolling so you got to
be a little bit more aware of that as
you use the device let's do a sort of
rest of the tour here you've got that
one main home button down at the bottom
you've got a back button and you've got
your multitasking button living right
there case you want to jump into that on
the left hand side you're going to have
your volume rocker and that is going to
be about it on top that's where your
power button is going to live through
per five millimeter headset jack you've
got some microphones on there as well on
the bottom that's where your charging
port live as well as the s-pen the back
is of course your moveable it's that
same sort of soft touch almost fake
leather that we've seen on the note 4
which I really liked
has definitely a premium look to it I
kind of dig what the top looks like with
that cool angle
I give Samsung a ton of credit for
trying something new here
whether you want this or don't want this
sort of they've left it up to you it's
not something that you want the offer
the Galaxy Note 4 it's almost identical
device safe for that screen but they're
trying something new and I really have
to sort of applaud Samsung for trying to
bring new technology to the market I'm
sure it'll get more useful as we get
sort of more and more in depth with it
and as developers get their hands on the
devices but it's something neat and it's
something new and something we haven't
seen before so again I think Samsung
should be applauded for doing that the
rest of stuff is pretty standard we've
seen it's almost exactly the same on the
Galaxy Note 4 but of course we will put
this guy there a full battery of tests
mostly just checking that side little
screen so I do want to do a real quick
size comparison with the Galaxy Note 4
these two are very closely related say
4.1 inches smaller and 160 pixel science
green speck for speck almost identical
see what they look like side-by-side in
case you wanted to cross shop when you
go ahead and stack them we look at sort
of the left side of both devices very
similar story there on each on the right
hand side though things a little bit
different don't have a power and lock
button here on the edge but you have 160
pixel screen on the top power and lock
but on the edge turn they look almost
identical same thickness that we've got
on both the case you want to figure out
which device is ready for you go to the
store it's going to be available on all
four major US carriers pick one up and
see if you can pick the right one and
that is going to be for you till next
time I'm John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo
