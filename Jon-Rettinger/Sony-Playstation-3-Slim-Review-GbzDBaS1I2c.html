TechnoBuffalo here with a review for you
on the ps3 slim if you want to see what
this looks like
check out my comparison video when I put
the slim up against well I guess the fat
ps3 so you can see the difference in the
size the ports and where things are
located but asked a few questions via
Twitter and email but I really want to
make sure I address in this review the
first issue is the noise the ps3 slim is
very very very quiet the ps3 the
original wasn't terribly loud this
version is noticeably quieter when the
blu-ray spins you hardly hear anything
when you first put a disc in it's almost
silent it is a very very quiet machine
the next question I've been asked quite
a bit is heaps I know the ps2 slim had a
lot of heat issue there's overheating
and there were some problems the ps3
slim does not have any of those heat
issues I let it run for nine hours
straight just I put a MU blu-ray movie
in I let it go I put a game in and I
just let it play and I did not have any
heat issues there seems to be extra
venting in the back to help pull sort of
off away those heat problems that made
to be other slim consoles I've had so if
that was one of your concerns and one of
the things holding you back don't worry
if you like the ps3 and you like the
operating system and you like being able
to play blu-ray movies and being able to
play some great games in high-definition
you're gonna like the ps3 slim it does
exactly the same thing just in a smaller
package what you might not like though
is the design it's been very polarizing
people are either saying it looks cheap
they don't like to be matte finish that
Sony put on it they don't like the fact
it doesn't say playstation they miss the
touch buttons you know there are a lot
of things that people can go one way or
another around InDesign personally I'm a
minimalist I like the smaller design
even from an engineering standpoint I'm
impressed that Sony was able to really
put everything that the ps3 has to such
a small package so well I like the piano
black a glossy finish of 4b fatiah
version better I prefer the slim version
just for well most from its that an
engineering and a design standpoint but
both are gonna work both have hard
drives that are easily swappable you can
get a size match
either of them feature for feature
they're exactly the same if you take out
the launch 60 gigabyte version that had
the cart readers and the four USB ports
what you're not gonna get with the ps3
slim is backwards compatibility you're
not going to get any backwards
compatibility unfortunately with
Playstation 2 titles the initial launch
console the 60 gigabyte leave a $600 pad
the backwards compatibility that was the
only place Asian 3 that had that so
there's no emulation no hardware support
you're not going to be able to
PlayStation play PlayStation 2 games one
thing that's also missing actually from
the PlayStation slim that actually all
the FATA consoles had is the ability to
install third-party operating systems
used to be able to install Linux and
actually and use it like a computer
since it's certainly as powerful as one
but that's gone with the PlayStation 3
slim graphic to be added via some sort
of software update I don't know but
right now it's not there that was
something you were looking to do
definitely keep in mind that you're not
gonna be able to do that on the slim
console you're also not gonna have a
power switch in the back but that
shouldn't bother you since the
PlayStation slim uses I think 1/3 less
power than the fatty version but if
power switch is important to you then
the fatty one is the way to go the
operating system looks just the same the
games perform just the same the blu-ray
discs load just as fast really it's
almost exactly the same thing in just a
smaller package so should you get the
slim over the fat while actually gonna
come to you it's probably going to be
from a pure aesthetic standpoint if you
want the bigger hard drive you know it's
nice to have 120 that's already in there
but you know like I said it's easily
swappable it doesn't board your warranty
go ahead and put a new hardware you have
not any problem this isn't really an
Xbox vs PlayStation 3 debate but I will
say that the PlayStation 3 is 100% price
drop makes it a very very appealing
console especially now for $300 you're
getting the ability to play some great
games in high definition you're getting
probably one of the best blu-ray players
out there that's firmware upgradeable if
you know Sony is gonna keep offering
support for it well into this probably
the next decade and you're also getting
really entertainment
it's not stealing DVD player does quite
a lot of things so you're getting a lot
of value into one package they'll be
something to keep in mind if you're on
the fence about the PlayStation anyways
I hope you guys in joyed are you gonna
get the PlayStation 3 slim do you like
the slim version or the fat you know
what is your take on the PlayStation 3
slim leave some comments or video
