TechnoBuffalo here I've got a full
review for you of Amazon's first foray
into the world of phones this is the
fire phone is it worth your smart phone
by and Buck is gonna set the world
aflame to go ahead and find out does I
do with all of my phone reviews in any
review we do I want to give a disclaimer
first I know I'm sunburned it happens I
use the device for two weeks of 18t in
Southern California Brandon did the
written portion use advice for a week
and if we're way more detailed things
I'm going to talk about including
gallery and a lot more on the camera
definitely their written portion of you
would put the link to right down below
I'm gonna break this video up into two
different parts but I like what I don't
like it and give it a final score but
before we get to that part I think this
phone needs introduction which not many
phones do so this is Amazon's first
foray into the smartphone world they've
long offered apps for mobile devices and
of course their own line of fire branded
tablets the fire phone though takes a
familiar Android based UI of those
tablets and tweaks it for a phone just
because it's the Android handset though
does not mean you can get access to the
Google Play Store or majority of people
services instead you'll be given
Amazon's own app marketplace which is
definitely a pretty growing platform the
big story though has to do with the four
corner based cameras that are just
figuring you straight in the face they
help make up what Amazon calls an ik
perspective and it's something actually
explained without seeing it in person
but if 3d content brought pictures out
of this screen tenant perspective
actually brings the content inside of
the phone think of it like this if you
stick your head inside a picture frame
when you look around be able to see
things that are past the borders if you
hadn't do that here with the phone you
could see things that ordinarily would
be you know stopped at the border of the
phone and here is why Amazon Peaks might
be interested in a fire phone a purpose
of the fire phone includes a handful of
kind of nice perks including a free year
of prime which is a limited time offer
just in case you're wondering about
without that and when you should buy it
also offers made a customer video
support which is awesome and a feature
called Firefly which we'll talk more
about and these are all features that no
other phone offers love them or hate
them no other phone cuts are bring that
to you and based on the fire phones
heftier price which is 200 bucks on
contract errors included to help serve
easy initial shock
of the higher asking price you don't get
the latest possible specs they do get
some kind of cool services that are sort
of thrown in as extras that's the count
for something I suppose so at that out
of the weight let's jump into the likes
one of the main features Amazon is
really pounding their chests and touting
is Firefly
so despite a chunk of its core
functionality already being built into
Amazon apps on Android iOS it's an idea
that in an ideal world takes with every
point the camera at either tells you
what it is gives you a chance to buy it
or in the case of phone numbers and
email addresses the chance to search
store them so you can take a business
card and somebody get the phone number
you know just write into your phone and
our testing no we found it's actually
not all it's cracked up to be though
we're looking forward to Amazon
producing tons of software improvements
that they promised to help improve the
experience down the road its way one
cable though of recognizing text on
business cards and websites not having
to type the address actually in which is
super nice it also does a really good
job of pinpointing the song you're
listening to and picking out the TV
shows and movies that you're watching so
works kind of as advertised but it's not
so great however on physical objects in
the video we did sort a lot more
thorough that explains the feature or
link Oh that'll be down below as well it
got products wrong or otherwise didn't
even bring the product up at all we even
tried to Firefly the fire TV and it
didn't bring up anything which was a big
deal for the things though like Mario
Kart 8 Firefly worked just fine but the
feature needs a lot of fixing and
updates before Amazon truly gets it to
where it wants to be if they have
promise they're gonna bring a lot more
to it right now it sort of works well
but as well as it could I add it into
the likes category think it's got a lot
of attention though it's really cool to
see a work in the UI is absolutely
gorgeous
so I debated a lot where to put the
Adamic perspective in this review it's a
really cool feature and adds a whole new
dimension when playing games or dying
take advantage of it but outside of that
Danelle 2 wears off super fast I kept
looking for way to even turn it off it's
in the like part of the review though
because despite initial bias before I
use the device it doesn't detract an
experience at all doesn't always add but
unlike 3d I found it kind of Pleasant
and excited a few aims not to do with it
aside from making maps look kind of cool
adding some tweaks to games battery life
on the 24 hundred million power battery
was actually put in surprise I wasn't
expecting much despite all of processing
it's gotta be going on behind the scenes
but get their perspective work and a lot
of people are not gonna for the design
but I'm kind of ambivalent to it
although Brandon totally feels otherwise
any funnier thoughts link down below
it looks like the lovechild of the Nexus
4
on iphone 4 which are both good-looking
devices but I also get that it's harder
and harder to stand out in designer
worlds we're just sort of making
different versions of rectangles despite
my initial concerns in my first
impressions video actually likes getting
to know a brand new OS aren't that many
chances I get to do that I use an
Android phone I know what is gonna look
like I use an iOS phone know how it's
gonna be things might look real differ
in the settings but the overall
experience is pretty much the same so I
kind of relish out between learnt
something totally new it I don't know
how to change brightness let's go find
it I don't know how to multitask let's
go find it that was really kind of cool
to do and if you're like phone's like I
do you might kind of expect that same
experience as well the 13 megapixel
camera
Rud on the back was also pretty good
pictures came out nice colors were
accurate represented how it was supposed
to look and also looks pretty good in
low-light want to see more than on the
camera and galleries all that kind of
stuff
see Brandon's review links hit me down
below again lastly and this is kind of a
silly thing I really liked the spaceman
lockscreen I like seeing him jump around
and sort of flying the antigravity and
then the alien come and grab him I don't
know why I kind of found myself staring
at it they're just really cool moves on
this nice job with that kind of little
small thing you might not notice and now
onto the dislikes you might just want to
grab some popcorn
cos well fun to learn admittedly is
incredibly unintuitive wondering the
silk browser for example there are two
panels one that can be swiped in from
the left might be swiped in from the
right when you're in the browser though
you have no idea whatsoever what these
layers are even they're switching or
flicking in from the right and bring up
some relevant links to the site you're
actually on flip again from the left
will show you your most visited sites
the book smart save pages and other kind
of similar options there and the phone
app though only a pain can be swiped in
from the right which shows you your VIPs
it's just terribly inconsistent across
the OS doesn't seem to be any rhyme or
reason to Amazon made these decisions in
the first place the chances of knowing
what a pained even exists but a lone
Lang what's gonna do unless you figure
out by trial and error it's really the
only way to do it in the camera app
where you think these layers would exist
from where settings and options is
mostly barren and empty you actually
bring up the settings menu by pressing
the little cog icon which then shows you
different camera modes the thing here is
things that should be easy to do on a
phone just aren't like trying to find
the time for example you have to tilt
the phone to see just looking right at
the phone you can't see
timer battery life remaining it's really
annoying I could go on and on here but I
think you probably get the point don't
mistake though all these OS quirks for
not being capable it's a big thing to
remember it does everything you wanted
to do it's not even a bad phone the
point though is that just on as good as
what else is out there in a world of LG
g3 is galaxy s5 HTC One m8 and iPhone 5s
is this thing doesn't even hold a candle
gets a six point five on the
TechnoBuffalo scale hopefully Amazon is
gonna bring all the features they
promised to the fire phone but they're
just not here yet and there are a lot of
better options out there should you be
really engulfed in the Amazon ecosystem
and you want everything that the fire
phone has to offer you lots of the
capable device just be aware you're
gonna have to go through some
frustrations and a lot of growing pains
well guys what do you think do you agree
disagree I want to hear your thoughts on
the fire phone are you gonna pick one up
have you tried it in the store whether
you get one or not definitely try one
when you go to AT&amp;amp;T store it's kind of
cool today my perspective actually work
want to hear your thoughts if you'd use
it not use it leave all the comments to
write down below so next time I am John
