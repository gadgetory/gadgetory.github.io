to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a marketing sanghun from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's video we'll
be showing you guys what's new in the
Android wear 5.1 update at the time of
making this video the LG watch urbane is
the only device with Android wear 5.1
but the update should be rolling out in
the next few weeks to other Android wear
devices Android wear has always been a
great companion to your Android
smartphone but ain't road where five
point one brings that to another level
adding a few new features designed to
make users less reliant on the phone in
their pocket one of the new features
here is the addition of Wi-Fi this means
that even when your watch is out of
Bluetooth range you can still
communicate with your SmartWatch via
Wi-Fi the only caveat is that not all
Android wear devices using the
Snapdragon 400 processor have a Wi-Fi
antennas so don't expect the original G
watch or the Susan watch to receive this
feature the Moto 360 on the other hand
despite being based on a TI OMAP 3 chip
which doesn't have a built-in Wi-Fi chip
will still get Wi-Fi because Motorola
added one separately
smart move Motorola smart move another
feature that was introduced in Android
wear 5.1 is the addition of emojis for
example you receive a text message you
can either use your voice to reply
similar to previous versions of Android
wear or draw a single emoji to reply
back if you want to be able to mix words
and emojis together you'll still need to
rely on your phone to do so drawing on a
tiny screen can be a bit troublesome but
Android wear there's a pretty good job
of recognizing my horrible drawings and
converting into an actual emoji it's fun
and reminds me a bit of what you can do
on the Apple watch this update also
brings new gesture controls so you can
simply flick it a risk to scroll through
different cards on your home screen I
think it's a nice addition although I
don't know how often I'll be flicking my
wrist back and forth to go through my
notification cards it's much easier to
just scroll and navigate the
old-fashioned way and that's what a
finger swiping down from the top of the
watch brings a new look to Android wear
you'll be able to toggle the three
different notification profiles for your
watch and phone toggle theater mode
enable brightness boosts and access the
settings swiping left from the watch
face will bring up your apps that are
installed on your watch another swipe to
the left will pull up your favorite
contacts and another swipe to the left
will pull up Google now and a list of
different actions you can activate using
Google now another new feature in
Android wear 5.1 is ambient mode which
essentially phase the screens to you
black and whites you
preserve battery life there's not a huge
number of apps that offer this function
just yet but among the ones that do work
like Google keep seem to work really
well hopefully in the coming months
we'll see more apps receive this feature
as it'll help a ton saving battery life
Google also added the ability to set up
a lock screen in Android wear to help
protect your watch when you're not
around setting it up is fairly easy you
can set up a lock screen pattern to
unlock your device just as you would on
your phone the lock screen feature
activates automatically once you take
the watch off your wrist and it's an
even better utility to have on while
your watch is charging out of plain
sight so friends or family can't snoop
around while you're away let me stop the
video real fast and thank our friends

TechnoBuffalo it's all one word in caps
at domain coms check out Android wear
5.1 is a big upgrade for Android wear
the new features like Wi-Fi support and
ambient mode are features that further
grow the platform who wouldn't want to
say battery life on a device that could
only last one whole day also the ability
to use the watch via Wi-Fi is a neat
addition to I don't always have my phone
on me and Bluetooth connection isn't as
great as Wi-Fi so the ability to use the
watch using just Wi-Fi is great one
thing I do want to see is iOS support
for Android wear Google i/o is creeping
up at the end of May so hopefully you
will see a big announcement there
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
