to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone
John wrench from TechnoBuffalo here I've
got in my hand two seeming oxymoron this
is the jumbo shrimp of phones this is
the nokia X which is a Nokia phone
running Android got the dual SIM variant
right here really excited take a look at
this sort of a entry level type phone at
a low price but offers a lot of features
so go ahead open it up and take a first
look so here is the box for the Nokia X
it's teeny it's tiny as is the phone
itself all kinds of specs written on it
but we don't need to worry about that
cuz I will tell you all about them so
don't judge this phone by the super
phones backstage you see ones in the
galaxy s5 of the world this is under 200
bucks off contract you can probably find
it for about a hundred and twenty
depending on where you look so it offers
a lot and sort of a teeny tiny little
package and it's running Android which
seems crazy to me so pull that one off I
have not a chance to see this phone yet
or even check out what Nokia skinned
version of Android looks like so out of
the box you have support for Google Play
but it's Android you could side load the
suckers on pretty easily here is the
phone it feels like the Lumia device
it's got that sort of nice plastic built
toilet this feels certainly a little bit
on the ha lower side than perhaps we've
seen with other Lumia phones push up to
the side for a quick second and so you'd
also were going to have inside of the
box we've got a cardboard thing got some
nokia X things and language I can't
understand we've got a pair of
headphones with the inline mic on it and
they are red we've got a charger which
connects to microUSB and we've got a
battery so that's probably why I felt
Hollow because the better was in there
I'm used to Nokia I'm just doing
built-in batteries let's go ahead and
pop the battery into this guy and turn
on the phone so the old back just comes
off we got two SIM card slots here which
is really cool it also it's gonna give
you two dialers on there so if you're
traveling internationally you want one
local and one your regular SIM it's kind
of a nice option I've really had a
chance to check out that many dual SIM
type devices so I'm really excited to
take a look at this guy
I will go ahead and pop in the battery
to
fifteen hundred million power battery
and then I'll turn it on and I'll walk
you through all the specs plastic just
goes right back on and I will assume
that it probably doesn't feel as hollow
as I originally thought and it doesn't
actually feels way better so that's why
this is a live unboxing and first
impressions we'll go ahead and power it
on I'll do a quick tour of the device on
the right hand side you've got your
volume up and down you got your power
lock button you could see it so we're
turning on right there nothing on the
left hand side charging in sync port on
the bottom top there is your headphone
jack and we've got a camera on the back
which is two megapixel but you'll notice
what it's missing is a camera on the
front so it's a 4-inch display right
here which means it's 800 by 480 it's
got a 233 PPI
and there's no Kia's familiar ringtone
it's an IPS LCD in case you're wondering
being powered by a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon dual-core processor 512
megabytes to ram and 4 gigs of storage
sort of AC would say modern specs for
early 2013 4 gigs of storage in side of
it does have external storage options
though microSD up to 32 gigabytes no NFC
here at all unfortunately but you know
kind of when you expect well go ahead
and go continue and go through the whole
setup process and see what it looks like
alright so we got this guy all powered
on let me pull off the plastic here and
get that whooshing noise hopefully that
I love boom there we go so you've got
one button here you don't know sort of
the three typical Android buttons wants
to give this folder a name but I don't
want to give that folder name it will
forever remain a nameless so it looks
sort of similar to Windows Phone you got
kind of a tile esque interface you just
keep scrolling down you can see where
all your apps you're going to live you
don't have sort of an app tray you can
pull down and get so a quick view of
your settings right there and I think
that you can also scroll up to get some
information it's kind of standard stuff
here let's take a quick look we've got
two sim on top so you can see what
obviously both always gonna look like
you'll have to dialers to drilling if
you put in both sims let's see what the
camera UI looks like here I'm super
exploring this for the first time it
looks very typical Nokia's to have a
quick picture but the box and frame
feel auto focus for us
and snap yes so that could be Ansel
Adams with this guy but it does seem to
work if we wanna arrange things we can
drag them around and you see that
they're all sort of ranged and tiles and
looks very familiar to Windows Phone
although it's funny as you move it you
can see there's a trail
it's kind of hard time keeping up with
what I'm doing so that's something I've
never seen before that's definitely a
thing that happened if we go ahead and
hold it down you can resize it if you
want exactly like you can on a Windows
Phone in fact the arrows I look exactly
the same if you hold it out again you
get two icons here you can select one
you can search choose a widget if you
want so you can see what's here at least
built in instead his Android base you
can have those widgets in fact that one
looks like it was apes directly out of
Android including a sort of the font
color there as well the other one will
just put it inside of a folder go ahead
and go home it will say it's kind of
frustrating a bit annoying to navigate
Android with just a single home button
but it's there if you hold it down you
don't get anything if you double tap it
there you go tapping ones are go to
let's go in the fast lane nothing's
gonna happen though if you're gonna
double tap this thing go ahead and jump
at the setting see what that looks like
here this looks like very typical
Android which is very still strange to
see on a Nokia device to go into a bat
phone we are running I don't get Telus
version of Android already nokia
software platform 1.0 so are you sure
which version of Android this thing is
based on a very interesting phone
looking forward taking a look at it and
putting it through a bit more of spaces
and seeing how it performs it's weird a
hybrid of Android and Windows Phone it's
like a low-cost Franken phone but I like
to hear your thoughts if you guys think
it's worthwhile not worthwhile you know
something you'd ever pick up why'd you
pick it up I can see why travelers and I
want this but leave your comments right
down below but you know worlds are very
crowded Android phones and a lot of good
low-cost Android options not sure why
this would be the right one to get if
you pull down you can also do a search I
discovered so that's kind of neat let me
take a quick second to think
our friends over all good people at
Dollar Shave Club look this face clearly
I hate shaving it's mostly because
buying razors kind of blows you got to
go to the store you got a gas the
manager
with the zits for the key to a plastic
razor thing then you got to shell out
just crazy buck for some asinine shave
tech that you probably don't need my
razor
honestly worked fine before it got a
vibrating hands on a laser pointer a
little Lucy does love laser pointer
razors but fortunately though there is a
company that's doing away with all of
that silliness and getting down to what
matters for really just a few bucks a
month Dollar Shave Club ships pretty
awesome quality razors and other
bathroom goodies right to your door and
their blades are just as good as other
big shape companies at a fraction of the
price which is good on your wallet
and your face they've got things like
dr. Carver's easy shave butter to make
your shave even more buttery smooth

got a try one wipe Charlies the new
pepper mint infused wipes for men listen

it feeling all fresh smiley shave time
