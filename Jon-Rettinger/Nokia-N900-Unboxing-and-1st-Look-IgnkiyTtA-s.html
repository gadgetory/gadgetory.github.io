LP here from TechnoBuffalo and welcome
back for another very exciting unboxing
and review this time around we'll be
taking an in-depth look at Nokia's new n
series device n900 we're going to be
looking at the hardware and software and
I'm also going to be putting the n900
through some tests and benchmarks we'll
be taking a look at how the device
handles multitasking and different video
codecs we're especially going to be
focusing on the new Miami 5 operating
system which is the first experience for
any mobile device and a first for myself
as well but before we get into the
review let's check out what's bundled in
with the device nokia always includes a
nice set of accessories and it seems
that they've not made an exception with
the n900 inside the box we find your
standard safe operation manuals a
proprietary USB sync cable with the
microUSB end and surprise surprise we
find the Nokia charger this time with a
micro USB connector there's also an
adapter for the old power cable as well
the device comes with a 1320 milliamp
battery we also find a nice set of inner
earbuds which have been excellent and as
a nice extra we find the TV out cable
and that's about it for the accessories
there might have been something else in
the box but unfortunately this device
has gone through another review before
me so I'll never know what he pocketed
but if I later find out that there's
been a microfiber cloth in box I'm going
to hunt this guy down or not but let's
get to the device itself so here it is
the n900 has a very familiar but
distinct look to it it has an all black
finish and it reminds me of the n86
which was a very cool device from last
year the n900 packs a 3.5 inch
touchscreen that's based on resistive
technology meaning it registers on
physical pressure it is pretty strange
that Nokia didn't go with a capacitive
screen on the n900 as they've already
come out with a device with a capacitive
screen but I'm a fan of the old
resistive screen so it doesn't bother me
but it's quite evident that capacitive
screens that register on thermal and
infrared signals are the future the n900
has a definite presence in the hand and
I have to admit it feels a bit chubby
it's even fatter than the touch pro2
which is a bulky phone on its own accord
it's not the heaviest phone
and in my hands but it's definitely not
a featherweight and why the phone is fat
and heavy I'm pretty sure this is the
reason the n900 has a three row QWERTY
keyboard that pops out with a bang the
mechanism itself is very solid but it
leaves very little space for the actual
keys there's only three rows of keys so
no dedicated row of keys for the numbers
which is a slight disappointment
luckily the keys do have a nice feel to
them they're nice and raised and
pressing the keys has a nice feedback so
it is a nice keypad but I would have
liked to seem some more space between
the keys and the edges because with fat
thumbs like mine it all feels a bit
cramped especially the topper which is a
bit too close to the edge of the screen
on the back of the device we find the 5
megapixel camera with the carl zeiss
lens and dual LED flash and the device
is an extremely useful lens cover which
activates a camera when opened there's
also a stand mechanism if you want to
use your 600 bucks device as a picture
frame the back cover comes off nicely
and under the cover you find a thirteen
hundred and twenty milliamp battery
beside the camera lens we find the
microSD slot and under the battery you
find the slot for the SIM card build
quality of the n900 is okay the frame
supporting the slide-out mechanism is
made out of metal aside from that the
whole device is made out of plastic it's
not as well built as the hd2 I reviewed
last week but I would say that the build
quality is pretty much similar to the
touch pro2 so I'd say build quality is
sufficient the Nokia n900 is a device
designed specifically for landscape mode
use so this is actually the top of the
device where you find the power button
beside the power button we find al
volume up and down rocker and a
dedicated button for the camera on the
left hand side of the device we find the
micro USB jack and a stereo speaker on
the right-hand side of the device we
find the other half of the stereo
speaker and a slider switch that works
as a locking mechanism for the device we
also find a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and as you can see there's also a
built-in stylus which was missing from
the n97 so as you notice the front of
the device has no mechanical buttons
which gives it a nice streamlined look
inside the device we find an ARM Cortex
processor which
actually the same CPU found on the
iphone 3gs the processor is clocked at
600 megahertz and the device has 256
megabytes of RAM and it also uses 768
megabytes of virtual memory the n900
comes packin with a whopping 32
gigabytes of storage which puts my 8
gigabyte microSD card to shame ok let's
fire up the device and check out the
Maya interface
there's my pin code if you want to steal
my phone and if you watch my Nokia n97
review you might remember that I wasn't
too impressed with the old and outdated
Symbian operating system and it was
pretty obvious that it was time for a
change so this is the mom of five
desktop and as you can see you start
with an entirely clean slate it's
actually just not a single pane you have
up to four separate desktops and each
desktop is fully customizable on the top
of the screen you find the clock and the
applications tab which are fixed to
every pane
tapping on the upper edge of the screen
gives you access to the desktop settings
from where you can add shortcuts
contacts web bookmarks and widgets to
your desktop you can also change the
amount of desktop so you can for example
have just two panes to keep it simple
you can also adjust the theme and
desktop wallpaper and let's add some
stuff to the desktop I'm more of a
Twitter guide than the Facebook guy but
let's add a Facebook widget you can move
the widgets anywhere on the screen and
on any of the four panes you can for
example have social network links and
widgets on one pane and contacts on
another it's simple enough but I have to
mention that the shortcuts are a bit
small for dragging around with your
finger I sometimes ended up holding the
shortcuts accidentally if you have fat
fingers like mine here you're going to
need the stylus but overall customizing
the desktops is made very simple and the
mom of five I think has a very short
learning curve it's fundamentally a very
simple interface but it's also very
versatile and there's endless
possibilities of customization the
interface has many similarities to the
Android interface which shares the same
Linux platform a very important thing to
note about the n900 is the fact that
it's a landscape only device meaning
there's no portrait mode for the device
so if you rotate the device into a
vertical position don't expect the
screen to rotate and scale to portrait
mode but if you are insistent on using
the phone vertically you can have the
device
vertically in your hand and rotate your
head about 90 degrees but I don't
recommend it
luckily while the interface itself does
not rotate there are some programs like
the phone application that does rotate
to portrait mode and helps with the
usability as a mobile device but if you
want to use the phone for anything other
than calling you're going to have to use
two hands to do it it definitely takes
some time to get used to but once you
get the hang of it it's not too bad the
resistive screen on the n900 is quite
responsive I'd say about the same as on
the n97 not quite as responsive as on
the newest generation of HTC devices but
sufficient the 600 megahertz ARM Cortex
processor handles interface with
impressive speed the n900 is much faster
than the Nokia n97 swiping between panes
is super fast there's no loading time
and no delay and it's almost as fast as
your fingers the screen on the device is
very sharp and the colors are vivid but
I would have liked to seen an AMOLED
screen on this device like on the Nokia
n8 e6 which had amazing colors in
contrast overall my first impression of
the device are quite good the interface
feels solid and I'm very satisfied by
the speed of the device itself I'm not
too happy about the lack of single hand
usability but I'll be going deeper into
the interface and testing out the
hardware and software in the second half
of the review LP signing out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
