technobuffalo here apple just unveiled
the super super well rumored iphone 5
scene i want to share sure my first
thoughts on it not gonna call first
impression tix i don't have it in my
hand but just like you guys i like to
talk about something got an ounce so
let's talk about stuff recap all aspects
in case you missed it if you want to see
a full recap on everything at Apple
announced put a link down below to that
video so it's going to be available in
green yellow blue pink and white the
design has no seems part lines or joints
at all which is kind of cool they got
these crazy cases look like connect four
on the back oh it's kind of awesome the
cases were designed to be totally around
the camera and flash you can still see
the color kind that shines through so
you can mix and match and get crazy
bright colors it's made of hard-coated
polycarbonate make sense it's plastic
inside this barrel totally new
construction method that uses reinforced
steel so mind you the specs it's got a
4-inch Retina Display integrated touch
full srgb widescreen video being powered
by this a iphone 5s a6 got 8 megapixel
camera with an eye sight hybrid IR
filter and five-element lens it's got a
new FaceTime HD camera takes you to
better low-light pictures which is kind
of nice 1.9 micron pixel size got LTE
802 11 a/b/g/n n all the colors are
available in 16 gig for 99 2 30 to 4 1
onion I know the two-year deal which is
kind of Awesome those cases are 29 bucks
the phones are arsenic-free mercury-free
and android freezeapple like to tell us
so what is this guy going to cost
unsubsidized t-mobile is going to sell
it at 549 bucks which is just a hundy
less than the 5s so where does this guy
slot it's going to be the budget phone
549 bucks does not necessarily strike me
as a budget phone even a hundred dollar
phone if you want to get it on contract
a lower version this theory strike me as
budget either I'm not sure where this
phone slots in the lineup for one
hundred dollars more you get the way
more powerful 5s the 64-bit processor at
the a7 chip the m74 motion graphics and
all kinds of other cool awesomeness and
fingerprint scanning business I'm not
sure who's going to buy
the 5c so I get the argument that it's
going to be maybe for developing
countries targeting maybe at teenagers
or parents who want to add another line
to their film don't want to spend that
much money i canna printer standing I
capri she ate that I'm sure they're
going to sell a bajillion of them but I
have a hard time seeing the value when
the price discrepancy between the higher
end model is just so little now you can
express yourself with the colors they
got crazy bright ones and you can mix
and match two cases and let your
personality shine through with your
colored phone but essentially what
you're getting is an iphone 5 with a
plastic back which you certainly can now
buy a used iphone 5 now they'd probably
got a ton of stock on a ton for sale
from guessing way less than 549 asking
price that t-mobile and I'm sure apples
gonna be selling it for the same price
unsubsidized so I just got hard time
wrapping my head around it it was going
to be free he was going to be 300 maybe
even 400 off contract I could get it I
can appreciate it i could say okay I
know how this phone is targeted it's
going to go to developing countries at
549 bucks that is a tough draw apples
gonna have to either take a huge hit on
each phone and try and make it up with
apps that they want to make a cheaper in
developing countries and that's gonna
piss off people in the US or other
countries we were selling it for five
hundred fifty bucks it's just a hard
thing for me to understand so having
that put aside the phone looks really
nice I much like the rest of the world I
have him a chance to see the back case
looked like and feel it on it feels
really nice the phones got substantial
heft to it I think it's going to be a
probably a pretty big success I'm not
taking anything away from the design it
looks really really nice i like the
bright colors I liked sir that no steam
approach it's gotta rent in this but I
didn't sacrifice any other display stuff
that Apple has been really good at I
just don't understand who would buy it
or why so let me know leaving the
comments down below tell me why you
think the 5 c's a good thing to have
existing or tell me why I'm way off base
when I think the 5s the best one to get
because honestly I'm kind of curious and
just like you I just want to talk about
it anyway thank you guys for watching
