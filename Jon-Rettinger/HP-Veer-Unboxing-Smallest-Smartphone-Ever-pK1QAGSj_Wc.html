from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of one of these smallest smartphones on
the planet this is the HP veer let's go
ahead dig in and see if it deserves a
tiny little spot in your pocket alright
so this is going to be coming to AT&amp;amp;T on
May 15th for just about 99 bucks here is
the Box gone to the palm branding we've
seen on previous webOS devices this is
the first actual release of a webOS
device under the HP regime it's part of
their small medium and large campaign
with the small being the veer the medium
being the upcoming pre 3 and the large
of course being a touch pad so we've got
a different looking box than we've seen
on previous HP and pom devices go ahead
and slide that off there's a bit of a
sticker down here well pull that let's
go ahead and open it up it looks very
similar to other boxes that we've seen
for HP and pong products lease on the
inside got some protection on the front
welcome to AT&amp;amp;T Quick Start Guide all
that business here is the veer itself
this is one of those phones that is so
tight you actually have to see it in
person it's available in white or black
of course this is the white model it's
sort of a panda color with the black
screen and the white in the back push it
off to the side for just a minute I do
want to dig into the box before I get
into the phone because this guy's so
small it actually doesn't have a
charging port so I want to show you how
the charging happens we saw this for the
first time back in February at the touch
pad event go ahead and open this up and
get in there and here are all the
accessories and I believe this is
touch-tone compatible as well so if
you've got an older palm device you can
use it with your conductive charging so
here is the charger if you go ahead and
see on the side it doesn't have a micro
USB ports got that weird sort of thing
on the side due to its size it was too
small to include so it's actually
magnetic go ahead and sort of put it in
here there it'll snap into place and you
can plug this in just something to keep
in mind kind of
what else you're going to get in the box
is a wall charger and I have no idea
what this is tiny little black something
let's go ahead and see what we got oh it
looks like a cover and a adapter if you
want to use that same port rocking out
for charging for a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack again dude the phone size
apparently that couldn't be included so
if you want to listen to your music
you're gonna need this a little adapter
would have had no idea what that was
we're also gonna get the little palm
wall charger there okay so enough of
that let's go ahead and talk about the
phone and see what specs this little guy
brings to the table because it does pack
a pretty big punch while I'm talking I
will power it on and believe that's the
power button look in the upper right
hand corner there we go so HP logo so
let's talk about it it's got a 2.6 inch
diagonal screen at the resolution of 320
by 404 a dimension standpoint it is 54
millimeters by 88 millimeters by 15.1
millimeters very very very thin it's
being powered by an 800 megahertz
Snapdragon processor so despite its
small size it actually should be a
pretty quick device it's got support for
18 T's HSPA+ network I can use it as a
Wi-Fi hotspot for up to five devices on
the back you've got a five megapixel
camera
right next to the speaker grille it's
got a 910 milliamp power battery which
is gonna be good for about five hours of
3d you talk time or 300 hours of standby
time so let's take a quick look at the
device on the left hand side a volume
rocker up and down on the top got your
power and lock button a little bit of a
lanyard switch right there as well the
logos are blinking on me there is that
sort of multi-purpose magnetic port that
you can use for charging or a 3.5
millimeter headset jack adapter we just
saw microphones on the bottom on the
back there's that camera that white HP
backing you can get that in black as
well with the AT&amp;amp;T logo and if you want
to input text you've got to slide this
guy up and you've got a full QWERTY
keyboard when I tried this guy
the HP event the keyboard was a little
bit hard to type on there is a rail on
the side I feels like that rail has been
reworked since we first saw the
prototype so if we were gonna have a bit
of an easier typing experience I have
I guess relatively large hands so I'm
not so sure this is going to be the
easiest phone in the world but I will be
open-minded and see if it's going to
work while the phone of this stature
might not be the most ideal for me I
love that it exists out there because
people are looking for a small device
they don't need a dual-core powerhouse
they just want to check email and maybe
get on the web and not have a lot of
bulk in their pocket now this is going
to be a very nice choice so we got some
terms of editions here let me do a size
comparison because you're not gonna be
able to see how small this guy really is
in the video so first let me just put it
in my hand just so you can see how tiny
that really is let me bring in another
phone in eighteenth he's lineup let me
bring in the just-released infuse this
is a 4.5 inch phone you can see just how
small this guy really is I mean just
absolutely tiny if we bring in another
phone to check out here's an iPhone 4
again you can see how small the veer is
let's compare the veer to its webOS
friend here is the pre 2 which is by no
means a big device but you can
definitely see the size difference here
as well
really really small so pull this out the
keyboard you guys can compare the sizes
here slide this out you can see the
difference is there between the veer and
the pre - I know guys this has been a
first look and a box I can wave back to
the camera sort of a first unboxing and
first look of the webOS powered HP veer
for AT&amp;amp;T I'll put this guy through the
paces do a full test and see if it
deserves a small place in your pocket
what do you guys think about the gear
isn't interesting to you not interesting
I'll leave your comments down below
anything particular that you want to see
I'll be sure to let you know my name
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
