Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo wanting to
show you a quick look at HTC's brand new
flagship the one m9 and a size
comparison with the oneplus one which we
know a lot of you guys like we like it
it was a phone of the year last year so
fantastic device we just wanted to show
you really how they stack up to each
other it's not about specs per se in
this because they're totally different
phones different manufacturers different
models obviously oneplus ones trying to
sell this for a really affordable price
this is a lot more expensive but I'll
show you how they look next to each
other so we see oneplus one slightly
taller and we'll just go to it right
hand side really like the metal here on
the one m9 but I still like the soft
touch on the one cost waters on the
sides here you go that you see just how
large this 20 megapixel camera since
there is on the one m9 compared to the
oneplus one here which takes pretty
decent photos on the bottom you've got
the micro USB charging for both and
notice oneplus one has the speaker's
there on the bottom while their
front-facing boomsound speakers on the
one m9 so again totally different phones
but just want to show you how they stack
up next to each other here in case
you're interested in both of them and
you see you know there's a lot more
premium materials with the aluminum
unibody design here on the one m9 but
again this comes at a much lower price
point so quick look one m9 vs. the
oneplus one this is todd Hazelton and
