TechnoBuffalo and the last we left you
was on our bicycles and now nothing
really changed because we got the
majority of our filming done that day on
Monday so now I'm talking to you from
here the hotel apartment room editing in
front of my laptop so this is where I've
been spending the last lots and lots of
hours now on Monday morning we heard a
really interesting announcement from
Sony they announced the xperia x a X and
X performance these are three phones
expected three different points also
priced at three different points which
we don't know yet for sure but will
appeal to three different types of
customer and that's what I wanted to
talk about today so first off we have
the xperia x a this is going to be the
budget from this is going to be coming
in at we've heard 299 euros it's not
really we're not really sure but the
phones are gonna be coming out in summer
so we'll have a better idea of price in
the future on the front we're looking at
a five inch 720p display it's running a
mediatek processor 2 gigabytes of RAM 16
gigs of internal storage and 2300
million power battery but they say we'll
hold for up to two days so we'll test it
out and see how it does in the real
world when we get one to review on the
back we're looking at a 13 megapixel
camera on the front we're looking at an
8 megapixel camera and that's all the
specs out of the way when picking up the
phone I notice that the edges are kind
of curved I'm not sure if it's the glass
that's curving or if it's just the metal
edges like an optical illusion but
either way the XA looks fantastic and
feels fantastic I love the color scheme
it comes in and this seems to be a
fantastic phone it'll just depend on how
it performs next up on the list we have
the Xperia X this is going to be a notch
above the XA we have a 5-inch display
here as well but the resolution will
have been up to 1080p processor wise
we've also had a bump it's running a
Snapdragon 650 3 gigs of ram 32 gigs of
internal storage and also you get a
fingerprint reader on the power button
like we saw on the z5 so back to that
it's also running a little bit bigger of
a battery at 2600 and 20 milliamp hours
again promised at two full days on the
back we've seen the camera resolution
bumped up as well 223 megapixels and on
the front we're looking at a 13
megapixel now
rear-facing cameras on this and the XA
and all of Sony's phones this line
around are using what they're calling a
hybrid predictive autofocus system it's
supposed to be super super fast and
extremely precise and finally we have
the xperia x performance this is
supposed to be the highest end out of
the three it comes in as their flagship
that we think this is going to be a
replacement for the z6 so don't expect
that anytime soon it's rocking the same
five inch full HD screen so no changes
here with Gorilla Glass 4 the cameras
are the same as well with 23 megapixel
on the back and 13 megapixel on the
front but we're rocking a twenty-seven
hundred million power battery here and
the Snapdragon 820 processor so packing
some big guns one of my favorite things
with the xperia x performance was
actually the back the brushed metal
design on the back of the phone is
absolutely stunning and looks amazing
it's one of my favorite design points
I've seen on a lot of phones recently
it's very cool very appealing and very
texturally satisfying in the hand so
that's it for this video guys I just
want to do a quick overview of the new
xperia x line let me know what you guys
think in the comments below do you like
it do you not like it did you like this
