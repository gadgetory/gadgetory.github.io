TechnoBuffalo here at the four of you
for you of the latest flagship from
Samsung this is the galaxy s6 and in a
lot of ways it is a brand new step
forward for the company but is it worth
your smart phone buying buck let's go
ahead and decide so before I go in to do
the full review let me give a disclaimer
as I always do this device was used for
five and a half days on t-mobile it's a
t-mobile brand in unit most of this
review also is going to apply to the
galaxy s6 edge we've got a separate
review for that if you want to check it
out we'll link to it down below I'm
gonna end this by giving it a score and
a buy not buy recommendation plus
something we've never done before
lightning round where we just asked
answered a lot of questions you guys had
about the device and really fit into any
sections so I'm gonna hit up the big
three about the galaxy s6 right away
screen build and TouchWiz then we'll get
into the other categories there this is
hands-down the best screen I have ever
seen on a phone ever and I've tested
pretty much every phone that's come out
over the past five years so I think
that's saying a lot colours look bright
things like natural blacks are really
black it's got pretty good outside
visibility it's got good viewing angles
there's been some complaints of
overexposure but that's actually more on
touch whizzes aside I totally get qhg
now I never really did before I don't
know if it's a 2560 by 1440 screen or
just whatever wizardry Samsung's packed
inside of this thing but it looks
absolutely incredible I've been really
rough on Samsung's build for seemingly
as long as I've been reviewing phones it
seemed like they designed one device for
a few years then just built different
versions of the exact same phone
different sizes this time around though
they absolutely nailed it aluminium
edges on the side look and feel great
obviously there are some glass concerns
it is Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and
back so you know if you drop it you
could read some issues but from where
the phone feels where the phone looks
and looks and feels really nice not
although is rosy and wonderful the
gigantic galaxy s6 on the back is a
little bit much it doesn't many carrier
branding on it through at least on
t-mobile variant samsung finally has a
phone that matches the premium specs
that's got on the inside I think that's
saying a lot not a big fan of that
camera hump on the back it's really
pronounced I'll talk a little bit more
about
that in the camera section and indeed
lightning round and the bottom of the
phone also looks nice but let's just say
looks familiar so to say I've been hard
on Tetris throughout the years would be
just a gigantic gross understatement
admittedly I'm not the biggest TouchWiz
fan you can dispute the usefulness of
TouchWiz Samsung really since the galaxy
s3 has taken the software approach to
just throw everything at you and hope
that you like a few of the tweaks so you
really can't call it a skin anymore it's
almost a straight brand new carrier
version of Android and it's straight
TouchWiz through and through this
version tries so hard to break from the
tradition but can't quite give up all of
its old habits The Annoying beanies pops
and water droplets are pretty much gone
which is really really welcoming
obviously you can disable in the
settings but right out of the bat it's
nice to not have to go through and be
like stop sounding like waters falling
on my phone here another knock that I
had on TouchWiz was there was just the
ridiculous amount of Samsung Apps it's
now 40% lighter and you can disable most
unwanted app which is quite nice not
delete them though as previously has
been reported it still retains some of
the cartoonish icons but Samsung left
again mosa blowed out a theming engine
is now built right in which is a nice
touch to have of note though the theme
still work on third-party launchers at
least partly you'll see them in
notifications pull down and the setting
screen a lot of people had asked about
that so the moral here for TouchWiz it's
finally grown-up and doesn't detract
from the experience although it really
doesn't add too much either that's when
the best things I've been able to say
about TouchWiz in years I will display
know that I did run noble launch on here
through most of this review a lot of
fuss has been made about Samsung
ditching and replaceable battery if
you're the kind of user and ask yourself
this question very seriously who
actually carried a spare battery or two
you're going to be disappointed with
battery life the 2550 million power
battery is not great it's not attrocious
but not overly awesome either my normal
daily usage job getting dumped around
20% or lower my usage was relatively
light I think compared to a lot of power
users but obviously everybody usage
you're going to vary so we did a battery
drink test for you only got about six
and a half hours of screen on time when
playing HD video with no volume and
brightness set to auto a few caveats
here it does
charge though ridiculously fast I went
from 22% to almost 80% in 40 minutes
when it was plugged in a wireless
charging is also built-in with pretty
much every standard available which is a
nice touch reading a few percentages
when you have a charging pad to put it
on but if you're out and about out with
your friends and you're not near an
outlet or wireless charger you're gonna
need to probably monitor battery life
especially if you are a heavier phone
user all right let's jump into camera a
lot of you use your cameras as your only
camera when you're out and about I know
I do
it's delivers really good results
outdoors looked awesome low noise
excellent exposure and pretty stellar
image quality colors were accurate and
detail is kept even when zooming in so
yay for 16 megapixels results so were a
little bit different in low-light they
were just okay kind of warm but
definitely on the better side of what
we've tested the front-facing camera is
also pretty solid too
if you want to see galleries in more
detail get hit the link down below to go
to the full written review where facing
camera is also nice now super wide so
you can get all your friends and we want
to take that selfie no sylphy stick
required to dig and eek remain intact I
should also mention a 4k video
capability is built-in I lack an
expandable storage is also an issue for
some this one is a bit hard to overlook
at least for me then removable battery
inside never carry Google batteries
anyway I know the argument is that it's
faster without having to read a card and
all that kind of stuff well the Samsung
has always been about choice and that
choice is now taken away from you
replaced with a larger out-of-the-box
built-in memory of 32 64 128 gig
variants personally no micro SD card
doesn't really bother me but if you're
the card swapping type you need to
seriously consider if you can live
without that feature the Galaxy s6 is
also the first time we've seen the XE
nose in the US which is essentially two
quad-core processors merge together and
make it ridiculously fast octa-core
processor and it is ridiculously fast
let me reiterate this point there is no
lag at all you've got eight cores couple
of three gigabytes of RAM everything is
buttery smooth but don't lick my word
for it because I know you folks love
benchmarks in two to five point two six
two got a sixty seven thousand four
fifty five and quadrants got a thirty
six thousand eight hundred and eighty
six so pretty good scores there too
we're gonna wrap this free well for the
new segment random facts the
some things that you wanted to know the
generally fit into any category so I
like to think of this kind of a
lightning round a speaker is way better
now it's not facing on the rear in call
volume was a little bit lower than kind
of would have been used to in the past
even with the camera hump it won't
wobble on a table when put down flat
this one was a big deal for me you can
charge wirelessly even when powered off
looking at you next to six the finger
per weird unlock is now way better in
previous iterations and maybe even more
so by an over-the-air update that
t-mobile had so moral being is very
usable I will say it got noticeably
warmer specially by at the camera when
using you especially when watching
videos the screen also seems to be
relatively fingerprint-resistant I
didn't get sort of giant gross
fingerprints on it and on the back as
well but maybe because we had the white
version here kind of an odd thing to
about the OS if you had the fingerprint
sensor enabled you doesn't work the
reason you want to put in the passport
it's not a simple pin code oh yeah and I
should do a series of letters and a
number in there just a little bit
annoying so bear that in mind another
oddity get turning on in my pocket I
don't know why I did it
but it did so what is the verdict here I
evaluate all phones based on if I could
use them for two years and I can
unequivocally say I could use this and I
would happily use this phone for two
years this is a phone that not just
Android or Samsung fans we're gonna love
it's a device that everyone can love and
appreciate some of you don't need a
removable battery or SD card it gets a
very solid 9 on a techno buffalo scale
and an equally solid buy recommendation
so what do you guys think you excited
