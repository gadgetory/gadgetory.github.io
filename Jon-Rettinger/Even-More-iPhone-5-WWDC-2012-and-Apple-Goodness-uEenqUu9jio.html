brought to you by Samsung Smart TV on
this episode of ask the Buffalo it's
going to be pretty much all Apple we're
going to talk about WWDC and what we
might see the rumor mill has been
turning out some juicy iphone 5 kibbutz
I'll tell you what you can expect what
we can see from iOS 6 the next version
of Apple's mobile operating system and
what we might see from the hardware
sides whether or not it's new laptops
desktops or perhaps both and what it's
like to work at technobuffalo and work
for me this is asked to buffalo jon
rettinger let's go ahead and get started
Josh wants to ask could a leaked
hardware mean a new iPhone released this
year at WWDC or you see Apple just
showing off iOS 6 the site 9to5 mac
really broke the dam on iphone 5 rumors
and we can now see presumably what the
next iPhone 5 is going to look like
highlighted by a larger 4-inch screen
and a new sort of dual color back but
there's now an aluminum plating in the
middle with some sort of plastic or
glass on the top and the bottom plastic
glass and aluminum or aluminium
depending on where you are are all very
very very good materials for allowing
signals in and out so presumably will
have a much stronger antenna both into
the new iphone not much being mentioned
about that and hopefully we're going to
see a new redesigned iOS 6 but will it
be a dub wdc clear the prevailing line
of thought was an apple is going to keep
up with an october issue the cycle like
they started with the iphone 4s but
where there's smoke there generally
tends to be fire and these products that
were seeing look very close to build
ready the awesomely named love Alba
she's hot asks John despite the
possibility of iOS 6 adding Android like
features such as widgets what new
features do you think iOS 6 will bring
so I'm hoping that iOS 6 is going to be
a relatively complete overhaul of the
iOS interface but if it's not broken
don't fix it so a little bit unsure what
Apple's going to do what I do think we
are going to see though and not as sexy
as some might have hoped is have iOS 6
be all about the a
p is Tim Cook has said we've only just
scratched the surface of what Siri can
do like we're going to see Siri being
used for a ton I've not only core
applications but third-party
applications so you can take out your
phone and say Siri set to vibrate your
phone sets a vibrate series set to ring
go ahead set it to ring Siri turn off
Wi-Fi all kinds of core functionality
into the phone but I also think we're
going to be able to use that now across
third-party app so you hit it Siri check
me in on foursquare you know Siri add
facebook status to wish you were a
facebook phone whatever it might be the
possibilities are really endless series
very capable and I do agree with Tim
Cook I think we're just starting to see
little glimmers of what Siri can do when
when who wants to ask what it's like to
work at technobuffalo hey John what kind
of boss you consider yourself to be and
what would it be like for others to work
for you so I thought it'd be best to not
have me answer that question but to
actually let you talk to one of the
TechnoBuffalo staff members if you read
the site often you've probably read some
of his articles let's see what brandon
russell has to say greatest day of my
life was when i met john john is the
nicest boss in the world he has the body
of the situation and the face of George
Clooney he sometimes lets his employees
eat food and other times he even lets us
go outside when the sun is out the other
day he let me dig through his trash
where I found an already chewed piece of
gum he's so dedicated to his employees
that he calls us in the middle of the
night to tell us what awful to tell us
what great work we're doing day in and
day out does this look like the face of
an unhappy employee want to take a quick
minute to thank our friends in samsung
and a new lineup of Smart TVs
introducing Samsung's all new smart TV
with smart interaction technology plus
innovative ways to help you explore and
locate smart content the built-in
microphone on the smart touch remote
control voice and gesture controls face
recognition and the smart view mobile
app all provide unique ways to interact
with your TV cutting edge TV apps a new
signature services plus web browsing

performance from improved motion clarity
to faster web access in the future you
can upgrade your TV's performance and
functionality with the smart evolution
kit learn all about the features found
in the samsung smart TV at facebook.com
/ samsung TV USA alright so last
question it's all about the hardware our
Martin wants to know hey John I'm
thinking about buying a macbook pro with
apple's WWDC which does stand for a
world wide developer conference coming
you think the updates will be that much
better than the current macbook lineup
do you think I should wait or buy the
new one coming very soon it's on the
11th depending when you're watching this
it's probably just a handful of days
away wait wait a couple days presumably
we are going to see a new macs debut at
WWDC I think we're going to see new
MacBook Pros new MacBook Airs up its the
imac i talk about that in previous
videos we're going to see Ivy Bridge put
in there we're going to see retina
displays and hopefully we're going to
see new sleek designs from the macbook
pro side and hopefully a little smaller
chin on the imac so wait thinking about
buying a new apple product any product
over the next couple weeks wait until
the eleventh waiting to the 11th wait
until 11 hopefully that helps answer a
lot of the questions out there I hope
you guys enjoyed this episode of ask the
Buffalo we're back every Monday
answering your questions no matter what
they are from the world of technology
i'm jon rettinger i'll see you the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
