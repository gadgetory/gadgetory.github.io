TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the latest from Apple this is the iPhone
6s and now just a few weeks ago we've
got it here in its latest color this is
rose gold the other colors are available
set Space Gray just regular gold and
silver we've got a 64gb version
available and you should not buy 16 gigs
64 or 128 pricing ranges from 649 all
the way up to 849 as a little side fact
if you pay full price for the phone your
device will come unlocked and with all
the band support that these phones now
have it'll work on pretty much any
carrier no matter where you go so bear
that in mind I'll go ahead and use the
I'm probably gonna slice a finger open
obligatory unboxing knife I'll take a
look at this guy I was at the event
where Apple announced he's had a chance
to play with them but I'm fighting to
sort of get it in the real world and see
how they perform a lot of things are new
here aside from just a color let's go
ahead and take the top off the box and
each different color is its own color
fish on it so rose gold is got that kind
of orange guy and if you're thinking
about getting rose gold bear in mind
that it's a fancy name for for pink the
phone is photos pink it's a it's a pink
phone so if you want a pink phone then
they just just puts out a call it rose
gold push off the side for real quick
sex it also you're going to have inside
of the box
you've got your ear pods you're just
normal wall work and a lightning cable
nothing else will be exciting we've got
inside of this little booklet
I'm guessing it's going to be fingertips
iPhone 6s and to Apple stickers push all
that stuff off to the side for a quick
sec and let's take a look at the phone a
little bit heavier this time around it
weighs 5.0 4 ounces or 143 grams display
same size as last gen 4.7 inches it's
1334 by 750 for a 326 PPI I'll get the
rest the specs let's pull its plastic
off here I get my really enjoyable
whooshing noise it was less enjoyable
and spin recent years
quasi enjoyable there and here we have
the rose gold so let's go and power it
on and walk you through everything else
that's here power this guy is a new a 9
sixty four-bit with m9 motion
coprocessor on the front we've got a new
camera here it's a five megapixel camera
but now the whole screen serves as a
flash calling it a retina flash really
the screen just lights up the back
camera also new you can see I swear the
hands already getting marked all over it
we down 50% more pixels it's up from
eight to twelve and now it can shoot 4k
video at 30 frames per second battery is
a little bit smaller here at 1715
milliamp hour battery hours from rather
Apple says though it's not going to
affect battery life because the a9
processor is a bit more effective for
using the juice two gigs of ram in here
as well keeping this guy hopefully
scratch proof is 7000 series aluminium
an apple worked with Corning to create
the glass it's not Gorilla Glass it
worked with Corning to make it
everything else you'd expect is here 802
11 a/b/g/n with AC and Wi-Fi and all
that kind of our stuff you'd expect as
well as again every other band if your t
mobile user though you might want to
consider an upgrade since it does have
support for band 12 which really get
through walls a lot better so bear that
in mind
go ahead set up to go quick first quick
first look all right so we've got this
guy all set up on a first blush it looks
just like every other iPhone 6 that was
out there except now you can kind of
push the screen it's not going to push
back but now it's got 3d touch with
apples named for force touch so you can
sort of give a hard push they can see
different options that will show for
apples core apps presumably that will
also filter down to third-party apps and
games oh there's the phone it's pretty
much exactly the same we've seen with
the previous gen you've got your profile
switch your volume up and down got your
power on/off button or your lock button
SIM slot you've got a new and improved
touch ID button right there a pro 5
millimeter headset jack a rear firing
speakers lightning port microphone on
the back there's a 12 megapixel sensor
and it says s right there just so you
know that's the S model in the antenna
bands love them or hate them are still
adorning the top and bottom will have a
ton more coverage of the iPhone 6
asking the iPhone 6s plus coming up so
be sure to stay tuned to the channel for
all of that info will also have gallery
samples of all these phones as well so
check out TechnoBuffalo calm until next
time I am John render see you guys next
