TechnoBuffalo here we're taking a
historical look at the samsung MV 800 it
is a new point-and-shoot camera that
they have coming out very soon and I
stayed historic it's actually being
filmed at checkpoint charlie
on the border of East and West Berlin
where a lot of everybody had to go to
get through it's one of the checkpoints
they had to get into east or west berlin
or chances are to try and leave East
Berlin so it was a bit of German history
let's take a look at the camera here
samsung has been nice enough to let us
check this guy out for just a few
moments on the surface it looks like a
pretty standard point shoot as a
motorcycle is driving by but it's got a
bit of a trick to it this LED screen
pops right out or LCD I should say and
that is a capacitive screen pumps right
now so for all you Facebook lovers out
there you can go ahead and hold this up
and actually shoot a picture and you can
use that button on the back to go ahead
and shoot so you power this on for you
real quick and I'll run through some
specs on it go ahead if the power button
lens pops out and the surface looks like
a pretty standard camera menu system
however it looks a little bit smartphone
ask to go ahead and hit the home button
here you get an array of icons to sort
of see all kinds of different options
and things you can do here from a spec
standpoint set 16 megapixel camera it's
got a 3-inch wide flip out screen so
that is a capacitive screen no
multi-touch sure though when you're
looking at your pictures you can
obviously shoot from different angles
with that flip up screen five times
optical zoom it's got a Schneider lens
noise reduction function HD movie
capable they're not really telling us
all the information about it yet
hopefully I'll be able to add that in
the text below as well as some release
information
3d photography functions they're a
little bit hazy on what that's going to
be it's not a 3d lens I may be able to
view back 3d images perhaps with those
glasses
it's obviously a compact point-and-shoot
you can see I've got the information
right here it does have Samsung's
panorama it's got sort of a funny face
option to it
which is an odd way of saying it's got
some men you can go ahead and see what
those Navy officers out here trying to
slide this on over we filter magic frame
which is kind of a neat little trick go
ahead and click that cuz I can do that
with one finger there we go you can see
you've got different frames you can
select from here that puts a picture
right in the back it's kind of neat
so they're saying Sakura sale conscious
consumer it's going to retail for about
two hundred and seventy nine dollars
more information will be down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
