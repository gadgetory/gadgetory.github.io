TechnoBuffalo here unlocking your phone
with the passcode or a picture your face
is so last year it's all about
fingerprint scanning and touch I even
give you a hands-on demonstration of
touch ID how to set it up and let's see
how it works so as you saw in the intro
it's pretty easy put your finger on
there you push the button the phone
unlocks the whole setup process gonna do
that though is kind of interesting so go
into settings we'll go to general and
you've got a new option here passcode
and fingerprint ID pull us off to the
side to put my code for just a quick
second come on back and now the here are
all the options you get so turn passcode
off if you'd like to require passcode
immediately simple passcode fingerprints
and this is where sure the action
happens right inside of there so by
default your fingerprints are not gonna
be named we had the option to go ahead
and edit them if you hit the edit button
and go ahead and select it and call it
anything you like we'll keep the thumb
there but I don't have my pointer finger
in here sometimes I unlocked my phone
using that let me show you what that
looks like we'll go ahead and add
fingerprint that's kind of a interesting
process you kind of have to lift your
finger and rest it on the phone and tap
it so we'll keep doing that here you'll
see that the red starts to fill in on
the gray so keep it in it buzzes and you
pick it up buzzes and you pick it up and
you see the fingerprint starts to fill
in it's kind of neat so now you have to
move it a little bit slightly so in case
you get a different part of your finger
shows up on the screen and that's it it
is all set and done now I can use my
finger to unlock the phone and I'll go
ahead and go to finger to will edit
rename it pointer so I can know which
finger I'm using and you can use really
any finger or toe if you want perhaps
let's try a toe unlock to see if that
works here as well so go ahead and get
done get done there now let's go ahead
and try it and see if that pointer
finger actually works so go ahead and
there it goes unlock to the phone
so Ralph behind the camera is working
I'm gonna see if I can get route to use
his finger and try and unlock the phone
here and see if it works for him
try again try again not gonna work
Adventure is gonna prompt him to get to
the passcode where you have to do to
unlock your phone so it does work it's
very secure I'm sure there'll be
exploits for what is a very nice way to
unlock the front that having to look
down or take your eyes off whatever
you're doing it really just seems to
work which is very neat and most
importantly it works very quickly so
what do you guys think about touch ID is
it something it's gonna be integrated
into all future phones I want to hear
your thoughts if you have a 5s are you
gonna use it are you gonna not use it
