TechnoBuffalo early hands-on here with
the all new Google pixel free Excel at
the Google event here in New York City
now stop me if you haven't heard of this
or seen this already this is what's new
from Whoville let me tell you quickly
what is new on the pixel 3xl so we've
got a 6.3 inch OLED panel on this phone
a little bit bigger than the pixel 2xl
we've also got a 5.5 inch screen on the
three which is going to be larger than
the 5 inch screen we saw on the older
pixel 2 series and we've got that deep
notch it is in fact there it's on top
and you're gonna have to live with it if
you want to buy this phone obviously
it's running Android 9 pi out of the box
and not a whole lot has changed on the
front obviously there's the notch
there's the chain before but Google says
it's 40% louder speakers and you've got
a very similar looking phone though
Google says you're getting more screen
to body ratio on this three series than
you saw on the two let's take a quick
look around back as you can see there's
now a glass back that's going to support
wireless charging we've got a rear
finger reader amount on there if you
want to scan your fingerprint to unlock
the phone and a single 12 megapixel
shooter here again Google's doing all
their camera magic and software not so
much Hardware still got a single rear
shooter on the back obviously again
running Andrew 9 PI out of the box and
you've got a couple of cool tricks here
in software obviously I've got a wider
angle lens built into that not so you've
got two lenses there to play with you're
able to really adjust that volume of
that slider here in software and get a
much wider field of view and kind of
zoom and compare which is kind of cool
you've got a lot of cool software things
in here as well there's Topshop that'll
automatically kicks it takes the best
shot it'll take a couple of frames of
pictures before and after you hit the
press the shutter button and it'll pick
the one best one for you automatically
there's a photobooth effect that you can
literally say cheese and it'll take the
picture for you lots of cool stuff built
into the software powering this phone
we've got a snapdragon 845 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM obviously it has all
those Android 9 high touch features on
here as well and you'll have 64 gigs or
128 gigs of storage to choose from
available in black white and a non pink
color and of course for more details on
everything on this one you can check out
TechnoBuffalo tile cobblehov pricing
availability
everything on there is just a quick
hands-on phone feels incredibly premium
feels nice in the hands that glass back
is super nice feels very premium and
this is the the latest and greatest from
Google this is the three XL feels nice
to the hands
