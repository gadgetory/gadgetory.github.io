to you by Netflix hello there I am
talking to you welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup this to show we
take all the tech rumors from the week
we smash them Basham condense them into
one little tech rumor show of awesome
for you so this week were to talk about
Android 4.3 jelly bean showing up in web
developers traffic sharp is supposedly
getting to produce the iPhone 5 best
displays next month a public preview of
Windows blue is supposed to launch and
like June HTC is supposedly working on
Windows RT tablets didn't get the memo
nobody wants them this is from a roundup
let's go ahead and get started so Google
i/o is really quickly approaching next
week and we thought it was gonna be 5.0
key lime pie but 4.3 jelly bean is
trying to show up in traffic reports
which suggests that perhaps we won't see
Android 5.0 key lime pie just yet unless
it's being disguised as super hope it is
Google is largely expected to unveil the
next version of Android next week during
its annual Google i/o developer
conference in San Francisco so it comes
as no surprise that we're seeing early
sans doute brain systems existence
unlike the iOS 7 reports however we
don't know exactly where the 4.3 devices
are coming from although we imagine it's
somewhere in the mountain view area and
of course we will be on hand to bring
you every minute by minute updates for
what happens at Google i/o so hopefully
it's just something else that's being
tested maybe 4.3 for older devices maybe
we'll see 5.0 key lime pie for something
new and fancy I'm hoping because I want
me some key lime pie deliciousness
supposedly sharp is getting ready to
begin iPhone 5s display production next
month so Japan display and LG are also
expected to produce the screens for
Apple's next gen iPhone Taiwanese news
outlet also noted that sharps common
awah plant where production is scheduled
to take place is reportedly noted a huge
drop-off in performance through lack of
demand for its products when operates at
full steam though the plant is capable
manufacturing 600 million display units
per month Apple's iPhone 5s expected to
launch in the fall and while Apple is
denied reports like they always do so
supposedly it stuff starts in June maybe
around the September October time frame
might be able to see the iPhone 5s maybe
iOS 7 perhaps we'll see the all the
rumors you've been hearing about the
iPhone 5s having fingerprint scanners
all kinds of other craziness in it but I
am hoping just for new OS so Microsoft
said the next version of Windows 8 known
as Windows 8.1 Baconian windows blue
will be available later this year now
the company has gone on total records
say that the public preview will be
available at the end of next month the
CD Nets Mary Jill Foley tried to dig
deeper to find out up there would be any
new public preview of Windows RT at the
same time and Microsoft chose not to
discuss that right now so I guess
Windows RT is probably gonna go away the
dodo goes away the Zune and other
Microsoft products and get axed oh we're
expecting with Windows 8.1 or blue some
form of the start button to return
perhaps off the whole menu as well as an
option to record Windows 8 desktop
instead of the tile bays Metro or modern
UI so neat features everybody wants but
you can already set your computer to do
that I can download tweaks I'll bring
back the Start menu of course you could
set things to boot up into regular
desktop mode if you want so hopefully
there's something else now what's gonna
get in there but of course we'll bring
you all those updates as they come of
HTC are 7 and our 12 Windows RT tablets
supposedly due in q3 apparently the
names actually have meaning numbers
represent the screen size so a 7-inch
tablet and a 12 inch tablet the arm a
stand for the RT version of Windows so
so far however Windows RT devices have
been super slow on the uptake its users
gravitate towards Android or iOS power
devices if she sees gotta convince
consumers that that doesn't matter or
totally try and change those views
perhaps the super low price point can be
a really compelling start phone Arina
said the r7 expected to ship with a
quad-core Snapdragon 800 clocked at 2.3
gigahertz 16 gigs of expandable storage
and a 13 megapixel camera and 2 gigs of
RAM so there are 12 reporters gonna pack
the same hardware but a larger 12-inch
screen at the 2048 by 1536 pixel display
apparently both tablets will eventually
hit the market with 4G LTE support so
maybe we will see the land on carriers
with subsidy options that can be a good
way to strim get them out in the market
right now though HTC is allegedly
playing get the devices on store shelves
by October 13th keep this in mind though
HTC exited the tablet market after it
launched a flyer and has so far only
said that it's watching how others
performing for at launch of their own if
sales of Windows RT based devices or any
hand HDC probably shouldn't be jumping
on this bandwagon what do you guys think
would you want to see an HTC my tablet
again you know we had the jet stream
that have been all kinds of other 8
didn't do all that well but if it looked
like a bigger version HTC one I don't
know I might give it a shot I want to
hear your thoughts leave them comments
