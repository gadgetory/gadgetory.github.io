to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hey what's going on guys the
marked in Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and
in today's video we'll be showing you
guys what's new in android 5.1 lollipop
now the update is slowly rolling out and
you should be getting it on your Nexus
device pretty soon but in case you
haven't received it yet we actually made
a video explaining how to sideload
android 5.1 so we'll leave the link down
below that like button so we got it up
and running on our Nexus 5 and I've been
using it for about a week now and so far
everything seems to be really fluid I
haven't experienced any app crashes or
major lags throughout the US and pattern
real life seems to be a bit better too
and John's using android 5.1 on his
Nexus 6 and he definitely noticed an
improvement in battery life and
performance so let's go ahead and see
what's new with android 5.1 lollipop so
we're gonna split these changes into two
different categories the big changes and
then we're gonna follow that up with the
small changes starting off with the big
changes in quick settings the Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth quick access buttons are now
clickable which means if you click on
the Wi-Fi drop down button it now shows
you a mini menu with different Wi-Fi
connections inside quick settings and
the same goes for the Bluetooth button
no need to go to the Settings app so you
connect two different Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth you can change connections
through the quick settings menu another
big change that I noticed with android
5.1 is the ability to change the system
volume when an audio or video is playing
in a background whereas before you
weren't able to do that another thing I
noticed that when you swipe up a
notification instead of dismissing it
forever it's just gonna be kept for
later so you can see it on your
notification tray another one that I
noticed was in the settings menu under
Wi-Fi Android now recognizes Wi-Fi
connections with no internet access and
it actually won't automatically
reconnect which is great with android
5.1 on the nexus 6 you do now have the
HD voice support for t-mobile and
Verizon and it also supports for two SIM
cards if you have a phone that's capable
of accepting dual Sims
now probably the biggest one for android
5.1 is specifically for the Nexus 6
which is the anti-theft device
protection basically if someone tries to
and wants to wipe your phone they'll
have to enter the account password of
the last Google Account on
specific Android device if you have a
Nexus 6 and a secured lock screen like a
pin pattern or a password and sign into
at least one Google account device
protection should be already enabled now
moving on to the small changes there are
new animations for the auto rotate
portrait mode button in the quick
settings menu screen pinning now shows
which buttons to press to leave screen
pinning mode otherwise it works like
before going inside the clock app there
are new animations throughout the clock
app if you press each individual buttons
if we go inside the Settings app inside
the running apps and applications or
services you can now see that the 3d
icons are now changed to a much flatter
material look I'm talking about the lock
screen real quick there are some subtle
changes swiping outside the quick
settings area will unlock the phone
rather than swiping the quick settings
away to just see the lock screen just
making it easier to get to your home
screen quicker and last but not least
editing a contact looks much cleaner and
simpler now with a few material design
elements and that's about it if you guys
want to give android 5.1 a try we have a
tutorial up on our channel on how to
sideload it on your Nexus device or if
you want to simply just wait for the
update then feel free to do so
anyways let's sit for this video guys if
you like this video give it a thumbs up
and make sure to hit the subscribe
button I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
