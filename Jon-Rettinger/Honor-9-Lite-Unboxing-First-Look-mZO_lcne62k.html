taking a look at devices that are
expensive on the higher end but there's
a lot of awesome options on the lower
end of the spectrum a few months ago we
took a look at the honor 7x and it's
pretty overwhelming in the comments you
wanted to see more stuff from honor so
they reached out and wanted to send us
another one so we've got the honor nine
light it's the light version of the
honor nine so the big story here with
this guy is you're getting four cameras
actually is going to give you you know
portrait mode bouquet on the front and
the back so it's go ahead open up and
take a look I got the honor nine light
logo on the top here's the phone I'll
kind of done up and really nice looking
blue actually take off the sticker on
the back and we've got a nice mirror
finish you can actually use it as a
mirror if you want to else inside the
box you've got a sim removal tool there
you're going to have a power plug
depending on the region that will have
your prongs with USB a on it and you've
got a micro USB cord because this phone
does indeed use micro USB all right push
all that stuff off to the side let's
take a look at the phone itself I still
do a quick tour of advice and I'll talk
a lot about the cameras in a second
since that's the big story here with the
phone so on the left hand side you've
got your SIM tray and it kind of does
double duty you can either do two Sims
or one sim and a micro SD card slot I do
like the flexibility if you guys do dual
Sims we've got the option here two
versions of the phone are gonna be
available one that's got 64 gigs of
internal storage one that's got 32 and
then that's paired with either three or
four gigs of RAM right the one here with
32 gigs of storage and three gigabytes
of RAM pricing is going to vary
depending on the region but looking at
probably around two to three hundred
bucks you want to learn more though
we'll link to it down below on the right
hand side you've got your volume up and
down and your power button nothing on
top on the bottom you've got your noise
cancelling mic speaker you've got a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and like I said
it's a micro USB on the bottom it's not
USB type-c so a couple things I liked
about the device just holding it your
first impressions the fingerprint
readers in a good spot that's where
fingerprint readers belong on the back
of a phone
don't put them next to the camera
sensors put it where your finger can
naturally find it screens are a big deal
for me they're sort of the way you
interact with your phone so if you got a
bad screen it sort of can totally take
away any positive experience with a
phone so they're very curious to see
what the screen was like here on the
nine light it has a feel of a 5.2 inch
screen because the bezels are so small
you get that's five point six five inch
display again the resolution is pretty
good it's 2016 by 1080 I do like the 18
by 9 aspect ratio and again the bezels
are thin on the top and bottom means you
can have an 83% screen to body ratio so
powering this guy is an octa-core
processor it's the curent 6:59 I should
also mention that software it's Android
or EO a point out of the box so at least
you're getting the latest version of
Android hopefully 8.1 that will come
sometime soon the big story and the one
that honor is trying to sort of tell
people is on the camera side so this is
something that I don't think I've ever
seen on a phone it's the same cameras on
the front in the back again there's four
sensors
it's each 13 and 2 so the pairing on the
front of the Baxter didn't get the same
camera settings and the same camera
options whether not you're taking
portraits or photos of your kids running
around so they sort of dig into the
camera there's a lot of camera options
here you also get the ability to focus
after the fact so if you've missed a
shot you can do a lottery focus turns
out that that second sensor is only used
to capture depth information so that's
going to give you sir that better bokeh
effect and again on the front of the
back you're getting a decent amount of
pro modes here in the camera so let's
test a camera speed honors claiming
point one seconds for an ultra fast
snapshot so I don't let's try that on
camera I mean I can't quantify 0.1
seconds but I mean it seemed fast
performance seems pretty solid battery
life probably pretty good it's got a
3,000 million power battery we're
getting years kind of a premium feeling
phone but an awesome camera in that two
to $300 price point which i think is
something a lot of folks are looking for
when they want to buy a phone sight
enough to spend the eight nine hundred
bucks a thousand bucks to get a pretty
baller camera you can get that on the
lower end also alright so this is the
honor night life you guys want to see us
do a full review give the video a thumbs
up and also let us know in the comments
you want to see I start to cover more
devices in this price point we've kind
of tended to stay on the higher end
there's a lot of awesome options down
lower-end thank you to honor for
sponsoring this video and sending us the
device hope you guys enjoyed to next
