TechnoBuffalo here today we're gonna
take a look at the latest headphones
from parrot these are the Zeek 2.0 's
this review is brought to you by the
all-new G flex 2 by LG life's good
parrot claims these are the most
advanced headphones in the world and
they're competing against a lot from
folks like beats Bose audio technica and
way more they come in just around 400
bucks so they're not for the feint of
wallet but are you getting a pair of
headphones that's worth that money
that's what I'm here to tell you a
parrot wants to make sure you're gonna
get the pair of headphones matches your
personality so the Zeke twos are
available in six different colors so you
can pick a range from black white red
blue and in between it really wanted a
big emphasis on design with the Zeke
twos they are designed by Phillip Stark
who did the first gen as well and they
look really nice difference between the
first gen if you're not familiar is a
17% lighter they have a new wider
headband with new padding which we'll
talk about in the comfort section of the
review I've got new longer ear cups and
they've got double the size of the
cushion that goes on your ear so from
look at these things they look really
industrial and very modern all the
movable parts here are real metal no
plastic you're gonna see on your touch
they've got bright color accents on them
and it's a really minimal design you
almost can't see any buttons when you
look at it from the ear cups on the
underside is where all the i/o is gonna
live there's not much you've got a power
button 3 / 5 millimeter headset jack and
then you've got your charging port which
is just microUSB underneath the left ear
cup you're going to find some other
options you've got a removable 850
milliamp hour battery in there and it
goes back on via magnet the design here
is absolutely gorgeous but the design
does come with a few trade-offs first
location of the power button it was a
bit on the annoying side I found myself
when I taking the headphones off
oftentimes pushing the power button I
was able to change my grip and fix that
but certainly be aware of it also sin
dust real design means these headphones
are not going to fold up and you want to
pack them away so bear that in mind when
trying to side if they're right for you
so first and foremost a pair of Deeks
are bluetooth headphones and I love that
no pairing mode is necessary I'd have to
figure out if I had a long press the
power button or double tap it is some
sort of Morse code to make it pair it's
just always in
Harry Moe just really nice if you've got
an NFC capable phone you just tap it to
the left ear cup and it'll pair on macca
for you super nice and super easy one of
the coolest features I think about the
headset is actually not the headset
itself it's what you can do with it from
your phone via iOS or Android app it
gives you full customization over what
you can do with headphones something
apparently seen on any competitors it'll
tell you simple things like your battery
it also give you noise control control
the noise canceling in the headphones
this is really neat you can turn it all
the way up and really shut out the
outside world or you can go all the way
down to what they call street mode what
that's gonna do it's gonna take the
outside noise use the built-in
microphone which can use for calls and
put that audio also through the headset
so if you're on an airplane and you want
to be able to hear what the captain
saying or you're on a train you want to
hear for exits coming up really cool to
be able to have that full customization
options built in so also in the app we
can get a full equalizer you're gonna
get a parrot's concert hall which I'll
talk about in the audio section also get
featured presets on just fine what's
good for you selected and completely
move on this does I missed over
throughput filed in the meter headset
jack and it will work even when the
headsets are turned off so if your
battery is dying
nothing to worry plug it in and you are
good to go for a headset that claims to
be the most advanced in the world one
odd thing I found is this uses bluetooth
3.0 and not 4.00 it which is a bit on
the strange side certainly there are
much more advantage to 4.0 with the
audio here is I'll get to still sounds
very good and distance wasn't much of an
issue either surprisingly parrot claims
about three meters of range when you're
away from your computer or your phone I
got almost doubled up two Tunes four and
five and sometimes as far as 64 I got
any sort of crackling so you could step
pretty far away and not lose any
fidelity you probably get these things
saying where the controls and I kind of
thought the same thing it's completely
gesture-based on the right ear cup swipe
up and down to change the volume up or
down and left or right to change tracks
you can just tap it if you want to start
or stop your music fun answer a call you
can just tap it using the built-in mic
or long tap it to decline
another really neat feature if you take
the headphones off your head I'll have
to polish your music can you put them
back on it will put the music back on
also if you're not listening to any
music at all you just have headphones
you put them on your ears automatically
activate the noise canceling feature
just really nice or frequent travelers
who just don't want to music just don't
want to hear people around them and just
want to sleep at 830 million power
battery lasted us around five and a half
hours I saw other reviewers got a little
bit longer I just used it as I would
normal set of headphones get say between
five and seven hours of use it's gonna
charge via micro USB and take about two
and a half hours to charge these suckers
up alright but they are headphones how
do they sound they some really good is
the moral base extension is absolutely
awesome even the lowest notes sound very
very good a highs are super crisp
without being harsh at all when
listening to it on normal volume as the
volume gets louder though the highs can
definitely get a little bit harsh I did
not like the concert hall effect at all
I thought it added way too much reverb
so I turn that off immediately but you
have the option turning it on or off as
I mentioned before noise canceling is
absolutely great as well
Fred phones that are calling themselves
the world's most advanced headphones
they are plagued just some outdated
Bluetooth and it's okay battery life but
overall audio and customization is
awesome 400 bucks I would have liked if
had more than just a pouch to carry
these things around then you can buy an
extra case for about $50 and where you
buy it from as I mentioned the
headphones don't fold up so I'm gonna
take a lot of room in your bag but
overall the headphones were really
comfortable for hours of use even with
glasses and delivered great music
fidelity via bluetooth I would
absolutely recommend this plus it look
really good on your ears so if you're
looking to get it premium bluetooth
headphones that has noise canceling you
want to spend at 400 bucks as your price
point I don't think you're gonna go
wrong with the parity - they knock this
one out of the park they're all the
features I would have wanted even added
things I didn't know I wants like a
removable battery
screw I would have lights modern
Bluetooth and perhaps longer battery
life but I can live with those small
comprises get the great customization
the great looks and the great hottie of
sound that the pair of z2 is all thank
