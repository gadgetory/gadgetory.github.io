portability and but the video quality
isn't as high resolution as I would like
and the audio quality you'll notice so
these recently has not been the best so
an effort to make my videos a little
more professional and kind of add some
audio and video fidelity
I went purchased a brand new
high-definition video camera from Amazon
which I'm going to a box for you guys
right now I'm really excited about this
camera it's a Sony supposed to be one of
the best around and let's go ahead and
dig in and see what we got so here is
just the cardboard Amazon box nothing
terribly exciting alright it's just some
shipping information there here is the
Box take out the Amazon package push
this off to the side and the camera that
I got is the sony HDR sr 11 prices on it
are gonna vary really depending on where
you look this was a little bit expensive
and I decided to splurge a little bit
it's the HDR SR 11 and it was about $700
on Amazon but I'm hoping that it's gonna
be worth it for the videos and some
future projects so let's go ahead and
get crackin go over the specs and stuff
kinda as we progress actually let's go
ahead look at the box first
it's a picture of the camera on the
front model number there again HDR SR 11
reminding you to get a spare battery
bravi a sync photo TV HD another picture
of the camera on the side just some
technical specs right there technical
specs right here it's got actually a
mini HDMI pores you connect it right to
your TV which is kind of cool
and some other stuff on the back here
it's got a ten point two megapixel a
camera or lens for still images it's got
a carl zeiss lens it ass face detection
multi-language operation 3.2 inch inch
extra fine LCD which is a touchscreen
and steady shot it also has night vision
on it which is kind of cool I don't know
if I'll ever use it but it's nice to
have and the image stabilization built
in should be pretty good let's go ahead
and break the seal here all right seal
isn't broken open it up see what we got
inside I know one other person has his
camera and it's been really happy with
it so I'm hoping to get similar results
and be equally as happy it's fully
compatible with iMovie which is nice
okay you know it is a little bit weird
to be filming a video unboxing my new
camera with my old camera a little bit a
little bit sad for the old minnow but
I'm gonna keep it you know for
portability if I'm going somewhere with
my family or friends I want to take some
video they're really nice to have some
software that it comes with it's like
some more software that it comes with a
lot of books suck up the handycam
limited warranty 15% eat coupon eligible
accessories where's the good stuff we
got here notes on using a computer
alright and this records actually at
full 1080 which is quite nice here is
the operating guide and here is the
actual camera itself pull off this tab
push that back down Sony does make very
nice products and I think the quality of
this should hopefully justify its price
got some audio and video cables nothing
terribly exciting right there put those
off to the side taking USB to mini-usb
cord have a ton of the
laying around more cables here's a
charger key what looks like yeah that
must plug into I believe there's a doc
in here and then just though little
outlet prongs there more video cables
the power brick so that quarter I just
showed you plugs into there here is the
battery go we knock on this camera has
been battery life isn't so strong but
that not that concerned that we film
videos five or six minutes time and it's
not the big inconvenience to plug it
back in but we'll see how the battery
works TV can see a size on it right
there
seven point two volts recyclable small
battery not too large that off to the
side here is a remote TV remotes are
pretty handy just standard remote stuff
play fast-forward back zoom in start and
stop here is the charging cradle this is
actually pretty cool you rest the camera
right on top of it and you can plug it
in in the back and you can charge it
nice and easily
Kenny's have a little bit of a dock
alright and what matters most the piece
there is is on the camera itself let's
take a look at it it has a 60 gig hard
drive built-in for recording video and
also takes flash drives as well Sony's
proprietary formats 1014 megapixel HD
full 1080 records at 1920 by 1080 I HD
recording 60 gigabytes record up to 22
hours hard disk hybrid yeah also like I
said it also uses Sony's memory stick so
there is the camera itself it feels nice
take a look at the Wow
that is quite a large lens right there
if you find a rather can rotate it to
the side afore when you're filming
yourself which I do quite a bit push
that down it's got a viewfinder that
pops up probably never really use
that there's the mode start/stop quick
on actually puts this thing to sleep but
you push quick on and you're ready to
record immediately
there's your zoom there's another side
view there's a front of the lens it's
got a 12 x optical zoom it's actually
very nice let's take a look at the
port's that it has on it
there's your mini HDMI port there's a
lion external line for a microphone
which would be nice and there's a line
for headsets
this records audio I believe in full 5.1
surround sound which is really nice
although YouTube will never ever be 5.1
there's some other ports right there for
charging audio/video ports and that
looks to be about it guys curls ice lens
I'm really excited to use this and give
it a whirl of course I will give you
guys a review on it and I'll do some
sample videos comparing this with the
flip minnow so you guys can see directly
I am real excited like I mentioned for
exclusive contents be sure to follow me
on Twitter twitter.com slash job for
Lakers I'll see you guys the next video
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
