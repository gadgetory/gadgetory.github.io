from TechnoBuffalo here I want to give
you a tour and show you what's new in
Google's tasty dessert themed Android
2.3 called
Gingerbread to help me out here I've got
an Android 2.2 device so I can
illustrate the differences here on the
Nexus One and 2.30 will be demonstrated
on the Nexus S let's go ahead and get
started a lot of the additions to 2.3
are under the hood and things that the
end user doesn't necessarily see as
graphical enhancements but there are
some graphical changes and some tweaks
that we can see and I want to go and
show you what each of those are so first
let's start down at the bottom these now
colored icons represent the call and
browser buttons we saw them on Android
2.2 but they didn't have that green
color that they have now that green
theme also sort of comes into play with
the status bar at the top you can see
the icons now I have a green color to
them whereas before they did not another
small change the battery indicator here
is horizontal in 2.3 it is vertical all
right so that's about it maybe the green
theme was due to the Android little logo
but that's the main difference that
you're going to see on the home screen a
very small minor tweak which I really
like is what happens when you lock the
device let me go ahead and show you what
that looks like so I go ahead and lock
the phone you get sort of a cool math TV
turning off effect so it powers down
like that
very neat you don't have anything
similar on 2.2 now it's obviously not a
giant thing it's just graphical but it's
kind of fun to say see it right there
and the unlock screens on both look
identical alright so let's go ahead and
continue our tour here one of the things
that I was hoping we were going to say
an Android 2.3 was more utility in this
pull down tray if you look at galaxy s
devices or other devices running
TouchWiz you have profile switchers and
some other utilities you can do with
that we don't have any sort of extra
functionality just some new colors so
there's been another sort of small tweak
here take a look at dialer the wrong
button there to jump into phone
you can see the dialer looks a little
bit different spin skin just a bit again
nothing major but there is a sort of
something new
you now have memory and application
management right from the home screen
the main menu on the home screen so I go
ahead and hit the menu button I now have
something for manage apps that was not
there in Android 2.2 and you can manage
your applications nice and easily
perhaps Google realize there's a big
market for third-party application
management and they want to their phone
to sort of natively support that Lee's
relatively easy and make it nice and
simple to get to so you can view your
downloads we'll talk about in just a
minute all your USB storage files and
what's running so you might notice this
says USB storage this is more of a
galaxy essay it doesn't actually have
expandable memory but it treats them as
16 gigs it has almost as external
storage it partitions it just a little
bit so that's in addition to Android 2.3
let's go ahead and homescreen out of
here if you look at a list in any sort
of the menu items on 2.3 notice
something different as well so let's go
ahead and jump into settings and I'll
show you what that looks like we'll do
that on each device so on Android 2.2
when you scroll to the bottom you just
get to the bottom you don't get any sort
of bouncy physics and your kind of thing
you just get to the bottom simple menu
I've got a bit more animations now on
two point three got that little yellow
or orangish color bar that pops up color
lets you know that you're at the bottom
of the menu it's a small graphical
improvement certainly nothing giant but
it is something that two point three
does or that two point two does not
another nice addition to two point three
is actually a download manager it's an
application found right in your
applications menu I'll go ahead and show
you what that is I've made a shortcut to
it on the home page you can now access
all of your downloads from your emails
from for apps whatever it is might be
whatever you downloaded you can now
access and reopen a nice and easily an
Android 2.3 certainly a lot of these
things that I'm going to mention that
two point three does it could be
accomplished with third parties
important older versions of Android but
they are now built in so one of the most
noticeable differences in 2.3
is actually the keyboard let's go ahead
and talk about that we'll jump into
messaging applications on each let's go
ahead and find messages here all right
so here the keyboard you notice that
they do look noticeably different on two
point two this is the stock android
keyboard certainly there are many
third-party keyboards you can put on
here like swipe which may make some of
this obsolete but if you're a fan of the
native Android keyboards you're going to
want to pay attention so on to point to
the keys were very close together you
can move around and pick whatever key
you wanted but became a bit cramped and
you were trying to type on two point
three the keys are a little bit spaced
out the fonts are a little bit different
and the typing experience seems to be
much easier another really big
improvement in two point three that we
didn't have in two point two is the
ability to manipulate the text and show
where you want to go and actually move
the cursor where you'd like so here
we've got a two point to add a message
typed in there that says Winnie the Pooh
sounds gross if I want to move my cursor
around I got to sort of select it pick
the letter that I want go on to the copy
text I'd have to hold it down I could go
ahead and copy all or copy a certain
area it's not to select text you know
you can just copy and you get all those
menus here on two-point-three they've
made it a bit easier so if I just sort
of tap text I get this new I don't know
let's what the call in a little icon I
let me move around and control where the
cursor goes makes it very easy now makes
element it easy if you want to copy and
at pasted text as well there's a lot of
things you can do to make things just a
bit easier so if I tap this and I want
to let's say select a word you'll now
know that I've got two so I can move
this to control whatever words I want
makes it a lot easier for copying and in
for pasting long text and that's
definitely much welcome improvement
alright so one of the other things that
actually that this particular Nexus S
has that the necklace one doesn't have
again this is particular to the Nexus S
is something called
NFC which is a near field communications
it's a way to transmit data back and
forth although right now it's just one
direction for security you also now have
access to multiple cameras the Nexus S
in particular which is currently only
2.3 device has a front-facing VGA camera
as well they go ahead and show you what
that looks like
so before it was a little bit difficult
to switch cameras now there's an menu
option built right in let you go to the
front and back and obviously wasn't
found on the Nexus One because in there
a front-facing camera alright so let's
go ahead and go back home and let's
continue the tour now there's a lot of
stuff under the hood as well that you're
not going to see here that the end user
isn't going to see right away they've
improved a third-party support for video
drivers which you're going to be
especially parents for 3d graphics so
gaming is going to look unnoticeably
better as developers get access to these
new AP is that also is a new AMR
wideband which is really going to new
codec for that which translates to
supposedly a better video for a started
rather better audio fidelity while
making phone calls so the sound quality
is going to be a bit better and there's
a lot of new API support the developer
can take advantage of so really in
conclusion 2.3 is not a giant upgrade
over 2.2 if you're running a 2.2 device
not necessarily have to be clamoring for
2.3 you're not going to get giant new
features or completely redone uy they're
very subtle changes certainly welcome
but it's nothing revolutionary very
evolutionary changes here found at
Android 2.3 so would you like to seeing
anything added Android 2.3 that you
didn't get are you waiting for the next
version of Android which is going to be
called honeycomb whether it's 3.0 or 2.4
ever Google decides to call it hey guys
I am Jon Retton German techno buffalo
with the highlights of what's new in
Android 2.3 bye-bye
