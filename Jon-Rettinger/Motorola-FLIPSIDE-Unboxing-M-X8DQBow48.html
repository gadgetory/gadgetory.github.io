TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the Motorola flip side let's go
ahead and see if this guy's worth your
hard-earned 99 bucks
alright so as I just mentioned this is
going to cost you 99 dollars on contract
with AT&amp;amp;T go ahead and run through the
specs as I take out the phone let's go
ahead and first look at the box letting
you know that it's got Android it's
running Android 2.1 it looks like
there's a blank bubble there not filled
out it's got Wi-Fi and of course email
picture of the device on the front just
some legal information on the side some
numbers IMEI stuff and some specs on the
back we'll go ahead and go through all
those in a minute but I want to jump
into the phone stuff nice and quickly
alright so here we've got a QuickStart
guide go ahead and pull that off to the
side got a turn this over information to
set up your motoblur account already so
go ahead and pull out the phone pushed
it off to the side for just one moment
and see what you're going to get in your
box we've got a micro USB to USB syncing
cable pretty standard for for
smartphones nowadays put that on we've
got a USB wall charger we've got a 1540
million power battery good for probably
a little over seven hours and we've got
the back cover it's go ahead and see
what the back of this is gonna look like
whether or not soft touch or plastic or
whatever it is a soft touch and it's
sort of soft touch all the way around
alright so let's go ahead and look at
the phone and let's talk about the specs
of the flipside all right so this guy
has a 3.1 inch capacitive TFT display
with a resolution of 320 by 480 as I
mentioned it's running Android 2.1 with
motoblur sitting on top of it it's
Motorola's proprietary Android skin it's
powered by a TI OMAP 340 which is going
to get you 720 megahertz
it's gonna have a decent amount of RAM
with 512 so multitasking should happen
relative ease on the back it's got a
three megapixel camera right there which
is gonna shoot a just standard
definition video it does have flash
light again not the thing you use in a
blackout but the way you can view Flash
content on your phone doesn't have flash
10.1 support because it's on Android 2.2
device and again it's got a 15 140 hour
milliamp hour battery so it's sort of a
unique phone let's look at it real
quickly I'll pop the battery in and see
if we can get it to turn on you've got 4
capacitive buttons here and sometimes on
motoblur devices you only get 3 and you
don't have that search button so I am
happy that Motorola included that gear
what sort of unique about this phone is
this huge touch navigation so a lot of
Android phones are forgoing whether or
not it's a scroll ball or forgoing a
d-pad a Motorola sort of taking a
different approach here with the flip
side and put in this very spacious touch
navigation pad well touch on how that
well that works and reviewing whether or
not it's worth the smaller screen size
or sort of you wish to rather have a
larger screen with the capacitive
buttons certain typical array across the
bottom so it's called the flip side sort
of like it's cousins the back flip and
the flip out because it won't sort of
flipped out to the side and I guess it's
more of a sliding mechanism but it does
have a very nice full QWERTY keyboard
the keys are a bit rubberized there's
not that much key throat to them because
it is a slider you can see they're
relatively flat but the keys are nicely
spaced out there's no problem really
hitting the top row you're worrying
about your finger hitting and oftentimes
sliders that has a problem it's got a
very large spacebar key function key
right there there isn't a dedicated row
for numbers they're sort of inlaid on
the top row of keys got a enter and
return and again a big space bar and you
have a four-way d-pad so continuing our
here on the left hand side of the Vice
we've got just your charging port on the
right hand side got a volume rocker up
and down and a camera button on the
bottom just microphone
top three point five millimeter headset
jack and the power and lock button I'm
going to go ahead and pop in the battery
and see what this thing can do is also
gonna come bundled with a 2gig SanDisk
card it's probably gonna ask me to set
up a motoblur account
but let's go ahead and check it out
anyway pop in the battery gear and see
what we've got going on so they're not
gonna pop a SIM card in yet but when I
detest this phone for my full review
I'll do my typical sort of array of
tests so I'll do sort of twenty calls
from different areas to gauge signal
strength and whether or not there are
any sort of dropped call issues all I
fell in the recent Motorola devices to
actually be a relatively strong in that
department
let's go ahead and put the back on this
is always sort of a struggle to see if I
can do this first time or not let's see
if it just snaps in which it looks like
it does sort of snap and slide so there
is uh the whole phone with the back sort
of on so that's going to slide off no
back is on Sony do a real quick size
comparison for you so you can see how
big this device is going to be and
whether or not it's the right one for
you this is more being mid-range Android
handset certainly slated below AT&amp;amp;T
Galaxy S series of phones
so first let's bring in its AT&amp;amp;T stable
mate here is the iPhone 4 didn't see
what they look like next to each other
stacked the flipside actually is a
relatively thin phone I despite having a
full QWERTY keyboard let's go ahead and
bring in a a few other devices for
comparison purposes here is the Palm Pre
tube with a serve a downward sliding
QWERTY mechanism and go ahead and stack
all these guys and make a smart phone
sandwich you can see sort of how thick
those are and let's bring in one more
four F size comparisons here is a the
very large Evo 4G this one does not have
a slide-out QWERTY keyboard I'm
certainly Bessette in the business
department because of that let's go
ahead and see if we can power this
sucker on or see how long or how quick
that takes a lot as far as we're gonna
get is an introduction to motoblur so
let's push these other phones off to the
side I will peel off the plastic because
I know how much they bother you guys
texting
I think it can wait so we've got all of
that peeled off and these are still just
capacitive buttons there's any sort of
demarcation between them sort of one big
panel on the left side and one big panel
on the right so you've got the motoblur
logo this is sort of the the older
version of motoblur that has the color
indicator systems on it if you go ahead
and look at the literature right here
you can see there's a color for your
dial pad and for your contact and the
big menu some versions of motoblur don't
have that so this is about as far as
we're gonna get looks like it is uh
pulling in the right time or at least
close to the right time I guess it's a
12 38 here in California I guess the
default time here is 12:30 see if it'll
let us get to the operating system
without sign into motoblur although I
don't think it is going to know so we'll
have to register motoblur and I'll come
back with a full review here of the flip
side and see if it's going to be worth
it for you and I guess I am John render
