clear seems like a good day to go to war
let's put Goliath against Goliath and
have the galaxy s 10 e square up against
the iPhone 10 our two contestants are
gonna enter only ones gonna leave the
winner
so Before we jump into the verses hope
you guys enjoying the new direction of
the channel if you're liking it be sure
to subscribe and of course that little
Bell get notified new videos are coming
at you I am a bit of a display snob it's
not necessarily the resolution that
matters but the quality of the display
is super important that's your portal to
the phone it doesn't matter what the
specs are how many gigs a ram if you
can't interact with your phone in a way
that looks nice there's very little
reason for me to see you getting a phone
so these are two very different stories
you've got a liquid retina which is
Apple marketing for LCD and we got
Samsung's OLED panels obviously they've
been doing very well
the best compliment that I can give
towards Apple's display do you think of
their LCD panel versus their OLED on the
10s and 10's maxes not as bad as you
think
you gotta actually look at it and use it
you can appreciate it's a really good
LCD panels it's good to compare it to
what's probably the best display going
this is the same panel technology that's
in the galaxy s 10 and the galaxy s 10
plus Samsung makes the best displays
going and it shines on the smaller
screen on the 10 II when you look at
these phones side-by-side you can see a
clear difference and you see the biggest
difference and obviously we'd expected
in black levels looking at something
with a bunch of colors maybe it's not
that noticeable when something's got
black in it the OLED panel just looks so
incredible so it comes to notch I don't
mind it as long as it's there for a
reason obviously on the 10r it's housing
the true depth sensor which gives you
face ID so it's there for a reason
I am in the camp though that I prefer
the hole punch and might be because it's
new it's kind of haven't seen it for a
whole generation of phones but I like
the way it looks and an old fairness
Apple there isn't really another phone
that could go up against Samsung and
display category and even send its
chance
two cameras versus one on the backs of
these two phones so they both have the
same wide angle what the s10 has is the
ultra wide angle which I think you see a
lot more versatility for cameras so I
feel like we're reaching kind of like a
peak camera here and day to day I didn't
notice that much of a difference the
pictures looked at good coming out of
both phones
there were times though when I was
appreciative to have that ultra wide
sensor on the Tenny what I wanted to get
all my kids together or a picture of my
whole family it's nice to have that
extra functionality and flexibility even
if you don't use it every day to make
former versatile camera experience I
take a lot of pictures in portrait and I
feel like the only limiting factor that
I found with the 10r
was only being able to take portrait
shots of people other than that I didn't
feel limited versus the 10s max and
usually I use on a daily basis on the
front the true depth sensor is really
impressive on the iPhone 10 R and it
gives you I think one of the best
features of the phone and that is face
ID but the front cameras on both are
kind of blah so the processing is one of
the area's really comes down to a
personal preference if you like the HDR
look you're gonna gravitate immediately
to the iPhone if you like sort of more
poppy vivid colors and the Samsung is
absolutely going to be your jam and I
kind of go back and forth into both
camps I think today though sir I'm more
partial to the poppy colors that I'm
getting out of the Samsung but don't say
they are better pictures they just look
better to my eye so both of these
cameras are used for more than just
Stills videos a big deal as well so
here's a sample coming out of both the
video looks equally good shooting at 4k
60 but there is some difference with the
processing how you're gonna view the
image so here sample is coming out of
both you can let us know which one you
prefer
so picking up an iPhone that ten are
included you know it's an iPhone Apple
is attention to detail to how the phone
feels in the hand is incredible
there's not much out that I can touch
through the visceral feel of holding an
iPhone and Samsung has come really close
with a galaxy s 10 line of devices I
love the way both phones feel in the
hand the hardware front the Samsung
packed pretty much everything into the
s10 including a headphone jack which you
know is a big deal for a lot of people
also things in here maybe didn't think
that you wanted things like reverse
wireless charging it's nice to have
especially if you wanna you don't charge
up your brand-new air pods or Galaxy
buds it's a great way to be able to
charge up something else out bringing a
battery pack perhaps when the biggest
advantages though of the 10r is face ID
I love face ID I love it for payments I
love the friend locking my phone when I
love it for the ease of use and security
it is awesome and probably one of the
biggest selling points for why people
would pick up a ten are over the 10 e on
the east side there's no in screen
fingerprint reader like you've got on
the big brothers they moved it to the
side it actually feels really good and I
kind of wonder why Samsung ever even
bothered in the past putting it on at
the back it makes sense on the side it's
quick on the side and I find myself not
even missing the in screen one on the 10
and a 10 plus I hate my phones pretty
hard also like my brightness a little
bit brighter so battery life is a big
deal for me I charge my films at night
so I want to get through a full day I
had a better battery life on the s10 II
that I did on the 10 hour at the exactly
the same usage and it was about 10
percent ish depending on the day so if
battery life is a big deal for you you
definitely may want to consider the 10 e
over the 10 R or you know just turn your
brightness down and close some apps
I said before I get to the winner these
are both really good phones and people
are picking them up for obvious reasons
so on the Tenny obviously I'd like the
extra flexibility I have with that
second sensor on the 10r I forgot how
much I like fake sighting you think
about how often you unlock your phone on
an hourly or a daily basis fact that
it's unlocking every time easily and
securely can overstate importance of
that and these verses come down to what
they always come down to your preference
on iOS versus Android assuming you don't
have an OS Allegiance
if both of these phones are on the table
I'm gonna pick up the Galaxy S 10 e not
only am I getting better value for the
dollar I'm getting better cameras and
better battery life and for me that's
worth the money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
