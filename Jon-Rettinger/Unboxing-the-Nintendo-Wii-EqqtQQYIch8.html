unboxing for you of the Nintendo Wii for
those you that follow my channel or
visit TechnoBuffalo you'll know we've
been running a console war series
between the Xbox and Playstation 3 lt's
been doing those doing a fantastic job
I thought the Wii wasn't getting the
attention that it deserves especially
being the console theater and majority
of parts of the world let's go ahead and
get to the unboxing and see what we got
inside it's a very small box only for a
very small console so we on the front
with a few little circles of pictures
telling you the games that come with Wii
Sports which is of course included very
short a minimalistic design wee-wee on
the front and again telling you that we
sports is included and a picture of the
console let's go ahead and open it up
and see what comes inside also when I
picked up the we also got the new Super
Mario Brothers which I'll be showing you
in a later video looks to be a pretty
fun game so we've got these nicely
numbered boxes within a box so we've got
one and two so we'll pull out one first
and let's see what we have inside things
light comes down to tray so here is like
a substantial book Wii Sports comes in a
whole sort of sleeve and a very
impressive looking user guide what is so
sickening operations manual has anybody
ever looked at the operations manual and
for any console it seems like a waste of
paper alright let's take a look at see
what else we have we have like these
stand for the console so you can choose
to stand it up it goes right in there
it's got a a Plexiglas piece on the
bottom to keep it a little more stable
you've got your standard cabling your
normal AV cable this is not a
high-definition console so composite or
component will work just fine let's like
we've got one of the
nunchuck controllers which the funny
names we were seeing the Nunchuk you
know it's got two things on the side two
chain in the middle but this is one part
is called the nunchuck so there's that
keep digging into it we got you got
little sticky things don't know what
that's for but there they are I think
we've got your sensor bar as well this
attaches to your television and it's
sort of what the Wiimote the controller
just see in a minute uses to record the
sensor since the Wii uses a motion
sensing control system so that was box
one nothing really exciting and there
let's see what comes in box two and see
if that is a little better looks like
two is where all the action happens all
right so we've got some batteries Maxell
batteries
sort of brand-name sort of not we've got
the Wii power brick which is ginormous
um almost the size of the console itself
quite big put that off to the side we've
got it's like the Wii Remote that we
were just talking about let's take a
look at this and it comes in a sort of a
rubber protective sleeve
no we MotionPlus it comes with it that's
a little add-on that comes with Wii
Sports Resort you can buy it separately
for I believe 20 bucks but it does have
a nice plastic thing on and see I'm
pulling it through your TV or you can
hold onto a little bit better and the
strap to prevent it from doing any
damage and the console itself which is
the main feature of the box the
packaging is quite nice very easy to to
get around nice presentation so here's
the Wii console quite small actually
very impressed with how small this is
especially for what it does so there's
the front of the Wii you guys have
probably all seen that certainly isn't
the newest of unboxings we jet got a
little slot there for SD cards reset and
power and of course where your slot
loading DVD all those does not play DVDs
ATI graphics Nintendo branding and that
sort of weird slice off of it I got your
power that's where the center bar plugs
into two USB ports and your power and I
believe there's also a spot right here
for Gamecube gov connectivity case you
have an old Gamecube you can still play
your old GameCube games that's about it
guys just a short unboxing for you of
