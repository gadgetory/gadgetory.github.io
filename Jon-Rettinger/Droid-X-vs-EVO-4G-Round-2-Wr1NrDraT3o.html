technobuffalo here and welcome to part
two of the android smartphone smackdown
in round one week covered screen call
quality and speaker battery text entry
browser speed and operating system in
this round we are going to cover the
camera qualities both still in video the
designs of the phone themselves
multimedia and miscellaneous specs so
sit back relax and let's see who's the
king of Android alright let's go ahead
and jump into camera both of these sort
of sport very high-tech cameras both
have 8 megapixel sensors with dual LED
flashes so you can see there's a
megapixel sensor on the EVO and there it
is on the droid x you can see the LED
flashes on each go ahead and jump out of
that so one thing that i should mention
too is going to color come into play is
the evo has a front facing 1.3 megapixel
camera so i'm gonna go ahead and put up
some sample video of pictures of beating
you guys can beat a judge what you think
looks a better picture and video quality
you
All Right see the both thing recorded
exactly the same time pretty normal
light conditions you can see sort of
what you look like
you
All Right see the both being recorded
exactly the same time pre normal light
conditions you can see sort of what each
look like
okay so picture and video quality using
the 8 megapixel sensor is pretty darn
close they both look very very similar
one of the big differences here and I
mentioned just a few minutes ago is
addition to the front facing camera on
the EVO 4G it is a 1.3 megapixel camera
so it's a pretty capable camera but
taking the whole ability to video chat
out of it the fact you can sort of take
your self portraits of a bit more
accuracy or take a video with a bit more
accuracy and sort of seeing yourself or
see what you want to show definitely
gives the edge to the evo certainly
considering that camera to video quality
it looks to be very close but that's not
the only determining factor here let's
talk about the camera interfaces since
motorola and HTC sort of put their own
take on how you interact with the camera
then go and show you what that looks
like so we'll jump into camera here it's
the same thing for a video as well so
you get a sort of a few options i'll go
ahead and put say my keys in here so we
have sort of a subject to focus on and
if i look at then you can sort of see
what the choices are going to be can
turn the flash on or off it certainly
zoom in if you'd like you can jump into
photo or video are you get some complex
options here so you have you've got
brightness you've got your contrast
saturation or sharpness you can pick
some effects if you like and you can see
ur jump at the settings widescreen you
can pick the resolution even some ISO
settings there as well oh it's just
pretty huh pretty advanced for a camera
phone so we'll go ahead and jump out of
this let's take a look at how Motorola's
implemented their camera so i'll go
ahead and do the same thing jump into
camera and see what we have here it's a
very sort of different take on the same
thing so they've got something called
scenes i wanted to sort of pick how you
want to look at things so auto portrait
landscape we'll go ahead and jump back
and see what sort of differences for
each get some effects as well so normal
black and white turn the flash on or off
or switch to both have really good at
focusing mechanisms in the picture
quality like we saw is very close
the joint excerpt gives you more general
options i'd say for novices whereas if
you're a sort of a serious photographer
and you left your DSLR oh and you have
to use your camera or use your phone are
you going to get a bit more options ISO
settings contrast ratio of you know
white levels and balances so if
therefore you have the options to do i
think the evo has got to take the camera
round because the interface and the
front-facing camera so we'll go ahead
and jump on to the next category which
is going to be design how are things
going to look when you woke them out of
your pocket so let's go ahead and talk
about size of these 4.3 inch devices are
very very big and if you look at these
next to each other almost makes the evo
4g look small and how can that be when
they both have the same screen size well
look at them next to each other I sort
of line up the bottoms and you can see
that there is a difference here with the
droid x definitely is a bit larger and
if I hold them next to each other in
side-by-side you can really see that
difference you can see that there is
also that hump from a thinnest
standpoint they're both very close but
that hump whether love it or hate it is
definitely an aesthetic difference and
is going to make the droid x be actually
bigger in it for a 4.3 inch phone that's
already going to be quite incredible Jin
your pocket you could have even a larger
one with the droid x so there are some
other differences as well you've got
capacitive buttons across the bottom do
your controls we actually a physical
buttons here on the droid x now
generally I have not been a big fan of
the passive bug Fred sins on the nexus
one they weren't very responsive now
should have found that on most devices
they're not very responsive however on
the EVO 4G they work great I haven't had
any issues with them whatsoever turn the
physical buttons work just as well both
tabs are dedicated some camera
functionality the evo 4g also sports a
kick sand in case you want to watch the
multimedia i'll just quite nice on the
screen that big you're not going to sort
of get that same thing with the droid x
now that hump maybe to sort of make it
look a little bit flat on a surface and
less sort of moving around as we see
another device it does sit very well and
the camera sort of jutting out you gets
her that classic
droid look on the back without the
initial droid the back is not metals
from a soft touch plastic but from a
design standpoint which one looks better
certainly I think that has to go to the
evo 4g the phones both phones look great
but if i'm going to use something that's
got a 4.3 inch we don't want it to be as
small as possible from a small miss
standpoint the evo 4g is definitely
going to take that all right so let's
talk about multimedia here both support
hdmi out for connection to TV or your
computers which is really nice kids you
want to watch a movie or something or a
video clip that you made you can go
ahead and watch it right on your TV
however the droid x supports DLNA which
is a digital living network of lion
allows you to watch media on other DN la
devices such as TVs or laptops so it's
really a nice plus it also has
blockbuster built in they've actually
download movie is right from Harry can
see Blockbuster right there we saw that
I believe on the hd2 as well to get sort
of another way to view content on here
in addition so we talked about earlier a
little bit of a nicer spring makes
multimedia viewing on the droid x a
little bit of a better experience so
let's talk about Spectras real quickly
these things are very close but i
couldn't in a good conscience talk about
both these devices without mentioning
that the evo 4g is called 4g for a
reason does support 4th generation of
wireless networks which are noticeably
faster so about talking about megabits
per second and getting to the actual
sort of nitty-gritty just know that 4g
can be up to 10 times faster than 3G
networks so you have the option of being
on a 4G network if you're have service
where those aren't Spence rolling out
more and more with the droid x you're
sort of limited to just the 3g which is
great for most people but it's nice to
have the option so if we're talking
about some respects and you sort of
miscellaneous intangibles I have to give
around to the evo 4g just for having 4th
generation wireless technology and
having me out computer views it or not
use it so for everybody keeping track
here's how the rounds broke down the
droid x came out strong it took screen
call quality and speaker battery life
and text entry the evo 4g swung a ride
back taking browser speed i'll be tied
in the operating system the evo took the
still camera i took the video camera
took the design the droid came back with
multimedia and that miscellaneous specs
the addition of the 4g is what gave the
droid are getting the evo 4g rather the
edge in the end for the final total of
droid x 5 evo 4g six and one round is a
time so we still have the reigning king
as the evo 4g now that does not mean by
any stretch of the imagination that the
droid x is a inferior phone just sir
there are some intangibles that give the
evo 4g a bit of an edge if you want to
pick up a droid x you're going to get a
fantastic very capable device on a
really reliable network so really there
are no losers here if you have to pick
one of these phones it's like picking
between chocolate or ice cream both are
going to taste delicious and you're
going to end up with a delicious treat
on no matter which one you go for so
