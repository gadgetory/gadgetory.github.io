from TechnoBuffalo and today I thought
it'd be cool to share with you guys our
top 5 apps improve your camera
experience on Android now there are
hundreds maybe even thousands of photo
and video apps on the Google Play Store
but we believe these are the best right
now so let's go ahead and get started
now the first one on our list is google
camera it's free from the Google Play
Store and it's pre-installed on devices
like the Google Nexus 5 and the Google
Nexus 6 it's very simple to use and are
very few settings to mess with if you're
using a Samsung and HTC or an LG device
and want something simplistic just use
this one
it offers HDR a timer panorama photos
and of course photosphere now
photosphere allows users to create
amazing 360 degree photos now there's
not much you can do with the Google
camera in terms of settings but it's a
great camera app alternative nonetheless
number two is camu it's also free from
the Google Play Store and what's unique
about this app are the unique live
filters which you can see right away in
either photo or video mode and when you
launch the app you're greeted with a
camera and you can either swipe right or
love to change filters and you've got
other shooting modes or effects when you
press on this button here you can shoot
it in a few different collage modes and
you can also shoot in square so you can
frame it just right for Instagram it's
got a clean interface that are really
like very much like the Google camera
app and it offers different effects and
filters that other stock camera apps
don't offer now other than those live
filters you can edit the pictures add
text add blur and also add another layer
filter if you want Khemu is a great
secondary camera if you want to have fun
in use filters number three is Photoshop
Express now if you're more towards
editing rather than shooting pictures
and of course with a name like Photoshop
you already know what to expect but
what's really cool about Photoshop
Express is the UI and functionality it's
straightforward and icons are very
familiar if you've ever used Photoshop
for desktop now you can add filters you
can crop rotate and flip the image you
can also mess with the contrast sharpen
and mess with the highlights and shadows
and many many more now a lot of these
are basic editing tools but Photoshop
Express pretty much has everything down
the app also supports RAW files so if
you've got a few RAW files laying around
your computer transfer it over and start
editing on the go probably the best
feature I found on this is the ability
to remove
Lema shoes now nobody's ever perfect
well I just got a little too deep but
with the magic of Photoshop say goodbye
to your annoying pimples and hope that
they never come back
surprisingly this feature works really
well on mobile and if you're looking for
a very very powerful editing app and
you're familiar with Photoshop on
desktop this app is the way to go
also it's free on the Google Play Store
so that's a plus number four is vsco cam
the app with the best filters now some
might disagree with me but I find this
app to be the best when it comes down to
filters the colors and the effects
gives my images or certain look I really
like and it just makes my photos pop
vsco cam is free and you can also
purchase more filters if you wanted and
it's available for most Android 4.0 and
above devices visco is also versatile
and that it lets you shoot with its
built-in camera interface or you can
also import images from your gallery now
once you have your images imported you
can get to the fun stuff when you first
download visco you won't have all of
these filters I've done already that I
bought but a handful came pre-installed
that you can play around with
now the presets aren't all that
descriptive so you're just expected to
just try them out and see what they do
and you also have your traditional
settings and tweaks like exposure and
yet contrast and more
there's also simple tools like cropping
and rotating your images but what makes
vsco cam better than the other editing
apps
well I found that the filters are better
than most apps and the whole interface
is just very user friendly it's super
easy to navigate through the settings
and you can buy more filters that I
believe are worth it
I bought probably $6 to $8 worth of
filter already and I'm glad I did try it
out see if you like it it's free so
there's really no harming giving it a
try now last but not least is canon
master kinah master allows you to edit
your videos just like you would on your
computer so if you've ever used iMovie
Final Cut or Premiere Pro Kenna master
will look familiar to you
you have your basic timeline where you
can import footage or photos and you
have the ability to then add transitions
titles lower thirds and different video
filters to add spice to your videos you
have your monitor on the upper left to
see the video in real time and within
your timeline is where you can press on
a clip and your settings will
essentially pop up and this is where you
can add effects and filters cut the clip
and more this is where your settings and
tweaks will live the circular buttons on
the right hand side is where you
add your music photos videos change
themes and you'll be able to record
video audio and take a photo directly
from the app kinah master is free but
the only caveat here is you have that
silly watermark in your video so if you
want that out of your video you have to
pay $4.99 a month or $40 a year which is
quite a bit
I would rather pay for the app straight
up rather than paying monthly for a
subscription service anyways that's it
