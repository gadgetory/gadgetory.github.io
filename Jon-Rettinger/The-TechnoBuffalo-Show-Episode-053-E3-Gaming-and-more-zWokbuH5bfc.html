the show's started everyone welcome as
Joey hit just as microphone well the
53rd episode the technical Buffalo show
on one of your to house for today Sean
ani editor and chief of the site I'm
joined by executive editor of gaming
joey davidson hello how are you man it's
been a while anyway we talked Italy but
we talk all the time just like I thanks
Joe again this Joey guy what's he gonna
whine about now everything everything
I'm having to walk to a conference oh
shut up man his right mark I did not
envy you so Joey is on the show this
week as III has wrapped up and he's made
his way home and hopefully gotten at
least one good nights of sleep and since
he returned nope conferences are always
so much fun but so he is back and so
this week we're going to be tackling
what he saw III our thoughts on various
games and announcements and so let's
just jump into it on a grand macro scale
what were your feelings of this year's
show oh well I enjoyed it um I think it
was a rough year for Nintendo but I
think it was a really good year for sony
and microsoft and even the pc platform
got a lot of love which is really
awesome it was a strong year it was
really crowded there man this is a
really really crowded show and i think
that counts for something like 55,000 or
some crazy number like that but it was
good good yeah was there anything that
really just made you sit back and go
whoa um well not you know not not really
and I say that with kind of a little
pause I think the VR stuff was awesome I
think that there are some really awesome
upcoming games but unfortunately the
best looking games were the ones that
didn't offer hands-on playtime a lot of
that was hands
and I'm speaking specifically about
fallout for that game horizon zero dawn
worst title ever that game looks amazing
but nothing nothing that I actually
physically got my hands on was that
tremendous no just kind of weird this
year I guess I don't know that was an
odd thing for me Oh battlefront was good
i guess i played that and mirrors edge
was good too it's all starting to flood
back Sean it's all everything that I
have kind of you know pushed aside as a
trauma year you're bringing it back up
would you like to lay down on the couch
and we'll we'll walk you back through
your couch right there man yes well
we'll just walk you back through the
traumas that you experienced at e3
hypnotize me first I now yeah well then
you know that you spend the rest of the
episode clucking like a chicken still
better than time so whatever okay well a
question from such of the hall which I'm
sure probably crossed your mind and
enough I crossed my mind uh so red dead
seek will be at e3 2016 you know for for
how many games the gaming community got
this year that they wanted and we'll
talk about this more later um aya I'm
giving up hope for red dead and for
banjo kazooie I feel like rock stars
probably making a red dead somewhere
somehow they have to be I mean that was
a really big license for them and it
made them at what can only be described
as a butt ton of money yeah so it's
coming and I hope that they're going to
do it for pc properly out of the gate
like even better than GTA 5 hopefully
but I don't know we'll see maybe not i
compared to Arkham Knight with its with
its amazing pc launch no thanks although
you did you did tweet out that amazing
photo the other day of being up in the
clock tower well then I'm playing on
PlayStation 4 like it it's not that it's
pretty good on PlayStation 4 like it's
it's the frame rate is steady at 30
frames per second with like very few
dips if at all I mean maybe in like high
combat
explosion segments but you just get
inside interior of a clock tower and
there's like a full-on downpour and
you're just like it there's no holes why
is it raining so yeah it's just
condensation buildup in the clock tower
not a condensation man yes exactly my
father used to work when he was in the
Navy he actually worked at the base
where the Hindenburg came in okay and
they had hangers so large that clouds
would form up in the tops of the hangars
it rang her yes grandma yeah it's really
cool so it actually does happen however
I think the clock tower is just a glitch
but you never know so you went through
how was it especially with the extra
press conferences annoying yeah like um
well I think the good thing is that for
for gamers for fans a lot of times with
with companies like square enix and
Bethesda you're relying on writers like
me to get secondhand information about
the games themselves but you didn't have
that here that's my phone I'm sorry um
you didn't have that here so you got
first-hand information and a lot of
times Bethesda and Square Enix
especially they're they're big on the
eyes oo are the eyes on like hands-off
demos so you saw exactly what I probably
would have seen this year anyway i can
remember the year that Skyrim came out
it was an eyes off presentation that
year so for you guys it's awesome for us
the writers i could have done without
the press conferences entirely I'm what
if they were just like livestream doll
on Nintendo Direct I probably would have
been pretty excited about that because
that means I didn't have to make
appointments and I didn't have to go
anywhere which would have been great but
you know getting the invitation and
turning them down its kind of that's not
a good thing so we do have a quick
question we need to address from a todd
haselton where's Todd uh well due to
popular demand we removed him from the
show yeah permanently
it's truly can't do it we're actually
going to bring in Todd's dog Mabel to
replace them uh I've okay uh
technobuffalo Twitter account just
tweeted out a link to our show in
Russian yes they are addressing that
right now we're not quite sure why it's
in Russia where we're not other
particular out how that happened and it
took a hit at the most interns that's
amazing a very important question I
don't know if you actually got any
hands-on time with this from Michael vez
el xbox elite controller with it or not
uh well okay for me no for you folks who
really really enjoy that like hardcore
crazy customizable controller yeah I
could see it being worth your time the
price tag alone is is way too steep for
my blood so I think it's like 150 bucks
but I mean it's fully customizable
that's kind of and crazy so I'm down
with the idea um but the price man
that's gonna keep me away but if you
have that type of money and you want a
really well-built controller that's
really customizable I can't see any
reason to say don't get it you know what
I mean it's actually pretty awesome
pretty awesome piece of hardware yeah it
looked great and I honestly what drove
me away even quicker than the price it
drove me away before I knew the price
was the little silver paddles I'm like
okay wait I'm not an octopus have you
ever used this before I have not okay so
they're real they're actually really
nice I mean like you keep your when I
put my hands on on a controller I'm kind
of like holding my hands up here they
sit like this and these fingers are back
here and so rather than worrying about
my moving my thumb to hit the reload
button or throw grenade or switch
weapons you just put it all down here so
if your fingers on the sticks you can
just kind of use these fingers to reload
and whatever functions you might be
using okay I could see that I didn't
realize it would allow
you to take power away from like the XY
abs right so with halo this is the first
time I ever did this I camera which halo
was my roommate and I were like oh they
just they just released a controller
configuration called bumper jumper and
it's where they move the bumper from or
the jumping function from the a button
up to the right bumper so you're
shooting in your jumping role on the
same thing and it was really easy to
like run and jump and shoot without
having to change your aim people who
learned how to use this gun crazy good
oh god you imagine that but just like a
controller specifically built for that
gotcha okay cool so we've got a lot of
questions coming in here we've got one
from brazen Franco who was very excited
to see that you were on the show Reggie
let's slip I like how we just now refer
to him as Reggie meaning Reggie filim a
from Nintendo Reggie let's slip out that
Nintendo's developing a new home console
during a press question at e3 can I
consider that the NX is the next sent
into home console enjoy avoid the wii u
now what are the odds the NX will be
retro compatible okay um that's a pretty
crazy question so let's try to unpack it
because I think it's a good one maybe we
should start with what Reggie said
because i think i read the same
interview that you did it he referenced
a home console he didn't say that the NX
was that home console and i don't think
we're gonna see that console in 2016 I
imagine it's going to be 2017 Nintendo
typically unveils one year has a full
year of like press previews and whatever
else and then releases after the e3 of
the following year so if you look at the
wii u i can remember the dates let's
pretend it was in veiled in 2010 and it
came out in 2011 that's typically how it
works so next year at e3 we're going to
see the NX whatever it happens to be and
then we'll see it in 2017 is my bed
console makers don't really do the three
months turn around it for a major reveal
that's a little crazy so let's say that
to start um as for what the NX is I've
heard a lot of different things I've
heard that it is a single platform
heard that it is a console / handheld
device something capable of playing TV
quality games on the go but then also
being able to bring it home and sort of
set it on your you're like media center
or whatever and just and just plugging
into your TV and going that way I've
heard that it's something like that
which kind of makes sense given the
gamepad I mean it's basically the Wii U
gamepad just removing the need to stay
within range of your console which would
be pretty awesome especially if Nintendo
can power it up quite a bit more because
I think that's one of the things that's
sort of held the way back from the the
public mind share is that it was just
everyone looked at and said oh it's
slightly better than an xbox 360 so
there's that backwards compatibility I
think that's the trickiest question
Nintendo's done backwards compatible
systems all the way back to the game boy
bands pretty much every single one
they've really since then except for the
Gamecube 264 every single one that they
really since then has had backwards
compatibility this is a company that's
that's it's sort of won a lot of
consumer trust because when you do
upgrade to their library one of their
big selling points is by the Nintendo
3ds it also plays all of your DS games
and dsi games and DSiWare or whatever it
was I can't see them getting rid of that
feature so would that all said coming
back to your question about should you
wait um that's up to you right now the
Smash Brothers community is probably at
its pitch with the wii u and i would say
the same for splatoon and if these are
two games that you really really want to
play when that there are height of play
especially splatoon you need to get the
Machine sooner rather than later if
you're the type of person who maybe
wants to ingest these down the line and
doesn't really give a crap about the
online component which I would say is a
bad idea for split soon because it's
massively online um you can wait I I
don't think there's a mistake happening
here and even as someone who really
likes that we use catalog if it is
backwards compatible I could see waiting
and I could see being okay with that but
the thing about Nintendo games and
especially stuff like Pikmin 3 they go
out of print and Nintendo has been
really stingy about adding things
digitally
when it comes to backwards compatibility
they do it on a week by week basis so I
mean you have a choice to make look at
the lineup now for the wii u and say to
yourself do I want these games that are
out now like a Pikmin 3 or wonderful 101
if you can wait wait if you can't get it
it is the cheapest system so that it has
that going forward as well and i imagine
by this holiday we might even have
another price cut on her hand so some
big question I'm sorry well I I wanted
to circle back for a second to something
you said earlier when we talked about
the red dead redemption sequel you said
that we got a lot of long-awaited games
this year and of course the biggest that
being the Last Guardian finally being
shown on screen one of them I don't know
if I'd call that the day yes well okay
it may be not the biggest but it was
definitely one of them the highlights of
the entire week I felt you know finally
we saw you know something about it now
the streams were extremely choppy during
gameplay segments they were great for on
stage with gameplay segments were choppy
judging only by watching it on the
stream you were there in person the
judging by the stream it looked like a
ps2 game to me um well have you played
shadow of the colossus turvy aurico hey
I played shadow the classes back in the
day yells shadow the classes had a
gorgeous art design and art aesthetic um
even its HD version on the playstation 3
isn't like that gorgeous or whatever I
mean it's it's a beautiful game but it's
not like the most graphically stunning
thing ever and on the playstation 2 i
can remember horrible frame rates and
tons of screen lag and everything else
so i think that team ego has a pension
for being really ambitious with their
games and so that huge scale tends to
make it so that graphically i am not
making fun of you Sean or anything like
that I just hate when I hate when that's
the direction of the discussion because
it to me the graphics are huge and I'm
they're important but like it's not it's
not the fulcrum for the entire enjoyment
no I honestly I ninety-nine percent of
the time I would agree with you
completely but when game has been in
development
for this many years I'd argue that
that's that that's making it worse
because this is a PlayStation 3 game
this is a PlayStation 3 game that the
team has decided we needed to get this
on the PlayStation 4 so yes it has it's
going to have some graphical challenges
and were developed for the PlayStation 4
out right we might have something closer
to again horizon zero dawn then then
then shadow the classes but we have
something in between that said in person
on screen that looked a little washed
out but that's kind of the color palette
for 14 eco games so other than the color
palette it look good i mean you know
feathers on dogbert bear thing looks
awesome is that is that the day we're
going with for the ding dog bird bath
thing yeah sure Griffen Griffen dog
makes me think about a man bear pig yeah
Griffin off from South Park um speaking
of south park they may have won the
entire III with the name of their sequel
game yeah but which I suppose we can say
on the show because it is a title sure
what was it the fractional butthole yeah
fractured butthole but just be clear
every what it was comma butt hole
arranging that always funny the I did
you do you watch always sunny hey I do
so when Danny DeVito is singing gotta
save the boy's soul from the troll gotta
pay the troll toll in order to save the
boy soul yes that's adoro might be a
great question from outer craft the the
game that was on a lot of people's lips
have either of you played no man's sky I
have a salt played in person and I did
not get a chance to play it they were
pretty they're pretty selective about
invites for that one and it was it was
in several places that I was near it if
that makes you feel good I did not have
time to play it it looks gorgeous um I'm
really excited about that game i do want
to preface what I'm about to say with
with that and I'm going to play it I'm
going to buy it um I'm a little bit
nervous for its focus and and how it
feels in real time
and what I wind up doing in it I think I
think with no man's sky the first 5 10
20 hours i'm probably going to really
love it and I'm questioning how I'm
gonna feel 20 30 40 hours is this a game
that I'm gonna play forever kind of like
minecraft or is this a game that I'm
going to explore for 20 hours and think
okay I got my money's worth that that's
kind of where I am with that game I'm
excited for it though and I think that
that hello games is doing some big
things which is admirable in and of
itself so yeah I'm uh I'm nervous too
I'm worried that lacks of focus I'm not
you know I'm not worried about the the
focus thing it has enough I think it has
enough of that to drive me but I'm
worried about how far I'm willing to be
driven that's that's where I am mm I
don't know I'd like you I there's still
no question I'm gonna get and how
excited were you to see more cuphead
really excited i was really said they
got stage time too yeah i'm so looking
forward to that game mm-hmm was that it
was 30 when i interviewed them last year
so it's like they went from having 13
seconds of time in microsoft's like
sizzle reel to having actual stage time
in one year and i went to a game
showcase on monday night and we're all
playing games and the line for cup head
was ridiculous ridiculous I mean it's
gonna it's gonna be popular at least it
just based on it to look alone so ya
know it looks so good yeah so good from
brazen Franco starting to get worried
about the ff7 remake rumor circulating
or saying they could end up being a
simplified third person action game like
FF 15 and not the difficult turn-based
awesome game it originally was what are
your opinions I think that you should
read a story written by ron duwell on
our site about getting your expectations
in check for something like this Ron hit
the nail on the head I think that it's
going to be a remake and I'm excited for
that but at the same time the final
fantasy 7 port is coming out as well so
you're going to have both if you want a
final fantasy 7 with just
same exact game with HD graphics I don't
think that's gonna exist but I you know
I don't know what they're going to do I
don't I and and I hope to god it's not a
13 or 13 a third person action game that
just doesn't make any sense and that's
not what we all played but it is going
to be different and I think that there
I'll go on the record now is saying that
no matter what someone is going to be
pissed off about something like that
yeah that's just that's just the
question of your works yeah I mean it's
just it's just the way it works I'm just
hopeful that they as long as they keep
the core mechanics in place like that
turn-based difficulty combat or whatever
turn-based combat was good i mean line
combat was kind of the homework a final
fantasy back in that era then I want
more of that so hopefully it's it stays
so Braun brought up a great point in a
recent article about do we now have to
take the certain large event at the end
of disc 1 and considered a spoiler again
I hope so we all now have to avoid
mentioning that large final fantasy 7
moment well I mean there's only
generation players here I'm sure that I
wouldn't even be surprised and this is
not insulting I wouldn't even be
surprised if more than fifty percent
that people watching now never even play
final fantasy seven it came out a long
time ago yeah yeah no I totally agree i
I just I fight it but do we hold it in
the same I mean people mentioned Darth
Vader's Luke Skywalker's father on a
daily basis you know no we it's not in
that it's not in that tier everyone seen
Star Wars not everyone's played final
fantasy as counter singing star wars
yeah man I'm waiting until he gets to
the age where like I want that sorry I
move my camera I want that moment that
Luke I'm your father moment to
absolutely ruin him I will not want him
to be like fully because i can remember
i can remember my dad waited until I was
like six or seven to watch that movie
and it just man i like it like didn't
trust anything i saw it in the theater
opening night I can remember just
sitting there in the theater going oh
yeah for Michael the sale Joey was there
any games that disappointed in jewett
III oh that's gosh you know there was
one or two um this is a question in like
right people are watching probably
getting in trouble a Star Fox zero
disappointed the crap out of me man I
was our Fox it it looked like the most
dated Wii U game the world's themselves
were really empty it felt really it felt
it felt archaic almost and the motion
control so there's two it was really
weird so like your kind of think like us
will tune almost except not really with
splatoon the moat the the walking is on
the lipstick and the aiming is on the
right stick but it's also on the gamepad
itself but you can turn this off but I
actually left it on because motion
control here is really good so like
you'll you'll do like your macro aiming
on the right stick and then your micro
like you're fine tuning on this and you
can get really fast and super accurate
and it works but it works because the
reticule stays up on the TV screen
you're not looking down at the gamepad
when you're moving Star Fox as a u-turn
that you turn the whole ship this way so
like you're moving you're moving up on
the top of the screen that's where
you're like that's where you're like
acceleration isn't everything else but
then like when it comes time to aim you
have to look down at the gamepad and
like turn and get really precise and by
the time you look up you're running into
other ships because the gamepad's a
cockpit view and it doesn't show you the
sides I don't know man it was just it
was like really even the demo they have
like dim I don't know what to call them
demo assistance I guess it's not the
person driving the demo but they're
staying there with you and they're kind
of like there to make sure you have
settings for questions yeah right so
like even she was just like yeah people
have had a hard time with this all day
and this was by day three of the show
that I our day two of the show that I
played it so like and I was the last
appointment so
she had like 10 people or 1020
appointments before that that were just
like yeah I have no idea what I'm doing
so I mean it's it's that was
disappointing um I'm not gonna write it
off its III man yeah trying to think of
is there anything else that was really
disappointing as really disappointed
with the rare collection I don't want
that like I want thing I want rare games
I want them to get back to making great
new games and I mean there's going to be
that one thieves of the seven seas or
whatever pirate game that is that's not
all i just want banjo kazooie again man
I can I just have that why can't we
bring back the rare that defines so many
of our childhood it's not the rare that
made a bunch of Kinect games and then
Microsoft's like let's try something
else yeah i connect what's that from
such and Bohol and I kind of want to
build off of this are any of you guys
going to get an oculus rift project
Morpheus or valves VR headset when it
comes out what was the generate it
seemed to be downplayed to me and all
the presentations that I had access to
um well vr-zone is a nearly impossible
thing to make exciting at a press
conference mm-hmm it just it just is not
it's not exciting right but in person it
is exciting and I think that the given
the fact that I went to several demos
like the directions in the email that
were just like hey we're at this booth
it's behind the VR section of the show
floor the fact that VR had like freaking
just enormous like football field-sized
section of the show floor God telling um
so yeah I'm excited about it I don't
know what I'm gonna get I probably
sounds crazy probably project Morpheus
and the reason why I say that is because
it's probably gonna be the most
affordable option oculus rift they're
probably gonna be the same price but the
I think the oculus CEO was like you're
going to need a twelve hundred dollar
like 1,200 bucks or 1,500 bucks just to
get going if you have a from-scratch
computer and my computer is terrible
right now so I'm going to be looking at
that price tag in order to get right
excuse me to get in on that but
PlayStation 4 is you know four bucks
plus pro
we have 300 or Morpheus I'm going to put
it around that five hour difference now
not not mentioned here and I realized I
actually not talk to you about this
since the show the hololens demo mm-hmm
what were your thoughts uh it was good I
did not try it at the show but I have
heard that we should lower our
expectations and that that demo was a it
not that it was deceptive but it was a
little far reaching it's not quite as
good as all that really the dumb was
freaking mind blowing though as it was
happening like it was great yeah but I I
was you were there as was Eric Ron and I
were on a skype call and I told Ron I
was like look there's no way there's no
way is as good as what they're showing
right now what they were showing was
life which is crazy um but the what I've
heard is that ok so like the glasses
view that we had take it like this so
what we saw on screen and what you and I
saw like because we the only Holland
stuff that any of us saw was the stuff
that was on a screen and they put the
hololens lens directly on top of the
camera so like this right there was no
peripheral view and what I've heard
about hollow lens is that if if you turn
your I anywhere like and break the
vision on either side of the lens when
you happen to be looking through like
when you look through glasses you can
see to the sides of your glass yeah yeah
what I can yeah so I Kepler right so
imagine imagine looking through glasses
and then you turn your head and the
vision breaks the illusion breaks every
single time that you like look above and
below and to the side of your glasses so
I've heard that that is kind of jarring
and it's sort of ruins the effect i
don't know that's that's what I don't
know I don't know how legitimate that is
i'm excited for hololens though it's
interesting is crap yeah well and Ron
and I were discussing on the call you
know what are the other types of games
that this could go to
basically we feel em you're never
talking strategy games yeah exactly it's
going to be things like civilization
Starcraft would be a stretch but
possibility manner saga could you
imagine instead of controlling them with
like you know like a tactical strategy
game like fire emblem try controlling
with the analog stick like reach in and
grabbing your pieces and moving them
like it's a big giant chessboard cat
gonna be awesome exactly exactly a Sim
City it'd be cool to yeah there's a lot
of possibilities for me vr doesn't
excite me that much I'm excited about it
yeah I'm definitely it's something I'm
definitely gonna sit back and wait to
hear more experiences and finally get to
experience for myself mm-hmm but yeah
from brazen Franco and this was a
question that was on a lot of people's
minds hey Joey how do you feel about the
Kwazii lack of presence of the Vita
during Sony's press conference
personally I'm sad yeah am sad too man I
don't know it's it's it's probably one
of the platforms I play most and that's
mostly because I've been enjoying a lot
across play stuff you know on the one
hand i get i use the crap out of my PS
vita sassone you must be doing something
right but on the other hand i'm i am
also a little bit frustrated with their
release schedules and they release their
sizzle reel and you hit the comments and
there's people who are like yeah PS Vita
and my comment is like man I want more
um you're not giving me enough I want
more stuff like I I love the crap at a
tearaway persona 4 golden and and even
uncharted has it had its high points and
gravity rush all those were amazing
games i I'm kind of angry that we didn't
get to see gravity rush to you know I've
heard that that's in development have
been hearing that for a long time and it
wasn't there and Sony's head Shuhei
Yoshida was just like it's it's we're
treating the PS Vita as he didn't desert
exactly his words but it's a quick play
device is something that that's meant to
played games that are good
in 20 minutes tense and that's cool and
all those have their place but I want
both man I want I want the big
experiences too and those just don't
seem like they're coming anymore and
that is that is a bummer now I a
surprise x hat little and concern Iran
does most of his gaming on his feet up
you can imagine what I was hearing on
the other end of the skype call session
came to an end yeah but yeah it seemed
odd it seemed very odd for Michael the
cell speaking of backwards compatibility
Xbox one is getting it for 360 games but
not all 360 games will be pliable do to
change licenses over time what's up with
that okay um Phil Spencer talked about
this on a podcast video show that
someone was watching in a press room so
we kind of like got a chance to all
watch and learn together very basically
the xbox 360 on the Xbox one is is more
or less emulations so what Microsoft is
managed to do is that they've created an
xbox 360 shell that you will download
onto your xbox one and then the games
will insert into that shell so the xbox
one sees it as playing xbox 360 the game
and then your xbox 360 game is playing
the game that's inserted in got it so
anything there's no work to be done okay
like there's going to be some
stabilization with the emulator itself
but there's no work to be done importing
games over to the Xbox one so it is
entirely up to licensing much child
might be running down the stairs here in
a second thanks so if that happens I'm
sorry so it is entirely up two licenses
entirely up to companies to give
permission for the xbox 360 games that
they created so many years ago to be
sold on the Xbox one now when is it
going to happen I don't know but that
that is what's up with that yeah there's
no work to be done and I can't see very
many companies going you know don't sell
our games again for good ya know Konami
would do it uh quick question from Dan
llegas will you guys be doing more to it
soon yes we will we just don't have a
exact date at the moment also from Dan
hey Joey what are your thoughts on
mirrors edge I assume he means the new
music yes I got to play it and I loved
it um I think I got about 15 minutes
which with it which was a bummer it was
an open-world area one thing that I will
tell you is really cool that I haven't
heard very much about prom i dint maybe
other sites are writing about i don't
know from my demo basically it was you
get dropped into an open-world area
inside Mirror's Edge catalyst and the
world itself is white around you and
yellow if you've ever played mirrors as
you know that the places you can park or
off of or a whore hey buddy sounds
almost sick today that's the way I got
it i'm working dude whoa wrap up here in
just a moment she's leaving he's going
to a doctor's appointment anyway uh it's
it's typically the world's all white and
then the stuff that you can park or off
of is red that's how you know you can
jump from point a to point point p poor
kid haha so like in Mirror's Edge
catalyst it's all white so there's no
like runners vision until you select
something on the map and say like I want
to go here I want to do this goal and
then instead of like in Arkham Asylum
for instance Arkham Knight for instance
we're in the car you get like a dotted
path on the road that says like you
should go this way instead of that the
runners vision shows up and so there's
no like arrows or anything like that
it's just like objects on the ground
turn red like that dumpster in the
distance turns red and then passed it a
wall turns red and it just sort of tells
you like hey this is the direction you
should be heading and it actually works
really well that's my dog I got whole
family here well but even though it's
open world since you can't see the park
or track until you select a destination
don't you feel like that takes oh and
this is just me speaking from your
explanation don't you feel like that
kind of makes it a little bit less open
world no um pretty much
the way that the game has been designed
at least in my very very very small
vertical slice pretty much everything is
park horrible there are some walls that
are very obviously too high so you can
run in any direction in any given time
and you will be able to park or down
services that make sense but when you
have the Waypoint selected it's just
that the best the most sensible parkour
path is the one that's highlighted does
that make sense horrible it's just that
the way that you want to go or the path
that you want to take is highlighted
once you choose your way point I was I
were where that Park horrible was work
it is man god I i I'm out of the loop i
I'm not into my parkour now I'm gonna
put it down after this call from brazen
Franco so what's your opinion yet
another heavily pre-order Triple A game
going down the drain again referencing
to Batman for pc I stopped pre-ordering
games like just don't do it none of us
do it I like but I almost did and you
talked me out of it yeah don't do it
another playstation 4 version the game's
been really good for me but i don't care
i'm willing to go to the store or
download it on day one I will I will
wait for the 12-hour download and
install I will wait for that over the
risk of getting a broken game and not
being able to play it at all ya know and
then you know worst case you get a
broken game and then you sit in your
chair and you like drink a bottle of
brandy and listen all the people
complain about how broken it is like
that's your reward for not pre-ordering
so I'll take that over over playing a
glitchy game any day of the week yeah I
can see your point I just of course as
soon as you told me yesterday it's good
you should get us like I was gonna get
it but then you told me I cancelled my
pre-order why don't you get it now
what's stopping you from getting to now
because now I'm at the point where like
well do I just wait for the game of the
year edition and get all the bonus stuff
yes you should Matt I you know war
brothers is like the worst now like I
though I know that we talked
Ubisoft and EA is like pure evil but
like just step back for a second and
look at Warner Brothers and their
ridiculous amount of pre-order content
they stuffed into Arkham Knight and all
of it retails specific and all of it
platform specific there's where we're
really pissed off right now a bungee in
there and they're collectors edition for
freaking dancing emotes in Destiny's
taking king DLC we are pissed off about
that because they're attached to
Activision and bungee is a big brother
company Warner Brothers not so much I
mean now that they now they are but like
come on how much exclusive content do we
need to stare at before we get that same
level of frustration like it's
ridiculous I was going to play batman
arkham knight no matter what you just
give me more pre-order options is only
angering me and making me want to
recommend it I'd litter Warner Brothers
if you are watching this you literally
just watch me tell someone named Sean to
wait and buy it later because of all
your stupid recommendations and like
presale stuff they're losing sales by
doing this like you dont i dont the the
public's gonna catch on you keep her
loose releasing reloj singh releasing
broken games and at the same time you're
releasing broken games with more
pre-ordering season passes then i can
shake a stick at like something's got to
give here man it's time to move on
speaking of broken games ubisoft came
out on stage they made a somewhat
reference to last year's Assassin's
Creed issues mm-hmm what was the general
feeling at e3 you is everyone still
angry about what happened with it or I
can't speak for everyone no of course
not I can speak for Eric and I were in
the room discussing into the time uh
Eric was excited it for it and I was
like you know count me out I am I am my
guest just like of the ilk that I'm so
sick and tired of broken key I am so
sick and tired of them like I'm just
it's just getting ridiculous and the
reason why I'm angry specifically at
companies like Ubisoft is because
they're doing it to themselves like a
few years back this is like water cooler
crap but whatever i was i was at the
hotel that we stayed we happen to stay
at the same hotel that has like all the
executives from all the various
bony's as well it's just like everyone
stays at these hotels because they're
close to the convention center they're
like walking distance or their shuttles
i'm downstairs getting the coffee from
the lobby bar and next to me are people
who are very obviously middle-aged
executives from ubisoft like they're
wearing their badges it says it on there
they're like that you can don't don't
treat this as like gospel because it's
like tertiary source here but these
people were like literally talking about
how they need their yearly hit they need
their yearly thing they need their
Skylanders they need their call of duty
and that's what we've gotten with
Assassin's Creed and that's why it's so
frickin broken call of duty isn't broken
because it's an on-rails linear
experience it's not literally on Rails
but it's it's it's a corridor shooter
there's nothing they can screw up there
Assassin's Creed is a complex vast array
of systems you know what i mean so it's
like I really seen them every year is
just asking for it and so here they come
with another Assassin's Creed on a
yearly basis and and if if the
announcement of your game includes an
apology for the last game it's time to
slow down and maybe pump the brakes a
little bit and back off and say we
should take a break it's ridiculous that
is an excellent point if you have to
come out go yeah sorry about last year
here's this year's though it's gonna be
great ignore last year's sorry about
that yeah I think you know I didn't walk
away from this year yeah of course he
all we're going to get the assassin's
creed and the the call of duty for this
year but it did feel to me a little bit
like maybe we're pulling away from
everything having to be annualized maybe
maybe now they don't think so it's
making them too much money like it made
them too much money I don't know what
what else can I say they're releasing
broken games and they're selling like
gangbusters what's the point of
releasing games at work like what's the
point don't have any ambition to it and
we're all
lined up going hey we'll buy it again
well one last question before we close
out today and this comes from Dennis
Langston just tuned in so I don't know
if you guys touched on this but what do
you think about Sony starting a
Kickstarter for a game good idea or bad
I debated about writing about this for
the Cyrus haven't gotten to it yet um on
the one hand I think it's it was really
a nice move of Sony to sort of give the
Shenmue guys a chance to announce their
game on a really big stage with a really
big megaphone that bits awesome but
Shenmue 2 costs 70 million dollars in
the year 2000 and then they come up here
for Shenmue 3 and they're like we only
need 2 million from you guys they don't
they need a lot more money than that I
this was basically just a pre-order hype
tool is essentially what it was and
they've secured that it sort of goes
against the core heart of Kickstarter in
my mind which is a platform for little
guys to get noticed and here we have
Shenmue 3 one of the most like called
four games and the entire medium and one
of the biggest console manufacturers in
the world Sony using Kickstarter to fund
a game it's just a little crazy to me it
just doesn't it's not what Kickstarter's
for I find it really weird that two
million dollars is nothing in the grand
scheme of this game it's probably going
to be like two percent of the budget I
just it just seems a little excessive if
they had announced that Kickstarter as a
on freaking Twitter it probably would
have done just as well but instead they
don't need it they like they used so
much of their stage time massively for
smart I was gonna say massively fart
massively smart for Sony here but like
cuz he you know they basically trotted
out a game that they haven't worked on a
Kickstarter that they didn't make like
they spent no money on it they basically
brought it out on stage and they were
like here you go Shenmue 3 and you heard
about it here first the PlayStation
press conference PlayStation 4 life like
that was obviously a really good move
for them but it kind of feels really
shady so
I tend to agree i vacillated on my
opinion since the announcement and as
time is worn on I'm definitely going
into the negative camp now that being
said I haven't played Shenmue or Shenmue
2 so well i'm i mean i'm excited for
driving some forklifts and doing some
shopping working through some gosh upon
machines yeah I i saw that was included
I was like I having not played the first
two games I didn't realize that was the
thing in the game it's it is a reason
why people like these games want me I'm
speaking I don't know kind of turn here
but my personal opinion the reason why
people like these games is because they
tap into what Japanese life is very very
well and for that's kind of awesome I
actually really enjoy it myself so cool
well I think that is going to bring this
