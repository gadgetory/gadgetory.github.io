here if you go through and check out my
videos to notice I don't do that many a
preview but the ones I do are generally
things that I really like and want to
share with you guys and this is one of
those videos the app I want a review is
doom resurrection
I've always got a ton of soft spot in my
heart for doom I remember being really
little and my parents had this garbage
old old old map and I remember calling
id Software the guys who made do almost
on a weekly basis asking when is your
Mac version coming out when is your Mac
version coming out and I've always got
the same answer we don't know coming
soon and I'm so jealous of all my
friends that were playing doom on
windows 3.0 and when it finally came to
Mac I remember how excited I was so the
dude was one of those games that really
I've kind of always got a yeah well
another soft spot in my heart so when I
saw that there was a doom game for the
iPhone I figured I had to give it a
whirl this will run you $9.99 in the App
Store which is just about ten bucks and
of course it'll play on your iPod and
iPod Touch so let me go ahead and show
you what it looks like launches at the
ID software and actually it looked very
similar to doom 3 as far as plot and
stuff goes and this actually game was
built just for the iPhone it wasn't a
port of another game it's got some nice
music in the background let me just pull
the camera in and one of the nice things
I like about this game is you can pause
right where you are and resume at
another time so go ahead hit resume and
I'll show you how things work and the
quality of the game the graphics wise
really is fantastic it looks almost ps1
ish
PSP quality I mean it really does look
very good or maybe a little bit shade
below that but for the iPhone it's
fantastic and this is again on a 3GS so
the control scheme is actually pretty
cool and relatively unique and worked
very well so the way it works is you
tilt your phone and it moves accordingly
actually it's pretty accurate as I tilt
it'll move so what's wrong - talking to
me hit ignore him so the guys coming
I can shake the controller you heard oh
so you move it around just by using the
accelerometer and it's actually pretty
accurate now at Auto adjust where you
want to be you fire using this big fire
button down below so I'll do right now
reload hitting a reload button up top
they did a really nice job taking a very
difficult control scheme for a
first-person shooter I think without any
physical buttons I made it very easy to
use so there's a fire button the guys
talk to you but there's a fire button
there's what the weapons button at the
top you can see how much ammo you have
left how much health you have you could
pick up items just by tapping on them
and it really just does work well and
some very fun game I really recommend it
there's a guy that's I blew him up with
a shotgun but you can just see that it's
a very fun game and seems to be I'm just
gonna pause it it does seem to be pretty
in-depth I'm a couple levels in some
that there are many more levels to go
and you can always tell a bit controls
if it gets a little off for you takes a
few minutes to get used to but you
definitely will it's a little bit on the
expensive side
I know but looking for a fun immersive
game that you know that you can pause
and come back to later Doom Resurrection
really is a great way to go and I highly
recommend it
plus it's do them on your iPhone mat if
you're like me you've always kind of
loved doing those first-person shooter
games it's a great way to always kind of
bring that genre with you in your pocket
so if you guys enjoyed and one last
thing that I want to mention I know
everybody kind of likes free stuff I'm
giving away an Apple TV there's a
company called moon fruit that does web
hosting and they offer you some web
building tools and are giving away a
MacBook Pro for giving away one a day
for I think ten days you may have seen a
lot of people Twitter about it I believe
all you have to do to enter is just put
the pound sign or you know call the
hashtag moon fruit M oon F ruit add in
any sort of Twitter post and you're
entered to win so pretty cool to win a
free MacBook Pro I'm clearly gonna try
it enter so if you guys want to do that
as well I probably just hurt my chances
by telling you but I figured I'd share
anyway hope you enjoyed guys for
