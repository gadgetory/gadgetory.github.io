John rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo
Here I am in Round Rock on Del's
corporate campus and I got some hands-on
time with a pre-production Dell Streak
let me go ahead and walk you through it
and we'll try and learn it together I'd
only get the device for a few minutes
first let's start at the size comparison
everybody started thinking about how big
this 5-inch screen is is really going to
be let's put it here next to the iPhones
you can see a size comparison stack them
up on top of each other it's a sort of a
in-between sort of device it's certainly
a tablet but it's also a phone they're
expensive me I'm going to keep it in
your pocket or purse so go ahead and
push that off to the side here it is
next to the much larger tablet
competition the iPad you can see sort of
the size comparison purposes there as
well from a food standpoint actually is
very thin so I will compare it next to
the iPhone as well you can see the
thinness really plays a part into how
POC they burn talkable this is gonna be
as we'll see in just a moment all right
so let's turn this thing on actually
before I do that give a little bit more
of a hardware Tory Adele hasn't been
giving out really specs on it we
consider some eyes of what we've got so
on the front advise you have a
front-facing camera which certainly has
obvious uses for Skype and video chat
you've got your earpiece and microphone
you've got a three android button array
as opposed to the usual Android buttons
and I'll show you why that is in just a
minute
they are capacitive you got a home
button the menu button and a back button
on the top of the device you've got a
volume rocker because this is indeed a a
mobile phone you've got a believe as a
3.5 millimeter headset jack your lock
and power button and a camera button
which lacks us both cameras on the back
this is the red model no trip didn't
come in other colors we've got a pretty
nice 5 megapixel camera with dual LED
flash on the bottom you've got a
proprietary dock connector so there
isn't any sort of USB or micro USB port
built in and I'll show you
works at you in a moment let's go ahead
and power this thing on and see what we
are working on so go ahead and unlock
and this is running a custom version of
Android 1.6 l Odell has said that it
will be upgradeable to Froyo version 2.1
in the near future or Android 2.2 rather
in the near future
so go ahead in the market and it's a
very custom UI traditionally with
Android phones you've got a bar you pull
down from the top light notifications
this bar is actually segmented let's
take a look at it so in the upper left
hand corner you've got a down arrow
which actually pulls down a list of all
your applications and if you haven't
sort of minimize you can have it sim
more or less and a pull up your most
recently used and if you want to get the
full sort of list of all the stuff you
go and hit more and then it looks like
standard Android you can scroll through
and sort of pick out what you'd like so
if you go ahead and get rid of that
you've got your home button laying out
this has four home screens you can see
the little orange dot so you can scroll
either way and access home screens to
customize them as you like and you can
see you can have an individual
wallpapers for each this next one here
is sort of for if I had 3G SIM card in
here I don't have a SIM card in this is
supporting AT&amp;amp;T 3G network about 18 mm
officially announcing it so that's where
that notifications and such would show
up if you had had emails and the like as
well like here's all of you are a
wireless settings so tells me that I'm
on I'm on Wi-Fi no 3G see by the X with
the bars and battery information and
then the time and date so this is in
landscape orientation I was trying that
sir to see if it would rotate and go to
portrait but it does not have a portrait
orientation which I assume is be due to
that sort of bar across the top that we
just talked about so this is running
Android 1.6 but they do have multi-touch
enabled
let me go ahead and we'll go to a web
page and see what that looks like device
just locked on go ahead and lock it
again
that's really multi-touch is important
feature to many people including me
let's go ahead and open that up browser
here we are at on a Dell website and see
how that works so court keeps going a
little bit after I stopped and this is
again a pre-production Dell had to make
sure that I had that I mention this is a
pre-production hardware see if we double
tab up that'll zoom in or not though it
does kind of realign the text but the
motor doesn't work you've certainly seen
worse implementations of it you get sort
of your standard array
you got your back button forward button
refresh and bookmarks let's go ahead and
go home no pricings been announced on
this yet either and so this is sort of
part of Dells a custom UI you can see
contact tech messages Gmail it's all
sort of segmented if we hold it down
there's some custom widgets as well so
I'll go ahead and launch that you can
sort of see what they've got on here and
of course you have full access to the
Dell or the Android Marketplace as well
so we'll go ahead and go home
the biggest question that I had was is
this gonna fit in my pocket so let me
show you what this looks like so I'll go
ahead and lock the screen and I'm
working the camera while I'm doing this
so excuse the probably shaking
nausea-inducing feel so right now I'm
gonna push down here my pants I got
nothing in my pocket I'm gonna go ahead
and put my iPhone in you can see what
that looks like so drop the iPhone in
sir if you can see it a little bit right
there not too bad but you know it's in
your bucket we'll go ahead and take that
out now and I will put be much larger
streak into my pocket
and I was actually very surprised that
it did fit in the pocket yet to sort of
rearrange it so it sort of slides down
but once it's in there it's not too bad
you can definitely notice it you can
certainly see I've got a very large or
rectangle in my pocket but it is
pocketable certainly it's not going to
be as palpable as other smaller devices
buddy could throw in your pocket now is
this thing gonna look when using it as a
phone since does have you know a full
phone capabilities they're going to turn
the camera around and again excuse these
sort of shoddy
camerawork we're about to have here so
there I am and here's the Dell Streak
let's see how it's gonna look when it's
up to your head looks very big up to
your head certainly you'd get some
attention while you were talking to it
but it does work and it certainly you
use a Bluetooth or that big speaker on
the back you want the new speaker phone
so that's sort of a the profile shot of
what that would look like to go ahead
and turn the camera back around I'll
show you some of the accessories that
are going to be available for this
streak I'm not sure if these are going
to be shipping with it or they're going
to be options or what but there here are
something that's going to come with it
it does use a proprietary port on the
back you do have a dock option suitable
probably way to charge it you go ahead
and pop it right in the dock it leads
back to it's got a power cord right up
to the wall now this wall cord does pop
out and this is how you get information
on to it via USB plug that in and you
could pick out the information now I
will assume that they'll see up for
piyah Terry to regular USB use didn't
have to use a dock to get information on
it but there's just how this one right
here is arranged you can serve a CV in
wall power is a bit on the large end
your go ahead and pull it out you can
see sort of what that looks like as well
so here's the dock it probably good for
for watching movies I think that each
streak is actually going to have a
pretty decent niche market this is great
for the traveller who wants to watch a
lot of video doesn't want to carry
another device doesn't want to carry a
tablet
Johnson sort of carry one thing that
could be their phone watch a video on it
and because it is such a large screen I
sort of would be remiss to not show you
the keyboard actually does this sort of
have a Dell custom keep
you're gonna do a lot of typing and on
screen this large it expect the keyboard
to be pretty pretty good here you've got
your so recent applications and you can
pick what homescreen you want let me go
ahead and duck out of this and let's go
ahead and check out the keyboard so we
will go to this is sort of a phone
somebody's using someone to not open up
text messages let's go to try browser
for example go and type that in and you
can see right here what the keyboard
looks like so you get a pretty decent
sized keyboard also get a full number
pad on the right and I did use this the
keys do look a little bit on the small
side but it's pretty easy to navigate
and there is a lot of room to move your
finger thing you get haptic feedback as
you go through and touch them so guys
know carrier release on this yet or no
pricing that's just a pre-production
model but I did want to give you a
hands-on time with the Dell Streak I'm
gonna try and get a product expert to
give me a more thorough walkthrough and
if I can't I'll add it to this video
hope you guys enjoyed I wanna know what
your thoughts are in the Dell Streak
because they'll have a good idea on
their hands it's sort of niche and isn't
gonna be well adopted you know what do
what do you guys think anyway I'm John
retinue from the TechnoBuffalo and I
will see you the next video
buh-bye and I mentioned to to my
audience that I was coming to look at
Delta mobility I had a few questions
that I promised I would ask so the first
one that I would ask is is Dell planning
on entering the mobile space permanently
and it's been served little forays here
and there is Dell something that Dells
commit it to oh yeah we're here we have
a whole business unit a communication
solution screw all these devices and the
next question they want to ask is how
does the Dell team view the iPhone 4 and
how do they view sort of Apple's design
as well so the question would be to
consider a product like the iPhone 4 to
be direct competitor or something like
this or is it something that's in a
completely different markets here and
what what market are you trying to
target server seems like an in-between
like I said before we really wanted to
create a product that that was capable
of providing a great web browsing
experience but also but you don't see in
some of the other tablets is the ability
to do this making phone calls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
