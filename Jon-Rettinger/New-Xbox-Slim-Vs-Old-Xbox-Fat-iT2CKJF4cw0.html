John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here and I want to give you a
head-to-head comparison of the two Xbox
360 models so on one hand we've got the
new just announced a few days ago Xbox
360 I'm going to call the Xbox 360 slim
on the other we've got the outgoing Xbox
360 which in this case is the black
elite version so on that static
standpoint there are clearly a ton of
differences with how these two look on
one hand the slim is shining it's black
it's thinner it's got a new design on
the other hand we've got the outgoing
model was a bit understated it had the
matte finish and it was sort of a
classic design with you loved it or
hated it your serve used to seeing it so
it's sort of strange to see a brand new
Xbox 360 model this one is significantly
smaller lighter and thinner and let me
go ahead and show you can see right here
there's a big difference at the top when
you show you what that looks like when
your staff top of each other and I'll go
over some of the more physical
differences between the two look like
put them right here and just off the top
of the back you can see that there's
definitely a difference this one is
about an inch I would say there we go
about an inch to an inch and a half a
larger and that's probably due to the
external hard drive that the outgoing
model had in this case I've got 120
gigabyte version right here this hard
drive just popped out and sort of
protruded a bit on top you can see it
right there the new one has an internal
hard drive which is still user
accessible but I got rid of this sort of
proprietary format which is nice you can
actually replace the hard drive if you
choose let's go ahead and look at the
front of the devices because there's a
lot to talk about here so on the
outgoing model the power button right
down here is actually physical button
you push it in and click the noise the
tray would open up on the new mods
actually touch sensitive so there's no
physical click you tap it in the tray
will open you had two memory units which
you didn't have a hard drive you could
pop in you know had a little bit of
storage
you could access Xbox Live that is gone
on the new version those slots are not
there you do have two USB ports on the
bottom sort of recess they are still
there two USB ports right on the front
so just on the front you can definitely
see different is you've got an IR sensor
right there sort of hidden on the new
version this one also the sort of
riddled with vents vents are everywhere
on this new Xbox 360
you've got vents on the side we've got
vents on the top and serves in that
whole day I know what vents on the other
side and there's nothing on the back and
speaking of the back let's talk about
the differences here between the tubes
there's a lot to discuss go ahead and
put this one on back so you can see the
outgoing model is sort of shy on ports
it had USB port your Ethernet port HDMI
port in some cases some of the older
models didn't have that and that weird
proprietary AV port and a very sure
strange power port and that was about it
that was all you had the new model has a
bit more going on with that it's got a
new power button or a new power port
uses just sort of a two pronged approach
you've got optical audio HDMI that same
proprietary port Ethernet the new AV
port which are going to be for the
Kinect which is the motion sensor
controller previously product and tall
although all older Xbox 360s will be
Kinect capable I assume them to be a
little bit of an adapter and now three
USB ports and if you want to go wireless
none of these have to be used now with a
wireless adapter this now comes with 802
11 n so if you have a wireless network
using an N a very fast internet and very
fast data transfers which is quite nice
so one of the other gripes about the
Xbox was the power brake was that it was
huge power brick was gigantic and really
lived up to its name as being a brick
let me show you what that looks like and
share comparison with new model got them
right here so here is the outgoing Xbox
power brick you can see very large and
here's the new one
still large but definitely smaller and
actually uses a bit less power as well
so one of the other knots on the Xbox
was that it was quite loud you could
hear the tray spinning you could hear
the fans I'm going to go ahead and plug
both of these in power Mon I'm going to
see if we can hear difference between
the table alright so I've got both
consoles ready to go here we're going to
start with the outgoing Xbox 360 elite
there is not a disk installed I just
wanted to hear what the normal boot up
noise sounds like I'm going to go ahead
and just turn this on you can definitely
hear it sort of spinning you can hear
the fans and then it sort of quiets down
a little bit but it definitely has some
noticeable noise behind it so we'll go
ahead and turn this off and let's try
the new one and see the differences here
that's it that's all the noise it looks
for a disc and it gets very quiet
actually can't hear any sort of fan
spinning at all so let's try putting a
disc in and trying to hear what that
sounds like I've got a few right over
here so let's pop in how about Modern
Warfare 2 we'll go ahead and open this
up there's the eject button just another
touch button right top you can hear it
spinning
and then it you can hit it fans with the
kick in a little bit now one of the
things you can do with the Xbox 360 is
you can actually rip the games right to
the hard drive so there's noise that
you're hearing with the game I wouldn't
necessarily hear after you ripped it but
I do want you to sort of get a fair
sense of what everything would sound
like so that's what that sounds like
it's certainly quieter than we've heard
before and Matt I'll give you a
demonstration of what it sounded like
before so go ahead and turn this sucker
off and actually I can feel it vibrating
with my hands and I can feel the heat
coming out and see the fan spinning but
it is definitely quieter so get and turn
this off and let's try the outgoing
model and we will put in the disc as
well
I've got call of duty world at war here
we'll try that so we'll turn it on
often the discs and let's get the noise
sounds like here
so there is a noticeable difference with
noise this is maybe about half as loud
as the newer model you can definitely
hear it but again once you rip the game
to the hard drive it is pretty quiet so
we'll go ahead and turn that off SOTA
guys I wanted to give you just a quick
overview in comparison about the
outgoing versus the new Xbox 360 models
and see if you thought it was worth an
upgrade or not that's going to be your
opinion here they are sort of next to
each other you can get a last look about
differences are how they appear so guys
