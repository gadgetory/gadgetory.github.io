let me walk you through what's going to
be inside when you pick up your oculus
quest for either 399 or $4.99 depending
on whether or not you want 64 or 128
gigabytes storage
I said giggle alright so the first thing
in the box is really the main thing this
is the oculus quest itself the headset
it looks and feels really nice and
premium it's kind of a canvasing
material it's adjustable for whatever
noodle size you guys have that goes
there you're gonna have two controllers
got a nice two got included wrist straps
here so make sure you don't lose them or
flame across the room some booklets USB
type-c cable power brick two double-a
batteries that's all you need to get
your VR on so before we set it up I do
want to give a big THANK YOU to oculus
for sponsoring this video if you want to
learn more about the oculus quest link
down below
alright so download the oculus app first
for either iOS or Android start the
pairing process so it's just a plug it
in so I'm gonna do that
alright I'm gonna look inside four five
digit code alright so I just went
through we did all the unboxing of the
oculus quest I am about to put it on for
the first time try some VR sans cables
alright so one of the cool things about
the oculus quest obviously you can play
it anywhere but you can't see like
what's around you doing VR so you always
have a war you're gonna run into a wall
or and into somebody so you can actually
set up boundaries for whatever space you
are in and they made it really simple
all right so I'm gonna confirm floor
levels I look down I can see the little
X's on the floor who confirmed
and then to find my play area so
actually I pretty much just draw out my
area that I want to be in so I'm gonna
draw it out and I can see the area
around me make sure I'm not gonna run
into anything all right so I got my play
area drawn out not a huge area but I'll
be big enough it's in continued so now I
hit that I see this almost like a whole
wall go up around me so I can look
around make sure it's correctly
positioned and then as you get close to
those boundaries it easier to walk up to
it you'll see the wall start to show up
as you get there and if you peek your
head through it the camera actually
turns on so you can see what's around
you so I can see you know cameras and
lights and I step back I'm back inside
of that VR space and I get a little
closer that wall start to show up so I
know if I go past that I could hurt
myself or I could hit something I'd like
a whole environment showing up around me
but whales swimming above me
I guess just like a loud scream all
right so I'm gonna play Creed rise to
glory I'm gonna be fighting Adonis Creed
or fighting against Adonis Creed there's
a giant dude in front of me
I am Adonis Creed all right I'll never
look this Jackie for him all right I'm
gonna fight this dude
this is VR done right this is kind of
what I think people always wanted with
VRS or that wire-free immersive
experience and music sounds pretty good
it's pretty immersive and I can say as
I'm looking around like I still see the
whole VR experience and I know I'd
probably look super cool but the music
really like helps and also I can hear
what's going on around me without having
you know noise cancelling headphones on
or other headphones so it's also I think
extra for safety too
alright so I just finished my first
session on the active quest and I am
like legit out of breath that's why the
biggest workout that I've had and
probably longer than I'd like to admit
playing in Star Wars was awesome boxing
the Dinah's creepers also awesome
taught me that I will probably get back
to the boxing but also in to work out
for
so I've had a mixed reaction to VR over
the years so in first like home VR came
out it seemed awesome but you needed
crazy expensive PC to get at work the
experience I don't think was ever that
great there's kind of that middle ground
we could use your phone as a VR headset
it was fine I just never really found
much of a use for it this was really the
first big our experience that was super
immersive I don't know if it was not
happy to put on headphones but actually
hearing the VR come through I didn't
have the worry that I was gonna run face
first into a wall the fencing that
they've got is really cool if you need
to go through it the fact you can turn
on the cameras actually see things maybe
feel a bit more comfortable and thick
let me enjoy the VR experience a bit
more annoying I wasn't gonna like injure
myself there's still no cure for how
ridiculous you look
while playing VR to others but the
experience was awesome so the games it
looked better than sort of when you have
a phone inside of cardboard or a headset
they were pretty immersive so like being
able to box as a Donna's Creed and
actually like legitimately get a workout
was also need I could see the potential
here and sort of built in to the oculus
quest you also have access to normal app
so I was admittedly shameless plug
watching my own YouTube video and didn't
show up as like a you know full 360
which is so big flat looked like a
gigantic widescreen in front of me the
overall with some the most immersive VR
experience I've ever had if you want to
play VR games how to play VR games on
the go this is a really good way
you've removed the tether I think you
already know whether or not VRS for you
and if you decide that it is for you
this is a really incredible way to get
into it to try and sort of have that
immersive VR experience and kind of
expect that I guess from from oculus but
thumbs up oculus quest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
