TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the latest flagship from Google this is
the Nexus 5 made by LG the Nexus devices
are probably some of my favorite of the
year so really excited to see what a
Snapdragon 800 a cordis 1080p screen
looks like an unadulterated unaltered
Android let's take a first look so here
is the box for the Nexus 5 it's
relatively small and it kind of makes a
5 on the screen so not much branding on
it got Google LG on the side and that is
about it this is sent to us from the
folks at Google they sent us a 32
gigabyte black model is also a 16
gigabyte versions both available in
white or black at 349 or 399 so Google
branding oh god there's a seal but
Google opened that perhaps to put a SIM
card in here this is a unique phone it
will work with LTE on spread on AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile but also with Sprint's on no
support for Verizon folks here so sorry
to say that here is the phone when it's
looking very nice and really thin to
hold the hand pushed off the side for
just a quick second even though I just
want to hold it see it also we are going
to have in the box of course will run
through all the specs I've got anything
in here we got nothing in there that's
just some filler inside of here we've
got sim removal tools for removing sins
looks like it's just a little piece of
metal Nexus 5 get started how to work it
all that kind of business we like to
figure that out on our own safety and
warranty don't eat the phone and we've
got a wall work and a micro USB charging
cable that is about it let's bring in
the reason we are all here here's the
latest flagship phone from Google I love
my Nexus devices I will peel this off
I'll run through all the specs boom
satisfying whooshing noise this phone
feels really nice in the hand very
substantial I'll try and power it on and
we could talk about everything while
we're doing it to power button lives in
the upper right hand corner foods got
some juice what's going to turn on is a
four point nine five inch screen up from
the 4.7 on the nexus 4 with a full 1080
resolution meaning 1920 by 10
with a PPI of 445 it's an IPS screen big
deal here is that from the hardware is
Android 4.4 also called KitKat is here
at launch being powered by a 2.3
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chip
which is crazy fast we think about how
quick the galaxy s4 and HTC One we're
those using Snapdragon 600 this thing
should be just an absolute beast so you
got this guy all powered on it's got 2
gigs of RAM no external storage also
make sure you get either 16 or 32 is
going to support all the storage that
you need the back it's got a camera
there that is an 8 megapixel sensor with
a stabilization which is kind of nice to
have the optical stabilization in case
you've got a shaky hand and of course
1080p video 1.3 megapixel shooter living
right there on the front 802 11 ABG and
in a scene that's 2.4 and 5 gigahertz
bands Bluetooth 4.0 powering this guy
keeping it running is not the largest
battery 2300 milliamp hours does have
NFC here also sports wireless charging
the Qi standard it weighs 130 grams
let's take a quick look here at the
phone so immediately you'll notice and
things are different got that
translucent menu bar there at the bottom
you don't have it sorted out lying
across it hangouts is now integrated
with SMS you don't like that you can
download a third-party SMS app which I
will be doing and setting that as your
default further integration with
contacts I don't have a name here you
can now search for places and stuff
inside of contacts so pizza place or
restaurant so that's kind of a nice
touch there as well a quick tour of the
device we got volume rocker up and down
on the left hand side on the right
there's your sim tray and your power and
lock button on the bottom we've got
stereo speakers which are we are facing
obviously there's your charge and sync
port on the top 3.5 milimeter headset
jack and mic 2300 milliamp hour battery
here is non-removable the back is sort
of a soft touch feel but it feels really
really nice doesn't look to be much of a
fingerprint magnet like some other soft
touch backs and I have a normal person
hands not relatively dirty
I guess we're clean but just normal
nothing is smearing them on here
you can now like you could on the Moto X
and the Droid phones just say okay
Google now and they'll do so we have to
pair it to your voice in order to get it
to do that
I'll run into settings and see what
we've got here a new animation when you
go into your app tray as well sort of a
subtle approach I guess will scroll
around here settings has a new icon rest
the stuff here looks pretty similar
feels very quick as you'd expect from a
snapdragon 800 with native android out
here there's nothing to sort of slow it
down at all we'll go to about phone
there it is Android 4.4 what the big
deal has been about little KitKat
animation dance around for you
then let's you know you are running
Android 4.4 so I'm very excited to test
this phone out and I bring a real quick
comparison with the outgoing Nexus 4
option the screen off you can see what
both of them look like 4.7 4.95 it look
like you know the Nexus 4 kind of grew
up a little bit now they both have a
very similar feel to it but the Nexus 5
feels incredible don't have that glass
back anymore which is known to scratch
or crack so you can see this family tree
here four to five also available from
Google they sent us is a case open this
guy up real fast and see what it looks
like and see if you want to pick one up
looks to be pretty substantial Google's
getting to the accessory business as
well they also have a Qi charger for the
Nexus 5 but if you have any you know
wireless charger it will work with it so
this is just pretty standard plastic on
the phone just goes right into it and
now your black phone becomes kind of a
red phone a little bit chunky but it
does have a lip on top so when you put a
flat on a table it's not going to
scratch your screen you can still see
the Nexus logo there on the back as well
so if you want to you can pick up a case
I think you guys want to see about the
Nexus 5 please let us know leave it in
