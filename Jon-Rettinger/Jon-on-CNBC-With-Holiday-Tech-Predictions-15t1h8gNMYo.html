and already the tech blogs are buzzing
about what will be this holiday season's
hottest gadgets joining us to break down
this year's tech winners and losers is
jon rettinger editor-in-chief it
TechnoBuffalo calm and Andrew said at
all he is editor at Geico system.com to
both of you thanks for your time John
who are your top winners the top three
winners are definitely going to be the
Apple iPad the tablet that started the
tablet craze number two would be the new
motion controlling system launched by
Microsoft called the Kinect where your
body actually becomes a controller and
third is a new smartphone coming out for
verizon wireless called the droid pro on
the three losers that are really set to
fizzle out this holiday season number
one would be the Nintendo Wii it's a
one-trick pony of emotion controlling
system has really been caught up by
Microsoft and Sony its chief
competitions number two is the 3d TV
phrase consumers are realizing the costs
aren't worth the benefits and number
three is the palm pre 2 it's got a
fantastic operating system called webOS
but is not being served properly by very
last generation hardware Andrew I see
that you've got one of those names on
your list as well but ironically you've
got Microsoft's Kinect not on your
winners list but on your losers list
what are you seeing this perhaps
different from John that's right i mean
i see i think that the kinect is going
to be a very very big deal the problem
is it's being put up by Microsoft it's a
major play in the Xbox market it may not
be a big enough deal to justify itself
now the Kinect has two ways to win it
can either become a wii killer it can be
the sort of thing where you no grandmas
who play wii bowling love to buy it or
it can sort of bring in the more
hardcore gamer market that play you know
first-person shooters and action games
it's pretty clear that the bet has been
placed on casual games we'll see if it's
getting if it gets it's been getting
very very good reviews I'm just not
convinced those reviews are good enough
to make it a week killer but I'd love to
hear what John has to say yeah what do
you think John
absolutely and I don't think that it has
Sara Lee kill anything Microsoft's 500
million dollar market push is going to
be more than enough to pique curiosity
other people to go ahead and pick this
up not to mention the Xbox is very wide
user base it's got a commitment from all
the major third party developers as well
as Microsoft's own in-house studios it
is going to be targeted primarily
initially at the casual gamers I think
the hardcore market there will be some
quick adoption once there's a game to
match the hardware Andrew who are on
your winners list I'd say that the the
big surprise for the holiday season is
likely to be the quantum which is LG's
entry into the handset market LG's
obviously spent a lot of time thinking
about you know what people use their
cell phones for how to make it easier
videos photos putting them directly into
a set-top box or a computer on the other
end of the spectrum for wireless
handsets Samsung continuum is pretty
likely to be a loser it seems like you
know and the Android platform is a very
good tool box for the handset
manufacturers it seems like Samsung
hasn't yet figured out exactly how to
use that in fact the continuum has a
dedicated ticker screen which would be
appropriate for you know a pager being
made by research in motion in 1998 it's
not very appropriate for a consumer
handset being made in 2010 okay John and
Andrew thank you very much for Bernie
those to us coming up next on the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
