beginning part 2 technobuffalo and they
continue the story in part two is too
long to sort of put out in one giant
video so if you didn't watch the first
part put the link will annotate it and
link will be down below but here is a
continuation of the TechnoBuffalo story
at the point where things were kind of
at their lowest it was almost like a
guardian angel on my shoulder I got an
email I got an email from a guy named
khalid bin al-walid and females and i
remember i'll never forget it i was at a
Shell station filling up with gas when
it came through on my phone and it said
quite simply I love the videos love what
you do I like to try to be a part of
technobuffalo so I went home and I did
what you would have done I put his name
into Google and what I saw I mean I
first I told my wife I'm like I got this
email she's like oh it's probably spam
you know look all right but you know
what I'm gonna reply anyway because
what's the hard and replying I still
read every single email it come into my
inbox so I replied to this gentleman
Khalid and I said you know thank you
very much for interest you know let me
you know I'd love to talk to you more
about it so again I went home and put
into Google and I realized he was a
prince in Saudi Arabia and like my jaw
drop I'm like this has got to be like a
new version of punk or something like
one of my friends that thought was going
to come running out with the camera
Ashton Kutcher with his trucker hat was
going to come out but it wasn't then I
asked him to sort of verify who he was I
saw a picture of him online and we
started talking and he and I talked for
eight months about our visions for
technobuffalo about our families about
our histories and we really really
really got to know each other you know
me taking on a business partner I was
scared that was nervous I didn't know
him at all and I want to be very
comfortable with him and him you know
investing in a company at a person he
didn't know me at all either you know
and dealing with the Prince of Saudi
Arabia it was sort of a little scary at
the time so I got to know him as a
person titles there any else aside and
couldn't we had a lot in common and
Khalid ended up becoming one of my
closest friends and is still with my
closest friends and
he became a minority partner and
technobuffalo and with that I got sort
of a life get a lifetime friends and he
again he and I talked for a long time
and his initial investment in
TechnoBuffalo helped us grow it helped
us bring Sean on full time I helped us
hire staff it help us open offices I
helped us get access to things we
wouldn't have access to before got us
into events we have I had access to
before and I just learned more about him
and he learned more about me and you
know sir just goes to show you you can
ever you know you don't know anybody
until you get to know them and you know
I'll never forget him and his wife
coming over to our house for dinner and
her wise playing dance central on the
Xbox and him and I just going upstairs
and I think checking out all the phones
i had in my college at the time it just
it just goes to show you in life you
never know what's going to come next and
call it as sort of he's been quiet we
haven't sort of talked about his
involvement technobuffalo but i feel
that i wasn't doing a service to sort of
the great gift that he gave me and the
gift that he gave the whole staff by
believing in us so you should check him
out i'll put all of his twitter and
instagram information to right here so
you can check him out say hi to him he
loves talk about technology is a really
good guy just a good human in a world
where I don't know how many good humans
are left but I he's he's one of the few
and I'm proud to to call him a friend an
even more excited to finally shared the
news he sort of been quiet behind the
scenes he's come to the almost a ton of
times he's hung out with us at CES and
million times and you know he's traveled
to Geneva together and gone to kind of
cool places my never had a chance to
talk about him so I'll surf continue the
story call it came on board and we
started to technobuffalo started to grow
and i realized i wasn't having as much
time as I wanted this is still the case
to do all the video work that I wanted
to do and still try and run a company
and this is still something I struggle
with you know we probably put out now
about a third of the video content we
could and probably should because it's
just me in addition to sort of doing all
the revision three shows and all the
other content I'm also running a
business I'm negotiating all the
contracts to go into our ad networks I
mean it's it's a lot of work so you know
we look to hire someone that help with
the video work we brought on Noah crab
its use with us for about a year
a half and I'll never forget our first
executive summit it was me Sean and Noah
we flipped San Francisco whenever lives
his son was just a little at a time and
you know I didn't have any kids and Sean
did not I figured you should have to
travel and we talked about the road 22
and the road 22 is getting us to two
million pageviews with the time seemed
crazy we may be passed a million one
time and we put together this plan and
what content we were going to talk about
and how we're going to try and be more
the voice of the consumer and we're a
teeny tiny little site I mean we weren't
even like a fly on like the ass of a
site like cnet or you know the sites
that are owned by AOL or the other CBS
sites but we believed in what we were
doing Kyle believed in us and we had a
vision we executed on it and we're able
to sort of continue to grow and grow
TechnoBuffalo and we serve did that by
just trying to be the voice of the
consumer and trying to utilize best SEO
practices and always trying to be sort
of honest and sort of on the up-and-up
so to speak so you know Noah's gone gone
his own way and we serve brought another
video people but I still struggle with
that same thing every day you know right
now it's just me making video and it's
tough you don't do nearly as much as we
could and again as much as we should but
you know we're trying we finally have an
office what you guys have seen we're
going to move into another office in
October we're building out a whole new
studio with sets and sort of up the
professionalism we brought on you guys
having that Jen Psaki meet him in person
but we brought on a video editor in the
form of Ron prieta who's you can really
see the exact day he came on you can see
the quality of the videos improved be
able to hire incredible writers
incredible video talent throughout the
years and it's been incredible and I
keep saying credible but that's how I
feel to give people the opportunity to
live their dreams and I feel so grateful
that somebody believed in me and gave me
the opportunity to live my dreams and
that I am I have so much respect for
that and it such a privilege to be able
to give the rest TechnoBuffalo staff the
chance to live their dreams and then
this would have happened if call didn't
believe in me now this what happened if
the audience didn't care what I had to
say I know this would have happened if
the audience didn't give me a second
chance I'm TechnoBuffalo crash and
failed and I'll forever be grateful
or that it was just it's it's an honor
it's a privilege and this is not another
script for this video I'm just talking
from the heart so that's the story of
TechnoBuffalo that's how we came to be
if you're going through similar
struggles in your life without starting
a business or you're in school and you
think things are at their worst and I
can't get better I can tell you they
will get better and they can get better
just when you think things are at the
darkest you might have that guardian
angel sitting right there on your
shoulder waiting to email you and
waiting to say I believe in what you're
doing no matter what it is so if you can
take anything away from this mess this
video let that be the message things can
get better you can live your dreams you
can fight for what you think is
important and you could run a business
your company or your life with the
strong sort of moral principles and
always with honesty and you can be
successful now we're not nearly
successful as I like TechnoBuffalo to be
my goal is protecting a buffalo to be
the largest consumer electronics portal
in the world and that's including the
giant sites we've only been around for
you know again since 2009 2010 early
it's not even that long we've already
sort of grown we're not nearly where I
want us to be we've got a lot of market
share now but we don't have lot of my
chair and I really want to grow and
change n I love our independent spirit i
love that we can try something new if it
doesn't work didn't work we tried it I'm
not beholden to a board of investors or
anything we've had people inquire about
trying to buy the site and I've sort of
pushed it back so I like being
independent I like being able to sit and
talk with you guys and say what I want
have to worry about anybody looking over
my shoulder so that's a little story I
hope for those you that sort of are the
fans that wanted to hear this and watch
I hope you enjoyed it's been just a
privilege for me to be here and I plan
on being here for many many many more
years but i want to just to share the
whole story of techno buffer with you
guys and i hope you enjoyed until next
time i'm jon rettinger see you guys next
