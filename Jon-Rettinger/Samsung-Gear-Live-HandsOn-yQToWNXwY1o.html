technobuffalo here and we are at Google
i/o 2014 taking a look at the latest
Samsung wearable this is the gear live
running Android where it's going to take
a first look I took here is the Samsung
gear live just announced here at Google
i/o can be available on july seven to
the Play Store for a hundred ninety-nine
bucks the first thing I notice about it
is really how thin it is I was very very
surprised seeing how thin that profile
was this just a demo unit so it's not
kind of working gonna get full
functionality here but this is Android
where essentially it's google now on
your wrist we do a ton of things with it
everything you're going to want to do
those going to be done by this 1.63 inch
Super AMOLED display it's got a 320 x
320 resolution and a 1.2 gigahertz
processor nurit there's been a bit iffy
on with the battery specs are but
Samsung is telling us it's going to last
all day on the back you can see it's got
a heart rate monitor built-in it's going
to track your steps as well so you can
say ok Google my could give the
information you can talk to it say ok
Google can set reminders you can glance
for weather when you wake up everything
a service scrolls you want to mute it go
ahead and pull it down as you pull it
down you'll see the date and the battery
time so if you just want some private
time you don't wanna be bothered very
easy to do and go ahead and see
notifications if you swipe up and swipe
them off the screen as you swipe them
off the screen it's also going to swipe
off your android device so they're going
to sync up and talk together if you go
ahead and serves keep scrolling through
you can see what else you can do you can
see your steps
ok Google there's a live downright me to
call mom and I go it's always good idea
anyway so go ahead and set reminders for
time when you get back I'll be a whole
bunch of apps available for this as well
we'll get some more hands-on with it
when we get it in the TechnoBuffalo labs
later on the week once you guys the
first general overview feature i'm most
excited about those navigation be going
to put this on your wrist and figure out
where you need to walk to we're here in
San Francisco it's not the city that I
know if I want to forgot to get to my
hotel like it's put it into my phone and
have it get right on my wrist through
there it's kind of cool how it works
around it you're going to have just one
physical button on the right hand side
and that is about it on the wrist oh
it's pretty light pretty small and feels
really nice anyway anything eyes wants a
particular be sure to let us know so
next time I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you guys next
video all right thank you guys for
watching if you like what you saw please
subscribe they'll be the first ones to
know when new videos come up we have a
ton of stuff we do unboxing to do hands
on reviews cars and everything in
between the nets to consumer electronics
we'd love to have you stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
