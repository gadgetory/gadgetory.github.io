editor technobuffalo calm and i'm here
with a look at anti chamber
before we get started let me just put
this out there anti chamber is going to
be one of the strangest games we ever
feature on we play it's unlike anything
we've ever shown off in this series
before we'll probably never used
something like it again so if you don't
really enjoy the offbeat side of the
gaming world i recommend you skip this
one anti chamber is wonderful but it's
definitely not for everyone we'll be
back to more mainstream games in the
coming weeks but I just really wanted to
highlight this one for just this episode
antichamber was developed by Alexander
Bruce it's been running the gaming
convention and awards circuit for the
last several years and it was originally
known as hazard the journey of life
Bruce created a game centered around
non-euclidean space and the navigation
of it for those of you who quite frankly
hate geometry like me antichamber is
basically about manipulating the game
world as it's perceived by the player
and then tasking them to move through it
so if you pay attention to the gameplay
behind my voice you'll see that i'm
almost fumbling through each contrasting
area trying to use the tools given to me
to solve each rooms puzzle so here you
see me running through this blue and red
space and kind of realizing that it's
going to make me repeat until i make a
different decision so this takes place
from the beginning of the game and just
so you know i deleted a save file and
start afresh i really wanted you guys
just to see exactly what it's like a
fire it up and get going it's really one
of the strangest experiences I've ever
had with a game I'm not even sure if I
like it I just it's it's just so bizarre
you'll see here pretty much run into a
brick wall and turn around and things
are different I have to hit the Escape
key and hop back out to the menu and try
and figure things out again that's what
this game is all about pay attention a
little bit how things are really going
in the video and you'll kind of get a
sense of what's going on an antechamber
just like that I have a gun now I've got
a gun it starts to take on a little bit
of a almost like a portal feeling I
really don't want to compare it to
portal but I kind of have to I guess so
that you guys understand it see in
Portal if you think about the way that
the puzzle solving was presented in
Portal basically valve strongly long and
kind of beat you over the head with the
way to solve puzzles it was like here's
how you solve a really basic principle
open a portal here and open another
portal here and you'll walk through it
if you remember the first portal it
started out where you can only fire like
the blue side you didn't have two
portals you could only open one and one
was already open for you when you
started the puzzle then after you
learned how that work that gave you the
second portal and then it taught you
more advanced mechanics with that it
introduced the idea of momentum and you
know a constant sense of momentum when
you jump through portals in order to
accelerate to leap to greater heights if
you've played the game you know exactly
what I'm talking about with antechamber
it just kind of it doesn't really beat
you over the head with the rules of the
game it just says okay here's here are
the puzzles here are some of the
mechanics that they require in order to
solve them good luck so antechamber is
not so much a game about relearning the
rules of physics and geometry as it is
about understanding the rules of a new
world and making the writer I guess best
decisions in it it's about learning how
to move forward instead of being a game
about geometry it's like almost a game
of psychology should I turn around here
should i go back should i look at the
space again am i doing this right the
signs of floating text you approach
during at the game echo the fact there's
an ultimate way to go about exploring
each space but the game is also really
quick to remind you that there's no such
thing as the wrong way so you might
think you're kind of going down the
wrong path but then there's a sign that
says there's no such thing as a wrong
path or this path isn't necessarily
wrong as it is just different I don't
know getting lost in edgy chamber feels
almost like a good thing it's not like
losing its like the developer wanted you
to be there as you start to spin in
circles around the same space over and
over and I was stuck on this door maze
for a while and honestly I got stuck
here and
after I deleted the same file id never
returned look at me i'm a goofball I'm
stuck but I got stuck here and I went a
different path and never met this puzzle
again and now I'm playing it with you
guys and I'm about to solve it for the
first time it's just that your brain
starts to work differently as you
approach antechamber over time Alexander
proves almost wanted you to feel lost
you get the sense that he's kind of
messing with you the entire time and
that really works I don't know like I
said at the beginning this cliff
antechamber isn't for everyone it's not
for people who are entertained by the
more obvious stuff in games and not that
there's anything wrong with that I love
big mainstream games too but there's no
winning here there's no overt plot
there's no killing there's not really a
score per core board it's just I don't
know it's about unraveling the rules of
this really strange world learning the
psychology of it and and it's something
I really recommend that anyone if you've
got a gaming PC this is windows only if
you've got a gaming PC and it's on Steam
right now and you've got a few bucks to
toss at this go for it it's bizarre but
you're gonna get the sense of really
unique gameplay with this it's unlike
anything I've ever played it and for
that I kind of kind of love it for that
you know
alright this has been another episode of
we play again my name is joey davidson
i'm the senior editor the gaming channel
at TechnoBuffalo calm if you dig this
show but you're not really too fun stuff
like antechamber just know that we'll be
back next week with something a little
bit more mainstream i'm pretty sure that
we're going to have Sly Cooper the new
game themes of time that should be
coming up pretty soon we're also going
to be looking at all sorts of other
stuff down the line antichamber is
currently selling for 15 bucks on steam
that's a sale price though it's
twenty-five percent off so pencils down
it's going to be 20 bucks after the
promotion ends I think it's maybe a
month-long promotion it might even be
longer it's just the introductory will
cost it's really weird it's bizarre
falling on this trippy tunnel right now
joy it's definitely unlike any other
game that I played a long time so if
you're at all interested i do recommend
it check it out thank you folks for
watching we'll be back next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
