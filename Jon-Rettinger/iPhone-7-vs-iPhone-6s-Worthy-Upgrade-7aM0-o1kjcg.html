from TechnoBuffalo here and you might be
thinking your iPhone 6s is now old and
maybe want to upgrade to the new iPhone
7 I want to do a comparison between the
two type you could decide whether or not
it's worth the upgrade and I will make a
recommendation so let's talk a little
bit about what's different first
aesthetically there are color
differences here as well Space Gray is
gone replace with a new matte black
option and there's now a jet black
option as well in 128 or 256 which
brings me to my next point storage sizes
are doubled from last gen so you get
double the storage for the same price
aesthetically there are a few other
notable differences the antenna lines
them ugly antenna lines have been moved
from the top and bottom of the iPhone 6
and 6s
it's almost be hidden to the very top of
the phone on the iPhone 7 so it's a
cleaner look on the back the camera
ramps are still here it's a little bit
more pronounced on the iPhone 7
certainly way more pronounced on the
dual camera are having iPhone 7 plus so
bear that in mind
the biggest difference though I said at
goatee no two phones comes on the bottom
and if you use headphones a lot you
might want to give a real big posit or
not you want to upgrade in the Box Apple
does include a lightning at 3.5 so
you've got that but if you lose the
dongle you're going to be out of luck
Apple is really pushing this Wireless
world so if you need a 3.5 millimeter
jack for headphones and you might want
to hold on to your phone speakers are
here our improved it's now stereo
speakers the speaker is actually kind of
right up top there supposedly this other
speaker on the side is even a real
speaker where the headphone jack used to
be it's just uh just a grill other
notable changes now of ip67
water-resistant so if you live in area
where it rains a lot you're prone to
dropping your phone and wet things it
might be worth the upgrade a lot of
changes are things you can't see the new
810 fusion processors suppose about 50%
faster than last gen a 9s quad-core -
for high power - for low power versus a
dual-core chip on the iPhone 6s on the
camera front the iPhone 7 adds oh is
which is previously reserved for the
iPhone 6s plus it also has a wider
aperture def 1.8 to get more light it
when you take your pictures the flash is
also improved from
dual-led - quad LED and also it's that
two-tone so if use a flashlight you
should get better pictures the home
button still here but it no longer is a
physical depressing home button it uses
apples tactic engine and it takes a lot
of getting used to to really feel
comfortable with it
supposedly Apple did it up with
waterproofing and supposedly West moving
parts means less things that can
ultimately break it works it works
pretty well it just feels different so
if you're used to the physical clicky
home button on every generation iPhone
before you have a bit of a learning
curve here dimension wise are almost
exactly the same and battery life is a
little bit improved you get about an
hour longer with the iPhone 7 other than
that things are relatively similar
you've got the same two gigs of ram in
both phones the same now ridiculously
low resolution 750 piece screen on the
iPhone 7 there's an improved color gamut
on the iPhone 7 for my eye and my money
the screens look almost identical from
the 7 to the success I see no difference
at all maybe that'll change over time at
least first impressions I notice very
little difference so the question I
asked should you upgrade if you need
more storage if your phone is running
out of space and ya upgrade you get
double storage for the same price if you
rely on your phone at your dedicated
camera the pictures do look better
coming out of the iPhone 7 Fiza 4 video
OS is going to be a nice improvement but
nothing overly drastic so I think unless
you need that when those features you
need the waterproofing or you need a
better camera
I say promise at this generation out and
stick with the iPhone 6s even possibly
the iPhone 6 doesn't seem worth the
updating specially all the rumors we're
hearing about the 10th anniversary
edition iPhone coming next year then
oled screen and curves if you waited
this long maybe can wait another year
find yourself really pining after the
new phone do it you know exactly what
you're gonna get it is the Apple
experience through and through just
improved and refined those improvement
refinements are worth it to you go ahead
jack be disappointed you know exactly
what your going to be getting here the
only time I would say definitely upgrade
if you're on an iPhone 5s or earlier
this is gonna be a big cific and upgrade
from those phones but yeah I think are
you going to be upgrading your iPhone 6
success or something older let me know
even the comments down below until next
time I'm John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
