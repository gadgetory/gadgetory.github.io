with TechnoBuffalo and I thought we
would do a fun little video something
that I haven't done in a very long time
you guys know I'm an Android user
Android I hard spent a little bit of
time recently using this little nugget
right here so first up just really
quickly I used to work at Apple I was an
Apple retail I just like I used to have
an iPhone I get it I like to try and
keep an open mind I am an Android user
because I think it's the best solution
for me I understand that everybody is a
little bit different so what works for
you might not work for me but I thought
it would be really cool to kind of look
at the iPhone as an Android die hard and
my takeaways are thus so I think iOS is
kind of finally there for me anyway it
finally feels like a really really
mature OS information density is still a
little bit lacking so that's not ideal
for me but I found myself really
enjoying the shortcuts in the control
panel I realize the control panels not
new and just so that you guys know I
haven't tried an iPhone since I believe
24 early 2014 I want to say and that's
really not all that long ago the last
one I tried out was the 5s so that's two
generations now but just about
everything on the 6s works the way you
would expect it to and that's exciting
for me everything feels really polished
now and it really kind of feels like iOS
has kind of grown up everything from
Apple pay which works fantastically
especially here in California where we
have electric vehicles you just walk
right out of course this is true about
Android as well
but you just walk up and beep and you're
charging your cards great touch ID is
Krave crazy Gaston crazy fast it's
almost too fast I when I when you touch
the device I got to do this
weirdly here it's it's seriously because
I don't even have my pointers but it's
so fast that when I go to wake up the
device if I pick up my thumb it's still
unlocks it unlocks faster than I can
even get my thumb off of it like it's
it's crazy fast almost too fast and it's
just about as fast as I've been using
the five access or fingerprint reader
there which is really great the big
thing for me though is 3d touch and I
realize that 3d touch
is Apple doing something that will
probably come to other devices will
definitely come to other devices very
quickly but being the first one to do it
and doing it pretty well in my opinion
is what Apple is all about so it makes
me excited when I see implementations
like 3d touch go really really well so
for example let's just give you I know
you guys have seen 3d touch before but
here's one of the situations where I've
been using it a ton over here in
Instagram I I'm big on Instagram this is
my profile so being able to peek and
then pop in is such a big deal for me
and just from a user experience
perspective it really matters to not
have to hit the back button I get really
excited about things that are going to
kind of change the way we interact with
devices and I can't wait for 3d touch to
hit Android I don't really care about
the implementation quite as much as I'm
excited to be able to dive deeper into
apps but from a user experience
perspective it really does make a huge
difference to not have to hit a back
button when you're done with with with
something so whether that's viewing an
email in a peek or viewing a photo in a
peek whether it's an Instagram or tweet
bot it makes such a big difference
subconsciously how fast something
behaves or how fast it seems to behave
just like on Android where you turn the
animation speed down so that your excuse
me up so that the time is lower so it
feels like your phone's going faster
just not having to hit the back button
for peaking makes all the difference and
it makes our phones feel smarter so I'm
really excited for that to hit Android
and I'm really excited to see Apple
doing really cool stuff like that again
in terms of a bill the phone is a
beautiful phone you know it's an iPhone
so as John kind of said in his review
it's it's an iPhone and that's not this
is a really bad thing it's a little bit
iterative at this point you know all
aluminum body of course 7000 series of
aluminum of course the new pretty rose
gold but I think that the biggest
takeaway for me as an Android user
looking at the iPhone 6s my biggest
thing is 3d touch I cannot wait to see
3d touch on more devices and that's
really that's my take away great camera
great screen it's a good phone I'm not
crazy about iOS I still much prefer
Android but 3d touches is the only thing
that's got me does really start to think
twice about that
if any of you guys are Android users and
you happen to have access to an iPhone I
would much very much recommend you
picking up the device and playing around
with it if you haven't in a while iOS
has definitely matured in a few years so
let us know in the comments would you
guys think do you think 3d touch is
going to be as big a deal as I think it
is or am i over hyping this let us know
and as always thank you for watching be
kind to one another and I'll catch you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
