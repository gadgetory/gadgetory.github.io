Excel are let's just say making
headlines for maybe not the reasons
google would be expecting we've got both
phones here and when it's not stuck in a
boot loop I've been really enjoying
using the three excel and perhaps you
value that pure unadulterated Android Pi
experience and you've got a three or
three XL for yourself so I want to share
with you guys our favorite accessories
for the three the three XL we actually
get a lot of questions things like what
cases what chargers what headphones to
use for different type of phones these
are my favorite pixel three accessories
for your brand spanking new phone so if
you've been like a pixel loyalist since
the very first well you haven't been
able to wireless charge you can stock
just old-school plug in plug in your
phone and so we're gonna kick off our
accessories video with a wireless
charger this is one that we've had
kicked around the office for a while
it's by rat power and I do want to thank
them for sponsoring this video and
making content on the channel possible
and the reason that I like the rat power
charger first is gonna charge super fast
but also with this code it's only gonna
be twenty bucks
so there are first-party options that
you can get you can buy four of these
for that same price you can put the
charges around your house on the
convenience of wireless charging
anywhere you want to go so it makes RAF
powers charger send out over others this
one's got 50% faster phone detection so
when you put your phone on it'll start
charging a lot faster and obviously
wireless charging it's cheese so you can
use it with any phone that can
wirelessly charge like the new iPhones
for example so it's gonna charge your
phone fast which is really nice it's
gonna charge your iPhone at 7.5 watts
I've got a samsung phone it'll charge at
10 watts of course if you got a pixel
three it's going to charge your phone up
pretty fast so this is the rat power I
love charger the nice thing here it's 20
bucks with the code and you're gonna get
nice fast reliable wireless charges
so there are durable phones that are
going to survive a drop most probably
and then there's the pixel three and if
you breathe on it it seems like screens
are cracking so you are a hundred
percent going to want a case and there's
a lot of good case options we've been
using the google case that we got with
our pixel three and I really like it I
really like the fabric feel it's a full
protection case so it all comes out a
little bit above the screen so if you
drop it screen down there's a little bit
of extra protection which is clearly a
giant deal you get a little color on the
power button it's easy to find a
fingerprint unlock or out the case being
so big you can't stick your finger in
there it just works well it's a nice
case reliable case and such a gigantic
and bulky I really liked it if you're
looking for a case you don't want to go
case shopping you're not be able to go
wrong
we got you a pixel and you want to share
photos or videos with your family or
friends at your house pick up a
chromecast it's a great way to do it and
to show those beautiful pictures on a
larger screen Google actually debuted a
new chromecast the pixel event might not
have known about it because oddly they
didn't say a word it's the same old
chromecast functionality that you loved
but now it beefier internals it's gonna
do 60 frames per second at 1080p not
very expensive and plug it right in the
back of your TV via HDMI so you have to
worry about running huge HDMI cables
down to plug in a separate set-top box
it's a great way of using YouTube TV and
you want to watch your content you can
push anything you want from your phone
up to chromecast I love my chromecast I
think it's a perfect area to go with
your brand new pixel 3 obviously the
camera on the pixel 3 is the big reason
people are buying it's pretty reason
that I'm using the phone but it's
missing something it's got the just one
sad sensor doesn't have telephoto
fortunately there's an option to
actually add telephoto functionality to
your pixel 3 meet the moment lens and
case so first these are not cheap the
lens is gonna cost you 90 bucks you
gotta have the case to go with it to
make it all work together that's another
30 but you can switch cases if you
switch phones if use it on on an iphone
using another pixel whatever you want to
use long as you swap cases these lenses
will work and they work almost like
first-party accessories so if you want
to zoom but you don't want to deal with
like a digital zoom and maybe in noise
your image it's a really good way to go
telephoto lens it's equivalent to like
about a 60 millimeter it's gonna work
flawlessly with portrait mode you're
gonna get really minimal Distortion and
it works and it looks as if your pixel 3
has a telephoto lens built into it so if
you want that telephoto functionality
that a lot of other flagship phones have
but you still want that sweet sweet
pixel action this is a great way to go
so if you were to give two knocks on the
pixel three we just addressed one with a
single camera the other one would
probably be no expandable storage but it
does have is a multifunctional USB C
port that can add you probably guess at
this point expandable storage right to
the phone so for this we picked the
Kingston data traveler micro duo
Reesey it's a long name it's 20 bucks
it's gonna add expandable storage to
your pixel it's just gonna work right at
the box you plug in it's gonna show up
in the built-in File Explorer and you
can do expandable storage stuff you can
transfer photos and movies whatever you
want to do and probably my favorite
feature of it there's no like
third-party app required it's just plug
and play and it's just going to work it
also has a USB 8 port on the other side
so you can transfer it to anywhere you
want sorts of 32 gigs and goes all the
way up 228 it's a nice sort of middle
ground if you want the expandable
storage but you still want to hold on to
your pixel it works well and it's most
importantly not gonna break your bank so
on a knock for Google the pixel 3 does
have a headphone jack but to their
credit they include USB C pixel buds but
they are not like overly awesome they're
fine if you want to make a phone call or
listen to sort of maybe some music while
you're working out but if you want good
sound and you want wireless headphones
that aren't gonna break your bank we've
got the j-bird Terezin been pretty solid
the wireless functionality was important
to me for headphones so these are
Wireless they're gonna cost you a
hundred bucks oh they're not that
expensive and they just sound better
than a pixel buds there obviously are a
ton of really good affordable like
wireless headphones you can have I
picked a tariff for a few reasons
they're not crazy expensive which was
nice they offer the functionality of a
lot more expensive headphones shouldn't
get water resistance which is nice and
if you're into customizing the sound
experience there's an app that you can
do it on and it get a pretty long
lasting battery life - about six ish
hours depending on how you want to use
it
they're awesome not expensive and
they're wireless headphones they don't
need that much more explanation it's
good sound quality for not a lot of
money
those are pixel through accessories if
we missed it accessory there's one that
maybe you guys want to recommend leave
it in the comments down below and let us
know if you guys enjoy this accessory
videos we like making them it's fun to
test new things bring a bunch of stuff
in here and the products we picked we
probably tested like 25 then kind of
picked our favorite so again if we miss
one let us know down below until next
time I'm John Ryan gherkin TechnoBuffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
