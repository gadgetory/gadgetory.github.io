doing well i want to thank you all for
the outpouring of support following the
accident girlfriends guide doing much
better we're going to make a full
recovery from my point of view all the
confession stuff is starting to fade the
headaches and the memory issues are
starting a lesson so you'll be fully
recovered in a few more days which will
be very nice but never thought the
purpose of this video I want to address
one of the questions that I get most
often from people and that is should I
wait now share weight or should I buy
especially in regards to Apple products
you know since apple updates their
product line every six months or so as
long as a tough decision so what I
usually tell people is if you need it
now buy it you're still going to get a
great machine it's not gonna be obsolete
if you can afford to wait if you don't
need it today then wait until you
absolutely need it the only exception to
the should i buy today rule is if you're
about three or four weeks before one of
apple's a big conferences which are
typically in January and June so if your
middle of December I'd say wait or if
you're you know middle of May then I'd
say wait anywhere in between if you
needed by it you're still going to get a
great machine the reason I say wait for
those conferences if you're around that
times that's usually when Apple would do
a complete redesign a new case or
something drastic even a new product
launch typically the updates that are
given in between those times our
processor bumps memory bumps hard drive
bumps nothing major nothing that would
make your computer I said before would
be obsolete so let's just general rule
guys if you need it now buy it you're
getting a kick ass machine still whether
it's a macbook macbook pro macbook air
imac even a mac mini or mac pro still
going to get a great machine so if
getting again guys if you need it buy it
and i've got a video coming out soon
it's going to help you guys to choose
which computer is best for you anyway
guys I'll talk to you all soon I'm gonna
go out and enjoy my Sunday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
