senior gaming editor at technobuffalo
calm and I'm here with a look at the
Rayman legends challenge app for the wii
u all right I've personally been calling
this thing the Rayman legends apology
app it's this is what ubisoft released
in the wake of their delay and decision
to make this no longer wii u exclusive
so so rayman legends let's back up just
a little bit Rayman legends was
initially announced as a wii u exclusive
this game was going to release in i
believe februari of this year so that's
still in that weird launch window that
nintendo declared for the wii u and it
was going to be exclusively available to
wii u owners and after Rayman Origins
that wonderful game that if you can find
it it's it's pretty cheap i think it's
sitting anywhere from fifteen to twenty
dollars and it released on every
platform under the sum a couple years
ago it's a great platformer and this was
the follow up and news of it being wii u
exclusive was huge for nintendo honestly
the wii u is devoid of games right now
and that's Nintendo's biggest problem i
mean dismiss every other complain about
the system i know that those complaints
are legitimate but the biggest problem
for the wii u is its complete lack of
first party and third-party software
Rayman legends was going to be another
addition to the library so what's your
what you're seeing here is the Rayman
legends challenge app they decided to
release this as an apology to fans to
kind of hold them over for the new
release date now that this is no longer
wii u exclusive and coming and i think
august of this year to the xbox 360
playstation 3 and of course the wii u
the challenge app is as you see me goof
here basically this is free which is
amazing news every single day it's going
to give you a brand new challenge this
is today's challenge the day of
recording and and that challenge can be
brief it can be a little bit long the
previous challenge made use of the
gamepad where you touched enemies and
stuff and you'll see me do something
like that a little
down the line I think I'm actually going
to do that right now but the whole deal
here is that you're competing with other
players in order to get the best runs
the best times the fastest completion
rates the fastest collection rates and
you unlock stuff like additional heroes
which is what you're seeing right now
and of course you've got Globox one of
my favorites from the original game I
decided to switch back to Glavine he's
so goofy I decided to switch back to
Globox and retake the the daily
challenge and all the stuff works
towards unlocking more levels more free
playable content and it's all randomly
generated all the challenges and it's
going to be fresh every single day then
there's going to be a weekly challenge
so you compete in order to unlock new
trophies and register on the world scale
so right now you're seeing me run this
I'm trying to do it as fast as I can it
I don't think I break 24 seconds in this
in this recording for this quick run and
I'm looking at the leaderboard and
people are getting it done in like
seventeen seconds I'm not going to
suggest that I'm amazing at Rayman
legends but i'm okay how people are
doing it in 17 seconds I have no idea
you just saw pretty a pretty flawless
run there and I don't break 26 seconds
ah ridiculous so if you want to feel bad
about yourself while playing this game
that's the ticket honestly I think this
is a great move by Ubisoft I don't think
that it's going to say she ate all the
frustration that came from fans but it
is nice that the content is completely
free but speaking as a Rayman Origins
fan as I mentioned before it is really
great to be able to have access to these
levels but I can't help but feel that I
would so much rather just have the full
game it's nice that this is free i'm not
looking a gift horse in the mouth but i
just wish you be soft to decided to
release it on the wii u in February like
they promised but and here's some some
side news that kind of comes aside from
this video the developers Ubisoft
Montreal have announced that they've
already added 30 additional levels and
brand new boss fights to the game in the
wake of the delay so all that extra time
wasn't for naught we are going to get
more content to the game
that's fantastic I just why we use
collecting dust from day to day when I'm
not when I'm not able to play games and
Rayman legends would have been something
that pushed it over the edge this is the
weekly challenge it is a Wii U gamepad
controlled level I'm not actually going
to show the gamepad because what you see
on the screen is the same thing that I
see on the gamepad so it's it's nothing
different at all basically I'm
controlling Murphy he's the ferry that
you're going to see popping in and out
of the screen there and my job is to
highlight the these think they're called
in order for them to be worth double and
I want to get to 150 as fast as possible
on this weekly challenge I actually
played it a bit yesterday it's really
hard and again people are able to do it
so much better than I am just feel
terrible about this the touchscreen
stuff is fun I definitely prefer the
more traditional controller-based
platforming that's what made Rayman
Origins so special but playing this on a
multiplayer basis like local couch co-op
well one of us is rocking the gamepad
and someone else has the regular wii
remote that'd be nice but as it is now
I'm not complaining it's fun so like I
said this is completely free if you are
a wii u owner you can actually download
this from the eShop right now it will
cost you nothing it's going to be
available up until the game releases so
between now and and that date in late
August I think it's the 27th for north
america and the 30th for European
regions this app will be available and
new levels and challenges will be
released every single day every single
day between now and then that's awesome
so thank you guys for watching this is
joey davidson for TechnoBuffalo calm and
we'll be back with more game content
down the line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
