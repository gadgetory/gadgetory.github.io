TechnoBuffalo here HDC just took the
wraps off they're much typed brand new
flagship the HTC one let me run down
everything you got to know about this
guy and you can help decide whether
that's gonna be worth your phone buying
buck let's go and get started so new HTC
one isn't simply a handset that boasts a
4.7 inch that's full HD 1920 by 1080
display Android jelly bean a 1.7
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core
processor augmented to 2 gigs of RAM 802
11 ANC which most people don't even have
at their house yet including me or 32 or
64 gigs of storage the company's crafted
three very specific and somewhat oddly
named features into its new champ all
designed to shift focus to the overall
consumer experience and not just a spec
race to the top if you've really seen
over the past few years so then that
confines the ones zero gap aluminum
unibody design which would be available
in silver or black rest HTC's hopes for
the future which are blinkfeed zoe and
weirdly named boom sound so blinkfeed is
essentially designed to act as Flipboard
on your home screen and it's part of
HTC's brand new Sense 5 set up is an a
tiled formation feature and introduces
an easier way to follow information
that's relevant to you including social
updates news entertainment and lifestyle
updates HTC secured over 1400 media
sources like ESPN MTV vice media cool
hunting etc all of which can dynamically
fill your blinkfeed for at a glance
viewing it sounds excruciating for
battery life
HTC's pretty hopeful or 2300 milliamp
hour battery to get users through an
entire day without worrying right now
that you cannot add new fees you have to
deal with what HTC has put in their
forum they do have 1400 options
alright so it's the next new feature
there's the ones ultra pixel camera
they're gonna be an area of great
controversy HTC says it will and I quote
redefined how people capture relive and
share their precious moments with a
completely custom camera HTC says the f
2.0 aperture lens and sensor capable of
gathering 300% more light than competing
smartphone camera sensors and that's
saying a lot when Nokia's PureView is
still
town edition to a completely redone
sensor HCC's also developed their
calling multi access optical image
stabilization help users capture the
best possible HD video and image chip
2.0 has been stuffed into the ones
aluminum body and its f 2.0 lens
allegedly stimulates normals 28
millimeter lenses so HTC is hoping to
achieve here is not only crisp images
but ones that look beautiful when
adequate light sources aren't present
now your family photos and every time to
take them hopefully they won't look so
blurry they'll look nice and crisp and
according to HTC the era of the
megapixel is over
HTC said onstage during its one
announcement earlier today we developed
our own custom technology called the
ultra pixel camera it captures 300% more
light which allows users to capture
ghost lists HDR video and capture
amazing photos and low-light conditions
so it sounds kind of cool
certainly HDR video is awesome what's
really gonna freak people out a little
bit is that it's just a four megapixel
sensor and that's what HTC is trying to
prep people for by saying the megapixel
race doesn't count
it's only four megapixels the megapixels
don't necessarily determine how good the
image looks certain it gets misconstrued
megapixels really feeling blowing the
image up matter but certainly four is
way on the lower side than what we're
used to seeing especially with the
PureView camera that I just mentioned so
we're very curious to see what pictures
are actually going to look like on the
HTC One and see if the new technology
really is working or they're not it's
just a poor excuse to put a low of
sensor in there that has yet to be seen
so HTC is also open two types of viewers
or something they're called Zoe which is
essentially just like vine it makes
animated gifs
Zoe lets users capture high-res photos
that come to life in three-second
snippets that introduces professional
editing software to help you create
highlight reels for your life that can
then easily be shared on your preferred
social network finally the new HTC one
is something called boom sound which
brings front-facing stereo speakers
dedicated amplifier to the 4.7 inch form
factor
it sounds like marketing fluff but HTC
says users will experience richer
YouTube videos and better overall call
Claude a particular in noisy
environments there's also an HDR
recording option onboard that uses
voodoo techniques and dual microphones
for the best
possible audio fidelity on the recording
side so kind of neat I'm live speakers
are usually on the back of phones and
you rest them on a table that can get
muffled so having those sort of
front-facing speakers I should really be
helpful again or sort of hold out all
thoughts until we actually get a chance
to see the phone
overall the specs on this guy look
awesome it looks like a jacked up droid
DNA the little smaller screen you've
ever used a DNA having a 1080p screen is
freaking incredible it's also a huge
drain on battery life so really putting
this guy the paces will be a huge help
no word yet on pricing we do know that
it's going to be coming sometime in
early March to every US carrier except
for Verizon and a whole bunch of
carriers abroad so that's AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile
and Sprint so sorry Verizon folks
Android DNA is what you guys got it
looks really awesome
Todd Hazleton was there at a chat take a
look at the phone he said it feels
really solid said as good as this phone
like the iPhone feels in the hand this
one feels just as good HECS long been
known for the awesome build quality
looks to be a pretty impressive device
they're really powerful form factor
super curious to put it through its
paces test it and see how it lives up
but I really want to test that four
megapixel camera which means even crazy
to say and see how well it works see if
HTC is really just putting some
marketing speak over us whether or not
it really is one of the best cameras on
the market let's hear what you guys
think about the HTC One leave your
comments down below I am John rent you
from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you guys
the next video and if you like this give
it a thumbs up really helps out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
