you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome to another episode of ask the
buffalo i'm your host jon rettinger on
this edition we are going to talk about
the Nintendo 3ds price drop we're going
to talk about the PSP go and the
upcoming PSP vita we're going to talk
about what's going on with Google TV and
we're going to talk a little bit about
me personally and my life before YouTube
let's go ahead and get started so thank
you guys for tuning in to another
episode of ask the Buffalo you can ask
me jon rettinger any question you want
from the wide wide world of technology
you can ask these questions one of two
ways first you can send a message to me
on twitter at john for lakers or at
TechnoBuffalo use the hashtag ask the
bee and you can ask me anything you want
you can send those questions in 24 hours
a day 7 days a week otherwise once a
week on technobuffalo calm will put up
an article asking you to send in your
questions for things that you want
answered it can be obscure questions it
can be broad questions could be anything
that you just want to know whether it's
how to or how to fix something that
might be wrong with your phone or tablet
so without further ado let's go ahead
and get started so our first question
comes from user Josh to us John what do
you think about the Nintendo 3ds price
drop this is Nintendo's white flag wave
and saying we're sorry that we put 3d on
there we know it hurts your eyes we know
we don't have good launch titles and we
know you probably don't care that much
about 3d effective August twelfth
Nintendo was going to be dropping the
price from $249 269 dollars effectively
sticking it to those early adopters that
went out and picked up in at endo 3ds
when it was first released including
myself so this new price point is can
represent a loss on each console sold
for Nintendo which is not a new thing
most console manufacturers whether
they're physical consoles sit under your
TV or portable consoles in general
do take a loss on each of those
especially on the early stages of
manufacturing certainly as they get
older and components become cheaper
manufacturer they make up that profit
but they do make their money on game
sales and gain licensing a Nintendo is
hoping that a cheaper price is going to
make more people want to hop on the 3ds
van wagon I think the best thing to make
people hop on the 3ds bandwagon be
released with everybody wants on a
Nintendo console release a mario game
I've been loving playing my ocarina of
time on the 3ds but I do with the 3d off
so it really it hasn't been any sort of
giant improvements to me I certainly if
you have a week go ahead and download
the game from a virtual console you get
almost the same experience suming you
don't want the portable side of it so
what do you guys think price drop is a
good things the bad thing is a harbinger
of very bad things for Nintendo curious
what you guys have to say alright so our
next question comes from moffa 3 o's who
asks John should I get the PSP go or
wait until 2012 for the PS Vita that
question my friend is a no brainer first
of all PSP go's when pretty much been
discontinued by Sony it was a
non-physical media version of the PSP
gonna download all the games at a
smaller screen some cramp controls it
was a slide out people just didn't like
it now is reflected in sales so sony has
laid down the act I can probably get it
for a huge discounted price but don't do
it don't go for the PSP go wait until
evita it's certainly going to come in
early hopefully 2012 and everything we
were hearing looks like it is going to
be absolutely awesome so Viva la Vida
wait for that one our next question is
about a topic I haven't talked about in
quite a while Google TV a-- comes from
google TV 25 who asks should i get a
google TV now i want a blu-ray player
and heard the sony google TV has that
any can search the web should i buy it
now wait to the new one and when you
think that will be thanks google TV has
been the stepchild of google i was
launched with giant fanfare and has a
cool cool new features in it but it's
been sort of languished free fringe
product a lack of product updates we've
been promised and promised and promised
android apps george hasn't been
delivered are in promise and updates in
the OS
hasn't been delivered I would stay very
far away from google TV until we see an
update which is rumored coming very soon
perhaps to the IFA show which
TechnoBuffalo is going to be at in
Germany towards the end of august so
wait wait wait wait wait if you want a
blu-ray player that can do all kinds of
cool stuff I check out Samsung you're
gonna be able to get there sort of smart
player and get all kinds of cool widgets
in there including netflix hulu plus mu
do and all kinds of awesome video
features my recommendation definitely
definitely wait so I want to take a
break from answering questions to thank
our friends and sponsors that godaddy
the guys that keep the wheels of techno
Buffalo running looking to drive viewers
to your video content then get a dot TV
domain name and stand out from the crowd

and video bloggers like me or anyone

wins our next question has been on the
personal side i come from bob centinela
who asked John what did you do before
you became 8 hackery viewer well I was
in marketing I was running a marketing
department for a software development
company and I've mentioned this before I
hated my job I used to hope I was going
to get in a minor car accident not big
enough for someone to get hurt maybe I
like a hit a stop sign but an excuse not
to go and I sort of looked at what I
love and what I enjoy it and technology
is what I love and what I enjoyed and I
really tried to find a way to make
technology my life I was very lucky I
was in the right place at the right time
but if you guys have a passion for
something whether it's tech or sports
whatever it might be pursue it and try
and make your career if you try and fail
at least you know that you will given it
your best effort so that's my advice
hope you guys enjoyed this episode of
ask the Buffalo will be coming at your
every Monday Wednesday and Friday with
all new techno buff
lunes i'm your host jon rettinger I'll
see in the next video cool beans koo
beans what does that mean what does that
