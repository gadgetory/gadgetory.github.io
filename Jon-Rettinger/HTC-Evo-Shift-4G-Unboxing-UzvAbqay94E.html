TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the HTC EVO shift 4G it's got
quite a long name it's a 4G Android
running smartphone for Sprint's let's go
ahead and dig in and see if shift
happens alright so this is set right
from the folks at Sprint we are going to
bring in a long-lost friend to help us
se√±ores stabby the big ol knife make it
a comeback go ahead and cut into this
package and you'll do the whole unboxing
thing we'll run through the specs we'll
talk about the price we'll do of course
some size comparisons we'll go ahead and
rip this open like there's some PR
material from Sprint today we're set off
this lamp in just a minute
continue to dig in there we go sprint
EVO shift 4G a little bit of a long name
but no problem so the telling us it's a
demo unit on the side there's some demo
unit information here we've got what's
in the box but we're gonna see what's in
the box there's a picture of it we're
gonna run through all that business
Android experience blah blah blah let's
go ahead and open her up and here we
have the HTC EVO shift 4G a lot of names
like Sally Jessy Raphael go ahead and
tilt that over a little bit so you can
get it out boom we've been shifted
alright so let me run through the specs
real quickly then we'll take a look at
what else is in the box if this looks
reminiscent of the Evo because well be
supposed to but also I know if I leave
it like this and run through the specs
the comments are gonna be filled to take
off the plastic so I will first take off
the plastic alright we are looking at a
3.6 inch diagonal screen the resolution
of 480 by 800 thing powered by Android
2.2 this is an HTC built device and as
such is rockin sense which is the newest
version of sense it's got a Qualcomm 800
megahertz processor 512 megabyte
Ram on the back there is a five
megapixel camera with autofocus and
flash we're gonna peel off the plastic
tooks
I don't want to hear it the camera can
shoot video at 1280 by 720 so that is
720p the back is a bit of a soft touch
to go through it it's got a very nice
feel in the hand we've got four
capacitive buttons across the bottom so
typical Android buttons home button menu
button back button and search proximity
sensor on top this does not have a
front-facing camera on the left hand
side you're going to have your volume
rockers up and down and your micro USB
charging ports on the right-hand side
you're not gonna have very much bottom
not gonna very much other than a
microphone port looks like the back to
pull it off and gets the battery top
there's your gonna be your power button
3.5 millimeter headset jack and when you
slide this guy out you're going to have
a surprisingly nonce preloaded full
QWERTY keyboard here with d-pad and this
I have had a chance to get my hands on
the phone before the keyboard is
actually very nice I don't like the fact
that there's a lot of pressure at supply
to slide this open I really do like when
it's a spring-loaded keyboard the
keyboard here is very nice the disease
cinematic key throw despite its sliding
mechanism you can sort of see it from
the side plenty of room for your fingers
to rest on the keys big space part which
I like I'm not so sure how often you're
gonna use a d-pad but I do have the
option for it being here and you can use
the middle to select so it had a glaze a
five-way d-pad you've got your enter and
delete buttons and of course functions
as well go ahead and push that off and
we'll power that guy on in just a minute
but let's see what else we are going to
get in your EVO shift box go ahead and
pull all that stuff up so you've got
your sprint getting started so we can go
ahead and get started
you got a USB cable and a power pretty
Spartan affair in here but that's what
you are going to get and as the 4G name
implies this is a 4G phone so it's gonna
be running on Sprint's WiMAX network it
looks like the batteries installed here
the battery is going to be a 1500
milliamp hour battery let's go ahead and
turn this on and take a look at
we're going to see and I should mention
the power button is a bit sort of
recessed on an angle and if you can see
that so it's a little bit strange to get
used to if you use your thumb to hit it
you're gonna have a very hard time we're
gonna have to use actually your
forefinger to get to that as well
alright so while this is booting up
let's do a quick size comparison if
you're looking for a sprint 4G phone
with the full QWERTY keyboard chances
are you're probably gonna wanna cross
shop this or e will be cropping with
more of the flagship this is the Epic 4G
switch before a size comparison here
this is Sprint's Galaxy S device now it
does have of course a full QWERTY
keyboard and it is using the hummingbird
processor so it's going to be a bit
faster from a price standpoint at least
prices are always subject to change
sprint right now is charging a very
reasonable 149 dollars for the EVO shift
4G so I'm going to keep in mind if your
price conscious you're going to get a
very capable at least what appears to be
on paper very capable phone it looks
like we're going to be dying on us in
just a minute you can get a chance to
see what this looks like in here I'm
sure you guys have all seen scents in
the past this is actually not the newest
version of sense we've got that little
paintbrush icon in the bottom right you
can customize different skins this
appears to be just standard version of
HTC Sense which as far as Android skins
go is definitely one of my favorite and
you are getting the newest version of
sense
this is advertised this is one of the
newer versions of Android rather 2.2
you're not sitting on 2.3 Gingerbread
the version of cents that's on here is
newer than other US release devices but
hopefully we'll see that newest version
of cents make its way to devices coming
soon that was a lot of stumbling alright
so here is the phone it looks good it
feels nice in the hand the capacitive
buttons appear to work very well phone
looks like it's really going to die on
me for some other size comparisons so
let me bring back the epic you can see
how this looks so you're going to get a
little bit of a smaller screen size to
with the Evo chip the 3.6 versus a four
inch on the epic but people you know
generally like that smaller screen size
if that's going to be your thing you're
going to get a much smaller form factor
as well if you really are concerned
about scree
resolution having the fastest specs
you're gonna want to look at the epic a
little bit more if you want just a
capable phone that's gonna have nice
messaging features and be able to do all
your multitasking you're gonna want to
give</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
