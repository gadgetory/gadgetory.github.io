TechnoBuffalo here and I've got the
latest hotness from Nokia and Microsoft
this is the Lumia 1020 bringing its
gigantic 41 megapixel sensor to the full
let's go ahead open the box see what's
got inside so here is the box very
typical AT&amp;amp;T style with a picture of the
device on the back salable in three
colors black white or oh my god that's
bright yellow we have the black let's go
ahead and open this sucker up and we've
got a QuickStart guide for when you
guessed it getting started very slowly
we've got a Lumia 1020 NFC sticker which
looks like we'll let you be a Nokia
Lumia professional photographer push
that off to the side
that's an NFC tag not a sticker I know
it we've got texting and driving it can
wait and there's a phone which I
inadvertently turned on which will be a
perfect time and we want to take a first
look at the device so looking very
similar to its Lumia 920 friend let's
see what else we're going to have in the
box we've got free 20 by 30 poster from
Nokia so if you want a ginormous poster
they've got you covered
the sound of blur free photos and all
kinds of other Nokia business product
safety information we've got a wall wart
not sure why it's called a wall wart W
gross wart we've got a charging and
syncing cable I've got a lanyard for
making sure you don't lose your phone
and a SIM door key and nothing else
either side of that business so push
that off to the side for just a quick
second and here is the phone I'm just
gonna leave this the sticker on here the
whole time just because nothing will
peel this thing off we will get the
satisfied whooshing noise no whooshing
noise there so let's run through the
specs let's go turn off the screen so
I'm not distracted by shiny things I am
happy to know we've got a return of that
sort of standby screen that does tell
you what time it is alright so you are
looking at a four point five inch screen
the same size Lumia 920 with a 1280 by
768 pixel display and if you can do math
at home that is a 332 PPI the screen
Tech is WXGA Windows Phone 8 is on board
here it's got a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
s4 processor with
that many cores two gigs of RAM 32 gigs
of Exeter of internal storage there is
no external storage found on this guy
but you get SkyDrive we've got some
cameras on here I guess that's you know
we probably should mention that people
have some stickers it's a very run in
the mill camera here on the Lumia 1020
just in that regular 8 megapixel camera
41 freakin megapixels found on this guy
with all kinds of crazy camera
technology and I'm super excited to take
a look at you peel off the sticker and
we will unsheath the camera I'll do it
very slowly because you can come off in
one piece but it will suffice to say
eventually be unsheath there we go
the camera is free so don't wait camera
though Scott now sort of a poultry
sounding 2 megapixel camera on front 802
11 a B G and M bluetooth 3.0 2000
milliamp hour battery and NFC onboard so
now that I've got it booted up I can
give you guys a first look at it go and
swipe that up nothing new here it's
pretty standard Windows Phone 8 we've
seen this a million times
I've got your required three buttons
here and they are capacitive you got
your back button your Windows Home
button and your search button onboard
nothing on the left hand side on the
right volume rocker up and down standby
and lock and the camera shutter button
that's where your sim is going to live
right on top where your phone is going
to charge speakers that's where your
lanyard is going to plug in let's just
real quickly launch a camera nothing
else to really see on the OS we've
covered that a lot here but let's see
where this story lies with the camera
and of course we'll do a hands-on first
look and all the rest of that stuff in
our full review but just you can get a
quick look at what the camera does the
interface looks like let's go ahead and
hop right into that so go ahead okay
there's the box and there is the new
interface there's a lot of things you
can do here I can change the white
balance ISO and all kinds of other
business you can bring in a whole bunch
of filters and a lot of other image
stabilization things are going on here
under the hood but we'll cover all that
in our first look including that Nokia
pro cam anything you guys want to see us
cover please leave your comments down
