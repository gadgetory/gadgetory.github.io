to you by domain.com what's going on
everyone John render from TechnoBuffalo
here it's about damn time we bring back
retinues rants I haven't been mad about
something a while I'm generally pretty
happy fellow but this week I got so much
beef with HTC I might as well be one of
those giant steroid cows so HTC just
announced and just released their m9 the
presumably the flagship for the next
year since the m8 and the m7 was
everybody was happy
yay m9 except there were a few flaws in
my opinion a lot of other people's
opinions with the m9 the screen was one
of them and the lack of any sort of
fingerprint scanner to possibly be used
for payments or just be able to unlock
your phone we're sort of big emissions
that the competition had so you think
you're okay we have to wait until next
year maybe the m10 to get those features
no probably so I know this is the one so
HSE is going to release but I can get
the newest version of HTC says to you
dear consumer piss off we're gonna go
ahead and now it's HTC m9 plus includeds
got that plus you know what's gonna be
better than what you're buying they just
took the wraps off the m9 Plus which
dress is pretty much every concern
everybody had with the m9 5.2 inch 2k
screen it's being powered by a 2.2 give
you heard 64-bit mediatek helio x10
processor chipping a while to remember
but I'll talk about that in a second it
also has the fingerprint sensor it's got
the same sense 7 it's got boomsound
speakers based off of lollipop all the
other stuff that you would want in your
flagship phone and all those other stuff
that the m9 doesn't have so HTC what
them so here's my thoughts on it so
first of all the m9 plus I like coming
out in China but let's say you don't
follow the tech world as closely you
don't do what I do you're not sort of
reading every side every day but you
hear that there's an m9 plus are you
gonna go out and buy an m9 knowing
there's a Plus version something that
can be better than what you have
presumably not if it's a Fodor gonna be
using for the next 18 to 24 months it
just makes no sense in your minds to buy
something brand new that you know was
already kind of outdated
I get the mediatek processor is not high
ends but couldn't they have thrown in a
Snapdragon processor maybe
I think argument that the components
weren't ready yet maybe you can say they
couldn't get enough Snapdragon 810 chips
or they wanted to use in it okay I can
get that let's go with that argument for
a minute flashback to the Droid turbo
that thing packed three gigs of RAM 2k
screen specs that still make it a modern
phone motorola waited to get that phone
out so it would be good for a longer
period of time and still top notch for a
longer period of time
why couldn't you see just wait the g4 is
not getting talents to the end of the
month probably won't ship until sometime
in May why not wait till you got all
your damn ducks in a row before you
launch a phone that only looks like the
last generation business bring anything
relatively new to the table save for an
improved sense experience and then
beyond that why would you release an m9
plus that addresses all the shortcomings
of the freaking m9 I do not get it and
then release it only in China so people
might not know that it exists
so they'll bake oh great lamb 9 is new
but then maybe they'll hear about it and
be like what the hell HTC maybe they'll
think twice by buying another HTC
product we stopped real fast and thank

I like HTC products I've always liked
HTC products they've got incredible
build quality I like cents I think
they've done a lot of great things but
this move I cannot for the life of me
understand why not put the fingerprint
sensor at least in the m9 why not put
that 2k screen obviously had ready in
the m9 and why released an m9 plus only
in the Chinese market
I can you explain it to me maybe in the
comments you can explain it to me what
am I missing especially now in a
smartphone climate where Samsung has
definitely got their together
Apple's got a really competitive product
you got the g4 coming
you've got a great amount of Chinese
phones coming in that are really
top-notch things like hallway devices
coming in we've got still inexpensive
flagship phones like the oneplus one
presumably the oneplus 2 is coming I
cannot understand why HTC would not want
to make sure whatever phone they
released this year has everything
consumers would want about it they need
this phone to be hit out of the park and
there just don't appear to want to do
that if you tell I'm upset about it
I just um we're the consumer just like
you are if I was looking to buy a phone
I would have a really hard time buying
an m9 I have a really hard time buying
it knowing that it could be better and
that knowing things can always be better
but that there's a better phone that the
companies making that's already
available it's just a very tough pill
for me to swallow it might being a
raging lunatic here can you calm me down
can you tell me why I'm wrong am I just
being just a huge dirty a-hole I like to
keep your thoughts on it leave in the
comments down in this region it's a big
subscribe button if you want to see me
get mad again give the video a thumbs up
to always appreciate it till next time I
am Jon ranging from TechnoBuffalo
and I will calmly talk to you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
