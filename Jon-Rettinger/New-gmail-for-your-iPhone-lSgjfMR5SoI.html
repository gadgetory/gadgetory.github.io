april eighth google updated their mobile
gmail for the iphone and android and
they added a lot of very cool features
so i want to give you guys demonstration
of what some of those cool features are
so if you've got an iphone or a g1 or
any other android powered phone just go
to gmail com on your browser no need to
download an app or anything it's just
web-based so i'll give you guys a sneak
preview of my gmail inbox unlock the
phone got gmail cute up here so here's
my inbox looks just like it did before
except now you've got search at the top
here in the upper right hand corner to
make searching much easier it's got and
tap that and actually add sort of a
universal search you go ahead and search
your mail but makes it much easier to do
so who got hit done good back to gmail
let it search it's not going to find it
in there but i go through all mail so
you've got an inbox a refresh box and
you've got a new composed message box
there in the upper right-hand corner so
those are fine features and welcome
upgrades but they're not the cool thing
one of the things that i really disliked
about using gmail well as always have to
scroll back up to the top five ever
wanted to mark as spam delete or mark as
new well Google came up with a really
cool way to take care of that so here's
here's a YouTube message so just like
any other email now at the top you says
archive delete and more right there but
as you go ahead and scroll down that
email you noticed that bar follows you
it actually makes it very handy so as
you go ahead and scroll that bar is now
always at the top of the page you've got
access to your archive delete or the
more button lets lets you mark as unread
add a star or report a spam it just
makes navigating much easier today guys
just wanted to give you a real quick
tour of the new gmail for the iphone or
android hope you guys enjoyed for
exclusive content follow me on twitter
twitter.com / John for lakers i'll see
you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
