google play edition box you can see we
just have the HTC One labeling there's
no signifying factor aside from the
actual picture of the device and on the
back you of the spec listing here
Android 4.4 KitKat obviously and you've
got the Snapdragon 801 processor two
point three gigahertz same model that
launched on the carriers though with
different bands for unlocked usage
across different US carriers internal
memory 32 gigs here and two gigs of RAM
and you can of course expand that using
a micro USB card to 128 so let's open
the box
all right inside we have you've bought
the best HTC One so all the marketing
materials from HTC the phone itself
we'll put that to the side real quick
and we have the earbuds which are
actually a little bit different than the
ones we saw on AT&amp;amp;T and the other units
we've received in for review these are
white and silver as opposed to the black
and red buds that ship the other version
so that's kind of interesting right
there the spare buds with it and then
the charger here pop this open same as
before it doesn't look like it has the
quick charge accessory which will be
sold later this year and then the USB
cable as well and over here we have the
sim card tool google play edition of the
HTC One m8 showing you how to pop out
the sim safety and regulatory guide and
some stickers here for the imei etc okay
so let's peel this off the phone put
this to the side now here you've got the
same 5 inch display will power it on as
we go here 1920 x 1080 p under the hood
we already went over the processor two
point three gigahertz snapdragon
qualcomm 801 on the back you've got the
duo camera setup which includes the
ultrapixel camera it's a four ultrapixel
or a 4 megapixel if you will and the
depth sensor above it for the unique
photo shots and google is actually going
to provide some support for this even
though it's running a pure version of
Android 4.4 KitKat instead of sense 6 on
the right side here you have the micro
SD card slot the volume controls on the
bottom you've got the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack next to the micro USB
charger on the left the SIM tray slot
it's a little larger it's a nano sim and
then up top you've got the plastic
border here with the power button and
what HTC did is put a lot of plastic up
here to make sure the antennas are can
broadcast properly as opposed on the
back which is now ninety percent metal
as opposed to seventy percent on the
aluminum m7 so here's the welcome screen
we'll skip all this
so we can dive right in okay so here we
are inside of Android 4.4 KitKat again
no sense 6 here we're just looking at a
pier google play edition device no
additional home screens out of the box
we can say ok Google ok Google and we'll
get up a search bar here so that's a
feature that the actual the M set or the
m8 rather does not have this is the
google play edition does ok so let's
take a look at the camera app here now
it differs slightly from the HTC One m8
and that you don't have the custom
software that HTC added in terms of the
camera interface so you have a very
google play edition device camera here
you can snap photos and change the
settings as you would on other Google
Play edition devices however if you tap
if you take a quick picture go into your
gallery and then edit it you can use HTC
photo edit and that's how you're going
to access the depth sensor that's part
of this phone which HTC said they were
going to allow Google to use that so
here we have in effects you can use the
you focus to change if you want to look
at the background or foreground and
bring that into focus after the fact we
also have dimension plus for the 3d
parallax effect touch up and then the
various filters and frames that are also
available on the HTC One m8 so that's a
quick look at the camera ok so that was
a quick look at the HTC One m8 google
play edition you can see we're just
running a pure version of android and
we'll be sure to bring you a longer full
review of this phone in the near future
