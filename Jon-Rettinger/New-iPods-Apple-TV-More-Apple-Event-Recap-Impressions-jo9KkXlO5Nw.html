technobuffalo hearing today Apple
launched the slew of new products
hardware software and sort of in-between
at their what's become an annual ipod
event let me go ahead and recap what to
expect so if you seen you look down or
fiddle with some notes the keynote and
conference just ended actually Chris
Martin from Coldplay is still singing as
i'm recording this but we'll talk about
that in just a minute and i'll start at
the beginning where Steve Jobs began his
keynote so first gave some iOS updates
120 million iOS devices have been sold
which is pretty impressive in 200 apps
are being downloaded every second click
boom 200 x which is pretty cool give
some updates on new stores in Shanghai
and Paris and then he announced iOS 4.1
which is going to be out next week for
iphone and ipod touches with ton of sort
of new features including bug fixes
bluetooth fixes which I definitely
experienced Bluetooth wasn't always
pairing with the Bison will lose the
parent proximity sensor fixes and
something new in the camera called HDR
which stands for a high dynamic range
photos it's actually what that does is
when you snap a picture with your iPhone
it takes three pictures one normal one
one underexposed one overexposed instead
of combine them all into one image which
you're going to create a much richer
picture and if you don't want that HDR
image it's also going to store if you'd
like it to the regular image as well so
you can see the difference sort of pick
the one that's best for you which is
kind of cool it's going to be built into
iOS 4.1 you're also going to be able to
upload HD videos to YouTube I'll when
connected to Wi-Fi which has been one of
the big complaints of iOS four point oh
so that's pretty cool and also Game
Center which was demoed first when we
saw a beta of iOS four is now going to
be live would you like to play games
with other people any were really most
iOS game you don't employ other people
see leaderboards invite friends accept
invitations to get your whole gaming
experience online which is pretty neat
all right so then he gave a sneak it's
actually going to be out by the way
next week like I mentioned and there was
a sneak preview of a new game coming out
to iOS four called Project sword from
Epic Games looked really impressive
beautiful graphics and that's gonna be
out this holiday season then he also
gave a sneak preview now of iOS 4.2
opted into coming out later this year
probably in the November timeframe and
that one was mostly about the ipad the
ipad is not running iOS four we have
multitasking folders or any of that
other stuff but the first time you've
really seen it up and running on an ipad
so there are some sort of cool new
features you can expect with iOS 4.2
this also be true with the or some of it
will be true at least with the iphone 4
and the ipod touch so first wireless
printing i was just fantastic suis
friend the pages app for example on the
italian be able to print right to your
printer for connected over a network he
didn't mention it the wireless printing
was going to work on to buy southern the
ipad but i assume that if the pages
application gets ported to other iOS
devices most certainly will work airplay
which you can let you stream audio and
video over Wi-Fi in the background so
you can listen to music in the
background like pandora and stuff we've
seen this on other iOS devices kind of
neat everything sort of iOS four they've
come to know and love or loathe
multitasking folders and the rest of it
and it's going again going to be out
november for ipad iphone and ipod touch
so now it's time to talk about the new
products every ipod at the exception of
the ipod classic got an update the
classic was not discontinued just not
updated let's go ahead and talk about
some of the ipod updates that sea began
with she talked about the ipods first
new for a remodel year and he began with
the ipod shuffle and talked about the
evolution of the shuffle how it went
from sort of a stick of gum looking
thing to a thing with the clip and then
something looks like now like another
piece of gum i tried it without any
buttons and the new generation ipod
shuffle sort of a hybrid of the last and
current generation so it's got a clip
like the second generation and it's got
the voice-over like the third pretty
impressive very very very small 15 hours
of battery
when you're playing music can it come in
five colors and be available for forty
nine dollars all these new ipod i'm
going to mention are going to be
shipping next week going to be available
for pre-order today which is sep tember
first kind of cool iPod shuffle next
let's talk about the Nano and he sort of
gave the evolution of the Nano as well
it's that the only way to really make it
a little bit better and make the screen
a little bit bigger what's get rid of
the track wheels so ladies and gentlemen
track wheel is dead the ipod nano is an
hour click wheel is now going to be
completely multi-touch screen and it's
got a clip and the thing is small
compared to the outgoing ipod nano it is
forty-six percent smaller 42-percent
thinner it's got again a multi-touch
screen running a version of iOS got the
FM radio nike+ and the voice-over found
in the ipod shuffle it's going to have a
whopping 24 hours of battery life and
sort of kind of cool holding down the
home button are holding down the screen
is going to act as a home button which
may be sure of a sign of things to come
a next generation product it's going to
come in six colors it's going to run 149
bucks for eight gigs or 179 for 16 gigs
and thing just looks really pulling so
small you guys could clip it to your
wrist on a wristband don't use it as a
service cool Dick Tracy type watch so
that is the new ipod nano let's talk
next about the best selling ipod and
probably everybody's favorite the ipod
touch which was definitely due for an
update I interestingly enough the ipod
touch has now become the number one
portable gaming system in the world so
outselling the nintendo dsi and the sony
PSP like kind of interesting so the new
one is obviously thinner it's going to
have the iphone 4s retina display should
get four x pixel density in a really
high resolution screen the same a4 chip
found in the iPhone and the iPads or
things going to be very very very fast
it's got the 3-axis gyroscope as well so
instead of moving the device alleges
left and right go to go forward and back
which is going to be pretty cool for
gaming now has a front facing camera for
face time which is pretty neat you be
able to facetime over Wi-Fi of course
and go to face time with other ipod
touch users
and also with iPhones so if you know
someone with an iphone you go ahead and
get your face time on Zuma bleats are
going to work with email so kind of neat
so instead of the face time on the
iphone 4 worked with a phone number this
one will be associated to an email
address it also has a rear camera for
recording HD video didn't talk about the
resolution or what it could record just
HD video presumably 720p which would be
pretty impressive we don't know about
mega pixel edge or anything like that
quite yet although by the time you want
just maybe up on me up a website with
the full specs it's going to cost you
for naked good bite model 229 dollars
for a 32 gigabyte model no 16pin acconci
299 + 4 8 64 gigabyte model it's going
to set you back 399 so those are the
price points again all new ipod the
shipping next week in pre-orders are
starting today which is sep tember first
so now let's talk about some software
itunes 10 is launching and Steve talked
about how relatively soon itunes is
going to be out selling physical mediums
DubLi cds on the itunes logo as a big
old CD behind it so with itunes 10 we're
getting a new itunes logo without the CD
behind it love it or hate it just a new
logo uh so itunes 10 is going to bring a
decent amount of new features you're
going to get a new hybrid view when you
have a lot of music that's in the same
album in listview would just list the
album pretty much all the way down when
you have five songs or more that are in
part of the same album you're not going
to see the album artwork instead of this
listing the album name all the way down
not going to take up any extra space if
it's sort of a nice new visual cue kind
of neat so Apple is now in this social
media business with a new service called
ping it is essentially according to
Apple a social network for music it's
going to be built right into itunes 10
its social music for discover you can
follow and be followed you can see what
all your artists are doing music wise
have your own profile that kind of thing
very similar to facebook now myspace had
been a real big push in a real big force
in the music industry this is just
another real kick in the nads for
myspace looks like Apple is sort of
in the social media business which
really not many people saw it coming but
this is going to be the new pink service
the ability to sort of create a circle
of friends you can set how many people
are going to see what music you're
downloading or concerts you went to or
19 songs whatever music related stuff
you want people to see and presumably
it's not going to be just music related
applicants aight just from music but you
can post whatever you want to post kind
of interesting very easy privacy filters
a sort of a dig I guess Facebook very
very very easy to use and easy to access
privacy features an apple really went on
the record is saying this is not
Facebook this is about Twitter this is
meant just for music but we'll see sort
of what ping involves into it's going to
be available today it's part of itunes
10 be available to 160 million users in
23 countries and presumably the rest of
the countries that have itunes will be
getting it in the near future as well
it's also going to work on iphone or
ipod touches kind of neat and then steve
said there was one more thing and the
one more thing unsurprisingly was a new
Apple TV which is not renamed I TV is
still going to be called Apple to me as
a sort of the update i think a lot of
people have been waiting for it so we're
going to get apple TV in terms of
internet TV as a whole mainstream into
most people's houses so first off it's a
quarter the size it looks very very very
small you see some pictures of it as I
talk it's got a power supply built right
into its no need for a brick it's got
hdmi port Wi-Fi 802 11 and ethernet port
if you want it and it's got that new
aluminum remote it's going to come with
it it's going to be all HD he didn't say
whether there's 1080 or 720 presumably
it's going to be 720 it's all rental
base so there's no purchases which also
going to mean there's no onboard storage
talk about that in just a minute
everything was going to be streaming so
either streaming from Apple servers you
can stream from your computer if you
want as well since there's no storage
not going to be seeking anything over
just grab the content onto your computer
so your desktop computers won't have to
be on or laptop by suppose I'm go to
stream content right to the apple TV
pretty neat 499 for first run Hollywood
movie so the day they're out on DVD it
will be out to rent on Apple TV for just
under five bucks again the same day also
now I
TV show rentals and only two networks
are on board right now ABC and fox and
show we're going to be 99 cents
presumably they'll be the day that they
show on television or the next day also
kind of neat we now have netflix
streaming on the Apple TV in luck people
are going to be asking why would Apple
put netflix on the Apple TV when you're
not going to maybe buy a movie that you
rent a rented movie that you get from
itunes and I'll just watch on netflix
talk about that in just a minute we also
have a YouTube you're on your YouTube
player and a new UI so let's go ahead
and talk about netflix for just a minute
but before we do let's talk about price
this is going to be ninety nine dollars
and that's why i want to talk about
netflix look some players that play
death lips like the roku box xbox 360
playstation 3 wii they certainly those
things do others but a lot of people are
buying them primarily for netbook if you
weren't playing games of the roku in
specifically now you just pick up an
apple TV and I assume apples figuring as
long as you go I have it maybe they're
going to rent a movie or watch a TV show
maybe they wouldn't have rented before
so Netflix just order the first taste of
the drugs I guess to get you in the door
hoping that apple TV is going to keep
you hooked and let you keep renting
movies so $99 it's down from my bleep
229 from the previous generation Apple
TV I'll be available within the next
four weeks later this month and also
kind of cool that new airplay that we
talked about let you stream content from
your iOS devices to your Apple TV so you
can rent a movie on your iPad iPhone or
iPod Touch or a TV show watch the first
20 minutes though it walk downstairs hit
a button and play it directly on your
Apple to be right where you left off
I'll just kind of need sometimes I
download whole seeds in TV shows when I
fly or travel and tour stuck watching
that content on my iPhone or iPad or
computer or wherever i can i'm just very
easily stream that right to the
television which is pretty neat kind of
cool so what do you guys think about all
this announcement very excited not
excited you want to see anything not
seeing anything of course we'll have
full hands on of these products on
technobuffalo and a youtube channel i
want to know what your thoughts are on
the apple event know Apple is a very
polarizing company i like to hear what
you guys have to say hi i'm jon
rettinger
no Buffalo and I will see you in the
next video bye bye
