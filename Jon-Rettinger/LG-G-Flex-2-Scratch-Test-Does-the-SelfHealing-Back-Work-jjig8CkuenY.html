to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's up everyone John rent
your from TechnoBuffalo here we are on
location from CES 2015 taking a look at
the latest from LG this is the G flex 2
addition to a crazy fast processor in a
curved body one of the cooler features
about this device is its self-healing
back but what does that mean and how
well does it self heal I figured I'd
take the phone and I take some keys and
I put it to the test
alright so we've got the G flex 2 and on
the back as I mentioned it's got this
sort of self-healing coating on it it's
not so feeling like you know the t1000
or anything how this works is actually
really cool so I'm gonna get a little
bit nerdier than usual for a minute and
tell you a little bit about this back so
it is coated with a lot of hydrogen
atoms and hydrogen naturally likes to be
equidistant from each other and when
there's a scratch on the surface those
atoms get separated so how did it
naturally wants to come closer together
and that's how the little scratches and
Nick's can get healed obviously if you
scratch off this coating or you take a
knife to it it's not gonna sell feel
things like that but little scratches
the little Nick's it'll go away like
magic on the previous LG G flex had a
similar bit of technology and a kind of
rub your finger over it you had a little
bit of heat and take about a minute for
it to happen this one so peels in about
10 to 15 seconds so way way way quicker
the back looks like plastic and it feels
like plastic but you can definitely feel
that there's more to it you can almost
push your nail through it you can feel
it there's a material there so I carry
my phones I don't usually use a case but
usually keep them in complete separate
pockets for my keys because I'm worried
about a scratches on the front and back
of the device so I figured what better
way than just to try it on camera so we
got a set of old-school keys I've got
the phone right here looks like it would
in the pocket I'm gonna go ahead and
just rub these guys on here go back and
forth to push a little hard I'll turn
the keys down so the edges are there
I'll give a bit of a scratch to even get
anything showing
it's a bottle opener get that going
there too I've got a little bit of Nicks
and dings at the top go ahead and get a
little bit of heat give it a few seconds
kind of wipe it clean for my
fingerprints and those little Nick's and
scratches are gone that was this is
obviously a bit of an exaggerated test
because I'm actually rubbing keys on it
what if you just put it in your pocket
so let me go try that I'm gonna take
these keys and throw in my pocket take
the same phone my throw up my pocket I'm
gonna simulate like walk-in dancin and
doing my thing scratching in them all
around like you would if you're just out
on a normal day go ahead take the phone
back out same thing a couple little
scratches and Nick's a little bit of
this action we end up with my sleeve
and the back of this phone almost looks
like new I'm go ahead and sort of show
you different angles so it's no camera
tricks or anything of all this thing
really just feels itself whether it's
scratch with your finger just scratch it
with keys it's going to look really good
and again obviously you can scratch off
this back coating and it's not gonna
keep itself that way it's not made of
magic but just little scratches little
superficial stuff I'll go ahead and take
care of where it's really cool proof of
concept that LG decided to bring to the
market and what do you guys think is
this a killer feature for years you care
is it something that you would want our
next device see your thoughts I don't
leave it on the comments down below so
