TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the rim blackberry playbook this is one
of my favorite devices at CES I'm happy
to finally get my hands on the
production model let's go ahead and get
started alright so this guy just got
delivered from the folks at Negri
electronics there's a lot to like about
it let's go ahead and dig right in of
course a bootleg Ettore Senor stabby
will cut the tape tape has been cut go
ahead and open this up we'll run through
all the specs and all that business as
we go tape is her to cut them expected
alright now we've got that safely opened
up here is the BlackBerry PlayBook push
all those peanuts off to the side peanut
gallery there you go go and open it up
here is the BlackBerry PlayBook pretty
thin package actually so let's go ahead
and run through some of the highlights
now run through the rest of the specs
this is a 7 inch tablet it's a lot
smaller than the rest of tablets on the
market or these some of the more popular
tablets so it's if it's your niche this
is going to be a perfect sized tablet
for you it's sort of in-between the 10
inch and the 4 to 4.3 inch smartphones
this is a 16 gigabyte model it's gonna
come in 16 32 and 64 and models there's
a picture of the device on the front
BlackBerry PlayBook with the rim logo
all kinds of specs and legal information
but enough to let's go ahead and dig in
since I'm really curious to get my hands
on this got the BlackBerry logo is
attempt to there's more plastic bust out
the cutter and we will have this sucker
open there we go one more piece a boom
go ahead and lift this up there is the
playbook thanks for watching a nice time
neoprene sleeve you're also going to get
playbook if I was r'mante the playbook
of rules which would be kind of funny
for me so this is make sure your area
had Wi-Fi coverage press the power
button follow the on-screen instructions
they've got that a few different
languages we're also going to have power
let's go ahead and see how this guy's
charged up somehow a lot of stuff to cut
with this hack this open I will take a
look at a tablet very quickly
alright we're going to have your wall
charger of course which is what kind of
courses he's gonna use it's got we got
micro USB which is quite nice and a USB
cable we've got some documentation CDs
but enough of that we're going take a
look at the tablets this is what I am
most excited on this is much smaller
than I expected alright so now that
we've got rims tablet out of the box
let's go ahead and take a look here
we've got the 7 inch screen there's a 3
megapixel front facing camera with the
LED status indicator if we flip this
thing back on its butt we're gonna see
the 5 megapixel 1080p shooting camera on
the back soft touch feel on the
BlackBerry logo that's a small mirror
you can kind of see yourself on the
bottoms where a lot of the action is
gonna happen we've got a dock connector
HDMI out and your micro USB charging
port it's gonna tell you what size you
have here this is a 16 gigabyte model go
ahead and flip it over on the top I've
got a very recessed power button got
your play and pause button and volume up
and down 3.5 milimeter headset jack with
microphone in and that is really it for
the size of the BlackBerry PlayBook
there's a lot packed in here the screen
resolution is 1024 by 600
which is WS VGA dimensions got that
forefinger multi-touch which is kind of
neat it's got a 1 gigahertz key I built
dual core processor so that's 1
gigahertz on each core it's got 1 gig of
ram the cameras that we mentioned it's
got the BlackBerry tablet OS we just
tell her by qnx which is really a sneak
preview of what we're gonna see in the
next generation blackberry operating
systems
it's got true multitasking you've ever
seen the PlayBook videos you're familiar
with webOS - close application you sort
of swipe them off and they actually do
continue to run in the background full
flash support and of course html5 the
HDMI video out on the bottom some of the
glaring omissions however with the
playbook there is not a native mail or
calendar application yet those are
coming soon there also be coming soon
will be full support for Android
applications compared to pick this up in
16 32 or 64 gig configurations for $4.99
$5.99 or $6.99 respectively let's go
ahead and bring in a real quick size
comparison here is the iPhone 4 to sort
of see how small this really is you can
see the on-screen keyboard there popped
up let's also bring in one of the
playbooks competitors the iPad 2 got
right here for a comparison you can see
how small the seven-inch grain really is
on the PlayBook this is very portable
really something that you could carry
with you almost throw into a jacket
pockets really I wouldn't say jeans
unless you're wearing some big baggy
jeans but it's got a really nice feel to
it curious how the seven-inch screen is
going to react and how it's gonna work
having a screen smaller than I have used
to and I guys i am john r Ettinger from
TechnoBuffalo we're gonna be putting
this guy through a ton of paces and a
lot of reviews coming up so anything
that you want to see particular about
the BlackBerry PlayBook be sure to leave
your message down below I'll see the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
