technobuffalo here with an unboxing of a
ton of what i think is ipad and iphone 4
accessories the folks at a echeck looked
like they came through big time with a
lot of cool stuff this video is going to
be a combo unboxing and review I'm going
to unbox them and I'll use them and I
will slice those two segments of the
video together let's go ahead and get
started so of course we'll use old
stabby here to go ahead and dig into
this box and this stuff was sent from
the folks at a tech I'll put a link down
below in case you interested in any
other products I think they can be
picked up from a case for ipad calm or a
case for iphone4 calm anyway those are
number four so let's go ahead and dig in
go ahead and slice this sucker open take
off the packing label feels quite heavy
so I assume there's either a lot of
stuff in here or one or two really heavy
things so let's continue to cut this
there we go alright so I've got the Box
open it's like there's some packing
information if what's in there cool all
right so let's go ahead and see what we
have we've got a ton of iphone 4 case
they look to be very thin fit let's
check out with a few light and again I
will do a review on all these mouths try
them and see what the quality and see
how they work you know over about a week
or so go ahead and just dig in it's like
there are quite a few different color
choice with these cases go ahead and
pull one of them out of the box it's
made that soft touch sort of rubber feel
so now what you see on the back of
actually the amazon kindle three it's
got a nice feel to it it's thin plastic
so definitely low profile looks like
you're also going to get a screen
protector for both the front and back of
the devices so that's kinda guy actually
nevermind just for the front on the back
the case obviously going to protect you
back and you're going to get a bit of a
cleaning cloth and a little plastic
squeegee for bubble removal so kind of
cool actually they're putting a lot of
stuff in here for these cases go ahead
and push this off to the side and it
looks like if you want
pick up one of these guys on your own I
can get them from amazon at the links
down below for just about 11 bucks or so
so we've got a few of these and these
are going to be great items for
giveaways at later time so if you're in
the market for an iphone 4 case pick
good look at these guys alright so we've
got that color if you've got a ton of
different choices here we've got a red
one we've got a white once want to make
your iPhone look white it's gonna be a
nice way to do it we also have a pink
one for the ladies or guys that like
pink we have a blue one feel like I'm
trying to learn my colors we've got a
black one oh you guys say it with me
this one is gray uh uh we also have a
aqua blue a semi called yes still didn't
learn my colors we got another white one
and we've got a orange one actually
looks kind of cool alright so we have a
lot of iphone 4 case i will use those
and i like you guys know how they work
and it looks like we also have some ipad
kids and we do indeed have some ipad
cases let's go ahead and pull this out
and see what it looks like comes in a
almost like a pencil pouch type of your
bag so if it's made of a leather esque
type of material similar to actually the
case that comes on the kindle that's a
little strap it pulls off to the side
and your iPad fits right in there close
it back up still very low profile so we
will push that off to the side and see
what else you have in the box probably
have it looks like a few more those in
different colors so we saw the red we'd
have a brown these are going to make
awesome awesome giveaways we've got a
black we have
this is a little bit of a different case
let's go ahead and open this guy up
Justin's got a button on it go ahead and
see what this looks like this one feels
really nice sort of a soft suede feel to
it again links to all these products
will be down below and keeps you on pick
one up right open this up like this
one's a bit more high-tech if you want
to set it up to stand up to watch some
TV also spots for a little better
protection on the screen there so that's
kind of a kind of nice go ahead and
close it up and looks like they are made
by the care folks as well and you can
put the top back through there and you
can perch it up see what else we've got
another one similar that black one in
red leather case for ipad this one is
similar as well but in brown and looks
like we also have a bag of something
let's go ahead and check out what was in
here it looks like we have capacitive
stylus is it kind of neat to again
interested in these products there will
be a link down below I'm going to go
ahead and actually review all this stuff
and that will come back on the video and
we'll see how it holds up alright so
I've had a chance use these accessories
for a few days I got a better sense of
how they work and how they feel let's
start with the iphone cases these are
not going to be a type of cases that are
going to offer a ton of protection when
it comes to drop they are gonna offer a
lot of protection though in terms of
keeping the back of your device scratch
free install is very easy to sort of
slides in and it's very low profile
early doesn't add any sort of weight or
bulk to the pocket the back feels very
nice sir help you grip it a little bit's
got that soft touch rubber we go ahead
and pull it off here and show you what
it looks like to take it off which is
relatively easy to go ahead and snap it
right off and it comes off it's not made
of the world's thickest material so if
you drop your phone you still may be in
a little bit of trouble certainly having
some protections going to be better
better than none here I'm going to try
and slide it all the way off the back
pull it off over the buttons
and let it just fall on out there you go
so it does offer you know again a little
bit of protections made of made of
plastic but it does offer a pretty nice
access to all of your buttons camera and
the accessory ports on the top without
scratching the device when you're taking
it on and off which is nice a lot of
cases will actually scratch your device
while you're putting the case on this is
not going to do that it comes in a ton
of different colors and offers a pretty
decent protection I had a cave very
similar to this that i use on my iphone
3g and i really liked the fact that it
was sort of low profiles making them a
lot of bulk and it's detected the advice
it's also going to shield you from
antennagate so if you're sort of
suffering from the dropped calls or drop
bar issues something like this is really
going to work and again you for
interested in picking one of these up
links you're going to be down below and
of course they come at a ton of
different colors and you're going to get
least amount of accessories with them
two you're going to get a script
protector for the front you're going to
get a microfiber cloth and a little bit
of a squeegee to help put that cloth on
so these are the iphone 4 cases and they
were quite a few of them next thing that
i want to talk about which i found sort
of kind of neat and surprisingly useful
are there capacitive stylus you're going
to show you what that means so on a
traditional smartphone or traditional
touchscreen devices we used to have
resistive touchscreens think some of the
older palm devices or think of some of
the older windows mobile devices so what
that means is when you use a touch
screen there were two layers of film and
they made a connection by pushing those
two layers together so as you touched
they went together and it was sore
pressure-sensitive well those are the
older generation of touch screens we now
have capacitive touchscreens
intentionally register the touch by a
transfer of electrons but which are
great and serve a lot more sensitive but
you lose out on a lot of the accuracy
that you may have had with a traditional
resistive screen stylus especially for
graphic designers you can actually have
a pen interface let's sort of bridges
that gap and gives you that sort of pen
s interface so let me go ahead and open
this up here and show you so go ahead
and open up
so I open up safari you can go ahead and
look around and scroll just as you would
anywhere else oh go ahead and jump on
over to technobuffalo and if you're
trying to draw our sketch is gonna be a
great tool and it's not um sort of a
foam that you've seen on other ones for
cheaper devices it's actually a little
bit of plastic and it transfers the
electrons nice and normal and it's
actually very smooth and really works
use multi touch with it and if you want
to sketch or draw if you're sort of into
the sketching or drawing it's going to
be sort of great tool for you so there
it is working welcome touch stylus go
ahead and pop it in your pocket rubber
might be sort of a nice quality and
works really well I know a lot of
designers out there really use these
things quite regularly so we'll push
that off to the side I'm actually happy
to finally have one alright so let's
talk about the ipad cases that work that
we got two separate styles of cases in
very different colors let's go ahead and
bring in style number one will do both
these in black this is more of your
traditional case the ipad slides in case
closes and this slides right over to
sort of keep it locked pretty
straightforward stuff go ahead and open
this back up i'll go ahead and put the
ipad in and show you what sort of
protection it offers and see if it looks
like it's going to fall out from it as
well it's secured by those little straps
go ahead and push that in and that is a
really the extent of the security here
so go ahead and turn it around when you
want to lock it up run push then see if
the ipad is going to fall out my hand
underneath just to be sure when it's
closed up there's really in danger you
can see it starting to sag out a little
bit but it's not going to fall out again
sort of sort of the theme of these
videos are low profile this is not going
to take up much extra room in your bag
or backpack whatever it might be it's
got sort of a nice look to it's got a
professional look too it's got that
leather feel this is sort of very
classic almost journal like go ahead and
push it off to side open up your iPad
you can go ahead and just start working
there one of my worries about this
though is that since just held in two
straps if I go ahead and hold it upside
down the iPads going to slide it right
out so you really do need to be careful
about that you can slide the iPad back
here under
these this part there's a little bit of
an area to push it in I found it very
hard to put in there actually and to get
it to stay and then put under the straps
I found myself to just using the strap
so if you've got a bit more dedication
you can push it in and sort of keep it
under there and you're not going to have
that falling out issue I've found it
just a little bit difficult to maneuver
but it certainly can be done I just did
it right there and then go ahead and use
this case for going to and from class oh
you're going to soar get full access to
everything it's not going to block the
screen that little sort of fake leather
piece across the top a case is a value
on the twenty dollar range you're
getting a decent value for what you're
spending offers a lot of protection top
of it here is at least amount of cushion
and it's going to be hard right here for
the protection so when I use this case
yes I most definitely would use this
case I get probably something like this
as in everyday case for traveling back
and forth to school or going to meetings
not going to add a lot of bulk and it's
gonna just make things a little bit
easier for carrying yet enough to worry
about dropping the device and it
definitely offers more protection than a
tea stock APPL case alright so let's
pull this guy out and take a look at the
next case that folks today text sent
over R and push this off and again that
will come in a myriad of colors and now
we have this guy which is sort of a very
nice soft feeling material feels almost
leather ish go ahead and open it up and
go ahead and push the ipad on in this
one's a little more straightforward how
it's going to go in go ahead and turn
this over turn it like this push the
ipad on in and it's much easier i found
to put into that side piece and it was
on the last case slide it under these
straps plunder the other strap there you
go close it up and button it now you've
got sort of a very nice looking smooth
ipad case now it's also has a bit more
utility to it you can go ahead and open
it up and angle it so you can you know
watch
content propped up go ahead and close it
back and give it a nice button that's a
bit more of a professional case I
freeing a lot of business settings it's
a probably really nice case to bring it
looks like almost like a professional
business folio and this is what I would
bring to when i go to businesses in fact
i have i would have gone to businesses
do what I've actually put it in upside
down right there but you can see what
the case would would look like really
works well it's very nice thins low
profile again and offers a relatively
decent mount of protection one of things
I like most about the case and go ahead
and any ipad off and take it out of here
and show you one of the cool features of
the case it's actually this stuff right
here that's almost a little bit of
raised protection protect the screen on
the top and bottom something that I
really liked and also serves a function
as putting a points where this is going
to lock into when you want to prop the
device up so really a dual function and
also extra protection I really actually
found these cases to be relatively high
quality as well despite a pretty
inexpensive entry point so the guys are
looking for a nice value for iphone or
ipad accessories I check out the links
down below and pick one up for yourself
I definitely give them my recommendation
anyway I am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and I will see you in the
next video buh-bye
