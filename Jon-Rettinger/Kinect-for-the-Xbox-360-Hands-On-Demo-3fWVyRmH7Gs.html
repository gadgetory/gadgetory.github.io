TechnoBuffalo here Microsoft's Kinect
the Xbox 360 a Dom that ditches our
controller and uses your body as to
detect your motion has been a bit of an
enigma since it was first announced at
e3 they're only a few places right now
in the country we can actually get some
hands-on time with Kinect and I happen
to get the unique opportunity to be able
to go to one of those and spend some
time with the Kinect system so the foot
that you're about to see is some
hands-on time of some people playing
Kinect and I'll sort of chime in over it
give you some demonstrations and some
thoughts about the how well Kent works
in the end I'll pop in and sort of give
a very early review I hope you enjoy all
right so this is a hands on Democrats
clearly that's not me but I was able to
get some footage of me playing this game
a little bit later and this kid right
here so you can see that he's playing
the boxing game you've got the connect
unit serve on display right below the
television as well as an Xbox controller
you can see sort of as he dances and
moves with it it wasn't entirely deck
which I would have liked I wanted to
come might have to do with the kids
height when I got some hands-on time
with it as I mentioned in the first
beginning part of this video
it was noticeably better so there's a
bit of wait time here as he does the
bowling I'd say overall this bowling
game was more fun than Wii bowling but
it wasn't as a cos I would have liked
reaches over and grabs a ball you can
see it picks it up as he goes through
and she puts arm back and releases a
little bit of a delight clearly he's not
the best bowler in the world but you got
to give the kid credit for for trying so
as he moves around you can see the
Avatar move on as well he's staying
pretty stable they got dance moves there
and excuted controller and the avatars
are moves on its own a little bit you
can see right there it's not really
truly a one-to-one it sort of moves in
the direction that you move your hand he
goes and fold one more time take a look
at his accuracy he does get a bit better
I did give him credit yeah I couldn't
knock this one pretty hard I finally got
a strike after his previous gutter balls
so let me show you a demonstration of
what the Kinect system actually looks
like up close I haven't seen that much
footage of the actual system
all right so here we have the Kinect
unit itself it is very small smaller
than I expected it to be you can see
it's got the two the two cameras we're
going to take a look around the back
there weren't many ports there just a
power button I couldn't really get the
camera around it as far as I would like
there were security all around but it
does look very small almost the same
size as what you'd expect for a micro
surround sound system in front of the
television one of the virtual deals I
can see right here it's got sort of
three sensor duty to light reflecting
I'll move around it just a little bit
more overall is much smaller than I
expect it to be and it's not the worst
looking century if you have to pick one
all right spend a bit more of the
controller and the Kinect system in
action so one interesting thing about
and I'll talk just very quickly when you
want to select something I was gonna
visit you know a physical button to push
you actually hold your hand over it and
it starts to sort of fill up you see the
colour go all the way from the bottom up
to the top that's how you're gonna make
selection so when you want to change
games got to hold your hand and moving
selves over that I continental sort of
fill up and here you can sort of see the
bowling game on action and other kids
started keeping in a job you started to
attract quite an audience he really they
appear to all be much younger I was the
only uh old four year playing this all
right so as you can see from Kinect it's
a bit of a mixed bag it's a really cool
idea and you feel very very high-tech
and sort of Futurity moving our hands
around and throwing the balls and
running in some of the games that they
had it really is a lot of fun and you do
get a pretty good workout like some of
the games as well surprisingly however
in the current form it's how well it's
calibrated and how well it works in a
one-to-one motion wasn't as good as I
would have liked can I move my hand if
it was out of the camera range and I was
right in front of it it would
necessarily detect my motion that's
actually moved my hand down to be into
the camera I think it's gonna depend a
lot in the position of the Kinect unit
itself so how well it's looking at you
and where it's located especially when
you have two people of different heights
so you saw a kid playing and I'm
certainly much taller if you have a
taller friend over you're playing with
children you may run into a bit of
difficulty sir we saw that with Kinect
so overall I'd say my came away very
positive feeling about I think it's got
a way to go forget
to release later on this year but I
think with the proper calibration and
the proper setup it can be a lot of fun
I'm certainly never going to replace a
physical controller but for party games
and sort of doing some some fun motion
things and getting possibly a good
workout it's a very interesting
proposition however we have yet to see
how it's gonna look and how it's gonna
react to have family kits retail shelves
hope you guys enjoyed and very curious
what your thoughts are I'm like yourself
connect I am John Rhett injure and I'll
see you next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
