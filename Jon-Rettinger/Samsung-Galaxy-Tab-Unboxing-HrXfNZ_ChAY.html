from TechnoBuffalo heareth and unboxing
it on really excited about this is the
Samsung Galaxy Tab it's the first really
mass-market Android tablet we've seen
let's go ahead and take a first look and
see if it's got a shot at taking over
the iPad throne alright so the folks at
Negri electronics hooked us up with this
European Samsung Galaxy Tab of course is
coming to the US on all four major
carriers sometime in the November time
frame before the holiday season it's
going to take a look and see what we
have on the box so we've got a picture
of the device here as a box is very
small so reflecting the 7-inch tablet
inside go ahead and see on the side
really nothing on the back we have some
specs is a European version so it does
have a European 3G bands but us 3G it is
a 7 inch WS VGA screen that resolution
of 1024 by 600
Ubik a poblano rest of the specs that
we'll talk about as I go through and a
boxer device that is of course Android
and it's running Android 2.2 let's go
ahead and bring out all stabby there go
knife here and break the seal I have not
seen one of these yet in person so I'm
too excited to check one out and see if
they look like so here is the Galaxy Tab
go ahead and tilt that over and pull it
out very small device a little bit
thicker than I thought we're going to be
looks like the standard thickness of a
smartphone I'll push it off side for
just a minute of course we'll do some
size comparisons let's see what else
you're going to get in the box with your
Galaxy Tab so some language here I'm not
sure what that is maybe it looks like
it's German a foreign plug looks like
that's a European we've got a power
brick which is just USB and we have a
USB to micro-usb sync cable and a pair
of stereo headphones with microphone
input push it off the side for just a
minute and let's run through the specs
of this
I just very quickly it is a seven inch
Android 2.2 powered tablet with some
custom Samsung skins to it it's got a
resolution again of 1024 by 600 it's
running a 1 gigahertz a cortex processor
you may have heard it being called
hummingbird a similar processor is
actually almost identical processor
that's powering the Galaxy S series of
devices 512 megabytes of RAM 3 megapixel
camera on the back with LED flash that
is out of focus and a 1.3 megapixel
camera right there on the front and this
does have full flash 10.1 support for
all of your web browsing in this
particular model I believe has 16
gigabytes of on-board storage as well so
be sure to stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo
for a ton of code to this guy will be
powering it all I've taken looks first
looks comparing it with the iPad and
speaking of the iPad 2 go ahead and do a
quick size comparison and see how these
two look together to pull the camera out
just a little bit and see is certainly a
big difference here from a science
standpoint and see that huge difference
see from the thickness point as well the
Galaxy Tab is a bit on the thicker side
sort of do a size comparison there you
can see that it's a little bit larger
alright let's take a look at the Galaxy
Tab into we're going to have you've got
your Android array of buttons here so
we've got a menu button home button back
button search button of course your
seven-inch screen there's a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera for video
chat on the left hand side you've got a
microphone on the right hand side we've
got a volume rocker up and down and a
power and lock button it's got a micro
SD card which you can actually access
without having to take out the battery
and it's quite nice go ahead push that
aside and get access to it does not look
like one comes pre-installed SIM card as
well no need to take off the back if you
get a sim GSM version go ahead and
insert that right there on the bottom
we've got actually a charging port which
is not micro USB excuse me it is a
Samsung proprietary port and we've got
two
stereo speakers 3.5 millimeter headset
jack on the top on the back we've got
that 3 megapixel camera that we
mentioned with autofocus and this is a
Galaxy Tab in white it's going to be
coming in a bit of different colors when
it comes to the US then Church this
thing off to the side
I just have a nice feel to it the
battery is already in there I believe it
is a four thousand milliamp hour battery
which should last a quite a bit of time
here at least that's the theory anyway
guys I am a John R Ettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and again we will do full
unboxings and full full more cover to
this guy sort of as the device moves
towards us pre-release will have all the
US versions and again we'll be doing a
more in-depth look at this guy and start
showing you what the operating system
looks like in a tablet form so I'm John
Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo and I
will see you in the next video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
