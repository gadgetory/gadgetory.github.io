and even in the bathroom with wearable
popularity in all-time high smartwatches
are very quickly becoming an important
part of our daily routine constantly
feeding us notifications and reminding
us that we're late for meetings what's
going on guys is a m√§rklin segun from
TechnoBuffalo and now that Android wear
is available in the market Google is
promising us a very exciting wearable
future with google now integration and
the ability to control everything with
only your voice sending messages and
setting reminders has never been so
convenient and with the proper app
support you'll be able to do even more
down the road right from your wrist but
these devices still need to overcome one
major hurdle the Sun when outdoors
devices like the G watch and gear live
are pretty much useless because they're
nearly impossible to see under bright
light and that's not a criticism to
Android wear but if the early hardware
we've seen so far I've been using the g
watch for about two weeks now and I've
noticed that trying to read
notifications or even the time while
outside is very hard to do John notice
the same thing using a year live that
essentially strips away all the utility
making these devices nothing more than a
boring inexpensive fashion accessory the
G watch uses an IPS display with a very
reflective glass and even a max
brightness you can barely see anything
over the fourth of July holiday I
remember sitting by the beach and
getting a notification instead of
reaching for my phone I looked at my
wrist but it was really really hard to
see what it said I just ended up using
my phone instead the LG G watch and
Samsung gear lie both have a beautiful
one point six or so inch screens a G
watch has an IPS LCD touchscreen display
with a resolution to 280 x 2 80 while
the gear live comes equipped with a
Super AMOLED touchscreen display with a
resolution of 320 x 320 they both look
pretty great on your wrist under the
right conditions but not being able to
see the screen in broad daylight can be
a huge deal to some you can't mention
smartwatches without mentioning pebble a
device like the pebble steel uses an
e-paper LCD display so it's visible in
all lighting conditions you may not get
a beautiful color display like the G
watch or gear live but nonetheless the
pebble screen has its benefits it does
what it's supposed to do tells you the
time feeds your notifications it reminds
you of upcoming events even in the
middle of the day you can read your
notifications just fine Android wear
device to show a lot of potential but
they'll need to overcome these hardware
issues before they have a chance of
finding a home on an average consumers
wrist you can see
finding new restaurants at the office or
when you're home at night but for
someone who spends time outdoors these
early Android wear devices probably
aren't for you we're hopeful for
something like the Moto 360 will do
better but we're not holding our breath
we're still testing these two out before
a final review but we thought we'd share
some of our thoughts at a hardware so
what do you guys think of the early
Android wear devices do these issues
prevent you from buying one let us know
in the comments down below I'm marklin
saying it from TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see you guys in the next video thank you
guys for watching please subscribe right
here to be the first one to know
whenever new videos get uploaded we got
a ton of stuff we do phones tablets cars
anything has to do a consumer
electronics that's be plugged in or uses
batteries we review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
