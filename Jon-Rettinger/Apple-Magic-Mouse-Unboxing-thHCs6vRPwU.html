unboxing for you of the new multi touch
magic mouse from Apple this release
coincided with the updated imac that
came out a little while ago if you're
planning on purchasing a new iMac no
need to buy a magic mouse because it's
going to come with it so this replaces
the old mighty mouse which is now just
being called the apple mouse due to
copyright reasons you can still get the
wired version of this which is going to
run you 49 bucks so but enough of the
old let's check out the new you've got
the device sort of sealed in this hard
plastic shell a typical apple minimalist
packaging just device is presented
nicely it's going to run you 69 bucks if
you want to buy it on the back it sort
of tells you some of the multi-touch
features escapable of so obviously your
left click your right click you can
scroll all around you can do screen zoom
by hitting control and zooming in and
you can do to finger swipes and maybe
you're familiar with in Safari if you
have one of the glass multi-touch
trackpad laptops think of this is sort
of bringing the functionality of glass
trackpad to your mouth the exception of
a pinch and zoom this does not do that
let's go ahead and open it up and stay
tuned to the channel for demonstrations
really of how this works and a full
review as well let's see how this opens
up looks like there's some tape on top
go ahead and pull it off these packages
look a little harder to open than I
expected them to be but not too bad pull
that back and focus there yeah
alright so we got the tape off the top
think there's a piece on the back as
well but maybe we don't need to pull
that off there we go slides right out
and there is the magic mouse if you
haven't gone to the apple store and play
with one of the it's got a very nice
feel to it a little bit low profile so
I'm not so sure how organ ama kits going
to be but I guess time will tell if
there's another piece of tape in the
back take it off of this shell it's
mounted on and of course this is a
bluetooth documentation on the mouse and
some little bit more information about
it a lot much of this has batteries in
it let's check it out and see if it does
it does comes with two energizer
double-a batteries so that was nice a to
put it in the device instead of having
to have you put them in it yourself
makes a little bit easier for some
people I suppose go ahead and put the
back on this and let's take a look at
the magic mouse itself so the back as
you can probably tell is all aluminum
with to sort of plastic bumpers is your
on/off switch that you're familiar with
on the old mice slide that up it doesn't
appear that there any buttons but this
whole part actually clicks you can see
and hear that you're navigating you are
actually clicking something so you're
left click you're right click you can
scroll down on a web page or a word
document or ever you're looking at with
one finger or two and like I said you
can zoom in if you'd like on you can pan
from one page to the next by going to
finger swiping unfortunately gone our
side buttons for launching expose or
ever else you like to set it to i use
expose all the time so I'm a little bit
annoyed that that's gone but I'm going
to give it a shot what you can do if
you're used to expose is you can set a
hot corner on your monitor so you flick
your mouse up to the upper right corner
or bottom left and it can activate
whatever you like also gone is this
little trackball a lot of people didn't
like me included get dirty and really
becomes almost unusable however that
trackball is also a third button that
you could push and that's also gone so
you're losing sort of two
functionalities that you had with the
outgoing Mighty Mouse although apple
claims you can rectify that again just
by setting hot corners so guys stay
tuned to the channel for more mighty
mouse or magic mouse coverage for
