and one of hours of techno Buffalo is to
give back more we're really fortunate
here they have the opportunity to play
with the ton of tech and share it with
you part of our responsibility I feel is
to give back to the community so HB
reached out to us as we wanted to do a
video featuring their new page wide
series of printers we said yes
absolutely but instead of just doing a
linear video on a printer and uploading
it to YouTube we said wanted to take a
hundred percent of the money that HP was
going to sponsor us with and give
everyone on the staff an opportunity
sponsor charity of their choice so we
ended up with 10 different charities in
each one got a donation of one thousand
dollars so Before we jump into the
charities and run through everything
that we did I definitely want to make
sure I take a moment to thank the
product that made this entire giving
possible and that's of course the HP
page wide print NHP was really on board
with this idea from day one so it's kind
of cool to see the page wide printer
which we legitimately liked and why we
agree to the video in the first place is
need for a few reasons first it is forty
percent lower cost to print color crazy
fast speeds you can print up to 75 pages
per minute it's got incredible security
environmentally friendly as well it uses
way less energy than most printers on
the market us for example we've got the
page wide pro mfp here that are printing
out a ton of things in color in our
footer printed before sales deck
sponsorship rolls things that help us
with retention that color just make
things look better the network
connectivity of the HP page wide printer
has made it super easy now for the
entire office to connect we started
printing out labels and we've now
printed out a full editorial calendar
for us to actually physically see and I
may or may not have come in after hours
and printed out invitations to my son's
holiday party at school because the
color looks really good and it's not
very expensive so I don't learn more
about HP of their page wide proceeds of
printers and you definitely should
there's a ton of them they all do really
awesome things fast or quiet RS has NFC
built-in network enabled hit the link
down below to learn more the cherry that
I think is one that's really near and
dear to my family and that's the
prostate cancer foundation odds are
cancerous at your family in some way
shape or form for me something that my
dad has had to deal with and fortunately
has made a full recovery from and the
cancer is gone but scary to actually
want to support at perhaps I looked
maybe have prostate cancer in the future
I want to make sure that it is well
funded so they were the first one that
got a donation another charity we all
agreed on with the Second Harvest Food
Bank so we went over to costco picked up
about four hundred and fifty dollars of
food loaded into two trucks it's to our
local second harvest but on top of that
we also gave a five hundred fifty dollar
donation to help feed people in need so
wanna learn more about any of the
cherries we're going to talk about we're
going to link to them down below next up
and whoever's pick the Challenged
Athletes foundation you might know
andrew he's done some on-camera work for
us recently but he's been behind the
camera from list of a tenure here at
exxon buffalo about two years editing
videos the Challenged Athletes
foundation is one that was new to me i
didn't know what it did but its goals to
provide physically challenged people the
tools they need to pursue active a
healthy lifestyles they advocate for all
levels of physical activity a way to
enhance quality of life for all next up
Ron parita wanted to sponsor charity
water and he picked out for a few
reasons first you like that they were
fully transparent where the money is
going and they gave a ton of different
ways to donate you just have to make a
one-time donation you could give up your
birthday and let people giving you gifts
they could donate to charity water and
they tell you exactly what your money in
a donation is doing you want a sponsor
well if you want to do a one-time
donation a monthly donation they also do
a really nice job telling the story to
be a documentary next up our editor Roy
Choi wants to support the Alzheimer's
Association and their mission is very
simple to fund and find a cure for
Alzheimer's next up brandon russell
jinxed are you read some of his writing
on TechnoBuffalo calm want their support
the american foundation for suicide
prevention and their mission is to save
lives and bring hope those affected by
suicide next up Todd hazel opinion if
you've read the any article on
TechnoBuffalo calm chances are one of
them has been by Todd he wants to
support the brain &amp;amp; Behavior Research
Foundation and their mission is
committed to alleviating suffering
caused by mental illness by ordering
grants that will lead to advances and
breakage in scientific research that
includes mental illnesses like ADHD
anxiety autism bipolar disorder
depression OCD PTSD schizophrenia and a
myriad of other illnesses next joey

centon TechnoBuffalo majority of its
written by him want to support the
Leukemia and Lymphoma Society next niven

watch on the YouTube channel 1 support a
local charity when that he's worked with
directly and that's breakthrough san
juan capistrano and their mission is
increased academic opportunity for
highly motivated undeserved students and
put them on a trajectory success and a
college path they also aim to inspire
developed next generation of teachers
educational leaders this is a cause that
he worked with in high school and that's
very local to where he lives and last
but definitely not least is sean ani who
runs all of our ad offs and leads our
development team you want to support an
animal charity one that we supported in
the past we have a local animal shelter
right across from our office the irvine
Animal Care Center so we went across the
street and sponsored two more kennels
for a year this is really incredible
shelter it's a no-kill shelters animals
have an indoor and outdoor area the
indoor achieved in the winter the
animals stay in their channels until
they are adopted and by sponsoring q
kennels we sponsored every animal that
goes into that including their food
their bedding and medical care the goal
this video and this one's giving us a
platform and talk about the HP page wide
printer wasn't to show look what we did
and to make you clap for for how good
people we are hopefully to inspire you
to give back to a chariot or cause of
your choice and doesn't have to be money
all the charities that we've listed
again linked down below would love your
time an hour two hours a weekend giving
back are a great way to help make the
world a little bit or better place
