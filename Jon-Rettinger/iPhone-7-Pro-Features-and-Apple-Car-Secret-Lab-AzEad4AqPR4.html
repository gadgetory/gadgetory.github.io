it's good weather for sitting and
talking to a camera having a picnic and
sharing some Apple rumors let's start
with the next phone that you either love
or hate and might be in your pocket come
September at the iPhone 7 but sort of
begins at the very sad face Qualcomm CEO
Steve Malcolm who told analysts it looks
like we're going to be losing a giant
customer and that big customer is Apple
it looks like Intel will be making the
LTE chip for the upcoming iPhone 7
that doesn't mean you're gonna get like
a core i7 in your phone essentially what
that's gonna mean is faster LTE sneeze
for you now Apple already up the LTE
speeds with the iPhone 6 and 6s LTE a
but you're going to get even faster
speeds with Intel 73 60 LTE modem which
I had to learn what that means
theoretical speeds on this 73 60 are
about 450 down and 100 up and also
because I know you care supports for
bands ten and twenty nine they're
finally gonna get some that below from
LTE to what the Frick is a phone gonna
look like the folks at math Oh guitar
are substantiating pictures that we saw
from catcher which essentially showed
the back of the iPhone 7 everybody
assumed including us that these were
just super fake pictures showing the
back of the phone with dual cameras at a
smart canker down below but it turns out
at least you believe Mac avatar he's got
a spotty record they have been spot on
with some things that's actually what
the phone is going to look like we
talked a lot about the dual camera it
should give you way sharper images and a
lot of ways to focus after the fact but
the big story is I think is a smart
connector now certainly you can lend
itself to iPad pro to accessories like a
smart keyboard for example but I'm
hoping it's got something to do with
wireless charging up and hoping for a
while maybe next let's jump to the Apple
car Apple has allegedly been trolling
Germany looking for a dance partner it's
like that goofy kid in middle school ask
everybody dance everybody's turning it
down
according to a Hasselblad Apple has been
courting gambler in BMW just inviting
them over to come help them manufacture
the car because Apple has no idea how to
make a car the rumor mill suggested
Apple wants to use BMW i3 as the basis
for their Apple car BMW was like nope
Steve Paikin
I got a date talks between both German
Giants allegedly fell apart
discussions over who will lead the
project who would own the data and who
would just be in charge of the whole
thing Apple certainly wants that own it
and BMWs Ambler were like we want we
want that for me
Apple also allegedly wants to integrate
the software the car very heavily with
their cloud software and BMW and Ambler
wanted to keep consumers information
private so they were just just just
butting heads so here's where the story
takes a little bit of a Bond villain
sounding turn Apple allegedly as
engineers working in secret in Berlin
they really want to use the Germans
expertise they're hoping they can come
up with a partnership so if the next
part I apologize to our german-speaking
friends according to frankfurter
Allegheny zu tog also known as faz
apples clandestine facility employs
between fifteen and twenty top-class men
and women from the German automotive
industry with backgrounds in engineering
software hardware and sales the workers
are described as progressive thinkers
not sure what that means but supposedly
they're progressive thinking butted up
against the more conservative thinking
traditional German manufacturers so no
one knows what this is gonna be maybe
you'll see an alpha car in like six
years maybe we won't
maybe BMW will make it into the slap and
Apple logo on it this point who the heck
knows but it's fun to speculate and talk
about one thing you can't expect to
feature heavily in this carpet does come
to the market is autonomous crisis one
thing it's been consistent
this talk of apple's project tightening
since the inception about three years
ago and rumor started circulating out
what do you guys think Apple rumors
iPhone Apple car you excited not excited
one of your thoughts on it
video a thumbs up because appreciate it
until next time I'm John rende you're
for TechnoBuffalo that's the guy's next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
