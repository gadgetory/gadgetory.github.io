technobuffalo here with a full review
for you up super phone gracing Sprint's
lineup this is the motorola photon 4G
let's go ahead dig in and see if this
photon is set to stun but I'm bunch
alright so let's take a look at the Box
sort of a newer design very rectangular
all kinds of globe business here letting
you know this is indeed a global phone
there should be a sim card hidden
somewhere inside of here so there's a
box tech specs all that kind of business
get the phone number covered up right
there sprint was counting up to send us
over as a test review unit we'll go
ahead and make it to do with little
striptease for us make a little more
romantic than that what's under here
what's under here have you been good oh
you've been good so there's a motorola
boot on 4g in its yellow sprint box
we'll go ahead open it up and boom there
is the motorola photon 4g got a little
tab will pull this up push it off the
side for just a quick second will run
through what else is in the box and then
we'll get to all the good stuff so we
have micro USB charging and sync cable
wall cord and a sprint book to give you
all your information about the phone
stuff you'd expect there's impaired to
be any headphones in there though
alright so that is off to the side let's
take a look here at the reason you are
all watching this video it looks like
they're already our fingerprints around
the display so either the PR folks had
this first or someone else checked it up
before I did this I'm glad actually try
and turn it on while I'm talking here if
you can have something to look at see if
the batter has any juice all right so
there you go so it's got to do a core
talk about that in just a second it's
got a 4.3 inch screen that's pretty
becoming pretty standard right now with
a resolution of 480 x I'm sorry 540 x
960 it's got a 1700 milliamp hour
battery which is going to hopefully
power this thing for quite a bit of time
android 2.3 and videos dual core tegra
two so that's dual-core 1 gigahertz on
each core on the back of this guy this
is not a 3d phone it is an 8 megapixel
sensor on the back with a dual LED flash
sort of covered up in blue plastic and
now you guys love when things are
covered up here in plastics so if I can
get that off none of any nails I might
have a hard time a bit get it boom got
it that'll be able to shoot a video at
720p but that's not the only camera here
living on the guy there's also one on
the front which is V
ga on so that's point 3 megapixels for
all your video chatting needs a little
bit of a heavier phone weighs just about
5.5 7 ounces or 158 grams that's how you
do your measurement looks like we've got
a new version of motorola's don't call
it motoblur sure what they're calling it
now but it's the less obtrusive actually
nice to use a version of not motoblur
here of course is a 4g phone to get some
wimax beads let's go ahead and do a tour
of it am i getting 4g here i'm only
getting 3g where i am so sad alright so
on the left-hand side you've got your
micro USB charging port an HDMI out I
love that these aren't covered i hate
when you gotta pull off laps to get to
them so there's where you're charging
port you're going to live an hdmi out so
you can kick this stuff off to your
television 3.5 millimeter headset jack
power and lock button in my favorite
place the upper right hand corner you've
got a really nice sort of here we can
hear that got a bit of a textured volume
rocker you can really easily feel that
with your thumb I like the location
there and you've got a physical camera
button on the back we got the sort of
soft touch plastic and you also have a
kickstand so you can kick it with this
as well as a speaker grill but there's
supposedly some mystery fun things here
living on the back of this guy this is a
world phone so it's got that cool sort
of gingerbread turn off screen thing
let's do that you powers on like an old
TV all right let's see if I can pull off
the back cover on this thing i'm
notoriously bad not as bad as Noah but
not the best when it comes to moving
back covers but there should be a sim
card living in here so if you were you a
lot of traveling or you want to take
your phone abroad be able to get some 3G
speeds on I want just quite nice I
believe this actually has support for
the 850 band so possibly you keep it
unlock it and use it regionally but
there are way better choices for them
all right I want to break this this is a
tough one all right there we go almost
there boom and here is where the sim
card lives and looks like it's just a
non-branded just a sprint sim card so
when you're traveling you can go ahead
and get your traveling data phone calls
on I have to worry about getting a new
phone so it was a very long pulling off
the back cover show you that
sim card but it does have a sim card so
for all your photon 4g information be
sure to stay tuned technobuffalo i'll be
showing you all the rest of the goodness
the phone has and running through its
usual places we've got the for motorola
capacitive buttons on the bottom and got
the menu button home button back button
it search and you've got everything to
expect from android 2.3 gingerbread as
well as Motorola's what they're calling
it now not motoblur custom UI here so
you guys anything you want to see go
ahead and leave your comments down below
and i will read them and i will try and
respond to them and more importantly i
will try and answer them an upcoming
boat on video let me go ahead and do a
real quick size comparison here with
some other 4.3 inch devices here is the
LG Thrill go ahead and see what that guy
looks like see how big the thrill is
actually next to the photon and here is
the hd7 s we've got a smart phone tasty
sandwich here to go ahead and do a
little stack or ooh and you can see the
size and thickness of all these guys so
there you go it's a photon in the middle
sort of a weird thing to say but i
really like the volume rocker here on
this feels nice the phone has definitely
a high quality bill to it close to the
sides at least from being a edge-to-edge
display it really has a nice feel in the
hand so if you're on sprint or looking
to possibly change over to sprint us is
definitely one of the phones that's
worth while checking out and show me the
top of their lineup with the evo 3d so
go check it out hopefully you will like
it I'll tell if I like it in the coming
days and week anyway guys jon rettinger
technobuffalo see in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
