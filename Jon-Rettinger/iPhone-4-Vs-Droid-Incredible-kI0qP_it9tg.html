TechnoBuffalo here I want to give you a
hectic comparison of two of the probably
three or four hottest smart phones out
right now on the left hand side we've
got the new contender Apple's iPhone 4
and on the right we have what is one of
the defending champs Verizon's droid
incredible these are both very feature
packed high powered smartphones and then
for professional users or power users
let's go ahead and get this comparison
started we are going to cover display
aesthetics power and battery storage
camera general features speed browser
keyboard UI and navigation obviously we
can make this list go on and off those
are sort of the ones that I thought were
most important and we're going to
declare a winner at the end of this if
you missed my video comparing the iPhone
4 versus the HTC EVO 4G they'll be a
link to that in the sidebar as well in
case you're trying to side which phone
is right for you so let's go ahead and
get started and let's talk about the
display the iPhone 4 is really being
pushed and marketed as having the
highest resolution than best display at
any smartphone I can tell you that there
really is quite true it's got a 3.5 inch
screen at the resolution which is really
unmatched by any other smartphone of 960
by 480 that essentially quadruples the
UH the resolution of the previous phone
actually the pixel density of the
previous phone now is that six hundred
and fourteen thousand four hundred the
incredible has a little bit bigger
screens 3.7 inches but a much lower
resolution at 3 sorry at 800 by 480 so
are the huge difference there in the
screens and you look at the two phones
and use the two phones are you really
can't see the difference so the edge
here clearly has to go to the iPhone for
the display now let's talk about
aesthetics because this is really gonna
come down to what you'd like most thorny
want to feel happy pulling out of the
club or taking out of the business
meeting they both have some sort of
unique looks to it so the iPhone will
turn off that display I serve a very
classic iPhone look is very easily
identifiable you know it's an iPhone
part the iPhone 4 it does look a bit
different its markedly
thinner than the outgoing generation
it's got this very shiny glass looking
back the camera now with the LED on the
side you've got sort of these slashes on
the side for the
antennas that are now broken and you've
got a micro SIM card slot on the side
there's the other antenna slot and it's
not necessarily broken that's where the
scenes stop you've got now bigger volume
up and down and your profile switcher
and on top you sort of got that classic
Apple look the incredible is a bit of a
different looking phone it's got sort of
your classic smartphone look with the
screen and navigation options however
the back is a bit different
HTC so this race car inspired and take
off the Batcave it's all red underneath
you've got a big camera lens and do LED
flash on the front you've got haptic
buttons and actually an optical trackpad
so the way the phones look is really
going to be a personal preference for
you personally I like the way the iPhone
looks but I have an iPhone user but I
can certainly see what people would
prefer the way they joined incredible
looks so this one has got to be a tie
it's going to be a personal preference
so next let's talk about power and
battery
well the iPhone 4 uses Apple
system-on-chip a4 processor the same one
that's found in the iPad the clock speed
hasn't really been reported yet but it's
estimated to be clocked down from the
one gigahertz that we've seen in the
iPad a battery life forgetting about
seven hours of talktime on 3G and 14
hours on edge the incredible has a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor which is
becoming quite ubiquitous now
smartphones and it's extremely capable
processor that really runs very fast
battery life though is a different story
312 minutes of usage and 146 hours of
standby so processor processor it would
be very competitive the a4 and the
Snapdragon really go at each other very
nicely the battery life the iPhone far
outshine the Joe incredible so this
round since we're combining it is going
to go to Apple next we're going to go to
storage this is what these get a bit
interesting Apple storage is all
internal on a flash card in there or a
flash drive rather either 16 and 32 gig
configurations the incredible
uses micro SD which will be more
expensive to buy if you want to get a 32
gig size which is the largest currently
supported however their advantages to
both if you're going to use a lot of
apps and not going to remove your
storage think that the iPhone is going
to be a better option for you
fear photographer need to constantly
changing cards and showing different
things
different people you're going to want
there moveable storage we're probably
going to want to pay the extra bit of
money for more car than that our
capacity so you may prefer the
incredible in that front
for me I'm served in the middle so this
one is going to be to be as high between
the tubes that's going to be a personal
preference as well so next let's talk
about camera there are a lot to talk
throughout there's a lot to discuss the
iPhone has a five megapixel camera with
an LED flash I'll flip that over so you
can see it the incredible on the other
hand has an 8 megapixel camera with dual
LED flash you can see those two right
there the iPhone can record video at
720p at 30 frames per second the Droid
Incredible can record video of a not
high definition the Apple iPhone
actually bring something else to the
table it's got a front-facing 0.3 or VGA
resolution camera for video calls which
we'll talk about we get to the features
video capture on the iPhone looks
fantastic its crisp it's sharp and
picture quality between the two phones
or exo-m's indistinguishable so we're
doing the 5 in the 8th so the camera
edge most definitely needs to go to the
iPhone just for having the front-facing
camera and the HD video really give it
the the edge of my book alright so next
let's talk about features of both bring
a very unique set of features to the
table here the incredible running
Android also brings HTC Sense UI which
has a lot of cool things we've got sort
of snap feature you can pick what
homescreen you want to jump to it's very
quick and very responsive as you can see
here it also uses Google Maps Navigation
is a free turn-by-turn navigation option
we've served a great add-on for Android
1.6 from newer devices and it works very
well the features of the iPhone 4 brings
you're going to get face time which is
your video calling when over Wi-Fi which
works really really really well we got
the Retina display the high resolution
screen and you also now have Wi-Fi and
so 802 11 and for faster data transfers
already effective to an end capable
network serve those core features I give
the iPhone a bit of an edge over the
incredibles we're going to give this
round to the incredible so next let's
talk about speed these are both
screaming fast let me show you what
applications are currently open and
running on each we've got settings and
browser and on incredible same thing
browser and settings so we serve at the
same standpoint here so let's talk about
browser speed both are connected to the
same Wi-Fi network and I want to show
you how fast their load web pages we're
gonna do this test as they always do for
pages that you visit on a regular basis
so these pages have been loaded on each
phone we're gonna try TechnoBuffalo com
I'm gonna try my youtube channel at
youtube.com slash John four leggers
let's go ahead and get this party rockin
go ahead open this up we've got the
YouTube channel already loaded here
we've got the YouTube channel already
loaded to here so we're gonna do a
simple refresh on each then what's hot
browser the browser features as we go
I'm gonna go ahead and hit that's that
and we gonna go at the same time or like
go at the same time alright
and we're often these are both again
connected over the same Wi-Fi network
and we did this test with the HTC EVO we
saw the Evo was much faster than the
iPhone 4 and loading with building web
pages now let's say forget the same
results here the incredible was
noticeably quicker when loading web
pages and you'll also notice that it's
actually trying to display Flash content
you'll see flash ads like open upper
right-hand corner because the incredible
can handle flash capable browsing which
is a really nice sort of addition to the
to the phone itself it's something that
works terribly well it's sort of choppy
and it's certainly a bit of a battery
drain but there may be times when you
need it and it's nice to have both our
multi-touch capable the multi-touch on
the iPhone 4 is buttery smooth scrolling
is very smooth it's a little bit jerky
on the incredible but it worked very
well you can tap to zoom on both let's
try another webpage maybe this is just
sort of an anomaly and not going to be
regular cards let's jump over to
TechnoBuffalo calm i'll do the same
thing here on be incredible both are
queued up let's go ahead and refresh
both pages and we'll see if the tests
are accurate and then we'll try loading
a webpage with Wi-Fi turned off and
maybe network-to-network the iPhone is
going to be fast or maybe horizons is
still going to be quicker
let's go ahead and check this out this
uses everything that the browser the
processor Ram
sort of puts everything together into
one test and again over the same Wi-Fi
network and it looks like we're getting
the same results the incredible is
loading a bit quicker
okay iPhone is catching up so might be a
dogfight they're almost exactly the same
place
iPhones got lead may be incredible is
catching up now incredible finish first
and the iPhone 4 finished in just a few
seconds later so there you go be
incredible as faster loading both
webpages now let's try this
turning off Wi-Fi and see if
network-to-network Alice is going to
work
I've got about five bars of 18 t 3g and
it's again a very obviously by where you
are in location and I have about one to
two bars of e video so this may not be
the most fair test but I do want to show
you the network speed as well if 18 if
Verizon's blows faster over one bar then
you'll certainly know that there's a
reason for it alright so look what
settings go and turn off Wi-Fi I'm gonna
do this on cameras you can see there's
nothing fishy going on and we'll jump
into settings here we'll go to wireless
networks I will turn off Wi-Fi alright
so now we are using network to network I
now have two bars of 3G and five bars of
3G here on the iPhone sort of in full
disclosure look then open up each open
up each and we're gonna refresh the page
again green arrow there and the Go
button there and they are both off and
let's see which is quicker network to
network and it still looks like well
looks like the Verizon's is a little bit
quicker here so far and again this is
gonna vary depending on where you are
location-wise so if Verizon is done
loading actually loaded very quickly and
18t finish up just a second later and
this was with Verizon having have fewer
bars so it's sort of interesting to note
alright let's go ahead and move on to
applications begin see if things load
quicker or slower on both we'll go ahead
and jump home let's go ahead and pick
sort of similar applications let's how
about we tried camera as always a good
to see and I know this is a very
unscientific test different operating
systems open applications differently
but let's just see the speed just for
fun it's either taking sitter difference
I missed it right there didn't get at
the same time let's try that one more
time and of course they open in the
background there we go
so that the iPhone 4 opened in just a
little bit quicker by not much let's try
a different application let's try
opening let's see what we got
find something that is of similar let's
try all right we'll try opening up 7
since what's been opened up on each
looking everybody has to open so about
the same so I've noticed reopen
applications is speed they're both
screaming fast the web browsing the risk
of the difference over Wi-Fi and over
the networks with the two devices so
speed was definitely has to go to be
incredible so something to to keep in
mind the browser we started talked about
you start us on inaction saw how it
worked
whether you like flash or don't like fog
it's going to be sort of a personal
preference but both browsers are very
capable and can handle serve the content
very nicely so for me I prefer sure the
smoothness of the browser on the iPhone
I can live without flash but I recognize
others are they going to want the flash
and may be able to give ups or that
smoothness to have that capability so
browser almost definitely has to be a
tie as well so let's go ahead and jump
into keyboard now I do want to give
certain full disclosure I am an iPhone
user so I'm more used to the iPhone
keyboard but I have gone on the record
as saying I really do like the way
Android implemented text input well
let's go ahead and see how this works
that will jump into messages I'll get a
new message and one feature about
Android or new verb builds with Android
that I really like is that
text-to-speech and it works really
really well you tap it and say what you
want and the text shows up and it's
almost all the time a very accurate so
let's do a quick test here and I also
like the autocorrect on the keywords my
Android does a very nice job so I'm
gonna type something in
let me go and back up actually I want to
type in a compose feel about recipient
that's right
I'm trying to type winnie-the-pooh
sounds gross meaning the puh sound gross
so isn't that far off taptic feedbacking
type but you also could have a landscape
keyboard and again the full disclosure I
am NOT as used to this keyboard that
will be to the iPhones let me try this
one more time
Meeny the poo is gross it's a little bit
better there but not that far off and
let's try now to keyboard following the
iPhone and see how this one functions
I'll go ahead and open up notes and I
will open up a new note here as well and
we'll see how this works so we got two
keyboard options the same way I'll try
this again
so mini the puds fund the gross not so
accurate there either and try it in this
one
so a little bit better there
winnie-the-pooh sounds gross a little
bit more accurate now I'm trying to
fight my desire to give the edge here to
the iPhone that's just because I'm used
to it I think the key word it's almost
easier to use on the iPhone but the
text-to-speech on Android is a huge
advantage so keyboard to keyboard input
here I'm going to give that a time
because again that's going to be a
personal preference I'm trying to be as
impartial as possible so let's talk
about UI as well cuz there's a lot to
sort of discuss from UI and how you
navigate up through the phone's so the
iPhone is really this thing is how
you're gonna use to navigate very few
buttons other than the home button all
your navigation is sort of done with
your finger but it's pinching and
zooming or moving around or making
folders by dragging icons it's all done
with your finger really there aren't
many menu buttons navigation however on
the joy incredible is much the same way
but a bit different you can see you've
got four menu buttons across the bottom
you also have an optical trackpad which
sort of works almost like a little bit
of mouse you can scroll it push through
and you can push it in to select if
you'd like I'll bring systems operating
system very different sort of methods
Apple does a fantastic job with the
closed environment if you like sort of
living within Apple's walled garden and
you don't mind having serve those
restrictions you know the phone's gonna
work very well is think of everything
added that you need it to and it's going
to be a very smooth and seamless
experience Andrea is a bit more open you
can certainly live within the Google
Apps atmosphere and serving just use
Gmail and after the marketplace but the
outbreak system itself is much more open
and can be customized a bit more but so
can you come down to the user what sort
of preference you are going to prefer
both now handle multitasking I just
heard the big difference between the two
later date so this one here is also
going to be a tot so I'm gonna go ahead
and tally this up now a display went to
Apple aesthetics with the time Apple got
power and battery get tied for storage
Apple about the camera
Apple about the features incredible
about speed and we had a tie for browser
keyboard and UI so that gives us one two
three four five rounds that were tied
Apple got one two three four rounds and
Apple won an incredible one one round so
means our winner of the iPhone 4 versus
the Droid Incredible is the iPhone that
does not by any stretch the imagination
me being credible is a bad choice as a
fantastic phone with a lot of options
but if you're stuck looking at which
once guess I think that the iPhone is
probably going to be the best choice for
you again but of any other features I
mentioned sort of are more value to you
like you want the open environment then
you know the joint incredible it's going
to be a really solid choice anyway guys
