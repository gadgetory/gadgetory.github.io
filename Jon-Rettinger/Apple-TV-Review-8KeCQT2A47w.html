TechnoBuffalo here at the full review
for you of the mid 2010 Apple TV the
first real update that we've ever seen
to the Apple TV let's go ahead and jump
in and get started alright so before we
talk about the Apple TV talk about the
hardware and the specs and go over the
UI let's talk about how the Apple TV is
controlled your main portal into the
device you will be using this remote
it's the probably now familiar new
aluminum remote which apple gives an
option to buy with all of their desktop
and laptop computers it's replacing this
old plastic guy and certainly from an
aesthetic standpoint the aluminum looks
a lot prettier more Apple like and such
but it is not very user-friendly I've
gotten the remote to be extremely
frustrating when using the Apple TV it
start to feel where these raised buttons
aren't I keep hitting the middle when I
try and hit the button so keep in mind
you may have some frustration and
learning curve when you try and use this
new aluminum remote but enough about the
remote let's go ahead and talk about the
Apple TV itself the UI is very familiar
to what we saw on the last generation
Apple TV but it now comes at a much more
affordable mainstream price of $99 I
would puts the Apple TV at more of an
impulse buy category something you've
got to think about so if you're like me
and you have a lot of components except
your television you're probably weren't
excited about the opportunity to hook
something else up the Apple TV now does
a lot more than what he used to do it's
still thought of as let's say an iPod
for your television a way to get all of
your content right on to your television
no longer do we have physical storage
here everything on the Apple TV is
streaming so you have to have internet
connection it does have anything that
port in the back and of course is 802 11
and Wi-Fi built in so let's go ahead and
talk about movies movies are one of the
great things Apple TV does I have the
ability to buy them anymore but you can
go ahead and rent them and most movies
are availa
the same day as their DVD counterparts
so here we've got Iron Man 2 just came
out for example Nightmare on Elm Street
which I'm probably gonna give a nice
rent to tonight and it's very easy to go
ahead and pick one to go ahead and
select the movie maybe I'd like it to
preview it and watch the trailer rent it
in full HD which through the streams
video in 720p it's capable of 1080p
playback but it's not supported so your
videos are going to be in 720p I am
going to add it to a wishlist and be
jumping over to more attractive took me
a couple days to learn you can view
reviews here from Rotten Tomatoes or
customer reviews which is kind of neat
and this worked just as the old Apple TV
didn't the movies play very quickly
depending on internet connection
obviously I've got a relatively fast
internet connection the HD movie is
ready to be played within about a minute
and a half of hitting the rent sometimes
a little bit sooner depending on the
movie but certainly not bad and it's
ready to go and there isn't any
buffering time as a movies playing you
can sort of start playing from there and
not have to worry about stopping this
one did not get a highway and Rotten
Tomatoes look at that 13% for Nightmare
on Elm Street and the same thing is true
with TV shows there aren't that many
networks supported here you can go ahead
and view networks it smoothly the Fox
and ABC networks here but there are a
few shows and again everything here is
just to be rented it's gonna cost about
99 cents if we jump on back to movies
for a moment you can serve sort movies
by top movies genres search or even view
some trailers for what's in theaters
Apple's real big into movie trailers
between Apple comm slash trailers
they've got a ton of stuff over there so
it's kind of a news next way to keep up
with what's in movies or what you're
going to want to watch on your Apple TV
whenever it comes out so this is all
pretty standard we've seen on the old
Apple TV what's in the new let's go
ahead on jump on over to Internet well
radio is here so you can now listen to
your favorite adult contemporary music
while you're doing whatever you're doing
there's a decent amount of radio choices
here so the first one is of course it's
all contemporary and go ahead and play
it and they'll give you the album
information song information and just
start playing a few other options
Internet and sort of interesting as well
Flickr integrated your Flickr account
MobileMe and in great reader MobileMe
account pulling your both movie pictures
podcasts aren't out here as well which
is a really nice feature and a lot of
people were looking forward to go ahead
you can search by top podcasts genres
providers or search if it's on iTunes
it's going to be on your Apple TV as it
could way to tell if it's gonna be there
YouTube we saw on the old Apple TV it's
here it's as well you can search and
view your videos you can log in and even
check out your subscriptions and most
notably the biggest edition now is
Netflix Netflix is here and it looks
very similar to what we've seen on
really on any Netflix advise but now
that the UI let's integrate it right
into Apple TV looks very familiar you're
gonna have sort of that read Netflix bar
that you get when you're looking at the
content on your Playstation 3 360 or we
it just really nicely integrated sync go
ahead and see suggestions for you you
can manage it you can pick movies right
from here recently watched instinct you
new arrivals and there's a lot of
content here and it loads pretty quickly
as you can see if you want to get your
family guy on go ahead and do so and
it's great to have Netflix you're on
another device if you don't have game
console you're not a gamer this is a
great way to sort of bring Netflix from
your DVDs right through the air onto
your computer for me alone having
Netflix is one of the biggest reasons to
get an Apple TV for 99 dollars it's just
another great way to view your content
especially if you're paying for if your
Netflix user so we'll go ahead and let
this focus again and we will jump back
at a Netflix now I'll show you what else
is here you can also hook up two
computers of course senses of streaming
device hook it up to another computer
using home care and every sort of
networking you have and you can watch
the content that you downloaded on your
computer right to your Apple TV if
you're an iOS user so if you have an
iPod Touch iPhone or iPad with the
upcoming iOS 4.2 if they actually push
your content right from your mobile
device to right through Apple TV so if
you're on an iPad and download a TV show
and you're halfway
through it you can actually pick it up
and resume it oh wirelessly you're right
on your Apple TV features not here yet
but it will be how settings go ahead and
control a lot of things but all your
computers sort of general stuff this
represents a much better value than the
230 ish previous generation Apple TV a
99 bucks it's a great way to sort of
bring all this content right to your TV
often times people have on-demand
systems but movies aren't available on
all on-demand systems the same day that
are available on DVD and oftentimes the
prices can range from you know $3 to $6
to $8 or $9 this was really sort of a
set Noori these price of you know about
five bucks or so it's a great way to
watch a movie get it for 24 hours the
content is pretty solid and you don't
have to worry about filling up any hard
drive space TV shows no definitely
lacking if you're not a fan of ABC or
Fox there's not gonna be that much fear
for you to watch hopefully other
networks are going to join overall I've
been very happy with the Apple TV it
does pretty much the same thing that I
use the old Apple TV for although now in
a much much much smaller package on
having Netflix is really the big
determining factor for me if you have a
Netflix account I think you owe it to
yourself if you have sort of a $99 that
you can afford to spend to get full
access to all of your content you'll be
surprised at how much you use it all
right guys I hope you enjoyed this
review of the 2010 Apple TV I'm John
rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see you guys in the next video bye-bye
