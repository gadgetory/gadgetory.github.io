Samsung unveiled the very first Galaxy
Note but at the time a ridiculously
large 5.3 inch screen and the world
including myself scoffed at such large
screen phones
turns out Samsung knew better than the
rest of us and here we are with its six
iteration but this is the galaxy note 7
and things of things have evolved quite
a bit from the one Giga RAM for Android
buttons that used to live on the Galaxy
Note so let's take a look at what
Samsung sent us this is their press box
a lot of probably extras in here that
won't come in the shipping box and there
are so we've got the brand new gear VR
right here this is going to be
compatible with older Samsung devices
well it's got an adapter for the USB see
that lives on the note 7 we've got a
gear fit 2 in here as well
for tracking we've got a power cord few
power cords in there for for charging
the gear fit push all that off to the
side we have of course the galaxy note 7
got a 256 gig microSD card it does have
expandable storage and we've got a Qi
fast charging wireless charging dock
let's move all of this stuff off the
side here and let's take a look at the
galaxy note 7 the boxes look very
familiar to the galaxy note 5 go ahead
and open this sucker up and there for
the first time on a note device we've
got Samsung dual edged screen this the
black onyx version I haven't seen this
in person that looks really nice I'll go
ahead and peel the plastic off of this a
couple of things I'm really excited to
test the first thing that gives the iris
scanner this is see how quickly that
works if it indeed does work in dark or
low light situations I want to try fast
charging and see how Samsung does USB
see so iPad this guy on and we'll see
how that 5.7 inch 2560 by 1440 screen is
going to look
I think Samsung has got some
best Super AMOLED panels going so
presumably it's going to look pretty
nice
rounding out the specs least in the u.s.
it's going to be the Snapdragon 820 on
here four gigs of ram is going to be on
board assuming you're not in China where
six gig variants will come out a lot of
questions about the fingerprint sensor
here it's still here you don't have the
iris you can choose to use fingerprints
or not and it is an actual suppressible
button we've seen companies go towards
making it just a sensor but you can
actually click this thing here of course
ip68 is here as well
IP 68 is now also found on the s pen so
you can write underwater antennae you're
going to ask you can't don't you put it
in backwards it's not gonna go in so
those days are gone and keeping this guy
protected is going to be Gorilla Glass 5
so go ahead and set this guy up let's
take a look how everything's going to
perform you're finally up and running
and the phone looks and feels very
similar to the Galaxy s7 edge a little
more weight to it a lot of the spectrum
a device carry over here as well
highlighted by a 12 megapixel sensor on
the back and the five megapixel sensor
on the front but take a look at how well
that iris scanner is going to work based
in normal lights on market professed
recognize my eyes and unlocked when I do
a full review that will test it outdoors
will test it in dark light and all
different scenarios here let's take a
look around Samsung's you I jump into
settings a little bit of a different
look here in settings of the color still
stays the same while the camera might be
the same on this versus the s7 edge the
UI is a little bit different here on the
note you can swipe left different camera
filters will show up a little bit
different I think a little bit of a more
elegant UI on this device let's take a
look at the s-pen when the feature is
here is you can actually start writing
directly on the screen even when it's
off and you can indeed do that you can
set your notes actually be your home
screen to show up on your lock screen as
well and it looks to be really quick
there's almost no lag at all as I'm
writing on the note 7 so first
impressions I note 7 are overwhelmingly
positive the phone feels premium and
look for
the screen not surprisingly looks
beautiful we're going to test a camera
to see how performs but anywhere close
to the exact same sensor again found in
the s7 the s7 edge it should be a pretty
nice setup going on here if you want to
make sure we cover it leave it down
below I'll make sure I check that as I
film the review and if you want to see
more note 7 coverage give the video a
thumbs up to let us know and perhaps a
note 7 giveaway coming up until next
time I'm Jon render can TechnoBuffalo
