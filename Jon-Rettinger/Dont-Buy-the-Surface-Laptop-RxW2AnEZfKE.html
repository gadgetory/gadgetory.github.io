Microsoft Surface line everything they
now instead of the original surface pro
I even saw the value in the surface RT I
use a Microsoft Surface pro floors my
daily computer at home I use the turfers
book as my computer at the office was
better part of five months I love and I
believe in the line but it was a huge
gap little Microsoft was offering and
enter the surface laptop would answer
the question that a lot of people wanted
just make a real laptop Microsoft I
don't want to carry a tablet I don't
want a weird-looking laptop I can take
screen off of I just want a traditional
thin laptop Microsoft delivered on that
with the surface laptop and it's good at
some strange to say this as good a
laptop as this is I don't think you
should buy it first care me out about
the laptop so price counter service
laptop something I want to talk about
quite a bit you can pick one up the
entry-level about $1000 going to get you
four gigs of RAM to get you an i5
processor they will be seventeen and
four gigs ram ours are 300 bucks more at
$1300 got 70 ini 580 driving 256
gigabytes on the SS you can match this
sucker out like 2200 bucks I don't
recommend it thing configuration we have
is kind of a sweet spot it works pretty
well from any computing you want to do
Savior for like video editing and game
design here is very clearly a surface
laptop it's aluminum and oddly Alcantara
on the keyboard I'll consider is usually
reserved for high-end cars the headliner
but it feels really nice here I've got
some concern about how it's going to
wear over time with greasy-ass palms but
it feels really nice there's a beard
scheme on the side listen come lifted
off kind of wish that wasn't there small
issue but I do like how it looks and
makes computer look kind of nice and if
you like the way you computers look you
can pick from one of four colors
microsoft offers they've got a really
nice arrangement of colors we've got the
kind of blowing silver here next up did
a couple cool things if you look at this
laptop they notice you can't see you a
speaker grille anywhere these speakers
are actually underneath the keyboard
you're probably going to think like I
did they're going to sound crazy as
muffled they actually sounds really good
but you considering the sound is kind of
coming directly through that keyboard
I'm thinking of a keyboard it's pretty
reminiscent of the type
that we had the new surface pro the
surface pro 4 it's got a little more key
travel but it feels good good to type on
a trackpad would like it's been a bit
bigger but it is really smooth Microsoft
is an incredible job with your drivers
on the server side onto track that no
force type stuff here a traditional
gotta push it in but does work really
well so battery life is also pretty
decent I got about 7 and 1/2 hours it's
not the best about a department of last
I'll confess it but it's not horrible
and instead of toned down what you're
doing you'll easily be able to get
through a full day microsoft's been
pushing is 3.2 aspect ratio on the
screens for a while and I still really
like it much like I did with the surface
book the scree on the laptop is pretty
incredible
it's a 13.5 inch screen is Gorilla Glass
3 it's 25 56 by 1504 so you're plenty of
pixels and the restoration these not
have to do that much scrolling stick it
outside though it is going to be
insanely reflective so this is
definitely going to be like an inside
computer ports are limited you've got a
single USB a port you've got a mini
DisplayPort in service connector that's
that's about it I would've liked to
beseen USB type-c or at least under bolt
3 Microsoft is not quite ready to commit
to that yet so not here also no SD card
reader certify cafeteria key dongles
with you victims computer has also with
Windows 10 but it's Windows 10s think of
it as like regular Windows 10 without
being able to download your own apps and
less does apps live in the Windows Store
which is like a wasteland of apps right
now Microsoft Office is now in there but
the app selection is just not good I
could also trying to use this computer
sort of forced developers to make after
the Windows Store which maybe they will
I think Microsoft is aware that that's
probably going to annoy some consumers
so for right now you can download
Windows 10 the full version for free
ultimately though it's going to cost you
about 50 bucks do that if you want the
full version of Windows so keep that in
mind when I start telling you why you
shouldn't buy this laptop so it's a
pretty good laptop it works well by like
was good it looks nice it feels nice
dimensions are pretty similar to laptop
it's clearly trying to fight in the mask
of books air fits in the bag really well
why would you not buy it
the big reason not the BIOS laptop comes
down to price if you value your dollar
and you want to get the best computer
in the best value for that buck this is
not a good deal
look at this competition the first razor
blade stealth starts at 900 bucks I just
want to look at spec for spec have it be
similar be brand new just announced
gunmetal version of the self is $100
more if it's going to give you double
the RAM at 16 gig can give you a 4k
display get me the seventh gen i7
processor didn't give you a full windows
so that $100 difference and if you end
up having to pay for Windows 10s you're
now only a fifty dollar difference maybe
if you try and buy the pen to go with
this could end up being a watch you're
getting so much more for a hundred bucks
but if you want to spend even less just
browsing Microsoft's own store online
shows way better value for your computer
buying buck even the new surface pro you
brand-new just down surface pro you can
get this thing spectra spec and have it
exactly be the same price the granted
you have to buy a type cover but you're
getting the portability of a tablet now
stating the ability to sort of how it
folds almost all the way down fail to
write on its rooming nice option and the
sand is really good on that so those are
a few examples I found while just
generally browsing Microsoft's own store
and beyond all that all those computers
also come with full version of Windows
10 I don't like the 10s
I feel like Microsoft had to put
something on consumers they shouldn't be
doing now know that going in so you'll
know buying this you're going to have
certain muted version of Windows you're
going to have to get it hit that upgrade
button which is pretty unique takes
about a few minutes to upgrade order you
have to pay for it if you're after that
trial period so that's the perfect
laptop it seems kind of strange to not
have a positive feeling about the
surface whine I've loved them since the
very first gen I've been evangelizing
them I've recommended them to friends
and family
hell I've even bought three different
services for my own personal use this
guy I just don't see the value but if
you bought one and maybe you're thinking
about buying one you see the value that
maybe I didn't mention let me know in
the comments we can talk about it and
perhaps you can change my mind looks
like a politician I can flip-flop if I'm
proven wrong until next time I'm John
render keep talking about
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
