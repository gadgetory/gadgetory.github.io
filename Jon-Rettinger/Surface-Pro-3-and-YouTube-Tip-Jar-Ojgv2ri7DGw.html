to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of ask the
buffalo or mascot shia labeouf flows out
this week's gotta deal with this guy's
mug I am jon rettinger up this week
we're to talk about the surface pro 3
iphone 6 questions our new office
patreon and youtube tip to our questions
and whether or not charging your phone
is really damaging your precious
electronic baby this is that the buffalo
let's start asking first question comes
from twitter user add two will was
watching asks at john for lakers should
i buy a surface pro 3 instead of a
laptop listen I love the surface pro 3 I
gave it a raving review I know some
reviewers were kind of down on it but I
absolutely loved it yes by instead of a
laptop had your cave and use it as a
laptop you can get the type cover or get
an external keyboard if you want and you
also get a tablet when you need it
beyond the shadow of doubt for you guys
going to college just want something
they can do the best of both worlds and
you like the pc side of things i would
absolutely unabashedly recommend the
surface pro 3 it's a little more
expensive than others or less expensive
laptops obviously it's less expensive
but you do get it when i considered to
be the best of both worlds and the best
windows 8 experience that is available
for my money though i would go for that
mid spec surface pro 3 i go for the i5
with 256 gigs of solid states and eight
gigs of ram be really really nice
machine hopefully up ain't your question
next question comes from twitter user at
gaby underscore BB who s at john for
lakers with all the great flagships
coming out this year is it worth it to
wait on the iphone 6 or to go an android
hashtag ask to be and thing with phones
is you can always wait for something new
with something like the iphone 6 that
you know is going to be annual release
date you can plan sort of accordingly
when it's going to come out the android
though it's kind of a crapshoot but just
because the phones might have already
been out doesn't mean they're bad phones
heck I have access to every phone out
there and I'm happily using a nexus 5
will you be happily and i love the
device so newer doesn't always mean
better for my money i would say though
if you're sort of thinking about going
to the iphone side of things that you
should definitely
for supposing big differences from the
iphone 5s with the iphone 6 is going to
be Android though it's a little bit more
fluid if you want to wait something
maybe the next Nexus device it might be
coming you have great devices like the
LG g3 which you gave the highest ranking
of any Foley of a review to you've got
great devices already out at a previous
kind of price like the Nexus 5 32 gig
was about 400 bucks off contract it's a
total steel so ask yourself that
question you know are you set on going
iOS if you want to go android I wouldn't
even bother waiting there some awesome
devices out the s5 HTC m8 you know this
guy and the g3 and a ton of others out
there I'm pretty much every carrier hoof
it helped inter questions x question
comes from at the Red Sox 2009's at john
for lakers how's the progress on a new
office going at technobuffalo last week
we showed a few pictures of construction
on our new technobuffalo office we're
going to be moving sometime in September
or october they are totally gutting this
office space it looks like a generic
office space we're gonna try and make it
look a little newer a little more modern
you're probably saying John why you guys
moving your space looks fine well we've
got a good problem first we're kind of
outgrown routing your staff members it's
a smaller office we need more space and
probably more pressing is our lease is
up so want to get something a little bit
larger and but i think is most awesome
part of new office we're building out a
full studio inside of the office be able
to dress kind of six different sets of
different shows so we want to keep
looking at you know the logo behind this
in every video bill to sort of mix it up
and add a new sets and be able to
control of our lighting too right now
we've got some natural light coming in
from over there and actually coming over
there then we've got sort of our control
plate right in front of it you guys
Kansas again just sort of a lighting
nightmare so be able to sort of control
all that stuff and hopefully will help
make youtube videos look even better we
always want to sort of improve and you
know sort of be fun to have our own set
anyway so hopefully look for that come
september-october of course will do a
full office where once we're all moved
in maybe even one before it's me too it
looks like before we move all our stuff
in then once we're all sort of set up it
will give you guys a full tour of the
space fit up ain't your question take a
quick second to thank our friends at
audible.com you know you love them they
are the best place to get spoken word
book the meeting to sound smart a
cocktail party and click oh yes I also
read dusty of S key now you don't spend
the time to them stupid pages you can
listen to the
when you're in your car with your at the
gym at work whatever it might be go to
audible podcast.com slash tech gonna get
your free audio book download of your
choice again that's audible podcast
techno it's your free audio book when
you sign up next question comes from our
friend Dave at geek annoyed to asks at
John for lakers what is your opinion of
the patreon and YouTube tip jar so if
you don't know patreon is a site that
lets you sort of give in monthly
increments or smaller amounts to you
know really whatever you want but
youtubers using it to help generate
funds to create videos buy equipment
whatever it might be as your pretty
popular and YouTube's jumped on ship as
well are all going to be offering
something called a tip jar which can
give just tips to your failure youtubers
not tips like you should shave your face
looks gross but tips like actually
giving them money they could give 200
waiter or waitress so I don't know how I
stand on this so when I first heard a
patreon it sort of seems like people
asking for money for me but then sort of
more and more youtubers got on board any
shard to see a trend happening the trend
is happening people don't always realize
is a lot of youtubers you know me
included rely on ad revenue to sort of
fund our livelihood and through my case
our business more people are viewing
these videos on mobile additionally
doesn't have advertising on it thank you
have ads then they're usually lower CPMs
so the money is gone sort of way down by
about twenty to thirty percent decrease
despite serve audience we worship kind
of rising across the boards I think
about if your job you know you lost
twenty-three percent of your job you
know what would you do so a lot of
people they would leave their job and
try and find a new one but Casey YouTube
can't always do that sort of asking the
audience would give money I don't know
where I stand on it I haven't done it I
can see why people are doing it I
certainly understand why people would do
it I don't know I just I just haven't
sort of I haven't done it you don't need
to do it I'd only do it if I thought
actually necessary means something big I
don't know but the YouTube tip track
something that's kind of cool
essentially if you like a video you can
sir just give a quick to a shin give a
buck if two bucks you know YouTube is
free always continues to be free so it's
nice way to sort of back a little bit to
the videos that you like but you know i
watch the videos too i don't know if i
would give money to youtubers i really
just go back and forth on the side
undulate if you will which I the fence
I'm on but it's looking like this
convene
learn more of a thing you know perhaps
it becomes more main to more tools
become available you know maybe it'll
sort of sway me one direction or another
but what do you guys think about this
patreon in the YouTube tip jar I reckon
would really love to hear your thoughts
on it leave it down below i'll make sure
that i read them x squared comes from is
molly ollie a sketch on for lakers are
charging your phone overnight damage of
battery that sir does not exist anymore
not a problem modern lithium-ion
technology not an issue charger battery
all you want every night i can advance
review at all in fact you should charge
your battery of your night because you
want to have a full charge don't worry
about d charging all the way then cherry
all the way back up to calibrate that
really is not an issue anymore it'll be
totally fine no matter what you do with
your battery just plug it in charge of
you need to and don't worry if you're
going to keep your phones maybe like
eight years you might be some battery
left aggregation but Judea would not
sweat it at all hopeful that help answer
