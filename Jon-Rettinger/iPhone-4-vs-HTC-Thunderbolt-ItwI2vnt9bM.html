known from TechnoBuffalo this is the
Apple iPhone 4 this is the HTC
Thunderbolt both phones are available on
Verizon although this is the III AT&amp;amp;T
version of the iPhone 4 the Thunderbolt
is the biggest baddest new kid on the
block it's got LTE it's got an 8
megapixel camera on the back 1.3
megapixel camera on the front it's got
Android it's got HTC Sense it's got a
kickstand the iPhone 4 still perhaps the
most popular smartphone in America maybe
in the world if you're looking at
individual model still it's not the
whole platform either way it's still the
one people want to know well that's
missing the Thunderbolt is it better
than the iPhone let's find out I'm gonna
get you
alright alright so on the left it's the
Thunderbolt
the HTC Thunderbolt for Verizon
Verizon's first LTE smartphone on the
right the iPhone 4 like I said this is
the AT&amp;amp;T version not the verizon version
not a whole lot of difference for the
purposes of this video Thunderbolt just
announced it'll be available well it is
available now March 17th sorry um and it
is - $49.99 on contract after rebate
although already some online deals a
little cheap from that iPhone 4s been
out for a while now for both 18cm
verizon and 199 or $2.99 after contract
depending on how much memory you want in
the device and so speaking of that Ref
the bat will say that the thunderbolt
has eight gigs of internal storage built
in it comes with a 32 gigabyte microSD
card pre-installed so essentially you've
got 40 gigs of internal storage microSD
cards generally not quite as fast as
internal flash storage but still you've
got 40 gigs of storage space or a little
bit less formatted iphone4 16 or 32 gigs
so if you get the 32 gig iPhone model
for $2.99
it's 50 bucks more retail than the
thunderbolt and you have a little bit
less storage 32 gigs as opposed to a
total of 40 on the Thunderbolt if you
want to look at such things also we'll
talk about the physical design obviously
the Thunderbolt a big phone larger you
know very clearly then the iPhone so
Thunderbolt you've got a 4.3 inch WVGA
display it's a super LCD technology
Super LCD capacitive multi-touch and
you're looking at 480 by 800 pixels so
217 dots per inch iPhone 4 you're
looking at a 3.5 inch display 640 by 960
the so-called Retina display at 330
pixels per inch so the iPhone is a
smaller but higher resolution display
Thunderbolt is a larger but lower
resolution to
display so there you go the devices
themselves obviously you know a big
physical difference Thunderbolt is just
it's larger all the way around its
chunkier or you know thicker or whatever
you want to say and it weighs roughly
20% more than iPhone 4 does and and you
definitely feel it you know there's a
very different field of the two devices
holding them here again you know you get
a larger display and so if you want you
no more physical room a little bit
easier to type on you know that kind of
thing God you get that on Thunderbolt
iPhone you know I'm not personally a
huge fan of the iPhone 4 design that's
all subjective I like the old iPhone
design better myself but you know a
couple things right off the bat you've
got the Android design here with the
four capacitive touch buttons on the
bottom of the Thunderbolt iPhones got
the single home button more bezel
particularly the top and the bottom on
the iPhone forth and the Thunderbolt you
know the front of the Thunderbolt you've
got some bezel especially down there on
the bottom but mostly it's taken up by
the screen when you turn the devices
over you know the iPhone has more of a
squared off design Thunderbolt you know
very rounded on to the back the back
feels curvier because you've got these
edges you know this have this big bulge
in the middle the edges really taper off
the iPhone you know very flat across the
back with the iPhone 4 design you know
overall that the iPhone is more
pocketable both in terms of footprint
and thickness and it weighs less but you
know both devices solidly built I kind
of like the the curved edges of the the
Thunderbolt a little bit easier to hold
in the hand I like the way they feel
better than the more kind of sharp edges
of the iPhone 4 but not a big deal I
don't think many people are really gonna
you know care about that kind of stuff
it's really just the overall side of the
device both devices have front-facing
camera the edge goes to the Thunderbolt
in terms of just raw
you know megapixels 1.3 megapixels
versus the VGA sensor on iPhone 4 and
then on the back you've got an 8
megapixel camera with dual LED flash
720p HD video capture on Thunderbolt
iPhone 4 has a 5 megapixel camera with a
single LED flash and also 720p video
capture I think you know the cameras
fairly even the iPhone iPhone
where I found takes slightly better
videos still image quality you know you
have more megapixels on the thunderbolt
but actual image quality yeah it's kind
of a push to me you know I'm gonna go
you know overall I think the iPhone is a
little bit of an edge because the video
captures better but if you just want to
rob megapixels certainly the Thunderbolt
has the edge both devices have 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and lock
switches on top nice to see that they
put the Thunderbolt lock switch over on
the right side where it's easier to use
I think iPhones is there as well on the
right spine of the phone Thunderbolt has
the rocker switch on the right side
iPhone has nothing you've got that SIM
card slot there but that's about it
on the bottom both devices have a
microphone the iPhone of course has the
Apple iPod connector and then on the
other spine you've got USB micro USB
port on the Thunderbolt iPhone has its
volume up/down buttons as well as the
the mute the silent switch over on the
the left spot so a little bit different
there Thunderbolt has divine controls on
the right spine iPhone on the left spine
Thunderbolt neither phone has an HDMI
out port which no surprise for iPhone
now apples got that adapter you can use
optional adapter to hook it up to a
monitor the iPhone and all the iOS
devices interesting that the Thunderbolt
does not have HDMI out since the other
HTC device has been coming out lately
and even back to the Evo 4G have the
microwave the mini HDMI rather so that's
a little bit disappointing
maybe a deal-breaker for some people
because the HD HDMI out on on some of
these new devices is kind of handy if
you're hooking this up to a big screen
monitor or what have you and then of
course the Thunderbolt has the kickstand
which I phone does not and it's it's
nice you know it's it's solid it's got a
nice snap to it it stays in place and
you can prop your device up for viewing
ipad you can prop up well no you can't
so there you go
iPad it's called iPad iPhone
you know when you get into the using the
devices themselves I pardon the pun but
it really is apples and oranges here you
know it's it's Android 2.2 its iOS
version for right now and HTC Sense on
the
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
