to you by Squarespace what's your
favorite food what's your favorite drink
what's your favorite video game dude
how's the cat doing what do you think
about chromebooks are they worth it what
do you think about the future of the
macbook pro line what do you think's
next for Apple is the ipod classic dead
would you stop asking questions about
apple and why is like I know I here
instead of John it's asked the Buffalo
from techno Buffalo hey what is going on
everybody and welcome to ask the Buffalo
brought to you this week by our friends
at Squarespace I'm Noah cravat sitting
in for jon rettinger who's going to be
sitting in for Noah Kravitz on Friday
doing the rumor roundup as always on
Wednesday John Q doing what whats the
apps although we might have to play
musical guys hosting the video show at
some point and get get John cuter than
where the shows anyway I'm doing ask the
Buffalo this week it's technobuffalo
show where it's all about your questions
answered by us you can hit us up with
your questions always on the website
just go look every week we post a call
for questions go look for ask the
buffalo or just type in your search
engine and choice their type like that
really fast ask the Buffalo
TechnoBuffalo and you'll find the
article you can post your questions in
the comments or you can use that Twitter
thing that all the kids are talking
about go to Twitter and if you want to
be extra nice about it direct the
question to John's Twitter account at
John for lakers or don't just make sure
you include the hashtag ask the BAS kthe
be and we will find your questions pick
some of them answer some of them all
right first question on the website
comes from Oliver goldsboro who wants to
know what do we think the future is for
the ipod classic as it turns 10 years
old this year in 2011 launch 10 years
ago the future it's going away the
dinosaur just like everything stirring
with the dinosaurs eventually does it's
actually kind of funny last week towards
the end of last week some articles I
read online harkening back to something
bill gates of all people said years ago
that the mobile
use a player device of choice is not
going to be a standalone music player
it's eventually going to be the mobile
phone because technology just always
gets cheaper faster and smaller and so
we kind of 44 saw a time when you'd be
able to cram everything from a self from
a digital camera to a music player to a
web browser to everything else in your
cell phone and that time was pretty much
here certainly for a lot of people
people who can afford the higher end
phones but you know so many of the
phones now have music players they have
either flash stores or removable storage
they have three nine millimeter
headphone jacks and they can work as
music players so the ipod classic
hanging on for dear life there i think
as the price of flash memory gets lower
and lower and so you move up those
increments 32 gigs to 64 2 128 22 56
pretty soon there won't be a need for an
ipod classic because the ipod touch and
the iphone in apple's case will have
those larger flash memory chips built
into them at the same price point so i
think that's what's going to do it and
you're just going to see the you know
smartphones in apple's case the iphone
line and the ipod touch line although
rumors about the ipod touch possibly
getting 3g data and all it gets
happening this year but i can see it
happening where apple just you know kind
of moves further and further away from
the reliance on voice contracts and all
that kind of stuff but at any rate ipod
classic mmm I'd say the odds are about
70 30 against seeing a new ipod classic
this fall maybe even a t20 but i'll give
it at least twenty percent chance all
right gabriel and i'm going to pronounce
your last name wrong I'm sorry I
apologize in advance Gabriel Inga marcin
wants to know if the Chromebook is worth
it I am still waiting on my own
Chromebook I went to Google i/o this
year and was eligible I got my galaxy
tab limited edition at the conference
but all of us who were eligible for
Chromebooks which promotes everybody who
was a registered attendee of the
conference samsung and google providing
Chromebooks but they weren't on site you
had to you know sign up for it and then
we got an email letting us know what the
deal was basically we got a promo code
to go to amazon.com order the Samsung
Chromebook
put in the promo code so you would get
the full 499 off the price so the price
is free and place your order and
depending on when you ordered some
people we're going to get them delivered
within like a week or two other people
like me way out till August so I know
two other people who we all went and
ordered ours within 15 minutes of each
other one of them his delivery time was
like two weeks out the other two of us
was over a month into August so mine
last time I checked was august 3rd to
the 10th was my delivery window I have
to go check after I finished this video
and see the deal is but all that being
said I got to play with a Chromebook a
little bit and I was there at i/o when
they launched them and announce them and
I think it's going to be most worth it
for people who don't want to deal with
tech support at all because the tech
support is built into the price if
you're a business or education user and
the whole idea is that you know there
won't be a lot of OS patching and
downloading updates and all that kind of
stuff because of the way that the whole
chrome system is is developed that being
said for the price points that they're
at right now you could pick up a windows
laptop or a UNIX laptop you could pick
up a netbook you could page us a little
bit more and pick up an Android or iOS
or a webos for that matter tablet so I
don't know that the average user the
average consumer is really going to see
a lot of value in the Chromebook remains
to be seen a lot of it has to do with
you know what does Google do what do
they do with the chrome OS with it they
do with the App Store how much do they
really put behind it to build it out and
you know a consumer platform or you know
how is it running parallel with Android
and androids really the big consumer
platform right now but I think
Chromebooks could be interesting in
places like education and in business
and enterprise use where so much money
is spent on tech support tech support
people and you know just the time it
takes to do all the upgrades and the
maintenance and that kind of stuff and I
think that's where the whole Chromebook
thing could be interesting but for
consumers I don't want to say note so
I've had one to use I've used one a
little bit you know some other people
let me use theirs and it's interesting
but it all just depends how much
software is out there
and you know even then for the price
point I don't know oh wait and see all
right Raja zman from Twitter wants to
know hey I'm Raja from Dubai can I be a
tech reviewer here yeah sure why not
anybody can I mean as long as you're

Oh new four five six seven techno seven
thanks again to squarespace com we're
sponsoring this week's episode of techno
Buffalo ask the Buffalo now back to
those questions all right and last but
certainly not least van Snipes I like
that name van Snipes fan Snipes starring
wesley snipes and vance knives van
Snipes on the website wants to know what
tech product were most excited to get
our hands on this year ah the answer
honestly is the one I haven't heard of
yet I mean you know there's something
coming down the coming down the pike
fourth quarter is always the big quarter
that's when you know back to school
going into the the winter holiday
shopping season Chrismukkah as they say
in certain parts of the United States
those aren't the only holidays but it's
just that's when a lot of stuff comes
out loud new products a lot of people
spending their money on Christmas gifts
and all that kind of stuff so I'm always
hoping this time of year or coming in
this time of year that there's something
just really cool and mind-blowing and
just game-changing that hasn't been
leaked yet that's going to come out you
know kind of around that Halloween
Thanksgiving time frame that being said
the product that i have heard a little
bit about that i'm most excited for
might surprise you but something new is
coming from so knows who makes these
really awesome but really expensive
wireless music systems but they're just
great and with all these services now
like Spotify that just launched and RTI
oh and mog and rhapsody and all these
services where you can pay you know five
or ten bucks a month and basically get
you know this unlimited massive music
collections it's just so cool because I
can use my smartphone to control the
thing and find whatever song I want to
find then play it through the sonos and
different parts of the house and so
there rumor there's some leaked photos
with an article on the site you can
check it out about a lower cost sonos
product or we think it's a little cost
because it's smaller looks like it's
clear the FCC it's going to be coming
out sometime we zoom in the next you
know next couple of months who knows I
might come out next week but the next
few months so I'm psyched to see what
that is because I would love to see a
lower-cost sonos product just to make it
cheaper and easier to use that system
because it
awesome and one of the things they did
was they develop their own wireless
technology so even though things like
apples airtunes and airplay does the
same thing the somos just works better
because it's their own wireless mesh
network and it just it's killer it
really works well but it's really
expensive so I'd love to see that get
cheaper and you know things like the
PlayStation Vita and audi a7 that's a
tech product sort of car I can't afford
the tesla model s there's a lot of stuff
out there for sure but the sonos and
then that thing I haven't thought of
whoever's out there Apple Sony Microsoft
nokia HTC HTC I don't know who you are
but make that product put it out this
year and that's the answer my question
all right that does it for this week's
ask the Buffalo again John will be doing
John R will be doing the rumor roundup
this friday john q whats the apps on
wednesday as always and then next week
one of the John's probably jon rettinger
but you never know maybe we'll switch it
up again we'll be back in the ask the
buffalo spot so if you have a question
go to the website look for the ass the
buffalo call out every week or just put
it up on twitter with the hashtag ask
the bee and that's how we find the
questions that's how we try to answer
them for you and like the like the man
asked from Dubai if you want to be a
reviewer write something up send it in
to us use that get featured link on our
home page and we're always looking we're
always looking for good people so that's
how you get involved all right again

episode and as always thanks to the
folks as revision3 at revision3 most
