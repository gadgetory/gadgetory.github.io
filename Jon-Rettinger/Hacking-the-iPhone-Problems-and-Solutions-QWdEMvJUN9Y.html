unboxing but is a review of sorts so
this morning couldn't sleep woke up
early decided I was gonna try to hack my
iphone a little bit more there was just
a new hack that was released that
enabled Gil broken one point one point
one iPods to essentially be upgraded to
the new firmware one point one point
three but also keep all the jailbroken
applications in spirit and jailbroken
just add the new features figure to give
it a whirl I'm not going to post again
you know where that hack was because
obviously didn't work everything seemed
to work fine it went through all the
steps like I'm supposed to took the
amount of time it was supposed to bet
the end when supposed to reboot into one
point one point three mode it did not
instead it just gave me the notice to
plug in my iPhone because it had been
right out so I was a little distraught
about that you know I knew what I was
getting into I thought I'd get a little
hack happy and give it a whirl didn't
work out hopefully i can save anybody
else from trying to do this it's the
same hack that one point one point two
users were trying to use to upgrade
their firmware to the new one point one
point three also so a couple interesting
things happened when i restored my phone
first of all it restored fine but it did
was call they restore an upgrade so it
restored the firmware and then upgraded
automatically to new one point one point
three when i had my phone jailbroken i
had a lot of hacks ahead you guys saw
when I hacked my phone video and
Nintendo on there all kinds of
third-party applications in addition I
also made the phone the carrier say
t-mobile the phone isn't it was not
unlocked and repeat that again it was
not a lot i just made it's a tmobile
because i thought it was kind of fun to
have it say and I had another hack that
enabled me to tap the battery icon and
it would show me a number as how much
bad i was laughing said of the little
status indicator that's usually there so
those are amongst all the hacks i had
any way when I fully restored my phone a
couple interesting things happened let
me show you
so here's my iphone kind of lower the
brightness you guys could see hopefully
you can see that little better if you
look right there still says t-mobile
restoring it didn't wipe that hack away
and also up there the battery thing if i
tap that and get it right but looking at
it there we go it still goes to the
number you can see right there it says
58 um I can tap back and you know do
that which is which is weird those hacks
didn't go away but I guess the new
updates didn't touch some of the
registry that was in the old firmware so
that was pretty interesting um but now
I've got the one point 1 point 3
firmware running which is kind of cool
sure you guys have seen the videos of it
but it lets you actually hold tap an
icon and hold it down everything starts
to do a little jiggly dancing and now I
can move things around if i want i can
grab an icon and move it around if i
want which is kind of cool also when you
want to stop them from jiggling you just
tap that you can also add other screens
now you can add these things called web
clips and i'll show you guys real
quickly here where the web clip is let
me load up paid on safari give me a
second here i will load up a site i hope
you guys are all familiar with its john
for lakers blogspot com so anyway
there's John for lakers blogspot com
let's say I want to add a web clip to it
I can click that little plus icon right
there I'll click it hold on Taylor pulls
up this screen that asks you to add it
to bookmark add to homescreen or make
the link to this page so obviously i'm
going to click Add to Home screen click
at the home screen it asks me what I
want to call it so I can change it
whenever I want I can hit I at it and I
go back to my home screen there's a
there's an icon for actually I already
did it I got its over here I tell the
blog which creates essentially their own
icons for web pages so it's where like
bookmarks
which is nice also the one point 1 point
3 firmware upgrade also adds a virtual
GPS which is kind of neat I'll show you
real quickly here click in where's my
maps click in maps do it without looking
that stocks again maps there we go um
there's now I want to show you guys
that's really where I'm located but
there's another like on right down there
that if you click it it will triangulate
your location which is actually pretty
close to being accurate anyway guys just
wanted to share my plight of the iphone
with you one point one point three seems
to be pretty good also another feature I
forgot to tell you guys about is text
messaging it gives you the ability to
add 10 tech messages text messages to a
lot of different people so i'll show you
guys right here so i just made a new
text message you know guys you recommend
with that screen but now there's that
little plus sign okay i can get frame
right over sorry I'm sucking with the
framing here right over there that lets
you add other recipients names you can
send to multiple multiple people so like
I said well I've been using this for
less than a day so I can't really do a
review of the firmware but so far it
seems to be stable and it's working I do
miss my third party apps though um I
wish I didn't do it I would have liked
it kept it one point one point one but
at least some of the hacks you made it
still says t-mobile even though it's not
unlocked still running on AT&amp;amp;T and I
still have the battery indicator which
is nice hey guys just wanted to give you
a real quick update on that guys don't
forget to check out John for lakers
blogspot com for some exclusive stuff
and some more information you guys
driving a good one wherever you are I'm
off to bed that guy's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
