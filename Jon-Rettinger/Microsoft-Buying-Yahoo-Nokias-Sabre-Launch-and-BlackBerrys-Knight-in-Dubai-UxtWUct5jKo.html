to you by thrillist is Microsoft gearing
up to try to buy yahoo again is Nokia's
first Windows Phone 7 device going to be
called the Sabre and what in the world
are blackberry and Porsche doing in
dubai next week if they've got
blackberry Devcon America's going on in
San Francisco right now well now it's
over but this week I don't get it I
can't keep up with these things that's
what they're called rumors that's why we
round them up its technol buffalos rumor
roundup
hello and what has happened welcome to
the roundup my name is Noah Kravitz and
this is revision threes rumor roundup
with TechnoBuffalo this week's episode
for today the week ending Friday October
21st 2011 I've been into doing the hand
signals this week's episode is brought
to you by our friends at Thrillist
Yahoo's been up for sale for as long as
I can remember and Microsoft's been
linked to them for as long as I can
remember was it was back several years
ago that a very publicized rumor started
kicking around about Microsoft making a
bid for Yahoo and the bid failed in an
all when it was a disaster and Yahoo's
stock price tanked and I don't know that
was that was sort of not quite the
beginning but that definitely was a
watershed moment and Yahoo's spiral
which has been spiraling since then well
if you believe the reports this week
Microsoft may be gearing up to make
another bid to buy out yahoo elba this
time they're not going to be doing it
alone reports have you have microsoft
lync to silver lake partners a private
equity firm that already has a big stake
in alibaba the company that owns forty
percent of Yahoo reports have microsoft
lync to silver lake partners working
with another one of the equity firms
investors to try to put together a
proposal to buy yahoo once and for all
the proposal being discussed would have
microsoft putting up several billion
dollars of their own money with the rest
of the funding coming through silver
lakes various partners but apparently
this is one of up to nine deals
currently being discussed put together
talked about in smokey back rooms with
sniffers of brandy and big cigars or
however it is big executives make deals
these days I like to think of that image
though right at all everything you
forget Silicon Valley everything happens
in the back room of a restaurant in New
Jersey somebody clearly misses the
sopranos speaking of Microsoft their new
best friend and the mobile hardware
business nokia is gearing up to launch
the first batch of Windows Phone 7 or
Windows Phone 7.5 mango devices at nokia
world next week in London our very own
emily price will be making the trip
across the pond to bring you all of the
new
those all the new devices everything
else from nokia world next week on the
scene so tune in to TechnoBuffalo for
all of that and one of the devices that
as being talked about right now is
something that's named saber at least
codenamed saber according to reports on
the good old internet but these reports
actually had some photos and that kind
of thing there's a device being called
saber that might be unveiled alongside
of the nokia sea ray which is now being
referred to as the 800 sea ray if you'll
recall is the device that right after
nokia unveiled the absolutely gorgeous
totally dead on arrival me go power 2 n
9 in a low press conference after that
milke did one of these things were they
like oh what's in my jacket oh what's
this oh it looks like an N 9 but it runs
Windows Phone I wonder what it is more
let's put it away and that I you know
sparked all kinds of talk about like oh
so this is the deal they were already
building the n9 they couldn't stop so at
least they're going to shoehorn Windows
Phone into it because migos dead which
now it's officially dead it's not called
Tizen but that's another story anyway ah
looks like we're going to see the sea
ray or 800 or whatever it is unveiled
and then also we may see this new device
being referred to as sabre sabre said to
be running a single-core 1.4 gigahertz
CPU pack in 1 gig of ram with a 3.5 inch
WVGA display and a 5 megapixel rear
camera sounds like a mid-range phone to
me and the alleged pricing running
somewhere between four and five hundred
dollars off contract would in fact back
up the spec sheet to say yeah this is
the this is the mid-range offering will
give you the big guns with see ray will
give you a saber for something that'll
rattle your wallet a little bit less get
it savor it rattles it now anyway
whatever's coming out of London next
week from nokia windows so on all that
stuff like I said Emily will be there
check out TechnoBuffalo for the latest
and hands-on with all of the new devices
I for one I'm psyched to see these
because Nokia they still make gorgeous
hardware and they have said it's pretty
much fat at this point that their
windows phone devices are going to have
a little something extra it's not just
going to be the standard Windows Phone
install that you're seeing on devices
from companies
like HTC and Samsung who differentiate
you know with their name brand and their
own hardware design but instead Nokia
apparently is going to be able to add
something extra to the Windows Phone pie
and a lot of talk about even more social
networking integration on Nokia's phones
and you see on the standard Windows
Phone devices from other companies so
very interested to see what what this
will all look like and again I think
Nokia makes gorgeous hardware and their
cameras are always top-notch so I'm
excited to see them sort of rebirth with
a modern operating system so fingers
crossed saber SI ray 800 whatever it is
let's hope it's good when it comes out
next week you know how you have that one
friend who's always hooking you up with
the cool new bands before anybody else
has even heard of them well thrillist is
like that but for cool new stuff to do
and places to go want to know about a
star wars burlesque show a beer garden
that screens 80s flicks or a cool new
restaurant with a sushi robot then sign
up for Thrillist it's a free daily email
that sifts through the crap to bring you
only the best in new places to go new
bars new restaurants events and services
whatever it is they promise it won't
suck just hit up Thrillist calm /
Buffalo that's Thrillist calm / v uff
alo Buffalo and you'll start getting
thrilla sweet sweet knowledge right now
all right speaking of phone launches in
faraway lands blackberry is apparently
gearing up for a launch next week in
Dubai this is uh this is really
interesting to me because i just spent
part of this past week at BlackBerry's
big developers conference Devcon
america's 2011 right here in San
Francisco we didn't see any new phone
launches we did hear about BB X which is
what blackberry is calling their
next-generation operating system for
phones they've already got the the
playbook OS they're now calling it for
the PlayBook tablet and the playbook OS
is built upon qnx and apparently bbx is
what they're going to call the QNX ified
if you will the qnexa fide version of
the blackberry operating system for
smartphones they talked about it didn't
actually show anything so everybody was
sort of left you know sort of scratching
their heads like
well okay you showed us a logo but
what's it going to look like it there's
no no hardware and I don't know REM
needed a home run here and instead we
sort of got a wild pitch what's going on
well apparently they are going to launch
some new hardware but they're doing it
next week in Dubai with Porsche invites
have gone out to be a part of something
truly exclusive and do my air quotes to
be a part of something truly exclusive
at an event on thursday october 27th in
dubai and the companies are expected to
unveil the blackberry night 9980 which
is a blackberry device you know it's the
candy bar form factor with a screen and
a keyboard underneath it so the same
general form factors the bold and the
curve and that kind of thing but a
radically different design done up in
silver metal very angular it is very
different probably going to be a limited
run exclusive kind of thing started like
the vert to die guess that kind of stuff
whatever it is they're launching it in
dubai next Thursday you know I don't
know it makes you wonder what what rims
strategy is it it sounds like you know
stopgap until they can get those bbx
UNIX powered phones you know up and
running and ready to show off and they
feel like they need to launch something
we just are really interesting and sort
of sort of head-scratching to me that
they've really underwhelmed people at
dev com with a lack of announcements and
now they're launching this thing and due
by next week who knows though i don't
know maybe maybe that's the way to do it
all right there you go it's the rumor
roundup again next week emily is going
to be in London stay tuned for all that
if somebody buys yahoo will let you know
as soon as possible and whatever comes
out of Dubai will report on that to all
on TechnoBuffalo thanks again to our
friends at thrillist for sponsoring this
week's episode of the roundup and thanks
to revision 3 i'm going to think the
numbers thanks to a revision 3 for
having the three of us me John and John

Wednesday Friday there you go till next
time my name is Noah this has been the
roundup bye bye
