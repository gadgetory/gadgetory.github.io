palm pre for sprint has really been a
polarizing device some love it some hate
it and neck spirit I thought I slice it
down the middle and do a new segment
called five things so this is five
things that I love about the palm pre
and five things that i hate about the
palm pre so let's go ahead and get
started the first do them to start on
the negative side and we'll do five
things that i hate about the palm pre
the number one thing that I really
really don't like about the palm pre
there's no autocorrect on a keyboard so
when you type a word the keyboard is
relatively small and as you type you
know your might have fat thumb and type
a wrong key it's not going to
autocorrect you you have to hit the
delete button go back and retype your
word that's quite annoying and it's
something that I think palm can
definitely fix with an over-the-air
firmware update not expected to be fixed
as one of really the first features that
get patched on the device but right now
still there and it's still totally
annoying so the next thing sort of on
that same keyboard main is a no
on-screen keyboard I know that's kind of
a hard thing to say can't really have
your cake and eat it too in a reference
to the physical keyboard but you look at
a device like the g1 that now has an
on-screen keyboard and a physical
keyboard as well sometimes you want to
just type a real quick letter I
certainly prefer a tactile keyword for
most of my typing if I just want to type
a real short message or send a yes or no
would be that just failed do it on
screen or at least have the option to do
it on screen as opposed to sliding this
up not that I don't enjoy sweating it up
but it would be nice to have something
on screen so the next thing that I'm
really not a fan of the palm pre i'm
going to give you guys a demonstration
of it right here is I go on YouTube
quite a bit on the parade I like to read
the comments on my videos and other
videos and on other mobile browsers for
instance the iphone the blackberry storm
even the g1 i am able to click on a
video and go in and view the content
however on the g1 so let me show you
guys
talking about here and zoom on in I am
right now on my YouTube page and if I go
ahead and click on one of these videos
to click on the first one instead of
opening up the web page that would show
the video and just say it can't be
played and let me read the comments it
opens up the YouTube a YouTube
application so i have no way of going
through and reading the comments on my
videos of your videos or any other
videos on the palm pre it is a little
done the annoying exact i really like to
go through and read the comments so on a
sign up w 2 player on here is quite nice
so let's keep going the next thing that
I hate about the palm pre is the X there
aren't any there really only about 20
apps and they're only about seven them I
think art are worthwhile I know it's
because it's a new device if I just
learning how to program for it and
they're still web apps hasn't been a
native SDK release yet but at least
right now to aren't that many x1 things
that i love about the iphone was just
the thousands and thousands of thousands
of apps and i don't have those options
right now at the palm pre i think that
will get fixed though i think that more
apps are coming in the days and weeks
ahead especially we're eating up to the
iphone 3gs launch I think sprint is
really going to try and push the pre a
little bit more so I would expect the
apps to becoming mentally the next thing
and this is really really really
annoying for me I like to view web pages
in landscape so let's say for instance i
I'm looking at my bookmarks and
landscape right now and I don't want to
type a URL don't let me create a type of
URL in any web page is to go back up to
portrait and then start typing landscape
is not fully functional yet on the palm
crates really only for viewing you know
have the same capabilities that you have
in portrait as you do in landscape
that's really annoying time viewing a
web page I've got it zoomed in right
where I want it and reading okay i want
to go to another one I gotta rotate it
letter realign itself and then type in
the URL really annoying I'm not not a
big fan of n so those are five things
that i hate about the palm pre oh no so
minor annoyances but there's still
things that I would like to see included
so now with the negative out of the way
I was really animated negative let's go
to some of the positive things and the
five things that I love about the palm
pre and we're going to start with
multitasking in the card interface which
really is the bread and butter of the
palm pre I love the cards onto your
check out my other videos for how they
work Vicky able to multitask is
fantastic I can say open up the web
browser and while the page is loading I
can go in and check my stocks or wallet
page is loading I can go in and check my
email I can leave my email application
open and go and play a game that I've
downloaded one of the applications it
really is just very nice and it's fun to
use to close applications by flicking
the cards off the screen it really is
fun and I've got a kind of joy using my
phone I let my sad little bit silly but
for you gadget heads out there you know
what I'm talking about when you get a
new toy a new phone or video game
console whatever it might be just enjoy
using it the palm pre really falls in
that category I just like using it I
find myself looking for an excuse to
text or checking my email maybe more
than I did because it's fun it really
had just been an overall enjoyable
experience with the pretty so the next
thing that I love about the palm pre
moving on to number two is the physical
keyboard I really like having a physical
keyboard fact I forgot how much I like
having a physical keyboard I've been
using the iphone for the past two years
it is really nice have your fingers
actually hit buttons I've gotten very
good at typing with non physical virtual
keyboards but I gotta say I can revert
very quickly back to actual buttons and
it is really nice to have that tactile
feedback a quite a fan of physical
keyboards in general on the palm pre
it's a little bit small us a little bit
cramped but i still prefer having a
small cramped keyboard over not having a
keyboard at all the next thing that i
love about the palm pre and this is not
computer for everybody is the size and
the dimensions of it it just fits in
your hand so nicely it really does feel
like a river stone
it was meant to be designed for its
small it's thin fits in your pocket
really easily feels good in the hand I
think the build quality is actually very
solid I just like the feel the phone
itself it's really isn't anything to do
with the operating system it's just the
from a hardware perspective I really
like the way it feels with the soft
touch back that comes with the
touchstone wireless charger just feels
nice to me again makes it sort of fun to
play with so the next thing that I like
this is something that I never thought I
would like this is definitely vary by
region as I've been thrilled with sprint
service there evdo rev a network is
lightning fast as you saw in my
comparison videos the voice quality has
been great I have not had a single
dropped call with the pre which is quite
nice I like all the sprint services the
navigation the sprint TV everything kind
of rolled into one for that one price
point is really nice sprint suppose you
guys don't know how these all-inclusive
packages that give you a limited calling
text voice data unlimited everything
really for one price in the u.s. it's
ninety-nine dollars for a single plan
for everything and I really like that
i'm quite happy with sprint if you guys
get good sprint service by your house or
wherever you live definitely consider
the the pump rate as an option and the
last thing that I really like about the
palm pre it's nothing I can't point my
finger on it and say look at this but
it's a potential of the device I like
the web OS I like that relies on the
internet and I think that it has a lot
of potential to utilize that for
web-based applications I think
eventually much like the iphone will be
opened up native applications they can
take advantage of the hardware of the
processor of the screen a physical
keyboard I think the potential is
absolutely fantastic I mean imagine
being able to play games using the
actual keyboard for controls imagine an
nes emulator or any other games you
actually have actual buttons while
you're playing I think the platform is
going to grow it's just really a rev a
right now it's just come out in the
first form many other devices are going
to be running the same operating system
I'm certain of it and the coming months
I think that webos just has a lot of
potential I'm excited to see what palm
does with it and what new features they
add how they augment the platform so
guys new feature was five things that I
love and hate hope you enjoyed what are
five things that you love or hate about
the palm pre you know it doesn't have to
be five you can have one or two things
that you love or three that you hate
what do you guys think about the pre in
general and I hope you enjoyed for
exclusive content sure to follow me on
