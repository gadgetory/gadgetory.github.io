don't know what IFA is think of it like
CES but for Europe usually where we see
big product announcements and we did see
some cool some crazy and some bizarre
products get announced this year so me
show you something to highlight some of
the coolest weirdest things that we saw
at IFA let's start with the abomination
that I want more than any tech product
right now just because this is the
gargantuan Acer predator 21x I think at
this point you can't call this thing a
laptop it's more of like a like a
desktop you can lug around with you so
first as a ridiculous 21 inch screen if
that's not ridiculous enough it's a
curved 21 inch green then how about you
throw in dual geforce gtx 1080 graphic
chips for for good measure and then
maybe just add in the toss of i cracking
technology which during a demo you
actually used to play games like move
your eyes and shoot the enemy 64 gigs of
ram in this thing and if that's not
insane enough they also have a
mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX
switches into this thing it is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen and
again I don't know why but I I feel like
I need one but I don't know when I can
get one because release are pricing it
hasn't really been announced but damn
look at that thing it you're gonna need
to have like a workout regimen to carry
this thing around but imagine it looks
you're gonna get in Starbucks when you
work on your screenplay
what trade show be complete without some
phones and sony was there with a couple
tiny computers the phone looks really
nice it's kind of a dark navy blue huge
phone and I like the design language
that Sony has maybe it's time to try
some new nothing from the spec
department here is gonna blow you away
snapdragon 820 and kind of the rest of
this stuff you'd expect from a mid to
high range phone but what is awesome
with Sony phones is that 23 megapixel
camera and megapixel adjust side Sony
makes some of the best sensors going and
in fact they're so good most
manufacturers are using their sensors
anyway so if you want a killer camera
look for the X Z but I doubt that's
gonna come to us anyway so looked about
what unlocked if you like your phone
smaller with a compact in their name
then perhaps the xperia x compact might
be for you we used to love Sony when
they would squeeze all these high in
specs
smaller phones but that's not the case
here and say you're getting kind of
middle-of-the-road Snapdragon chip and a
bunch of the same specs but guard gated
austin 23 megapixel camera that we just
talked about in the Xperia XZ it did
feel nice to hold a bit like the
unapologetically plastic phones it may
have come from other companies I'm not
gonna mention any names but again a nice
mid-range phone the chances are we won't
see here in the US but what if you're in
the category like Miri like your phone's
big and your tablet's small perhaps the
brand new hallway media pad m3 might be
one to consider 8.4 inch all-metal
design it's got hallways take on Android
on it love it or hate it but Google Play
is there so throw a launcher on other
than that it's the tablet that we've all
seen before a few nice additions though
the home screen you can serve swipe over
and get access to multitasking it's a
nice little trick that they've included
if you're a fan of good speakers on your
tablet they partner with Harman Kardon
on here and they sounded loud to us even
in a crowded conference hall but off to
get them home in the lab test it out and
see how the sound the screen looks
really nice to the naked eye which is a
weird expression to say I'm gonna put a
shirt on my eyes no one no one's the
ones got to see that this Blake does
look to be pretty solid I did like how
light felt though it seems like it's
perfect just for watching a movie
attached to the book on a trainer plane
ride Plus starting on a 350 euros that
doesn't hurt either oh I didn't save
we'll see in the US but if we do I'll
let you know maybe we'll just come and
visit maybe get a work visa there were
also some smartwatches that got
announced you're probably thinking I'm
gonna mention huawei LG Samsung the
usual players but no how about winnings
the folks that made that regular watch
that actually had some SmartWatch
functionality into it they are back with
the winning steal HR which not
surprisingly is made out of Steel and
it's got a built-in heart rate monitor
as you'd expect again that HR name and
it looks like a classic watch I mean a
lot of people are looking for they might
not want a screen on their wrist
I've been using smartwatches for a while
it's been felt a little bit small to me
but it felt really solid and well-built
and the feature set is what you want so
if you need that heart rate monitor and
you want a classic watch look without a
giant screen it's pretty good option
there's obviously a ton more by fa we
cover it some more for my faith but
these are some of the things that when
the most interesting discussion pieces
not all obviously we're great not all
knock things out of the park but some
were interesting so you guys think about
IFA 2016
it's alike for gigantic curved laptops I
feel like they they deserve it the next
time from John Redinger from
