TechnoBuffalo here and I figured let's
change up the backdrop for a little bit
the iPhone 6s here you might be asking
yourself what's the difference why would
I upgrade about I consider it maybe you
already have a six or something older
you don't know what the difference is
alright because the phones look
identical let me open answer those
questions for you and walk you through
what's new here with the 6s so first
you've got 3d touch oh that's the
ability to do is force touch into
applications so you get another
contextual menu inside of Apple's native
apps right now presumably third-party
apps later on down the road Apple
describes it as peeking and popping so
you can peek inside of an app and you
can pop inside of it if you want to open
the full app up we're gonna do a full
video walking you through 3d touch nice
to say it works well and it doesn't work
as advertised also new here is the color
it's available in rose gold the other
classic colors are still there silver
Space Gray and classic gold and the
biggest difference between the phones I
should mention is this one has an S
below below the iPhone so while Apple's
usual mantra with phones is thinner
lighter faster that was not mentioned
with the 6s because it's not the width
here is a little bit on the fatter side
6.9 millimeters versus 7.1 on the 6s so
got a little bit fatter you don't really
notice it but it's definitely there I'd
also got a little bit on the fatter side
the six came in at four point five five
ounces or 129 grams versus the slightly
more portly 5.0 four ounces or 143 grams
inside here it can be different as well
and got the a8 processor versus the a9
it's a little bit faster there
supposedly more battery efficient as
well
cameras Apple up their game a little bit
on the front facing camera we've got a
1.2 megapixel sensor on the 6 with no
flash and we now have a 5 megapixel
sensor on the 6s and uses the whole
freaking screen as a flash kind of cool
on the back camera also improved 8
megapixel versus 12 and the video you
can take with it got way better
we went from 1080p to 4k at 30 frames
per second on the 6s
battery capacity did not go up the 6 had
1810 liam bowers versus a smaller one
though
fifteen million power battery but apple
says it's gonna have the exact same
battery life because new a9 chip is a
little more battery efficient Ram you
now have two gigs versus one in the
previous generation so that should help
with multitasking all the things with
the body are different here to apples
using new series 7000 aluminium so it
should be a little more scratch
resistant and they worked hand in hand
with Corning to create a new glass just
for Apple it's not Gorilla Glass it
probably is but they're calling an ion X
glass so bear that in mind also has a
new taptic engine when the phone rings
and it's got a vibration mode it's very
strange almost pulsates at you also new
here is ability to say hey Siri now you
can do that but the last generation has
to be plugged in but this guy does not
be plugged in you can just say hey
Google now sorry hey Siri and it'll wake
up and ask you whatever you want to do
performance wise he's my first blush
needs to be about as fast
certainly multitasking down the road
will be faster games take advantage that
more beefier hardware especially at two
gigs of ram so whether or not you want
upgrade that's your decision
thought I'll be shed some light on
what's new here and maybe illuminate
what's not new here with both phones
anyway thank you guys for watching hope
you enjoyed are you gonna upgrade are
you not gonna upgrade look to your
thoughts on it until next time i'm jena
in your some TechnoBuffalo so guys
thanks video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
