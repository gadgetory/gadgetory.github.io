bets on the Lumia 920 as an exclusive on
AT&amp;amp;T for just 99 bucks the new two-year
contract is the company's latest Windows
Phone device and large improvement over
its previous efforts can it wound more
customers to Microsoft's budding
platform let's go ahead check it out and
see for ourselves
the Lumia 920 no doubt packs a bit of
heft at 185 grams and the thickness of
10 point 7 millimeters but it's a far
cry from the complaint several pundits
have already issued in fact I think it's
bulk actually makes it feel rock-solid
like the Nokia phones remember from back
in the day that could play snake and
really take a beating
I'm absolutely positively in love with a
high gloss cherry red polycarbonate body
- and that's what I love about what
Nokia HTC are doing with Windows Phone 8
bringing color back to the smartphone
game the phone is a large four point
five inch screen the 1280 by 768 pixel
resolution and thanks to its pure moment
HD technology I found it's off for more
accurate colors deeper in Keir blacks
than the Windows Phone 8x from HTC I
preferred looking at the Lumia 920
screen in every situation whether it's
watching movies outside or indoors being
angles were also great and the screen
was easily viewable outdoors on the
direct sunlight Lumia 920 also features
wireless charging for its 2,000 milliamp
hour battery which we'll talk about a
bit later
it's got a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 processor support for AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE
network rocking 1 gigabyte of RAM 32
gigs of storage twice that of what the
8x offers Bluetooth 3.0 NFC and all
kinds of other goodness which you're not
gonna find though is Beats Audio which I
really liked on the Windows Phone 8x
but I prefer the industrial design the
display and nokia software bundles over
the Windows Phone 8x so far speaking of
software let's go and dive right into
that we talked about Windows Phone 8 a
great deal on our HTC 8x review since it
was a first smart phone that we'd
reviewed running the new operating
system so we'll spare you the basics
about NFC support
sizable Start screen tiles and other
features instead I'll talk about what
Nokia's included looks Lumia 920 extend
out against other devices if you want to
see the 8x review though we'll have a
link down below first to finish
filmmaker included its own Drive Maps
music and city viewfinder on the Lumia
920 all add value and are completely
free at the phone Drive works really
well for turn-by-turn voice got
navigation for example you keep and save
Maps
flying use when a cell signal is just
not available Nokia music is
surprisingly pretty solid store for
shopping for songs even for finding out
about local concerts in your area city
view is a really cool augmented reality
application in concept but it's not
really that useful yet it works don't
get me wrong it correctly showed me all
the nearby coffee shops but you don't
want it to go stumbling down the street
using it as a viewfinder I'm not sure
how much it can be improved though just
not that useful seeing a bunch of
floating ID comes on the screen I can
easily use maps and find a point of
interest much quicker the application
selection for Windows Phone 8 is still a
major weak point especially against iOS
and Android Microsoft could take the
stage and show off live tiles all at
once but if you can't do anything with
Windows Phone it becomes a pretty boring
experience the great apps just aren't
there yet folks but Microsoft has
promised 45 to 50 of the top apps from
other app stores unfortunately it's
still playing a huge game of catch-up
especially considering pandora which has
already been available on other mobile
platforms forever
it's a highlight on that list look
you'll buy a Windows Phone 8 device
because the great harder which Lumia 920
absolutely offers and the excellent user
experience but you'll want to look
elsewhere if you're an app junkie this
is not a shot directed Lumia 928 want
you to know that Windows Phone 8 itself
is really lacking in that area so let's
talk about the camera the Lumia 920
offers an eight point seven megapixel
camera or the Carl Zeiss lens and the
company's PureView technology is first
introduced in the pure view 808 images
are crisp colorful and accurate in
pretty much every scenario the low-light
performance is like magic but didn't
always produce awesome results I held
the phone several times in super dim
conditions where most phones wouldn't
take a great shot and I snapped the
photo suddenly the screen lit up after
being completely dark with a bright
image as if it hadn't been shot in dark
environment at all but I compared it to
low-light images too though shot with my
iPhone 5 arguably the best smartphone
camera on the market though I found that
the iPhones shots were a bit sharper
less blurry than those were the 920
which I really wasn't expecting that is
especially true if there any lights in
the image such as those in my keyboard
the iPhone 5 stepped a photo that looks
just fine but the lights and a massive
glow into the Lumia 920 shots the
front-facing camera is okay it's got a
resolution of 1280 by 960 doesn't blow
my pants off don't make any jokes next
let's talk about wireless charging ATT
is gonna include a free wireless
charging plate two Lumia 920 while
supplies last it's a pretty awesome
feature that I really like using I was
able to come home to Lumia 920 out of my
pockets just drop on the wireless
charger
coffee table I not to fiddle with wires
or anything like that it kind of seems
trivial and a little bit silly but I
really found it enjoyable the phone
makes this sound you drop it on the pad
to let you know what's charging and
there's an LED indicator it lets you
know when it's finished charging what I
could distinguish Jeff doesn't take
longer to charge Lumia 920 on the pad
then it does plug in it indirectly seems
it just takes a few hours to get a full
charge charging plates to be available
in all the colors of the Lumia including
black cyan red white and yellow there's
also a Nokia wireless charging pillow by
Fat Boy we'd have a chance to test that
guy out probably because he ate it
alright next let's talk about battery
life data and call quality Lumia 920
packs a 2000 milliamp hour battery
that's rated for up to nine hours of
talktime over 3G I was able to easily
get through a full day without having it
drop it on the wireless charging pad
once that's become my benchmark for most
smartphones these days several times I
woke up with it next to me with a full
charge but I mostly kept it on his
charging pad since it's just easy to
cruise by toss it on my pocket and walk
out the door data speeds we were really
solid on 8g and G's 4G LTE network and I
was able to download full albums on the
Xbox music store in just a few minutes
while I was walking to the coffee shop
obviously though that's gonna depend on
your location
I used the Lumia 920's my primary phone
for a few days and didn't experience
really any drop calls everything sounded
perfectly clear speaker was adequate
especially during a TechnoBuffalo
conference call everybody can hear me
yelling at him clearly so what's the
verdict on Lumia 920 are they gonna miss
him not to send it back to me Nokia
really just hit the nail on the head
with the silo of software and hardware
the cherry red color really made it
stand out on my memory against any other
thrown up tested recently and it's leaps
and bounds ahead of the Lumia 900 it's
so excellent that all the complaints
about the half to have me baffled but I
suppose there's always something to call
out in the smartphone Windows Phone 8
does need work still doesn't have as
many applications as Android and iOS but
that's okay
it's a fledging platform just needs time
to grow and frankly I'm judging Lumia
920 for what it is a Windows Phone 8
built on great hardware the camera is
wonderful he has the close-up shots to
make it look a bit blurry so prefer my
iPhone 5 for most camera situations so
it brings you down to the hard question
I need to answer is Lumia 920 better
than the Windows Phone 8x by HTC yeah I
think so the 920 is $100 cheaper
Alvers compatible hardware a better
camera comes pre-loaded with Nokia's
excellent applications plus you get
wireless charging for freedom it's me
that's a no-brainer but if you prefer a
skinnier phone two completely different
design the Windows Phone 8x is going to
be an amazing alternative so if you've
been considering a new phone Lumia nine
20 is gonna serve you very well for the
next two years it's a great phone
awesome build quality on a really
intriguing operating system what do you
guys think is the 920 gonna grace your
pockets for the next two years we want
to hear what you have to say check us
