I don't know a year more than a year
rumors and leaks and specs and talk
about a PlayStation based phone and here
it is it's a Sony Ericsson Xperia Play
live and in the flesh so to speak in the
silicon I guess at Mobile World Congress
2011 in Barcelona I am here with Pedro
from Sony Ericsson who is going to take
us through the first PlayStation
Certified device the Xperia Play know
we'll be having is so this is the Xperia
Play fully fledged smartphone as you
would expect from wanna buy Xperia
devices so you get the Sony Ericsson
flavor of Android Gingerbread it's
running on the latest Android release
available which is Android Gingerbread
2.3 so as I said for me to fully fledged
Android Gingerbread innovative the Sony
feel you can see from the theme also
what we call the media pane where you
can consume very easily all your content
and then of course we have the the
gaming part so the idea is that when you
slide open the phone you go into a full
gaming experience and I will show you
that how that will look
this is still the demo version
pre-production software not you know not
what's shipping yet so this is what you
will get when you open the device so
you're going to fully gaming merge this
is what we call the Xperia Play launcher
and as you can see here you can find the
games that are actually installed on the
device you have another tab which is
recently out so this will show the games
that you recently downloaded and then
you have the the more games tab and this
is where we will we will show the the
games that we're recommending you put a
download for the game so this will be
refreshed a few times during the day so
that you always have the latest and
greatest funding available to download
and how this will work is that when you
click on it you'll be directed into
Android Market to where you can then buy
it and down
let me just then show you maybe one of
the gangs so here I'm showing it's
asphalt so title Foreman James off
actually be pre-loaded on the device I
just going to set up the race
to download download MMO explained so
the controls that we have on the gamepad
itself so you have the d-pad then you
have to analog touchpad so emulating
like where you get on the kind of a
joystick regular plan you have the
typical for symbol keys from Sony to
select and start which is very typical
team Sony as well and you can see on the
back we have the shoulder buttons as
well oh great could you flip that one
more time I miss yeah terrific
so in this game while you'll be seeing
so use the X to accelerate which you
know very similar what you expect on a
Playstation controller and then just the
directional keys and then the shoulder
button on the back as you can see
actually triggers a nitros to make you
go even faster yeah that's the button
that I hit too many times I play games
like this huh I forget where the break
button is but I know where the nitro is
so that the PlayStation Certified
concepts what does that refer to
well this is the first PlayStation
Certified device so as part of the NGP
announcement from from Sony a few weeks
back they also announced the PlayStation
suite framework and that means that
they're committing to bringing the
PlayStation titles to the to the Android
and what they've committed is to
initially they will bring PlayStation 1
titles to to this framework so those
titles will spot up the PlayStation
framework will be made available for for
this device as I said initially
PlayStation 1 sidles and they will be
available for download from from android
markets
exclusively for this device and then
there's talk of a PlayStation Store
coming later exactly I mean part of the
the Playstations suite framework for
Sony what is will bring up a PlayStation
Store later this year we're old and
there the games that they bring to the
PlayStation 3 framework will be made
available so we'll have the devices were
shipped with some games pre-installed
will be more available for download and
at launch and then later the official if
you will PlayStation Store yeah exactly
so I mean we aim to have around 50
titles available at launch you spent a
day training me to play this game and I
played it without also being on camera
explaining how the whole process works
yeah you would still beat me hands down
but you're driving you're telling me
about the whole place it's very easy I
mean that's what we what is key is what
we really focus is on delivering a great
for the ultimate gaming experience on
this device and we believe that the
gamepad is really key in this to be able
to achieve that terrific
will there be multiple multiplayer games
yes this asphalt for instance supports
multiplayer with up to six players
excellent out of the box we have spar
battalion which also supports
multiplayer
and FIFA 10 which is actually a first
Android multiplayer will be on this
device excellent
and more of them the titles that will be
made available for download will be
possible and there's one of the titles
that we actually can be available for
download which is Dungeon Defenders it
actually supports online playing and
it's cross-platform so it's a title that
you can play on PC and consoles so it'll
be completely across very very cool and
when more of this mobile gaming goodness
be available so we we just announced
device yesterday and the the launch of
this device is in the first quarter of
this year all right not long to wait
it's the Xperia Play I think I'm gonna
go get my hands on a demo you know for a
little while off camera though because I
am NOT a good driver from the Sony
Ericsson Pavilion at Mobile World
Congress here in Barcelona Thank You
Pedro it's the Xperia Play very exciting
we're gonna see it soon across the globe
and in the US they announced exclusive
launch with Verizon much much more from
the show
Sony Ericsson and everything else going
on on TechnoBuffalo com all week long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
