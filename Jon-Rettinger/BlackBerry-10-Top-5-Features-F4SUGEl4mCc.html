TechnoBuffalo here we are just a few
short weeks away from rim taking the
wraps off its way long waited long hyped
blackberry 10 out break system in their
BlackBerry 10 launch devices it's coming
up at the very end of January so that I
run through my top 5 features I'm most
excited about
but BlackBerry 10 and the more I see it
the more I play with blackberry 10 then
we're excited I'm getting we're trying
something new here we've got two cameras
see how this works out to be what your
opinions on that as well let's go and
get started alright so blackberry 10
brings a ton of new features rim is
finally stepping up to a modern
operating system now discussion whether
or not it's too late or without they
have any life left in them is really yet
to be written but after we had a chance
to play with blackberry tenancy yes I
think REMS got some juice left and that
berries so to speak so let me run
through my top five features so these
are the top five features that I'm most
excited about it brings a ton of other
ones to the party you might be excited
about others let's go ahead and start
with number five the BlackBerry hub the
blackberry hub is where all your
messages live everything from email bbm
making a comeback you can share your
pain with people social media updates
text messages and everything it looks
like a really handy way to avoid having
to go to individual apps to check your
updates I hope you know it's super
customizable because I don't want my
phone to vibrate ding or make some sort
of noise when I get and that reply on
Twitter but it looks really nice
Testament Universal inbox for everything
now there was kind of that in previous
versions of blackberry and certainly
other operating systems have had some of
these features but the way they've done
it the way it's looked really cool to
activate it using that peak feature we
can sort of just pull over and see it
it's really neat so I'm very excited
about that
number four is active frame it's not a
new feature than mobile os's but it's
totally a great one it's actually about
mobile frames do let you quickly access
up to eight apps in one screen they give
it like live tiles for a Windows Phone
these little app previews are gonna
receive real-time updates so it's only
gonna do it for first-party BlackBerry
apps at launch so your calendar you got
to see what's coming if you have a web
page open a new contents been there
should be able to see it it looks really
neat
seeing the interface is really slick and
a really smooth it works very quickly
I'm not even expected from rim in the
past so those live sort of tiles are one
of them are sexy features of BlackBerry
10 one of the less sexy features one of
the coolest things is number three the
on-screen keyboard it's a bit of a weird
one to be excited about I totally know
but Rim has done an awesome job of
taking touch typing to the next level
you think something called next word
prediction you can literally swipe
suggestions up from the keyboard to your
text it's gonna learn really quickly how
you type it's gonna adapt accordingly so
hopefully eliminate almost all typos rim
could have one of the best virtual
keyboards around and it's only gonna get
better as you use it the more you use it
the better it's going to work so their
on-screen keyboard could be rim secret
sauce alright number two is blackberry
balance what this is gonna do is help
you maintain balance between your work
life and professional a lot of people
have to carry two devices a blackberry
for work and probably some other Android
or iOS device or Windows Phone for
personal rooms hoping you can only carry
one don't see what this does is to kind
of segment your phone completely you can
have separate profiles like you manage
apps separately IT professionals can
manage just the business side of your
black bear you can set alerts for just
the business side of your blackberry
ever get flossers someone you can wipe
just a business side of the blackbird
the reason I'm most excited about it is
after work hours you can shut off that
whole part of the phone essentially it's
like having two separate phones you have
to worry about you know being out on the
date and seeing all your work emails
come in and getting all stressed and
worried about it you just turn it off
you can just have your personal phone
and sort of a phone that can do all
kinds of different stuff so I'm really
excited that RIM has done that it's a
really sort of ingenious feature that
should have been there from day one
essentially it's like a profile for
business and for leisure but it is
really neat something that folks have
carried a blackbird for a while and had
to carry more than one device they're
gonna be super excited about so that
brings us to number one can I get a
drumroll please real keyboards I'm so
excited to get a real keyboard on a
blackberry
I love the keyboard on the bold 9900
it's probably one of the best typing
experiences I've ever experienced but
unfortunately it was running on an
outdated blackberry operating system so
being able to actually get a real
keyboard that bold 9900 keyboard on a
touchscreen with a really up-to-date
feature
killer Ram dual-core processors and
black braids head
I am jazzed about for me there's really
no substitute for typing on a physical
keyboard like you have been using
on-screen keyboards for years since 2007
actually being able to get that real
keyboard love the clickety clack action
I cannot wait for I'm hoping that we're
gonna see the keyboard version of
blackberry 10 launched on the 30th and
it's going to be available for purchase
soon after cuz that is a phone for me I
can only envision myself carrying that
every day I would love to have that guy
in my pocket be able to get the best of
both worlds here the keyboard and get
the best of blackberry 10 experience so
what do you guys think do you agree with
my top 5 there are a ton of others I
could have put in there if you think I
missed one put your top 5 or put a
feature here most excited about the
obviously hundreds and probably
thousands of new features gonna be
coming to blackberry 10 I think rim can
actually pull this off and I think rim
could be successful if they can get
developers there there are a lot of
other great features totally redesigned
blackberry app world that's got movies
and music it actually looks like a real
app store are some of the other features
that I think are going to be killer in
blackberry 10 leave your comments down
below for now I'm John Rhett enger' from
