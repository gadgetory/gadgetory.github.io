lakers calm here this video's got a bit
of an old-school flair to it i'm
recording with the eyesight i wanted to
get a video up about the keynotes
quickly as possible so it's still fresh
in your mind and my mind and we can
start the debate as quickly as we could
so let's go ahead and get started here
this is the last macworld that Apple is
going to be attending and Steve Jobs was
nowhere to be seen I actually feel
Schiller took the stage and he started
by talking about I life not terribly
exciting and everybody expected the
keynotes really pick up there we
expected new mech minis imax you know
all myriad of other things a possible
netbook tablet all these things and
really mostly what we got software and a
new 17-inch macbook pro which we all
knew was coming anyway which looks
exactly like the macbooks and the
15-inch macbook pros it's nothing
terribly exciting so let's get started
and leaves discuss what was brought up
and got over and what's new coming out
of folks in cupertino so the first thing
you started talking about was ilife 09
I've got a few notes here set up missing
so the first product in I life daddy
started talking about was I photo it's
got this really cool new thing and it
called faces it actually uses
recognition software to detect
somebody's face so you tagged a face to
make a little box in it like that sort
of in facebook you type in the person's
name and they'll actually search through
all your photos to find that person's
name and tag it appropriately and you
can search for photos of jon rettinger
and they'll show up I don't know why you
pictures of me but if you do they would
show up right there and also when you
import a new picture of me or whomever
you have tagged it'll ask if that's that
person and you can say yes or no if it's
not you can't act with that person's new
name so it actually is a very cool
feature I can see that being handy let's
say you got a few buddies over and
you've got thousand pictures in your
iPhoto library and you're not sure you
know where your photos of you guys going
to Cancun were you can type in your
buddy's name boom our metallic Brandon
minimun hit enter you can see all the
pictures of them very cool and very easy
so they added in something else new
called places which essentially
geo-tagging to sort your photos so if
you took photos when you're in Paris you
can tag your photos and all your photos
repairs will show
nothing terribly exciting a
revolutionary there but it is a new
feature found in iPhoto 09 they also
added support for feedbacks and some new
filters are built-in nothing terribly
exciting he also added some new
slideshow themes I wasn't really excited
about it maybe you guys were I don't
really use slideshow very much but if
you do there are new slideshow themes
there and those teams will also now show
up on your iPhone so if you're looking
at your photos on your iPhone we've got
a theme synced bill show up do you guys
really show slides was on your iPhone I
usually just flick to the pictures when
I'm showing somebody but maybe it's
important to you and I am just way out
of the loop so started building a little
bit of momentum like okay he's getting
the software the boring stuff out of the
way and then he brought up I'm blue
iMovie 09 people were not happy with
iMovie 08 and it was pretty universally
it will receive missing out on a lot of
the feature that I am movie HD or iMovie
06 head so they're trying to fix that
with iMovie 09 visually it looks like
I'm movie oh wait my house got a ton of
new features here and I think a lot of
them were long overdue he admitted that
I movie await even did it live up to
some of the hype here so we've got a
precision editor you've got some
advanced drag and drop we've got dynamic
themes animated travel maps would
actually started what kind of look like
the old Indiana Jones movies or the new
Indiana Jones movie when you see the
little red line he travels all across
the globe to find the hole in kwara
whatever he's looking for when I you can
make those not expect that to be just
egregiously abused I was watching the
engadget stream and listening to the
folks at Mac tip pods cash tremont and
they made the same joke so I thought it
was funny sharing with you guys here
also their support for green screen
which is very cool or a white screen
behind me so you guys can see so you can
add your own effects behind it we'll see
how that works the next thing they
talked about was GarageBand essentially
what garage band is now is a musical
instrument tutor will actually teach you
how to play instruments they brought in
some big musical names but it'll teach
you how to play an extra guitar how to
play a piano and so forth I'm not
musically go musically inclined if I was
I'd probably want to learn from a person
instead of a computer but
if that teacher horn garage bands you
know now for you so okay now he's God
have gotten a sock we're out of the way
right he talked about iwork 09 and some
of the other stuff in there is it now
time for the hardware no then you
started talking about I work which is
Apple's answer to Microsoft Office
another little dry speech here but what
they added was the first one is keynote
so now there's a new keynote application
keynote is like PowerPoint there's a
keynote application now for your iphone
so you can view your keynote
presentations on your iPhone or you can
even control them from your iPhone and
it's a ninety-nine cents application
from the app store yeah not so impressed
so next thing I started talking about
was this new I work com there was a lot
of talk that apple would be taking their
ilife suite into the cloud and not
online but it turns out all that was was
I work com pany buddies familiar with
Google Docs essentially google docs now
but by Apple so you can upload a version
of your I work doc which is like a
Microsoft Word essentially upload it
anybody from a pc or mac can download it
they can look at it they edit online
they'll be notified when changes are
made and you can set it to be emailed to
you or email to the person that's
editing it it's just a collaboration
tool that's now done completely in the
cloud and by the cloud I just mean
online in cyberspace case you're not
familiar with the jargon nothing
terribly revolutionary it's in beta
right now actually the beta starts today
so if you're and I work user it's kind
of cool I don't see the need for it I've
been using products with mobileme I put
stuff in my public folder let people
pull it down from there and edit it
email it back I'm not terribly excited
about I were calm although it could
potentially be very cool in handy the
one nice thing about it though is it's
totally cross platforms people on PCs
now can have an iwork sort of work
station online so started building up or
said okay now is it getting more
exciting no slammed us with a mac box
set which is a nice deal but it's not
exciting certainly didn't think merited
time in a keynote so what the mac a box
set is iwork 09 I'll
I fo 9 and leopard 469 bucks it's
actually a pretty good deal considering
I work is ninety nine dollars and I love
is ninety nine dollars and for both of
those if you want to get a family pack
meeting you can put it on five machines
excuse me seventy nine dollars each and
the family pack is ninety nine dollars
so it's actually a pretty good deal with
this mega box set so the next thing you
talked about finally got a little bit of
hardware got very excited so you can
talk about the new mac mini redesigned
imac no 17-inch macbook pro that we all
knew was coming was very obviously going
to be happening but it does have some
cool feature so let's talk about the
17-inch macbook pro vide started
discussing it's got a backlit LED with
the 1920 x 1200 resolution 700 x 1
contrast ratio pretty nice the glass
trackpad found in the current macbook
pros and macbooks can have up to eight
gigs of memory all that's going to cost
an arm and a leg but if you want to you
can have it and it comes now with four
gigs of ram standard which is really
nice a single firewire 800 port you can
get up to a 2.93 gigahertz dual-core
processor and a 320 gigabyte hard drive
is standard so a lot of people were
complaining about the macbook pros least
professionals worth that the glare was
awful with this glossy screen it
couldn't use it outside they weren't
getting true colors really pissed off so
Apple is done date now the fifty-dollar
anti-glare option you're probably saying
50 bucks whatever for anti glare option
that sucks i'm not paying it well the
reason they're charging fifty dollar is
actually have to remove the entire glass
bezel and actually build it into the
screen so there's a little bit of extra
labor involved fifty bucks worth the tia
and your professional and you're buying
a machine that cost as much probably not
gonna break your bank but at least now
you have a choice so the big thing and
probably the biggest bit of news to come
out of the keynote was the new battery
lasts up to eight hours and can be
charged 1,000 times it's not removable
however and the lifespan got extended up
to five years so you get a much longer
battery life not removable however so if
you're traveling on an airplane for
longer than
eight hours you're going to be in
trouble so what do usually want to talk
about this for a minute here what do you
guys think about non-removable battery
even though it's got this extreme long
battery life you can charge it for five
years finite I'm going to keep the
laptop for that long if your
professional user you probably upgrade
pretty regularly but is it worth it to
you you know are you giving up too much
to get a non-removable battery you know
up to you guys see what you think
personally I don't mind having down a
movable battery I've never bought a
second battery for a laptop I've never
replace the battery on a flight but I'm
not a you know professional that uses a
macbook pro for my life I'm not a
graphic designer I'm not a professional
video editor you know so that's never
been easier for me but for you guys that
are is that an issue for you the price
the same as before and it's going to
ship the end of January so not readily
available like ilife and iwork are those
actually will be shipping out today so
you can find picking up for apple store
tomorrow or probably even download them
so next thing I started talking about
all right we got to the hardware really
exciting here comes the big stuff here
comes the netbook here comes a tablet
please here Calise comes a mac mini nope
here comes iTunes so most songs on
iTunes were 99 cents we now have a
three-tier pricing system 69 cents 99
cents and a dollar twenty-nine if we're
in the UK prices are obviously gonna be
different or if you're in Europe did
prices are gonna be different or
anywhere else in the world Australia
wherever else you guys might be so
itunes was famous for having this drm
and what drm essentially means is the
songs are restricted you can only play
them on an ipod you can't move them
elsewhere it's somebody else's computer
it just it's digitally restricted music
essentially so Apple has been
progressively getting rid of that and
they now finally have almost gotten rid
of all the drm 8 million songs are now
drm free today and by the end of q1
which is March would be 10 million songs
drm free which is actually very cool so
you can bring your music now from the
download on iTunes to another mp3 player
you can give them to a friends to listen
to you can put them on your zune if
you're foolish enough to buy one you can
put them on whatever player you guys
choose
and it really gives you freedom as a
consumer he bought the music you should
have the right to do as you choose with
it as long as you're not distributing it
so that's pretty cool the next thing
they started talking about was the
iphone here comes some cool for the
iphone we're finally getting copy and
paste mms something all we got was 3g
downloading of itunes music you're no
longer have to be tethered to a Wi-Fi
connection or wireless hotspot you can
now download music dress me from 33 I
don't care I've probably downloaded for
songs total from the itunes music store
on the iphone i think most of those i
download just to show you guys I was not
terribly excited so at this point it's
getting a little bit late that you're
okay they got the breaks with out of the
way here comes the big stuff nope it
brought out some musical artists to play
for you and that was the end of it there
wasn't a one more thing Steve didn't
come out saying look at me I'm okay you
can see actually the worst the keynote
got further down the stock price went
still didn't do a bad job I think he did
the best of what he had to work with but
did not have much to work with you can
almost see why Apple was getting out of
macworld here they couldn't keep up with
their own product development cycle they
have expected to be wowed or to wow
people every year and just couldn't do
it anymore it's clearly a case
expectations have been so built up by
blogs and I'm guilty of that too that it
was bound feet of disappointment here
and it certainly was considering it was
almost all software stuff so what do you
guys think about Mac world 2009 what
were your thoughts on it did you enjoy
it did you not enjoy it were you
enthusiastic book pro do you not care
are you pissed that you're not getting a
new mac mini or a new iMac or not
getting Intel's i7 core i7 chip in an
imac you know what you guys think so
want to leave this up to you and
hopefully start a nice discussion BTW
