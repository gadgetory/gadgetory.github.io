from TechnoBuffalo here with a much
requested unboxing of the beats by dre
studio headphones these headphones are
some of the top-of-the-line
they offer really advanced noise
canceling capability they've got
oversized speakers and amplifiers built
in and it supposedly offer just
unmatched audio fidelity so I'm really
excited to get my hands on these and
take a look this was sent by the folks
at Monza for review I got the box turned
upside down to cover up some shipping
information let's go ahead and dig in
this is gonna run you about three
hundred and fifty dollars from monster's
website although Amazon on another such
retailer you may be able to find a
little better deals let's go ahead and
open up so here we've got it all sound
go ahead and pull the Box off to the
side and a very large box for headphones
you've got the beats by dre on the front
monster branding Plano if you did a
studio version there are other less
expensive versions picture of it on the
left it tells you a little bit about it
all about the sound the beats are
precision engineered to reveal the full
sound of your music including the most
sonic 'l damar ting rock hip hop and R&amp;amp;B
natural fit with beats you feel the
music not the headphones ready for
iphone tells you a little bit of what's
included but we'll see that in a minute
and step into the studio let's go ahead
and dig in and see what we got in here
this can be picked up too I believe at a
Best Buy or other big-box retailers
close you guys have followed me you know
I'm a sucker for a good unboxing
experience so let's see how monster did
here it's like it's got a sleeve that
slides out so that's where the black and
red theme throughout the box sleeve just
comes off beats by dre let's go ahead
and see how this opens up it's like
there's actually a little towel on the
side you pull up and it goes off a lot
of stuff crammed in this box so this
looks to be just the case or maybe the
headphones are in there let's go ahead
and take a look and if those you guys
that are looking for only a very high
quality audio sound and real natural
sounding the beats by dre are supposedly
one of the better ones in the market I'm
very curious to get my ears wrapped
around them and see if they live up to
the hype so the headphones are actually
in there I'll take a look at those in
just a moment let's see what else comes
in the box lift this up we've got looks
like they are battery powered by appears
to be one double-a so you've got a bit
of information start here beats by dre
QuickStart guide and warranty
information we got some sort of cleaning
cloth in there as well on the other side
looks like just some getting started and
welcome to the world of monster let's go
ahead and see what else we have in here
looks like we've got a audio cable it's
like three-and-a-half millimeter
three-and-a-half millimeter and I think
we've got another audio cable
three-and-a-half millimeter
three-and-a-half millimeter so it goes
it depends on what color you're looking
for we've got a click a studio adapter
for some other sort of audio inputs and
you've got a much larger adapter here
for actually studio recording go ahead
inspect you
killing myself here we'll use the big ol
knife to get that out there we go you
can take a look at that but after all
that work we'll put it back in and of
course just the battery let's take a
look at the headsets themselves and I'll
take a look at the case they fold up
pretty compactly there's a decent amount
of cushioning I can tell right off the
bat for the ear so they're not going to
hurt your ear these new offers suppose
the advanced noise cancelling so
listening to these on an airplane will
cancel out all that baby crying that you
need it's like they they swivel a little
bit get adjust for your head size on the
side you have a pull-out ribbon let's
see if it's labels for left and right it
looks like it is so there's a card in
there and an L right there and let's see
how they look on and I'm probably
screaming this is how you guys are gonna
look rockin the beats by dre see me
bumpin with the music um oh there's any
music playing I just tried them on I can
immediately hear that it's keeping a lot
of noise out that's without sort of the
noise canceling power running through it
so I'm very curious to get my hands on
these things and see how they work again
I'm probably screaming at the camera I'm
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo and
stay tuned to the YouTube channel and
technical Buffalo for the full review of
the beats by dre I'll put some
information in the I guess underbar tao
in case you're interested I'll see you
next video
