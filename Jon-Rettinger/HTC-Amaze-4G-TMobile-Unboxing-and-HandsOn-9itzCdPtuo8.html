TechnoBuffalo comm and the nice folks at
t-mobile USA we're kind enough to send
us not one but two of their newest
Android cell phones the galaxy s2 from
Samsung and the Amaze 4G from HTC we're
going to start on the left
all right it's the Amaze for to you from
t-mobile and HTC they launched this
phone back at mobilize in San Francisco
Emily price was on hand and check the
phone out and it will be available for
pre-order online October 10th
hit retail stores on October 12th to
59.99 on contract after rebate so a very
high-end high tier price tag now that's
still the expected price I suppose that
could change by the 12th I'm filming
this on the 7th but that's what they're
saying to $59.99 on contract after
rebate thanks to the folks at t-mobile
PR for lending us this phone oh thanks
to me for getting that thing open device
itself powered up while we check out
what else is in the box there we go
it's like these phones have so many
features now that the stickers instead
of these 50 blank stickers or some of
them used to say like you know don't
text a driver ever now they have like
all the different things like this
buttons for this and that buttons for
that and this thing over here is where
the sound comes out you know you gotta
educate people whatever you can in the
black start guide recycling voucher or
label recycle your old phones all your
old gadgets we've done them don't throw
them in the garbage where they wind up
in a landfill recycle them so that
they're disposed of properly and so that
certain of the bits and parts can be
reused you also get a USB cable and your
charging adapter your AC adapter awesome
no headphones I'm getting all kinds of
messages though no headphones or
anything like that with this phone not
like the HTC Rhyme that came out
recently where you get like the tangle
free earbuds in the charm and the
docking station and now you buy a super
phone you get a super phone that's it
it's a nice nice nice feeling device and
it reminds me a little bit of this
Asian XE which I just happened to have
of course Teemo will already carries the
sensation but like the sensation XE this
is not a u.s. bound phone this is a
unlock Wow lot of spam blowing me up no
interesting anyway alright the phone
itself 4.3 inch qHD super LED display
and we use all this stuff yes set up
accounts later 4.3 inch qHD Super LCD
display so 960 by 540 you've got a
front-facing camera as well as a rear 8
megapixel camera autofocus dual LED
flash all the new HTC camera software
the zero shutter lag they call it for
fast reloading of your of your camera
and the FAL different things smirk shot
and perfect pics and clear shot a share
all the stuff that we saw debuted in the
u.s. on the the mytouch 4G slide also
the front camera 2 megapixel I forgot to
mention that also full 1080p video
recording
it's a 4G phone of course and it's one
of the first devices to support t-mobile
USA's HSPA+ 42 network so theoretical
maximum speeds of 42 megabits per second
is that why the boats on fire maybe
because comes a fast I don't know you're
not going to get 42 but you can get
bursts I've been hearing I think up to
around 20 so I'll have to try that out
you also on this phone get the latest
versions of Android Gingerbread and HTC
Sense will go into the settings here go
about phone software so 2.3.4 and as she
said HTC Sense the readout oh so yeah
almost the the newest version we're not
the exact newest version almost the
newest versions you can see the 4G
indicators lit up there of course you
have Wi-Fi on the device as well and
we'll go back for a second take a look
at the apps here and
so you get this T Mobile apps specialty
mobile features or bloatware whatever
you want to call it t-mobile male name
ID t-bolt TV HD quick is pre-installed
Zinio readers pre-installed I saw
slacker radio pre-installed as well
let's check out mobile HD here taking a
little tour around the phone while this
is going on of course the display we
talked about 4.3 inches multi-touch
what's not multi-touch these days for
capacitive touch menu buttons on the
bottom on the Left spine you've got your
microUSB charging or syncing and
charging port on the top three nine
millimeter audio jack the power lock
switch on the right spine you've got a
rocker switch for volume and whatnot and
then you've got two additional buttons
presumably for the camera we'll check
those out in a second on the bottom
nothing going on is your battery cover
latch which I will stay away from unless
something terrible happens and on the
back your camera again eight megapixel
autofocus dual LED flash all those
features that I talked about a second
ago alright let's check out a t-mobile
TV here let's see what's going on on
ESPN mobile right now 30-day trial sure
did you pay extra for everything I
wanted ESPN mobile
all right we'll talk about the TV shelf
I mentioned the film supports DLNA and
HDMI mirroring you have to get an
optional adapter but so you can send the
content from this device out to a
big-screen TV set or monitor via HDMI
it's got a 16 gigs of internal memory
and a microSD card slot so officially
supports up to 48 gigs and they
mentioned this the processor today
Qualcomm s3 they renamed their
snapdragon line this year so this is an
s3 it's a 1.5 gig dual-core CPU and then
you've got your Wi-Fi your Bluetooth all
that stuff and it's a world phone
quad-band GSM and like I said 4G via the
HSPA+ 42 which maybe I should have
turned off my nectar to Wi-Fi before I
checked the load up the TV here well I
give this a minute though see if it
comes on phone feels really nice in the
hand I've been in you know I've always
been impressed by HTC's build quality of
the hardware and now this phone it's a
nice mix of you know it's plastic bits
here but it feels solid I don't know if
I would call this hte exactly rather
pixelated yeah so this is live only this
is live TV and a little bit pixelated
for sure let's try something else
Saturday morning TV what's that all
about now it can Saturday morning TV
actually be live on a Friday afternoon
yeah
also a little pixelated but you know I
don't know kind of cool I guess the Pens
- yeah they charge if then you can go on
demand
I would assume these would be slightly
better quality is it on demand and
that's feeling i watch the whole episode
of 30 rock I am cornered so see what
happens if I watch a full episode of 30
rock okay remember when these things
used to just be phones and then they had
some of them had cameras and that was
like whoa now I'm watching on-demand
episodes of dirty Rock Chuck just the
Chairman meanwhile my spam was blown up
in the background you thought you were
just getting an unboxing you didn't know
we were gonna sit around waiting for old
TV shows to rerun rerunning anything of
that show what's happening anybody out
there
no Roger no rerun no rent yeah anyway
that's a great show but I was saying the
build quality of the HTC phones you know
I've always liked that I like their
current design language there's that one
device recently the the radar I got to
check out that isn't out yet I wasn't so
thrilled with the design language in
that one had kind of like a double chin
but this phone the sensation XE I just
showed you the Titan certainly I'll
really digging the look and feel of
those devices you know what I don't
really want to wait for this anymore so
we're gonna go back to the home screen
and we're gonna see what these buttons
do on top let's I'm guessing camera and
camcorder but let's see the first one is
bigger it has no red stripe on it so
let's press it and it's the camera learn
more about the advanced camera features
now right now say button does nothing oh
yes did it launched the camcorder
I got a little vibrational feedback
Allah haptics but took a while
so it's not a zero lag camcorder it's a
well let's not really shutter lag or
time with over time a launch time so
your let's test up this your leg go go
that's I mean yeah that's fast that's
great I mean I'm taking the same picture
of her over again so my pictures are
gonna be worth a dime but that is really
fast
that's terrific well there you go I'm
sold it's the HTC Amaze 4G I better be
sold quick because it's 260 bucks which
is a lot for a cell phone well you know
you get a lot of cell phone here
the qHD display the 4G the dual-core
snapdragon s3 the a megapixel camera
that reloads so fast all that stuff
although apparently I've dropped down to
2g now anyway t-mobile HTC the amaze
available for pre-order online October
10th in stores October 12th we'll have
much much more on this phone maybe I'll
send this one to Mike since he's our at
imaging expert get him one of these
these new HTC phones see what he thinks
is the the camera
that would be a good idea wouldn't it it
should do that much much more
TechnoBuffalo and don't forget we will
be well I won't but John and Ralph and
Mike will be down at CTA San Diego
starting October 11th for all the news
coming out of the show apparently
they're not going to do the Samsung
unpacked thing anymore but I hopefully
there'll be some other interesting news
coming out of show maybe from HTC you
never know so stay tuned for that so
next time my name is Noah thanks for
watching and thanks again to t-mobile PR
for loaning us this device okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
