product from Apple available in two
colors either a white or Space Gray not
working right now in this demo and
surrounded by 40 or 50 people this is
the latest product from Apple it's a
smart speaker that really heavy emphasis
on music that's what Apple was really
emphasizing here just saying music
focused speaker as opposed to going to
sound awesome but also the smart home
stuff here's what you've got to know at
least on the music side it's got a seven
tweeter array it's got a four inch
woofer and throughout seven inches tall
and it looks like a cylinder with some
mesh around it on top again I'm sort of
an illuminated LEDs it's going to show
you the Siri logo and kind of move as
you talk to it we can't hear anything
here so I don't know a good at sound
Apple at a really fancy demo but
supposedly the audio is going to sound
really good it sort of spatially aware
no matter where you put it it will know
and it will adjust the speaker thanks
for the audio so that's whether you put
in a corner whether I put in the center
of your room or pair with a few others
it'll work composedly very well but it
does work only going to work with the 40
or so million songs on Apple music so if
you rely solely on Spotify or another
service you're going to be out of luck
here and of course all the smart stuff
will work as well as simple hey Siri or
bring up controls for your home kid
naval devices you can't these questions
you could send messages you can ask
normal smart assistant type stuff the
big selling point versus day at Google
home or an Amazon echo supposedly music
fidelity which unfortunately again we
don't know here but we will know in
December when the ships about three
hundred and fifty bucks so the guys
think about home Claud are you going to
wait until December to finally get your
first smart speaker I've been waiting
for something from Apple
I really have no real interest you've
got another set of speakers I want to
what you guys think we're going to
comments down below and let me know what
you think about the latest home pod well
or what you think about the name I'll
take investor I thought the name was
going to be I thought Apple speaker
would have been a boring name anyway
we've got a comment down below let us
know what you think until next time I'm
