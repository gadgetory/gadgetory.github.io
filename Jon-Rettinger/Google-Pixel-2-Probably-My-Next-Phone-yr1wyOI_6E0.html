over the year I love the phone I think
the software is incredible the hardware
is awesome but like if we can be honest
with each other the design of the phone
itself
I don't think age all that well that big
old Jay Leno chin at the bottom without
any buttons there just doesn't look like
a modern smartphone despite it
performing and still being one of the
best smartphones out it looks like
though the pixel 2 is going to get a bit
of a makeover I want to talk about that
on this episode of TV news so first a
code name because makes it sound more
like a like a James Bond movie than a
phone Taemin cave kayyy Taemin some
something like that so if you've also
been watching some the reviews on HTC u
11 the other flagship feature there is
feasible I'm squeezing my side
squeezable sides that make it do certain
actions the squeezable sides are going
to be parts of pixel to probably when
the flagship features you probably say
in yourself
so I guess HTC is also making this new
pixel and the answer is no LG will
allegedly be making the phone but
they're just kind of aping that that's
feasible thing and the squeegee squeeze
eNOS will be integrated allegedly again
with Google assistant so you can squeeze
it pull her up and ask your questions
and ever make appointments or after what
your favorite restaurant is or find a
gift jiff
don't yell at me for you and addressing
like I said the biggest I've been
negative on the pixel is the design it's
going to be LG g6 inspire still have a
two to one aspect ratio rounded corners
edge to edge AMOLED panel so you should
get that I just calling it a pin just
plain oh that's a samsung term but like
there's very little bezels and it should
come in at about a six inch screen so
not a tiny phone so being made by LG
it'll have the LG fingerprint sensor
located in the back it should also get
an always-on display which is quad my
favorite feature of something like a g6
what we've got with the galaxy s 8 and
si plus it should be coming later this
year and we're already middle of July so
not that many months left we should see
Android Oh hit in a few months well so I
would guess probably like August
September ish around the same timeframe
we see the note come we should see the
pixel - we don't know colors I'm hoping
for a pretty baller blue to make its way
down we've seen some
color options red and black so that kind
of stuff it looks like a better looking
phone so we know some stuff don't know
some stuff we do know is I am damn
excited for the pixel to you guys
yelling where's my hands all the
time but I'm excited and that's just me
and how I talk so pixel - would you buy
one for me it's gonna depend on price
that sort of larger phone it's going to
compete squarely against the si+ even
the LG's own g6 the Note 8 there's a ton
of competition the new iPhone coming out
it's harder and harder to differentiate
yourselves a smartphone manufacturer but
the pixel looks to be a pretty solid
phone but is it the phone for you does
it need one feature to get you to buy it
leave a comments down below and let me
know before I jump out this isn't an ad
rating just kind of a company that I'm
working with I want to tell you a little
bit about a new hardware and software
thing coming out called Babylon I'm
associated with a company it's idea that
I've loved the passion about for a
really long time it's coming to fruition
so it's on IndieGoGo link to it down
below potentially what they're trying to
do is take your voice in your voice
profile so everything about that so your
throat pattern so essentially your cheek
flaps - how your lips move they're
taking all of that out into a voice
profile of synthesizing it digitally and
taking that same profile and adding it
different languages you can hear
yourself big Chinese you could speak
Spanish in your actual voice technology
kelps appears to take an actor's voice
and they do dubbing for movies in other
languages you can still have that actual
actors voice that can make digital
assistants like City and Google and
Alice and more realistic it's awesome
it's cutting edge and it really is a
future so check them out down below so
next time I'm Joe and Jack executive
buffle hope you guys enjoyed episode G
