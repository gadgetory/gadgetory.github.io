from technobuffalo and this is my very
first official video for the john for
lakers channel and i'm very excited yeah
recently there's been a lot of talk
about these samsung galaxy tab in the
galaxy tab of course is samsung's first
tablet from the galaxy line in other
words it's the samsung galaxy tablet
without the l ET pam galaxy tab genius
right there but a little bit lazy as far
as creative naming goes the tab runs
android 2.2 with TouchWiz three pointer
what can I say Samsung they like to
touch wiz it's got a 1 gigahertz a a
processor a four thousand million power
battery 3g bluetooth and Wi-Fi it's got
a front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera for
video calling very very nice in a back
camera that's 3 megapixels with a flash
and since it's a tablet the display
that's where it's at mm-hmm the galaxy
tab has a 7-inch TFT LCD display with a
resolution of 1024 x 600 you go girl no
word on pricing in the US yet but the
galaxy tab will be coming as a 16 or 32
gigabyte model with a microSD expansion
of up to 32 gigabytes of additional
storage very nice something the galaxy
tab can do is voice calling however
there is no earpiece which makes sense
as it'll be quite awkward to hold it
like you would a phone instead there's a
speakerphone or Bluetooth option what
can I say when life gives you lemons you
make lemonade or you can go buy some I
think that's easier do whatever you want
that your lemons be your own boss power
to the people now I know what you're
thinking hey there hey that looks like
an oversized Samsung Galaxy S or what's
going on where's jon rettinger and in
short yes pretty much an oversized
samsung galaxy s and as for John he's
probably playing starcraft 2 or
partaking and other John render related
activities oversized version of
something sound familiar to anyone when
the iPad came out a bunch of people were
like why Apple why why did you name in
SJ feminine hygiene product while be
gazed upon this oversized and giant ipod
touch which is true to a certain extent
but the iPad offered a lot of new and
modified features which made it its own
thing the galaxy tab does the same thing
but the software is not mature enough to
make it more like a tablet and less like
a phone I'm sure somewhere down the line
android will start implementing more
tablet like features as more Android
tablets are released hopefully maybe
possibly perchance ah arguably the
galaxy tab does more than the iPad such
as video conferencing picture-taking web
browsing with flash support and so on so
is the galaxy tab better than the iPad
tough call I think the same thing as if
you were to ask is the samsung captivate
better than the iphone for android OS
versus iOS apples vs. oranges cats vs
dogs chocolate cake vs. cheesecake take
your pick that is of course unless you
don't like cake of any kind in which
case why cake is so delicious apple and
full of yum yums mmm as of now the
galaxy tab is sort of like a beta
product so for those of you who are
interested in picking up an Android
tablet I suggest away for the next one
with a more solid and updated android
firmware with more tablet orientated
features well that's it for today's
video make sure you check out
TechnoBuffalo com for more technology
related stuff and I'll see you guys in
the next video lettuce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
