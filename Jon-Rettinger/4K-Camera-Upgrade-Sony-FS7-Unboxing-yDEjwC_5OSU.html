TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing that we
probably do once to twice a decade we
got new camera gear to take a look at
what you've got here is the sony fs7 or
what its mother called it the PX w FS 7
this is a new 4k camera from Sony I
almost feel bad having our outgoing c100
record this it's like asking it to
record its own funeral I will go ahead
and dig in talk to you a little bit
about the camera we'll set it up and
I'll show you at the end of the video
what some footage looks like totally
unconnected when we picked up the c100 a
couple years ago we knew 4k was coming
but there was anything out there that
was affordable and also was kind of
standardized so when Sony announced the
FS Evan it seemed like the ideal time to
jump into 4k now we're going to upload
everything in 4k but it's like being
able to have more megapixels it gives us
more flexibility but we do in the videos
we can do some more zooms and that kind
of stuff so go ahead and open it up
you've got some old-school styrofoam
sitting right here on top and a lot of
accessories here we've got a kind of
large manual you've got a remote control
and you've got inside of there is a disc
for the manual but of course you can
just download that if you want because
who uses CD drives anymore we've got a
battery with LED indicator on it already
comes partly charged it's got four total
lights on it from empty to full
definitely going to need that also is a
bit of surprise if you stay tuned into
the video in addition to showing you two
sample footage also show you some of the
other gear that we picked up we're going
to be using here you've got just your a
wall adapter I assume one of these
cables will be the other side of that
adapter which is right here we've got a
power charger for that wall adapter and
also a power cord for the battery
charger to show you in a minute you can
actually plug the camera into the
battery charger it's kind of neat so
just two simple chords we've got some of
these things see what those do we've got
some mounting brackets it looks like as
well all that stuff off to the side pull
off the tops IRA foam I haven't unboxed
something with this much styrofoam since
my very first unboxing which was the
santa rosa macbook pro
and inside this is where the action
happens as far as I'm concerned I'll
leave this sexy little guy until the end
this is the grip but this grip is kind
of interesting can also serves as a
wired remote of sorts for the camera so
go ahead open this up and I'll show you
so as you're recording you can actually
hold this down hold the camera on on one
side and this plugs directly into
control it you've got a ton of controls
here of course including your start/stop
you've got a five-way joystick your
release if you want to release it and
all kinds of other customizable options
and this appears with the relatively
thick threaded screw so push all of that
off to the side and I guess all screws
are probably surrounded by nature what
else we're going to have we've got this
is kind of interesting I don't usually
spend much time on battery chargers Sony
includes a lot of stuff in this pack so
this is a battery charger obviously you
can plug in the battery to charge it but
you can also plug it into the camera as
well while it's charging so if you
aren't traveling you want to care just
want that you can carry this instead of
carrying that separate power adapter but
you've got both options in there this
large guy is the viewfinder and there's
a lot of pieces put together in this
cameron of course we'll put all this
together on film for you well time-lapse
it up so you can have to spend all the
time putting together but go ahead and
pull this tape up and I'll show you what
this can do so standard sort of
viewfinder for an older camera go ahead
and peek on and you can see stuff also
open it up and then there is give you
your normal LCD viewfinder put this on
top of it and if you're you know in the
sunny conditions or something you can
look in and actually see it through the
eye Cup and it shows you a lot of stuff
here it will show you zebra and all
kinds of other speaking options so
there's that push that stuff off to the
side
now what I have been waiting for and
probably the reason you are here here is
the fs7 push this box off to the side
and take a look at the new TechnoBuffalo
main camera we also picked up and we do
a separate unboxing of an a7 s as our B
cam alright so here is the body to the
fs7 it looks like there is just a lot
going on here
give your just a real quick highlight on
what's on the camera of course we'll
cover much more about it you've got
control for both of your XLR which live
here on the other side you've got two
SDI outs underneath there you've got
HDMI obviously where your battery is
going to live where your media is going
to be and you're probably going to say
hey John what kind of SD cards it's
going to take and it's sony sony loves
product or a format so it takes q XD
cards it'll take two of them right there
we've got one we got a 64 gig variant
right here it also does have a utility
esteem what that means is you can save
all your user settings on it you go to
another FSM and you can pop that in and
be good to go it's got a micro USB port
for a software updates and also get the
media off the camera if you don't have a
card reader I will say the card that we
bought actually came with an adapter so
free interested that's going to be there
as well and of course you've got your
handle grip
I've got spot for boom mic you've got a
hot shoe and the viewfinder that we
showed earlier goes right into there
just a lot of options and of course the
lenses uses the e-mount lens in system
we bought a few lenses we're going to
use some of our old Canon lenses with a
meta bones adapter in addition some
lenses we just bought so you've got the
Zeiss alpha 24 to 70 millimeter we also
have a 55 millimeter that we picked up
and a 16 to 35 sort of been a long time
coming for us upgrade our camera
equipment we don't do this very often
you know every six years or so so I'm
really excited take a look at this so we
got a lot of pieces sort of strong out
here on the desk let me go ahead and
build the camera and again will show
some footage what this looks like
totally unedited and a sneak peek at
some of the other equipment that we've
got we're gonna be using here
you stopped the video just real fast to
thank our friends and good peeps at
