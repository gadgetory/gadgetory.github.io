unboxing the LG G pad 8.3 I saw this in
Germany when I was at Aoife and it was
pretty cool so let's check it out okay
guys so here is the box for the LG G pad
8.3 it says don't accept it the seals
broken but too bad I already broke the
seal so let's get in here this is the 16
gigabyte black model the 8.3 this is
actually really cool tablet so here's
the tablet they put it right out front
and center for you this is sort of a a
little bit of a brushed look to the back
I like this sort of two-tone thing
happening here it's very very nice got a
couple of speakers but before we really
get into this let's look at what else is
in the box so of course you have your
standard micro USB charging syncing
cable and your wall wart so pretty
simple stuff and then just this a little
Quick Start Guide and that's the end
there's nothing else it's a pretty
pretty barren box but you know honestly
that's not too bad I like simple things
so let's move on and take a look at the
tablet so here is the G pad 8.3 and
there is our very lovely film right off
the top of it is a delightful device so
obviously the 8.3 indicates how big the
screen is it is an eight point three
inch screen 1920 by 1200 resolution
that's 273 PPI if you were curious it's
got a front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera
and on the back it's got a five
megapixel shooter so pretty standard
stuff that we've seen also has a slot
right here for your microSD you can
expand that storage kind of nice big fan
of that and then like I said this is a
16 gig Wi-Fi model it's got a quad core
processor onboard Snapdragon 600 this is
a 1.7 gigahertz quad-core processor so
you're gonna have a lot of speed on this
on this delightful little bad boy
honestly really nice in hand it's it
doesn't feel too heavy but it also
doesn't it doesn't feel chunky
it's it's pretty good I actually really
liked the way that the LG G pad is sort
of designed obviously LG makes gorgeous
screens and they have some really cool
features in their custom software this
is running Android 4.2.2 so not Android
4.3 obviously not even kicked at because
it gets not out yet but I'm sure at some
point hopefully LG will put the newest
version of Android on this device so you
can see we're gonna have to walk through
all of our setup and everything but
generally speaking you've got your
Android set up a little bit of holo
happening there and that's pretty much
it that's what we have right now the
battery capacity is 4600 milliamp hour
battery so you're gonna get some nice
battery life out of this but definitely
a very nice at first glance first
impressions why is a very nice solid
device that we're really excited to
review here so if you have any questions
