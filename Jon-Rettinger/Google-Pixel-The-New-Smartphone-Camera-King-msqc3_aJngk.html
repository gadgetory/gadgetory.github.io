from TechnoBuffalo and today we're going
to be doing a quick camera test and look
at the new Google pixel phone it got the
highest DxO rating as Google was touting
very proudly their keynote and so we're
gonna be testing that seeing if it lives
up to all the hype and briefly take a
look at how it stacks up against some of
the competition let's go ahead an get
started so firstly specs on the back
we're rocking a 12 megapixel F 2.0
camera using phase detection and laser
autofocus it also is a dual LED dual
tone flash it's a one by two point three
inch sensor and has a one point five
five micron pixel size and if you're
wondering that is a slightly larger
pixel size than some of its competitors
like the Samsung Galaxy s7 in terms of
camera UI it's pretty much what we've
come to expect from previous Nexus phone
so nothing too crazy here it's very
simple and it works when looking at
actual image quality the pixel does a
really really good job with sharpness
and resolution not just resolution in
the sense of over sharpening but
actually keeping detail and things like
trees and leaves it makes you feel
confident that if you need to crop in a
little bit every now and then to Reese
or to frame a photo you can get away
with it pretty easily when doing
side-by-side comparisons with the
Samsung Galaxy s7 in the iPhone 7 it's
not a head and shoulders above but I can
see why some people believe it is a
sharper camera the pixel also performed
very well in low-light with low noise
and good high detail given the extreme
lighting conditions so many factors go
into creating a good image it's really
hard to say but I'm gonna guess this has
something to do with the 1.5 5 micron
pixels which are slightly bigger than
the Samsung as far as we know quickly
moving on to video we get great 30
frames per second 4k video here
everything looks really good as can be
expected from most phones nowadays we
did notice some artifacting and very
very extreme situations with patterns
and moire which is to be expected one of
my favorite features however is the 120
frames per second that you can get in
1080p we don't even get this in some
full DSLR cameras or cinema cameras so
to have this in a cell phone is a really
fun awesome feature and everything
obviously is much cooler in slow motion
so that pixel peeping those are really
my first impressions on the pixels
camera and kind of how it stacks up
roughly against something like the
iPhone or s7 I mainly did it so you guys
could get full
images to compare yourself so please
click the link down below please go
ahead and form your own opinions I'm
very curious to hear them so leave them
in the comment down below I really don't
have a preference as usual I think most
phone cameras nowadays are so good that
you can sort of pick them apart but on a
level that doesn't really affect the
majority of us in day-to-day usage but
let me know again what you think in the
comments down below give us a thumbs up
if you like this video hit subscribe and
I'll see you in the next one thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
