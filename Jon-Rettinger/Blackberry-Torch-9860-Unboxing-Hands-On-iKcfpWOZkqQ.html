from TechnoBuffalo here not only I'm not
hypnotizing you at the spinning fan I am
also unboxing one of the latest
blackberries to come out of Waterloo
this is the torch 9850 let's go ahead
hack on in and see if it can illuminate
the way to your pocket making a
triumphant return is the obligatory
big-ass knife here it is and all of its
unnecessary gratuitousness this 9860 is
OAM that means no carrier on it and it
comes courtesy of the folks at Negri
electronics that's where generally we
get all of our unlocked giveaway items
and where all of our unlocked phones
come that we review so let's go ahead
and take a look at the box it's black it
says blackberry there's nothing on the
side without certain that carrier flare
these boxes get very boring got some
stuff on the side and some of the old
business on the back blah blah let's go
ahead and hack on in I'm happy to use
the obligatory knife again I suppose by
using the obligatory knife also has to
make it obligatory joke about not
cutting my finger off so let's try it
again
ah alright peel off the plastic this is
the GSM version so it'll work on AT&amp;amp;T or
Rogers if you're in Canada on their
HSPA+ network or any other carriers that
have compatible 3G or 4G or 4G if ever
you want to call it networks this is
available though in the CDMA variants on
Verizon and Sprint in fact my chrome
actually reviewed the Sprint version of
it
I'll put link down to that down below go
ahead and pull out of the box there it
is feels pretty decent in the hand push
it out to the side t also we're gonna
get I'm guessing is gonna be a battery
and a wall charger and some books which
no one's gonna read so headphones with
microphone yeh battery the bane of my
existence the J
em one battery this thing is awful the
same battery that's used in the 9900
they supposedly going to get four point
seven hours of talktime on this although
it's extremely doubtful it's 1230
milliamp hours wall charger microUSB
cable alright let's go ahead and push
all this stuff in the box now let's see
look at the phone here is the phone you
zoom on it a little bit come on closer
hey there alright so there we go alright
cuz I know you guys love stickers on
here I'm gonna go ahead and eat that on
there not again go ahead and peel that
sucker off do the same thing here on the
back and I'll go ahead pop in the
battery first let's go ahead and pull
off back and I'll let it boot up and
I'll talk about it it's inside a metal
back certainly has a much higher quality
feel than other devices we've seen sim
card obviously go in there micros D
Kardos or micro SD card rather also go
in there look like the OEM version
actually shipped with one though so
through that in my I'm not gonna popping
some cry right now put on back hopefully
can do this in one shot boom and I did
alright let's power it on let's talk
about this guy because there's an
interesting things here hopefully
there's enough juice to make this thing
work and it looks like there is okay so
the torch 98 6 t it's mostly just a big
screen on that big screen is 3.7 inches
with a resolution of 800 by 480
I mentioned the battery life talked
about that probably in the review from a
size and weight standpoint four point
seven two by two point four four five
point four five and weighs 4.7 six
ounces if you kept track of all that
it's pretty thin phone actually even
with the battery in it feels really good
in the hands very very light camera
lives on back five megapixel camera four
times digital zoom flash HD video
recording at 720p there's a flash this
guy will actually have autofocus you
don't have autofocus on
Bold 9900 memory it's got 4 gigs
internal of course you can up that with
a 32 gig CAD it's got 768 megabytes of
RAM and it's been powered by a 1.2
Gerrits single core processor and there
are it just put it up there put it up an
older blackberry or OS 6 buck for you it
takes forever this one is actually
relatively quick alright so see what we
got here
proximity sensor typical array of
Blackbird buttons these are physical
pushy clicky non capacitive buttons got
your home button your BlackBerry button
5 way optical trackpad you can push in
back button and call any button on the
left hand side pill on this back I know
just going to know you folks ha
the metal is a bit of soft touch feel to
it really actually feels very nice in
the hands on the left hand side there is
the micro USB charging port right in the
middle which is great that it's in the
middle you want to put this thing in
dock because you have to charge the
battery so I'm guessing it's going to
suck as badly as the 9900 you can also
sync it with that port a microphone port
on the bottom on the right hand side
hitting like very stealthily really hard
to find is volume rockers so that is
there think there is there's a hard
button there which you can use even if
you can see it on camera for the camera
is what it's set to for default 3.5
millimeter headset jack there's the
camera on the get back on top you've got
the lock button so all kind of stuff
going on here it's go ahead and get exit
this exit this so this is all
touchscreen accelerometer based all that
business let's take a look at a keyboard
I was not the biggest fan of the
keyboard on the storm devices there's no
share press here this is just a
capacitive screen doesn't click or do
anything else fancy but the keyboard has
been done and revamped so take a look at
what a text message I'll create a new
one
create alright that's why alright so
here is the keyboard and obviously and
yeah landscape orientation I have not
used this before at all so this will be
a very first test I lost it
okay again as an I get shot this is a
test so I wasn't that accurate but the
auto corrects just bring it hopefully I
got it on camera
let's switch not over let's try it this
way this is a test this is it yet this
us in yet so probably takes some getting
used to and but that was a very first
shot you can see the keyboard looks like
see how quick the rotation is actually
pretty fast
we've got a full webkit-based browser
and i'll show all that kind of good
stuff here about the torch 9800 anything
that you guys want to see in particular
leave your comments down below again a
special thanks to the folks at Negri for
hooking us up with this phone I'm
actually pretty excited to what dig in
I've been using a 9900 actually is my
dedicated device for a while so I'm
gonna switching over this guy and give
it a shot
just for a size comparison sake here
they are side by side I don't if you
called me brothers sisters or just in
cousins let's go ahead and see if they
look like named blackberry sandwich so
there's the thickness yes I can hear my
cat snoring in the background she's just
snoring like crazy I swear there's a cat
in there somewhere
not sure what Jenn does her head
magentas her tail
that's Mercedes recolor Sadie um here's
the back of them plastic back with NFC
right here no NFC on this guy least I
don't believe so if there is all
annotated and that is about it maybe you
guys want to see comparisons head to
head and let me know leave your comments
down below I'm John Retton drew from
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you in the next
video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
