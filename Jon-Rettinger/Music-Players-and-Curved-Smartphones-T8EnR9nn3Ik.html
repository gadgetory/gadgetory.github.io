to you by Linda calm hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me ashley's gather any question you
might have in the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo calm
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise you can send them to
me anytime of the day or night on
twitter at TechnoBuffalo or ashley sceva
just use the hashtag ask the be so i can
see it usually answer between three and
five questions every episode so let's
get going at it's a Christian one asks
why isn't anyone challenging the ipod
market it seems like samsung was the
only one a few years ago and Microsoft
gave up this is a really interesting
question i've actually been getting a
lot of questions about when's the new
ipod coming out and all these other
questions about ipods and competitors
and things like that and really the
answer is is personal music players are
a little bit cannibalized by phones so
Microsoft didn't really give up they
just started making Lumia devices and
they started making windows phones and
samsung also same thing they didn't
really it's it's one of those weird
industries where it's kind of dying off
because people say you know well for 179
dollars i can buy a moto g and that's a
personal music player and also a phone i
don't really even know a lot of people
anymore with an ipod so for me I think a
lot of people are just using their
phones at team oryany asks our curved
displays smart phones and tvs really
required i mean how does it add value to
the user also another great question now
we were just at CES and curved
televisions i will fully admit standing
in front of a hundred and five inch
television that's curved is a sight to
behold it's gorgeous it's amazing to
look at what we've been told is it adds
value by putting the viewer the same
distance from different parts of the TV
if you're sitting in the center for me
personally I don't actually see the need
to have curved smartphones unless
they're flexible screens which we you
know have sort of kind of heard rumors
about and maybe seen a couple pictures
there but nothing is actually in
production for flexible I mean that I
would say would add value to user
because obviously then the phone becomes
a lot more durable but curved
smartphones I just don't know I'm not on
board yet with that because i feel like
the screen is way too small to add any
kind of immersion or give any extra
viewing value to somebody who would buy
it ash ra asks what exactly the job is
it called being a reviewer of tech
products and doing what you guys do at
TechnoBuffalo what courses would you
need to take to get hired at a place who
does things like you guys this is a
great question a lot of people actually
want to know stuff like this like what
exactly are titles well here's the
honest answer all of us have really
different titles and do really different
things even though we all kind of have
been known to write for the site so
somebody like Brandon for example writes
for the site all the time but me on the
other hand i'm a senior content producer
and so while I focus more on video
sometimes you might see me write
something on the website it really
depends on what you want to do and
honestly I think that really truly in my
heart of hearts if you love doing
something you can bring it into a hobby
that you enjoy so for example I love
hosting and I love video and I'm able to
sort of translate those skills into
working for TechnoBuffalo and host and
make video for the site so whatever it
is that you like to do whether it be
writing maybe you want to go to business
school you want to help run a website
maybe you really like social media you
can use those skills and go to school
for those things and then translate them
into working for a site like
technobuffalo at sea degraffenreid says
do you think it is more likely to see
Apple released a SmartWatch or smart TV
this year definitely a SmartWatch I
think we should just not bury the lead
on this I think the SmartWatch is the
obvious choice for a few different
reasons number one we've heard a lot
more rumors about the SmartWatch of
course we've been hearing about this
Apple smart TV for a while now but
they're really haven't been any kind of
concrete pieces of evidence that it's
anywhere beyond a lot of negotiating and
and this brings me to my next point
which is Apple smart TV is going to take
a lot of content providers to get on
board and license their content I'll
of the things that is sort of weird
about the apple TV is that it doesn't
have offerings like for example amazon
prime video you'd be able to get that on
a set-top box like a roku but not on
apple TV and i think apple is really
having that sort of tough time
negotiating with Hollywood studios
number one because Hollywood is
notoriously scared of moving forward and
technology and innovation I think it
freaks them out that we may not be
watching TV traditionally anymore in the
next few years but secondly the other
part of it is is that there's a lot of
licensing deals that go into and a lot
of livelihoods that go into business
deals like this so I think the smart TV
is still a little ways out seeing how
Apple has handled mp3s and music and
also books has sort of been a point of
hesitation on behalf of the studios so
that's my guess I can't say for sure so
that's why I would say definitely will
see a SmartWatch before a smart TV I
