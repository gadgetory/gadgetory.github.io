could step up your home TV viewing game
without breaking the bank we had a lot
of products that will swim are under
$100 and the feedback on that video was
awesome we asked you guys what you
wanted to see next and overwhelming it
was ways you could step up your smart
home game in that same vein without
spending a ton of cash so I got a lot of
products for you most of them are under
50 bucks and only one comes in at about
a hundred and fifty dollars so if you
want to step up your game and you don't
want to spend every dollar in your bank
account check it out every Smart Home
setup needs a main assistant a hub
that's gonna control all of your things
this guy to my right probably looks
familiar to you it's the Amazon echo
plus I've been using the Amazon echo
product since the very first gen it's my
go-to but the new one the plus comes out
a hundred and forty nine dollars it's
now has ZigBee built in you get all the
Amazon stuff that you know and love
course you're gonna order with your
voice you get through into 60 degrees
sound powered by Dolby you've got seven
microphones you can hear you're almost
anywhere in the room have tens of
thousands of skills that can do a lot of
different things but some situations it
might not have what you want so now
that's a new feature called Amazon
Skills blueprint that kind of lets you
create your own some give you guys some
examples for what you can do with that
so if you've got a house guest coming
over maybe you rent your room and you
want your guests to know where
everything is in your house you go and
create a very simple blueprint for that
so you could set it up to have it say
where your TV remote is where extra
toilet paper is where they could find
blankets what's your Wi-Fi password is
what temperature to set the room for to
for optimum comfort all those things can
make life really easy for a guest and
probably more personal for me I've a
nanny that comes out a couple days a
week to help watch my kids so I can set
up a blueprint for her to let her know
here's my wife's parents phone numbers
an emergency here's poison control for
an emergency here's how you can reach me
anytime of day if I'm not home here's my
office phone number here's how you can
text me you can set these blueprints
that can do a ton of things those are
practical there's some fun ones as well
you can do ones that are gonna send
burns to your friends you can set ones
up that are gonna tell you jokes they're
dancing your songs of the day you can
customize this do whatever you want but
those are the most practical ones that
I've been using that I found really
helpful
so the
are super easy to set up as is generally
everything when it comes to the echo you
can go to blueprints on amazon.com we'll
link to it down below order with your
voice say Alexa let's try a blueprint so
that's the echo Plus now with ZigBee
built in which puts it at leaves what
you're gonna need for our next product
smart light bulb it's the element
classic by singlet there's a
misconception that smart bulbs have to
be expensive they do not the element
classic buy single adds are super
inexpensive you can buy one for $9.99 or
a 4-pack for thirty two bucks they're
energy efficient LEDs they're gimel
they're not going to change colors but
if you just want to be able to control
your bulbs with your voice to turn off
kitchen lights or bedroom lights it is
an awesome inexpensive way to go so just
like light bulbs cameras can get
expensive in your house as well
especially when they are Wi-Fi enabled
so meet the wise cam it is $25.00 gonna
give you 10 ATP streaming video gonna
give you motion detection it's gonna
mount into your wall and then click in
with a magnet it's really easy to use
it's really easy to install and it's
gonna give you almost all the same
features set of cameras that cost four
five times as much think about you can
buy four of these for $100 put them all
over your house for security know what
your cat is doing or make sure your
house is just secure when you're not
home alright so next up we've got the
Wemo mini smart plug $30 really
inexpensive it's a way to turn almost
anything in your house smart so if you
want to tell your coffee maker turn on
at a certain time we're scheduled to
turn on at 7 a.m. you can do that
anything you plug in turned it smart one
of my favorite features though is that
if you plug in lights
it'll randomize the lights that go with
it so if you're away on vacation it'll
turn on upstairs and downstairs simulate
somebody being home in your house in
case somebody's lurking outside to make
sure you are safe and speaking of people
creeping around outside your house how
about the ring doorbell for 99 bucks
chances are you've heard of ring or you
might have already have one installed
it's a smart doorbell but beyond that
it's really steps up your home security
game lets you see who is at your door
you can have two eight conversations
with them get notifications on your
phone when somebody's ringing your door
or somebody walks up in front of your
house if you're not home you can talk to
them from anywhere without being
physically in your house beyond that
it's enabled for cloud recording so you
can go back in time and see if maybe you
missed something strange at your door
suspicious car drove by it's a fisheye
lens it's got a really wide field of
view the quality is really awesome and
if you want to have something in your
house it's gonna keep you secure I think
this is really the place that you start
with so those are five products so if
you step up your smart home game that
aren't going to break your bank
individually they're all really good
products but where this whole smart game
experience comes together when you start
using all those products in tandem with
a hub something like the Amazon echo
plus with the blueprints is a really
cool way to do it I want to give a big
shout out to Amazon for sponsoring this
video if you don't have an echo device
you probably show there's a ton of
different options that you can get I
prefer the echo plus but if you want
something smaller they offer a ton of
options there as well you guys like to
style a video showing you how to do
something without breaking the bank it's
sort of our second in the series let us
know down below and give us a suggestion
of something that you guys want to see a
lot of videos out there on YouTube give
you incredible options but things cost
ten twenty thirty thousand bucks we want
to put out videos for products that
people can actually afford hope you guys
enjoyed until next time I'm John Ranger
