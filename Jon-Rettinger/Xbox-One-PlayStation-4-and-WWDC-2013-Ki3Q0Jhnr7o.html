to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back there episode of
ask the Buffalo this to show you could
ask me jon rettinger any question you
might have from the wide world
technology not sure what to make of iOS
don't know what phone to get with tablet
to buy this is the show you can ask
every tuesday on technobuffalo calm and
put back all four questions you can
leave your question in the comments
otherwise you can send them to me at a
time of the day any day of the week at
john for lakers use hashtag ask the bee
i'll make sure i see it usually will
answer three four five ish questions
every episode of this week we're going
to talk about next-gen consoles xbox one
and ps4 course we're gonna talk some iOS
7 and some OS 10 Mavericks disaster
Buffalo let's get asked the Buffalo it
right so the first question comes from
Twitter and user kingdom hearts who asks
at John for lakers which cons are
looking forward to more the ps4 or the
xbox one so I'll set this in a ton of
other videos when I do my console gaming
I previous I've preferred to play on the
xbox in that case was a 360 I like the
way the controller felt but I always
said that I thought the PlayStation 3
was a better value you've got the
blu-ray player you can stream a ton of
stuff you're able to get NFL games on
there just get a ton of things in
addition to being able to play games
this generation though I'm really gonna
have to rethink my gaming loyalty to the
xbox not that it's not a great console
not that's not gonna have incredible
exclusive titles but the hubris that
Microsoft exhibited during their
announcer the xbox one was mind-boggling
when they went on stage and talked about
things are gonna do with use games then
backtracked but previous generations I
never really been considered doing that
much gaming on the PlayStation this time
though I think I'm probably gonna do
most of my gaming on the ps4 well
obviously our the office review and show
you what it's about bratz will change my
mind i get both consoles because i do
like to get my dance revolution on i
would connect but i'm leaning more
toward sony this round and i know i'm
not alone not too
than one hundred dollar price difference
as a big deal next one comes from
Twitter as well at user Gabrielle
quittez who asked at John for lakers we
go back to using an iPhone after the
review of iOS 7 so right now I'm testing
the gargantuan samsung galaxy mega at
6.3 into behemoth and usually i'm
testing your phone so i don't get much
of a chance after just use a dedicated
phone i'm gonna go back to using iOS 7
probably not i think if i have a down
period in between testing i'll probably
go back to the HTC one for me i really
like the way that phone works i looks
but I'm withholding any opinions that
I've gotten iOS 7 right now until the
fonner of these candidates there's a pro
tip anybody he does anything you'd
remotely called a review of iOS 7 while
still in beta do not put any stock in
that at all with the icon looks like now
if you don't like him it might not look
like that when the phone flash player on
the LS finally comes to market they
don't like the way things are working
you don't like the way animations work
it might not be that way and they
finally put it down someone does review
of iOS 7 the day any day minute before
Apple farmer releases it do not put any
stock in it so I'm not really gonna
share any my opinion Iowa seven cuz they
all could very well change but am I
gonna go back to using an iphone maybe
not perhaps if I vessel get me back to
the Apple side next question comes from
Twitter user s Khalid 135 who asks do
you think mac OS maverick to the solid I
need an update or just another update
Apple did as an excuse I don't know what
they were doing for an excuse or what
the excuse would be Apple has sold their
OS is for pretty much dirt cheap by
desktop OS prices so I don't really need
much of an excuse out even wager there's
not much of a profit margin at all on
their OS don't even have a drm on the
file so I don't think they did it to the
excuse to you know make money like
people like to say certainly it brings a
lot of nice updates I know the folks the
amps really excited about the sinking of
iOS notifications with desktop
notifications maps is nice edition books
a nice addition is it a giant OS update
no certainly not I've seen a real reason
to update turn a must-have feature since
Apple introduced time machine that one
for me was a must have raised its
upgrade my OS these are has been sort of
incremental the past few generations the
cats and now the California locations
but it's nice you get more stability
presume going to get more security and
you get a few added features as well and
for a really really really miniscule
price it's a nice update with you guys
agree to disagree or what killer feature
on maverick you
about perhaps there's something you
figured that wasn't shared yet again
still in Developer Preview so many
things could change by the time it
finally gets released okay what you guys
