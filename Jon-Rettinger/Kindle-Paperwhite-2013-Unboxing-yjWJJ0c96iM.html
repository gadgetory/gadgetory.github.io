TechnoBuffalo here at an unboxing of the
brand new Kindle paperwhite in my mind
they're ear eaters and then there's the
Kindle this guy has been head over heels
better than anything else out there and
they've made the best now better it's
faster it's got a better backlight it's
more kindled up let's go ahead take a
first look at it so here's the box for
the new Kindle paperwhite it's gonna
look pretty similar to the outgoing
Kindle paperwhite if you want to pick
one up it's $119 a with offers which is
fancy way for saying ads or 139 without
we got the version here with offers on
first blush you'd be like hey it looks
exactly like the old kinder paperwhite
and you'd be right it does but 25%
faster there's better lighting and it's
got way better touch technology built in
at least that's according to Amazon go
ahead pull this stuff out slide this out
of the plastic come here Shindo why
don't you want to get into my hand
ha see the paperwhite and it feels
really things feel awesome in the hand
if you haven't seen one of these in
person if it really feels like you're
reading a book there's no glare you can
read in direct sunlight at the beach
wherever you are without any sort of
issue it's got that soft touch feel
lighting was on certainly known for now
that the Kindle Fire tablets you got the
Amazon logo and blazons on the back we
do have a charge cable there stop sort
of including this I believe or the
charging birthday went with it so you
just have a cable new brick let's go
ahead and power this sucker on and see
what it does power buttons right there
on the bottom look at that it lit up
it's probably yell at me to charge it
first but I want to turn it on high
Kindle when I go out to dinner hey it
worked so you've got this the Kindle
boot up screen a guy sitting under a
tree I'll come back in a minute once
it's all booted up so we've got the
paperwhite all booted up we've got the
backlighting going you can see it's way
more uniform in previous version you
could see little back lights on the
bottom you can see where they were now
it looks like it's all the way around
the entire device while setting it up I
saw that the touch screen worked much
better it's pretty incredible how far
each has come over the years so a few
things here of note you can obviously
change pages just by tapping a phone to
pull up a menu you can serve tablets
and you get a toolbar you get sir the
same stuff that you get elsewhere x-ray
is still built into the Kindle tablet so
you can jump in and see a character's
name or information about what you're
reading and all kinds of other goodness
here you can go back to table of
contents if you want you can scroll
through to get to pick it apart of story
so we'll go ahead and go right there
same stuff here if you want to look up a
word for example you don't know what the
word let's say books means go ahead and
just hold it down and they'll pull up a
definition for you book you are reading
one and I go ahead and tap out and you
are ready to go not much here in the way
of buttons you're not gonna find
anything on the side turn pages you hit
there'd go back you hit there long press
or keep flipping through I've got one
button on the bottom and you've got your
charging and seen cable other than that
that's about it this is all about
reading you're not gonna find much here
there's an experimental web browser and
that kind of thing but mostly this is
all about ebooks no cameras nothing else
if you want all that kind of business on
a Kindle I look at the fireline but if
you just want to read and have a really
nice reading experience I highly
recommend the Kindle paperwhite thank
