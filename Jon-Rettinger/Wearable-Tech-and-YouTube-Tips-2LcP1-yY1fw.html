to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back the episode of ask the
Buffalo I am despite not having horns
and not being as furry as perhaps one I
am a buffalo John renter you could ask
me any question you've gone from with
technology and sometimes outside the
world technology of this week we're
going to talk about the Moto X its would
back miss we're going to talk about some
iphone 6 business some TV show questions
and some tips for youtubers and last but
not least some touch ID improvements
this is asked to Buffalo let's start
asking buffalos
the first question comes from twitter
user at sai he asked at john for lakers
john how well does the wood back and
moto x hold up in real life against
water and general usage is it a buy or
not it is yes a definite by that's a
good question you figure would might not
hold up if it gets you know wet in the
rain or something i wouldn't throw in a
toilet or anything I holds up fine like
any other back no issue at all I assume
the wood is treated so yes if you want a
wood backed phone jump in with both feet
but don't bring the phone with you into
the pool cuz you're gonna ruin to anyway
and the wood back gonna look super bad
so hope that helped answer your question
so the next question comes from junior
tobias 525 asks at john for lakers do
you think it would be smart to wait for
the iWatch before buying any wearable
tech hashtag ask the be so i get this
kind of questions all the time john
should i wait for the iphone 6 should i
wait for the iphone 8 the reality is we
don't know what it's going to be coming
around midnight but might not be coming
Tim Cook said new product lines are
coming maybe it's a watch maybe it's a
new pair of Apple brand sneakers we
don't know I would not based you're
buying decisions based on products
aren't released so I phone for example
you know a new iPhones eventually gonna
be coming I patty no new ones going to
be coming week you can sort of gate and
that's going to be this is unreleased
product line so really nobody knows at
something else that you like right now
if you want to pebble or whatever the
new gear and it works for you then i say
go ahead and pick it up otherwise if
you're more fickle and you want to see
all the marketplace you know then you
can wait but if you're always waiting
you're never going to get anything so
fit up answer your question next
question twitter comes from at a zine
Spence us at john for lakers what do you
think about the how i met your mother
farewell episode before everybody scream
spoiler alert i am not going to spoil it
for you I've watched every episode of
every season I love the show and they
come in the minority but I really liked
the ending I thought it kind of tied it
up nicely certainly I would have changed
a few things but overall I was pretty
happy with it there were some sad moment
some funny moments but if your fan of
the show I think that you should give
the ending another watch if you haven't
started watching this show i'm not gonna
spoil anything for you but start
watching it because there's a lot of
good TV to see out there and a lot of
Neil Patrick Harris which really with
the world needs more mph next let's go
to ats wonderin one who asked at john
for lakers my only question is how kind
of
smaller youtuber become big well you can
go to the gym you could eat more you
know that would probably help you can
use some kind of filters on the camera
or you know some sort of fun house
effects or make yourself bigger but if
the question and my stupid jokes aside
probably how to get more attention we've
got a whole series going on how to sort
of improve your YouTube experience how
to become a bigger youtuber how to get
products that kind of stuff if you go to
the main a youtube channel so youtube
com such heck debuff there's a whole
playlist their advice for aspiring
youtubers things of do's and don'ts
where our tech comes from how to deal
with the negativity I can see the videos
range from like way back in time when I
look like I was 12 years old you know to
now to receive the advice that I've
given hopefully I'll that'll help you
guys figure out how to become bigger and
hopefully set you on the right path take
a quick break to thank our friends good
people well dress folks at audible
they've got over a hundred thousand
audiobooks and spoken word entertainment
to choose from if you want to sound
educated at parties you want to read
that latest romance novel but don't want
to be judged at the beach now is your
chance listen to books in the car at the
gym why pretending they'll be at work or
anything else you want to do audibles
got you covered go to audible
podcast.com slash tech down and get a
free audiobook of your choice when you
sign up today yay audible podcasts tech
go get your free book don't be a dummy
sound smart now back to the questions
let's jump next to at Smosh ariana pie
who asked at John for linkers do you
think the iphone 6 will have a better
touch ID like improvements and
relocation so I don't know what
relocation means I think touch ID still
going to be you know in the home button
I think it's only going to get better I
think even software alone will sort of
improve touch ID buzz we jump to an X
phone I think it's only going to get
better I think that's sort of the
evolution of the product touch ID at
least for me does not work all that well
probably about seventy percent of the
time usually have to enter my password
the other 30 so it's not a giant pain
doesn't work as well as advertised but
no you know some people have said John
you're crazy it works every single time
for me so your experience might vary I'm
hopeful though a software maybe some new
hardware thrown in maybe some more
sensors when my tech ID work even better
but i would expect next iphone to make
things better
rural thank you guys for watching and
hope you enjoyed if you want to ask
