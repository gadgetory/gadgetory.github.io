technobuffalo here I get a lot of
requested give a tour of my office I
haven't done one in quite a while
actually since I moved into my new place
so let me go ahead and oblige you
there's my nameplate this is my office
I'll try to make this as less shaky as
possible here's the desk where I do all
of my filming got a nice chair there is
the 24-inch imac which i do all the
editing on there is an external blu
that's a 22 inch HP resolutions not
fantastic on that so it's a secondary
monitor some more of my desk sort of all
my messy cabling I have towards to the
side there but it's all so no one can
see it Orange Crush because well it's
delicious harman kardon soundsticks were
some good sounding audio here's the rest
of my desk on my drawers of my files and
such moving on over some of the lighting
that I used for my filming here is my
tripod printer a dusting I was doing
there I've got a digital photo frame and
I really use some of my books this is
what I look at what I'm filming my
videos I got some signed Lakers and
angels pictures in the big sports fan
you probably could have guessed from the
youtube name and here's the view that
sort of I get when I film you notice
that that picture is actually down
really low it's sort of cuz the camera
the tripod or download to so perspective
a supreme white wall I should probably
decorate a little bit better that's the
initial technobuffalo logo that when we
first decided what we're going to make a
logo that was the original file that
first got printed out sort of keep it up
there for remember to sync I've got a
little bit of a view as a parking lot
right there and a pool right beyond it
so I can sort of take a look out at at
the people if I want to break there is
my diploma from the University of
Rochester prove I'm a college graduate
let's see what else we got moving along
there's actually a picture that my
girlfriend drew and I was studying for
the gmat for business school the man on
a mission that's supposed to me me kind
of looks like
picture of a like a stalker or like so
much serial rapist or something but I
thought it was funny so I framed it
there's some more lighting that i use
got some more side pictures there Shaq
and Sean Figgins now you see what the
reflection in my closet sort of right do
all of my storage here some boxes and
blankets I've got some electronics on
here some of stuff that I'm keeping for
future giveaways several all my stuff
that I've kept that I use on a regular
basis and some other sort of accessories
and stuff that I'm looking to our review
and giveaway in the coming weeks and
months sorry I keeps on my boxes up
there too okay so ever need to return
them my green screen that I'd like to
use occasionally some more storage some
pictures there's the macbook some
miscellaneous stuff over here vacuum
that's about it really nothing that
exciting guys this is just a pretty
simple office where I like to do all of
do all my work and I think the last
thing that I'd show you is down there
I've got the hyper Mac charging and i
also have the mifi chardon down there
and sort of a mess of cables and that is
about it guys hope you enjoyed just a
real quick walkthrough of my office I'll
see you guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
