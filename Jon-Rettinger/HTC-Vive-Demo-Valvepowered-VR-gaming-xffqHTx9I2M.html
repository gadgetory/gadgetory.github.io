Hazleton from technobuffalo I'm here
with a first look and first impressions
of the HTC vive it's their new virtual
reality headset that was announced here
at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
it's a crazy has said it's sort of
similar to oculus as opposed to what we
saw with gear VR that works with
smartphones this is entirely powered by
a pc by high-end graphics cards although
we're told that it should be available
to millions of people so you don't
necessarily have to upgrade to some
crazy high end card but HTC is not
certain yet on what it's going to
require in any case I had a chance to
check it out it's fantastic it has
sensors around the front on the top it
has two USB ports and HDMI port and then
the cords were run ran over my head
connected to the PC and then I had two
controllers in my hands and what it does
is it allows you to walk around two
rooms there's a virtual world in front
of me in one example I was standing on a
ship and this whale comes in against
360-degree viewing so you're looking all
over but you can also walk around
similar to what you can do with the
oculus which was just a lot of fun there
was another example where I was in a
kitchen and I could use the remotes to
pick up different vegetables put them in
a pot and try to make a recipe in a
certain amount of time I ultimately fail
because I'm not a very good cook even in
the virtual reality world it seems in
another demo I was actually in sort of a
portal universe and so that kind of
shows the benefit of having valve on
board here with HTC the gaming aspect of
it all and I was supposed to fix a robot
but the robot broke and fell apart and
then I had to use the controller so open
up some drawers in the robot repair shop
where I found a piece of cake so the
cake isn't necessarily a lie it turns
out in any case that was a quick look at
the HTC vive we're really really excited
for it to launch it should be HTC's
promising available to consumers by the
end of this year this is Todd Hazleton
