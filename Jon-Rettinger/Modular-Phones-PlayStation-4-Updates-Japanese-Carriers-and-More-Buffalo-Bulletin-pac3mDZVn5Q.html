are a project our assassins creed 4
black flag review a ps4 launch day patch
and a featured series on Japanese cell
phone carriers it's about flow bullets
in time hello internet and welcome to
the Buffalo bulletin where we recapped
five major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story i mentioned on the
show check the description for links or
click on the graphics for each story if
you have annotations available and
toggled on I'm Ashley sceva hair you're
tops LG jumped on the curved display
bandwagon this week announcing the LG G
flex the G flex has a six inch plastic
OLED screen with a curved OLED panel
underneath a 3500 milliamp hour battery
and a self-healing coating on the back
that somehow takes care of daily wear
and tear nicks dings scratches and
uncased phone would pick up it launches
in korea next month but there's no word
on any additional markets personally
though I think curved screens are going
to be the next passing fad and cell
phones just like 3d devices were for a
while but what about you would you pick
up an LG G flex Motorola nounced a
familiar-looking project this week the
ARA project has a goal of swappable
parts for cell phones allowing users to
create a custom and easy to modify
smartphone well that sounds a lot like
phonebloks that's because it pretty much
is and Motorola actually met with
phonebloks founder to discuss the ARA
project and to get feedback from
phonebloks large community devs will be
happy to hear Motorola plans on a module
dev kit alpha release sometime this
winter in gaming we've released our
assassins creed 4 black flag review just
in time for the game's official ps3 and
xbox 360 launch today our own joey
davidson worked his way through the game
so you'll know what to expect if you've
been thinking about picking it up the
good lots to do and being a pirate is
pretty fun but not so good sometimes the
main storyline gets lost amongst side
quests and sea battles you'll have to
read the full review to find out her
score so hit the link and enjoy the ps4
is set to launch a tascam 70
days but don't get carried away with
visions of a plug-and-play experience
you'll be downloading a three hundred
megabyte patch before you pretty much do
anything on your ps4 the patch has some
features though that are relatively
essential to your ps4 experience remote
play gameplay recording and screenshots
gameplay casting play as you download
online multiplayer and blu-ray and DVD
player functionalities so you'll
definitely want to get it on launch day
lastly if you've ever wondered about
carriers in other countries besides the
US and how they work our wildcard story
this week is a great place to start this
week we begin a series covering the
three major carriers in Japan starting
with Softbank mobile it's a
well-researched and interesting read if
you want to know more about how carriers
and other countries work so then we'll
look if you have a couple of minutes
that's the Buffalo bulletin for today if
you enjoyed the show a thumbs up would
be so awesome of you and if you want
