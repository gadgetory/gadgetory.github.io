TechnoBuffalo here at the review for you
of the sony ericsson xperia x1 i know
this is an older phone and i mentioned
this in the unboxing but it was one of
the few devices that i hadn't had a
chance to check out i was really curious
about the form factor and the operating
system so while this is not the most
modern of devices it's still a pretty
interesting one so i thought that i
would give you my impressions on it
so the x1 is running windows mobile 6.1
but scott i sort of a unique take on
Windows Mobile and I'll show you that in
a minute
spec wise it's got a very strange screen
it's 3 inches diagonal it can show over
65,000 colors which is quite nice it's
got a 480 by 800 resolution just a
little bit weird but not bad and again
it's a resistive touchscreen so one of
the cool things about the x1 and I'll go
ahead and jump right in here and show
you what it is your windows mobile 6.1
homescreen is nothing fancy but what
sort of is the flagship of the Xperia
Lion and what's going to be the flagship
of the x2 which is replacing this
running Windows 6.5 is this panel
interface let me show you what that
looks like there's a panel button in the
bottom right hand corner which pulls up
a row of sort of new skins home screens
think of it like touchflo 3d but you can
change different touchflo 3d skins and
there are different panels that you can
download here are some of the most
popular I'll show you what they look
like so access a panel all you do is
just give it a click so we'll go ahead
and pick one we'll pick fish it pulls up
does a little refresh and you are good
to go now from the surface this fish
thing just looks kind of gimmicky ghen
you know not so not so useful but
there's a lot more below the hood the
fish will change color if you have
messages or missed calls more official
show up depending on whether not you
have messages waiting certain it takes a
little bit of a luck to get used to it
but it is surprisingly useful you can
move the fish around they're just a fun
thing to have a few other panels here
and you see how quickly the panel
interface does respond and I'll show you
this works in landscape as well you can
use some that are a little more useful
You certainly have like different
for for business or for pleasure and
there are a lot more things you can use
here's a little more useful panel with
an array of icons at the bottom a big
analog clock and you definitely know
update the panel or whatever you like
and there are several choices here you
can go ahead and choose from their range
of different utilities some are more
calendar-based some are more media based
and there are a few more that you can
download does work in landscape go ahead
and pop it open let's have a relatively
quick refresh rate as well go ahead and
hit panel button and then you get the
same thing sort of in a portrait mode
you can fit a little differently if you
want to sort a fan across them some need
animations you get sorry the utility of
that is is questionable but it
definitely looks pretty so the xperia x1
is running Windows 6.1 or windows mobile
6.1 which is already antiquated
operating system in fact it was
antiquated almost when it was released
about how it's been supplanted by
Windows Phone and we're commonly known
as windows mobile 6.5 certainly be very
hard to recommend an older device
running antiquated operating system like
the xperia x1 especially at the almost
$700 price point that most retail
outlets are asking for it comes a very
expensive phone it was expensive when it
was first released and is surprisingly
not seen that big a price drop I believe
in the well over a year since it first
came out so assuming that this is a
phone that's probably not going to be in
your budget what is nice and unique
about it and sony and sony ericsson
particular really known for a great
build quality and the sony ericsson
xperia x1 really has probably some of
the best build quality i've seen on a
mobile device it uses really strong
metals the spring and sliding mechanism
is very solid
I believe this phone is actually built
by HTC it's got sort of an arcing slider
which you can see right there makes
typing really nice and easy
the keyboards are a little bit flush or
is a little bit flush but they're really
easy to type on it shouldn't easy to
navigate with your fingers I'd say it's
probably one of the better keyboards
that I've actually used you feel
definite like you're using a quality
device the camera on the back is not the
highest resolution but it's certainly
usable at 3.2 megapixels and it takes
very nice pictures surprisingly nice
picture
actually and the LED flash adds a nice
touch I wouldn't use it as your primary
camera as far as camera phones go was
really his of one of the nicer sensors
I've seen solid metal back and solid
metal feel call quality was very good
the radio seems to be pretty strong
certainly you get this standard windows
mobile 6.1 crashes I certainly had a few
of them but hardware wise is a really
nice device and it makes me very
optimistic for the x2 coming out that's
replacing it improved processors be
improved Ram and really sort of a
similar design so I think that there's a
lot to be said for the x1 I think that
it paved the way for some of the future
generation devices we're going to see
from Sony Ericsson like the x2 and the
upcoming Android extent I believe this
codenamed Rachel so this really is a say
a forefront and a forbear some of the
new phones were going to start seeing
from Sony Ericsson and they did a really
nice job with this but it's high price
point and to pay top rent system makes
it very hard to recommend and I hope you
guys enjoy this review of the sony
ericsson xperia x1 I'm John Retton gern
I'll see you in the next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
