technobuffalo here we are taking a look
at yet another of Mac OS 10 Lions 250
plus new features in the last video we
took a look at this game Mission Control
its new fancy expose now we can take a
look at this rocket chip right next to
it called the launch pad let's go ahead
and get started alright so we will
launch launch pad will launch the launch
pad go ahead and click it and you get
something that looks just like I Oh s
all your icons show up here in a what
Apple calls a very quick and easy way to
see them you've got all these little
dots on here that show you a pager on
and if you hold it down you're gonna see
something very familiar as well they do
that little jiggly dance which means you
can move them around so you can say i
want i move you there or no I movie
belongs it's a final cut because they're
both video programs they should be next
to each other and their friends but if
that's not enough for you you can also
make folders so i can take this and i
could drag this here and boom that look
familiar to you i bet it does and it
automatically titles it or you can
change that title but I don't want image
capture here so let's drag that back out
I'm not going to make that into a folder
it's automatically going to show you all
the folders that you have set up so my
utilities are here and it's going that
jiggly dances awfully annoying all my
utilities are here something called
solver I'm not even sure what that is
I'm gonna find out what solver is
because I don't like not knowing what's
on my computer make it see how your
application sort of show up as you
scroll use the arrows to scroll from
screen screen feel my ton of Windows
programs having parallels I don't really
use that much anymore but I like to have
it so you can see all this goodness it's
pretty simple it's essentially like
looking at the applications list in iOS
I'm not entirely sure how much I would
ever use this on a desktop but if it's
your cup of tea then hey here's your
steamin Earl Grey or maybe like orange
and they've got a choice to have that
too I doubt that I am ever going to use
Launchpad are you guys going to use it
I'd like to hear down below it seems
unnecessary to me perhaps if I wasn't
using a desktop maybe we had a lot
top and I could just use some gestures
to launch it and might be handy but
otherwise I'm just gonna use this dog
thing down here it's much easier so this
is Launchpad once give you guys a quick
tour and now i'm getting all rambling
cuz i was up early i'm jon rettinger
from technobuffalo and i'll see you
there next video but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
