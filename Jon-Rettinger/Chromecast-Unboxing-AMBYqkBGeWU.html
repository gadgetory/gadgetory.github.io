technobuffalo here it's an unboxing for
you of the latest product to come out of
google's labs this is the chromecast
actually lets you watch video in the
online world on your television set
let's go ahead open it up it looks like
alright so here's the box for the
chromecast as little guys gonna set you
back about 35 bucks 40 if you factor in
some taxes and maybe some light shipping
costs it is available now so there is a
picture of the devices the dongle that
plugs into your HDMI port on your
television set chromecast the easiest
way to watch online video on your TV
essentially it's airplay in a dongle
cool thing notice does work across
multiple flat platforms works with
android iOS OS 10 and Windows you can
video or anything on your web to your TV
from your smartphone tablet or a laptop
if you want to watch a creepy first
person video of a kids surfing go ahead
and do that let's go ahead and open it
up it says peel here but why peel here
we have a ridiculously unnecessary knife
let's go ahead and use this and just
stab here what it should say and we'll
go ahead and see what we have inside
we've got to the chrome logo and
chromecast very nice packaging here so
what you think it's going to be easy to
plug this right into television set but
what reality is is to hdmi port and
either into USB power or to an external
power adapter so it's not just that
something else has to plug into that
little micro port right there switch
input and set me up and got a setup
guide right here of course we'll have a
full hands-on for you I hopefully later
on today of this guy but it's really
light and really thin you can see it
looks like in my hand in here underneath
we've got a cord so there's USB port if
your TV has them provide enough power
you could just go ahead and use this if
it doesn't provide enough power gonna
have to use this really sort of ugly
wall work and we also have looks like
we've got a hdmi extension cable so if
your TV I can't get right to it for the
donga least you can extend it with this
and plug it in to the end we've got some
product information here is dongle
itself not really that much else to show
battle peel off all the plastic
and we've got on it there's your there's
a single power button on it right there
we've got your sinking port or charging
port connection port everyone use it for
and then there's the hdmi and that is
really it Oz has been done baktun I
suppose very quick first look at the
chromecast look at this guy's set up and
show what it looks like in the next
video what's up everyone it's ashley
