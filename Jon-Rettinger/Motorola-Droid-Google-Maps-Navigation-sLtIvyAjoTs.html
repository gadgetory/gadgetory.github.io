lot of great things to like about the
droid by motorola but one thing in
particular stands out it's got
turn-by-turn directions by Google
granted it's in beta but it is a free
offering it's going to be included with
any Android to point out of ice most
smartphones have had some sort of Google
Maps it's been on the iphone it's been
on previous Android devices BlackBerry's
got it Simeon's got it really every
operating system has it but it's the
first time we've seen turn-by-turn
directions on an Android device it's
actually done by Google at the great
price of free so it's still available
and give you a quick demonstration of
what it looks like and how it works so
right there it says car home and it's a
separate application then the maps that
you're probably used to so go ahead and
open that up and you get won't wait very
slick looking doc taking advantage of
the voice search you can either do voice
search go right to navigation you can
view your map contact if you have
somebody to address stored in your
context books search or take you back
home and the search is pretty neat
because it will actually do a google
search and a little hot length all the
addresses and you click one and you head
right off so I'll show you what this
looks like and I'll show you using the
voice search because it works quite well
so you can say street address or you can
say the name of a landmark or place it's
certainly gps aware so it knows where
you are so it'll search for things in
your vicinity so there's a big mole by
me called South Coast Plaza so I'm going
to search for that via voice search and
see how this works and keep in mind that
all of this still is completely beta
south coast plaza see if that worked so
it found it south coast plaza there's a
map of where it is
and I can go ahead and route myself
right there it says get directions go
ahead hit get directions I can either
use the browser or the map certainly I
want to use maps and let's see what
happens ok so there we go and brought to
a navigation screen I can either drive
there I'm taking a bus or walk so it's
using my location to south coast plaza
we'll go ahead and hit go it's
calculating driving directions it gives
you an overview of where you need to go
and I go it'll show it on a map if you
like and I'll go ahead and hit navigate
one more time now I see in the splash
screen for Google Maps Navigation it's
looking for my gps signal so you can
hear it's a very mechanized voice but it
really works quite well and it's got
some cool features on it that might not
find that some of your baseline GPS
units and as you saw i rotate it so
we'll definitely take advantage of
accelerometer depending on where you are
if you've got a car kit or something for
example put this write-up on your dash
so you've got a few options that you can
do first you go I'd hit the menu button
you can get your all your route info you
can start adding some layers to this map
so let's go ahead and add a layer I can
add traffic view if I'm say I'm driving
to Los Angeles and Simon Orange County
and I want to see if there's traffic
it'll overlay it with traffic let's say
that's not good enough I want satellite
view well we're going to put a satellite
view right on top of that and if that's
still not enough for you you go ahead
and get parking in a show you where all
the parking spots are the big parking
lots along the way and there's a really
great different off today you could have
you can exit the navigation you can mute
it you can get the route info which will
give you the turn-by-turn with where you
want to go so you know it'll tell you a
left turn ahead but you want to know
what's after that left turn you can find
out right there you can have some more
information you get your full directions
less to your destinations or of course
the terms if you hit the arrow it will
give you a
a almost a street view look from where
you are and where you're going and it'll
rotate around with you and you can
certainly pan around to where you'd like
now one of the downsides of this is that
it is of course network based so you're
not storing any map directly on the
device so this won't function if you
don't have a clear view of the sky and a
verizon data signal it's not like some
of the conference for for tomtom that
we've seen on mobile devices or it
actually puts a whole slew of maps on
your device this you need to have a data
connection for i will say that it's a
little bit buggy i had to crash a few
times but that's to be expected at the
beta application it works well and best
part is it's free so for those of you
that are going to go hop out and pick up
the motorola droid this is going to be
very welcome addition for those of you
that are waiting for your android device
calf grid 2 point 0 this is something
that you can look forward to hope you
enjoyed this overview of the google maps
