you by hostgator hello there it's John Q
here from TechnoBuffalo and welcome back
to what's the apps hmmm a little bit of
attitude and sassiness right there love
it so today on WTA we're gonna be taking
a look at a way to manage our finances
with an app and service called partial
about a month or two ago I was looking
for something on my iphone to help me
manage my spending now I knew about a
website called mint calm I even signed
up for an account and when it came time
to that last step that one final step
before I can use the application it
asked me for my banking information and
I I just rhymed during my app review
presentation immediately I started
googling stuff like mint.com security
mint.com scam and thankfully everything
came up positive and everyone was saying
how awesome and secure mint.com was
still I didn't feel comfortable sharing
my banking information so my search for
this awesome on-the-go budgeting iPhone
app cuz you know I'm such an on-the-go
person carried on and it eventually led
me to taschlin oh boy was I glad it did
first of all I don't even know how you
pronounce this thing Tasha Tasha Tasha
Liam I'm just not too sure Tasha Liz a
cloud-based service that allows you to
input your expenses and all of that
wonderful data is accessible throughout
a wide range of devices from
blackberries to your Mac or Windows
powered computer the key thing I was
looking for was cloud syncing I love
that stuff magically takes things from
my phone and sends it into the air in
the magical cloud area with rainbows of
whatever and then delivers it onto my
desktop like nobody's business
dan freakin tastic Tasha Liz very very
easy to use first you set up a budget I
simply put a monthly budget and a daily
budget you can put stuff like food
entertainment and so on but I'm not that
fancy-pants to add expenses simply tap
on the plus sign enter in the amount
enter in your tags and boom done when
your expenses accumulate you'll be able
to see how much you're spending on a
daily weekly or monthly basis based on
days or tags very handy you can even
email yourself the expense reports in
various form
it's very super handy even though the
user interface and the designer partial
is amazing there was something that kind
of bothered me in addition to tags I
really wish there was a category option
for example I'd like to have a food
category and under that food category
I'd have stuff like groceries snacks
lunches dinners diners drive-ins and
dives and so on and so forth I mean sure
you can accomplish this purely with tags
but I personally would like that extra
level of organization and control to
have more of a visual and in-depth
experience with partial simply log on
using any computer there you can see all
them fancy charts and graphs in the site
it's really really pretty after using
this for about less than a month I gotta
say I've become a lot more aware of my
spending especially after looking at my
expenses list oooo hold on there
girlfriend
350 oh yes that must be that super rare
endangered panda i ordered from ebay i'm
a name him sprinkles and would you look
at that i did not break the bank as my
monthly budget of a humble Oh 100
million dollars is still in the green
and speaking of green I'm gonna take
some time to thank our good friends at
Hostgator Hostgator can get your blog or
website up and running in minutes the
plans starting at just around 4 bucks a
month you get 24/7 support and access to
website building tools with over 4,000
templates they'll even migrate your
current site over for free their servers
are a hundred and thirty percent powered
by wind energy and you get unlimited
disk space and bandwidth you also get a
45 day money back guarantee and 100

this means marketing for rev3 viewers
Hostgator is offering 25% off your order
or your first month free just go to
hostgator.com and entering the coupon
code TechnoBuffalo at the checkout back
to their review just a heads up
Tasha does offer a pro account which
will cost around 20 bucks a year the pro
account lets you create more than one
budget very handy but mostly it'll
dramatically enhance your online desktop
experience I picked up the pro version a
while back and I think I'll be renewing
again next year even though there's room
for improvement for what Tasha does and
the ease and accessibility of the app
and service i'ma give this guy a four
out of five
Tasha really helped me with my budgeting
I mean it's kinda
cool to see how something small can
change your lifestyle and your
perspective on things
tried for yourself Tasha does have a
free version so you don't have to worry
about shelling out your bling-bling and
just a heads up you can only sign up
from your phone from the actual app
itself I mean I was on the site for
about 5-10 minutes looking for a sign up
option I couldn't find it I don't know
why it's there maybe I just don't know
how to navigate the site I don't know
but it's weird that it wasn't there
anywho I hope you guys enjoyed my review
and if there any applications that you
would like me to check out let me all my
commenting and a stay tuned to the
TechnoBuffalo rev3 channel as we have no
work rabbits coming in on Friday with
