know from technobuffalo and this is the
inspire 4G from AT&amp;amp;T and HTC it arrives
ATT 4g HTC it's the newest android phone
it drops i believe on februari 13th
ironically enough the same day you can
start pre-ordering the motorola atrix 4g
which you know frankly in a nutshell
here this is a really nice phone but i
would imagine that atrix is going to
overshadow it in the stores because it's
all was banging laptop dock craziness
stuff but that being said 100 bucks on
contract gets you a lot more these days
than it did five years ago when i
started in this business nine dollars on
contract of course we all know that the
contract part cost you way more than the
upfront cost and also a lot of times you
can get these ones cheaper from a third
party that from the carrier store but
you know so what for the sake of the
review nine dollars on contract and try
to point to the newest version HTC Sense
4G is it any good let's find out
you
alright so here's the phone the inspire
4G again ninety-nine dollars on two-year
contract when it drops i believe it's
Deborah thirteenth and you know in a
nutshell it's a really really solid
Android device if you like the form
factor the big 4.3 inch screen really
what the only thing you're missing here
that might I think be really important
right now is a front facing camera if
you'd like to do the video chat and self
portrait and stuff otherwise you know
it's a single core processor and their
dual core phones coming out but most
people aren't going to need that this
one is plenty responsive you know
everything that I've done with a web
browsing and email and everything else
you know works just fine the HTC Sense
system is nice it's got the hspa+ 1880s
first quote 4G HSPA+ device which I get
I'll talk about that in a second it's
got Wi-Fi on the back that eight
megapixel camera 720p HD video dual LED
flash I just did a little bit with it
didn't have a chance to you know do a
whole lot of video recording and all
that kind of stuff but it works you know
it works well the photos are solid I've
got a photo here that I I took this
morning and some new sneakers I got
unfortunately there are a half size too
small Nike change their sizing since
last time I got shoes but anyway just to
show you you know the pinch and zoom
it's very responsive and the photo came
out well i emailed this to a friend and
then you know saw it in my sent folder
when i looked on a big monitor on a
computer and you know a pretty good
photo from when I just took quickly you
can see kind of the detail there in the
cardboard box you know I'm not a
photographer per se but definitely
pretty good phone you got the GPS I mean
pretty good camera rather for a phone
the GPS built in with geo-tagging you
know all that stuff you're used to it
from a high-end device HTC Sense you
know works really well you've got your
multiple home screens and you're kind of
overview you can pinch in to get your
overview thing and then you know click
on what your screen you want to go to
all the widgets the HTC widgets as well
as the Android widgets here's the HTC
clock with the animated weather that
kind of stuff you know it's really good
there their new new version the sentence
is a few little few little additions
including the find my phone service
online backup tight into the web's
website you can log in to remotely to
manage your phone and find that if it's
lost or stolen that's pretty cool
got this personalized button which gives
you kind of quick access to the settings
and customizations that people you know
most people will want to use and this
something that's nice if you're you know
kind of a power user you can get it set
up quickly you can set up your own
scenes in your own you know a scene is a
combination of a wallpaper apps and what
app shortcuts and widgets on your home
screens and then you've got also you
know sound sets which are similar but
for sounds and so that's cool you know
power users can set this all up to jump
between different you know sets and
settings and then for a novice user you
know this is cool because it makes it a
little bit easier a little more user
friendly than stock Android at least in
my opinion and i'll talk more about that
in a second because i have a gripe still
out there just some things about android
i just really bugged me let me talk
about that in a second one thing i like
about android is the notifications bar
and then you've got also the
customizable LED notification light not
on right now because I've ignored my new
emails for long enough so not anymore
but again you know overall solid saw
device I think when the atrix comes out
like I said it it may overshadow with
all the the dual core and and all the
the hdmi out and the accessories and all
that and you know probably more of a
marketing blitz but but this is a solid
device and you know it's not super
lightweight but it's not overly heavy
it's thin enough solidly constructed the
battery cover was a giant pan the neck
I've always been a massive fail at
battery covers my whole lust rias
half-decade career covering the mobile
industry I for some reason battery
covers and I did not get along but this
one particularly bad and I've talked to
other people reviewing this photo said
the same thing as you can see i mangled
this thing trying to get it open i used
at a coin and a fingernail in a
screwdriver and everything I could think
of try get this thing open I finally did
but I messed it all up then you've got a
separate mechanism down here for the sim
card a microSD slot you know most people
won't have to access these things very
often and that's good because solidly
constructed you know feels great in the
hand stays in place once it's there but
man just a bear and not in the good way
to to deal with those things another
thing I really like about HTC is their
on-screen keyboard so I'll show you real
quick i love android voicesearch one of
my favorite things voice commands search
for a big pizza
I look at that search for a big pizza
pie I mean it that's fantastic so when
you're typing I think I think HTC's
keyboard on-screen keyboard is one of
the best ones out there it works in you
know in landscape and portrait modes I
really like their predict system which
as you're typing you know gives you the
options right there and it's easy to
customize the dictionary of course that
one was so far off you know it gives you
your auto complete options and
everything and just really nice easy to
type in the nice big screen the 4.3 inch
screen makes it even easier to type on
which is great but a couple of the
negatives so for me AT&amp;amp;T store was
notoriously you know lots of complaints
in the San Francisco Bay Area and my
office where I work in an Oakland
California where I feel most these
videos and everything has really bad
cell phone service across the board but
18 TM t mobile the gsm carriers are
worse than the cdma carriers right here
so i know it's kind of a dead spot that
being said this phone dropped three
calls got the same call three times
actually this afternoon and another call
once when i tried to call call somebody
i got to fail right away and I'd to call
again so that's not you know necessarily
the fault of this device but just to say
you know 18t still having his problems
in some parts of the country and other
in other parts it's great but out here
the problems continue and the hspa+ you
know I've got two bars of hspa+ right
now so not you know particularly great
but the speeds where I am haven't been
all that great but again that's you know
the issue more with the coverage right
here and in my home office I was using
it earlier today had to go somewhere and
not using a wall on the car because
don't use your phone while you're
driving but I used it you know when I
got there and the speeds were a little
bit better obviously it has Wi-Fi the
Wi-Fi works great so there you go a
couple other you know little niggles
which are as
about androids anything else I androids
just too complicated still it's too
complicated for the average person to
really get the most out of i knows you
know for tech enthusiasts for android
fans for all that absolutely i know this
doesn't necessarily apply to you and you
know it's so customizable it's great
with the widgets and you know the
notification customizations and
everything and the shortcut apps and all
that stuff absolutely fantastic
notification system is great you know
all these widgets you can add but you
get a device like this and you know on
the one hand HTC has done a great job
making things easier to use on the other
hand it's more complicated for instance
I've got the HTC mail app and then the
gmail app also now this didn't come with
the gmail app widget you know or app
shortcut rather on the homescreen add
that myself because I couldn't set up my
company email via the mail app it's just
I couldn't get it to work and so then I
went into the gmail app and it was able
to parse it no problem and so you know
why do I need both or you know even
worse somebody's not as tech savvy as me
the average consumer is going to see
this and think you know why are there
both of these here maybe they won't ever
find the gmail or maybe they'll try the
mail and it won't work with their
account and then the wonder what's going
on so you know things like that other
things up even more egregious I think
because that's kind of a specific
example where my account you know my
email account wouldn't work with the HTC
mail app but the personalized menu right
so this is great and everything two
things that I tried to change right out
of that one my notifications were set up
where the phone would make noise there
would be a notification tone when I got
new email I wanted to turn that off
immediately because I get so much email
there's no point in having that happen
it took me so long to figure out how to
do this again I'm tech-savvy amused two
phones but I haven't used an android
phone I used one the galaxy s for a
little while but not many in the last
several months and not an HTC android
phone in a while so it was kind of like
starting from scratch but being a tech
savvy person and I was like well how do
I do it I went to sound set that's not
going to do it that's a whole bunch of
prepackaged sounds and you can't change
it up there you can set up I could set
up a new sound set I create a brand new
one but I never thought to actually do
that you know and that's I don't want to
create a new sound set I just want
turn off the email ringer so then I went
to ringtone not there then I went to
notification sound you'd think oh that
would do it right so email great sorry
I'm going to go in and will default
alpha get more but where's the 14 off or
silent not in there what I wound up
having to do was I had to go all the way
back into my mail program and then from
inside my account I had it the menu
button on the bottom which android users
will know you know you can always hit
the menu button and and half the time
you'll get you know more options
sometimes you won't but then from in
there I had to go to more and for more
settings and then inside of settings
there's email notifications where you
can change the ringtone the vibrate
notify wants and in ringtone there now I
have a silent option that's you know
drilling down way too far in general for
such a I would think a highly important
thing that a lot of people are going to
want to mess around with especially when
the phone set by default out of the box
at least mine was to ring ring ring
every time I get a new email and who
wants that just wait it's buried too far
and it's not what the rest of the sounds
and that just doesn't make any sense
similar thing with turning off the
haptic feedback when i was typing on the
on-screen keyboard not where i expected
it to be just there are too many things
like that that and it's not just android
you know its technology in general and
gadgets and stuff but android in
particular in the mobile phone space
there's so much you can do with it but
but it's like they need to run it
through the common sense filter one more
time to make it easier for the for just
you know smartphones are becoming such
big business so many people are buying
them and they're getting it's like that
saying that you only use ten percent of
your brain i think people only use like
five percent of their smartphones
because they're just they're just too
complicated and too hard to use anyway
my little rant being over you know
that's kind of my two biggest negatives
here on the device are you know the
difficulty of certain setup and
customization features and then AT&amp;amp;T
service the hspa+ you know Iran where is
it I ran speedtest earlier and again you
know where I am is not good right so I
know that
it was just kind of funny here i'll run
it side by side just for fun with an
iphone for both you know with Wi-Fi off
and sorry i just got text message both
of them with Wi-Fi off just off the
cellular network and you know these
results your mileage may vary and I hope
it does because these results were just
pitiful that being said HSPA was faster
sorry about the glare here overhead Wow
we'll begin test on both of them and
this you know not the devices fall and
not the fault of HTC and you know where
you live even for me if I went you know
four blocks away probably be better but
I'm just going to show you this because
it's kind of funny so this is a little
bit better actually than I was getting
earlier I got 983 down I got 1.5 down on
the iphone interesting earlier the
results were reversed but much much
worse I got 300 up on the inspire point
9 or 90 to say you know 1.5 up point
nine down but 15 down point I not sorry
with 387 milliseconds ping on the iphone
and then ninety a three-down 307 up a
307 ping latency on the inspire so the
inspire faster all the way around except
for download interesting try that one
more time just for the heck of it again
don't use these these results as
anything other than just may as well
test because I'm doing the review
because the coverage like I said is
really bad where I am so are we getting
now there you go a little bit better 1.4
down on the aspire you know this being
said just to be fair on verizon using
their 4g modem the other day in this
same exact building where i am i did I I
was consistently getting at least 12
down and at one point I got 21 down I
got basically uh you know 10 times as
fast so anyway I'm talking about 21
megabytes down
it would be like 21,000 set of 14 for
whatever that's worth anyway so alright
iphone one point oh eight down one point
oh four up and then on the aspire one
point four down point three up so again
you know where I am it's very sketchy
there you go enough of that though just
kind of recap here spire 4G 99 bucks on
contract it's a solid solid Android
device I like HTC's customization I
still think there's work to be done on
Android in general and even HTC in the
personalization there's some things are
too hard to find but all in all it's a
nice phone very responsive big screen
makes it easier to type on solid camera
with HD capture and you know if you
don't need a dual-core processor and you
don't need a front facing camera and you
don't need a slide-out QWERTY keyboard
this is a great option to look at for an
android phone and a lot of you know this
is basically the the US version of the
HTC Desire HD so if you're not in the US
and you're interested in this check out
the desire HD there you go you know what
for a not full review that sure was 15
minutes plus of me yapping but what can
I tell you it's how I do things hope you
enjoyed it thanks for checking it out
don't forget to check out techno
buffalos coverage of the palm HP palm
webos event and and then you know Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona is starting
on Sunday februari 13th I'll be over
there a bunch of press conferences
sunday evening Barcelona time morning
and afternoon us time but I'm headed
over there friday it's a long long
flight from where I am so John will have
more with the atrix or the atrix the
inspire the HS comes in all that stuff
till then my name is Noah thanks for
watching I'll buy oh by the way thanks
AT&amp;amp;T for loaning us the phone buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
