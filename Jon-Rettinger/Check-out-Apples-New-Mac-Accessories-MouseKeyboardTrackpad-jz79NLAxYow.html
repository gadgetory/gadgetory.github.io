with technobuffalo and we're looking at
the three card three device monte of the
new Apple peripherals we're looking at
the magic trackpad the magic mouse and a
magic keyboard got a lot to unbox here
so let's get right into it i'm going to
ask Niven here for my trusty missin your
stabby over here so that we can get to
opening these things I actually did
myself the favor of making a few pilot
holes actually this is really unsafe I
don't know why we do this this has got
to be some kind of like an insurance
liability but here we are so I cut the
box just a little bit but we're gonna
live we're gonna be just fine here's
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna play it
smart you guys I'm gonna play it smart
I'm gonna use this knife right now for
all of these so my god I'm gonna hurt
myself there we go alright I cut the box
again that's fine no big deal we're
going to get all this stuff off of here
so these new devices are awesome I'm
excited about the magic trackpad you'll
see why in just a second but the other
two are generally the same you'll see
the form factor is pretty close here we
go thank you sir alright so why don't we
take a quick look at that will start
over here with a magic keyboard the
magic keyboard is a little bit different
Wow there's really not much to that
you'll see on the side of the device
where is there we go so if you're
familiar with the old wireless keyboards
from Apple you'll remember used to be
rounded right here on the end for that
power button no more it's now got a kind
of just tapered slope look to it and
then on the back you've got a lightning
port right here which is where you're
going to pair and charge you've got your
power switch over here and you've got
what I believe is a plastic outlet for
the Bluetooth signal to escape from
since the rest of the device is mostly
aluminum it's really really light and
the other major difference is you're not
going to be able to see obviously but
this this is the same mechanism the new
mechanism that's in the
new macbook keyboards as well so this is
going to type a little bit differently
have a little bit of different travel
and where I can't wait to try it out
there's going to be a little bit of a
different unboxing obviously we've also
got a cable in here for all those
lightning necessary things that we're
going to need to do with this it's going
to be a little bit different once we're
done here we're actually going to go and
set these up and take a quick look at
how they behave and operate the magic
mouse is just sitting right inside there
just like the the keyboard was just
sitting right there and the magic mouse
again looks very very similar let's see
if we get a cable in this one too yep
we've got a cable right here man we've
had lightning cables to lower now so the
magic mouse again looks very very
similar to the old model there's a
couple of things that it that they say
have changed supposedly down here on the
bottom these stripes are going to be
much easier to glide across services
whether it's a soft surface a hard
surface mouse pad or not you'll also see
the distinct lack of a battery door
that's because all these new devices are
all rechargeable so right here you're
going to see you've got that lightning
port again it's going to be a little
funny a little awkward to charge it on
inside and then you've got a power
switch up there right up at the top
otherwise and believe it's just about a
millimeter or two longer but it feels
about the same in the hand I don't use a
magic mouse on the on the day-to-day
anymore so I'm excited to play with this
and see if it makes that big of a
difference lastly but certainly not
least Lee the magic trackpad and this is
the one that I'm most excited about when
the magic trackpad came out I was really
really stoked to be able to do all the
same gestures that I do on the computer
when I'm using a laptop and it had its
fair share of issues a lot of Minecraft
and stopped working this new one again
has that slate same sloped design and
there it is and it operates a little bit
differently and it of course has force
touch which is what the the track pads
on the computers all have these days and
of course famously the iphone 6s has in
the form of 3d touch now you'll see
again that top bar is gone it's
approximately thirty percent larger than
the old magic trackpad it's a nice big
surface area it's all nice and soft
seems pretty like a good
balance between grippy and soft but
because it uses force touch for just
about all the input there's absolutely
no travel here at all when it's off the
old magic trackpad had a sensor not a
sensor but a click on the feet now at
the bottom so it would actually rock
from one side to the other so you could
push up here but it wasn't comfortable
to do so because you were so close to
the hinge now you can push anywhere but
we're not going to be able to demo that
for you right now while it's off so what
do you say we go take a quick look at
the setup process for these and get a
few couple of first impressions of what
I think of the new magic trackpad
alright guys we are here to set up these
new Apple devices and keyboard the mouse
in the trackpad let's start the mouse
okay so all apple says usually have to
do is plug this sucker in turn it on and
it should pair automagically and then
you can unplug it yup there we go now
ready to use let's pop into the settings
here really quickly cool so we can see
we've got a magic mouse to connected pop
in a mouse over here there we go look at
that smart zoom let's turn that on let's
turn on secondary click let's check out
more gestures with swype team pages all
that stuff this is that that's nothing
terribly new the magic mouse is remain
basically the same domain difference is
that that door is gone and it's
rechargeable now so let's go ahead and
switch this guy off well come will deal
with you later let's switch over to the
brand new magic trackpad the magic
trackpads the one of the biggest amount
of changes let's switch that sucker on
let's do the same thing keep an eye on
the screen they're ready to use there we
go done and done so the other really
cool thing here is underneath the
trackpad settings you're going to check
out right here silent clicking so you
can listen to this right here ready you
can hear that device clicking that's
actually that doesn't even happen let's
turn it off you'll hear you hardly hear
anything so there is actually a little
bit of travel on the trackpad but you
can't hear anything when it's off
doesn't do anything doesn't go anywhere
where you turn it on that's when you
start to feel and hear that simulated
click but it's got a noise to it you can
turn on silent clicking
much much quieter it's not exactly
silent but it's much much quieter
without it turned on bit louder there so
it's a really great cool looking track
but I'm really silent so I'm clicking
turned on let's let's go ahead and pair
this keyboard as well boom ready to use
unplug it just plug it right in when
it's running out of juice and you should
be good to go apple says these will give
you an enormous amount of use for just a
few minutes to hours of charging should
be able to get hours and hours and days
of usage out of the trackpad of the
mouse and the keyboard with just a
little bit of charges so that's pretty
cool too that's basically all there is
to it I can't wait to use this thing for
a little bit longer i'm excited to edit
some videos with with this sucker it's a
lot more surface area and its really
nice and smooth and it feels like the
tracking is really nice and tactile
which is which I really like a lot the
shallowness of the keyboard not quite so
much the keyboards really really shallow
now this thing is super shallow it
really does feel just like the keyboard
on the brand new macbook that you can go
and check out so you it it's a little
weird especially with like the space bar
the space where such a large button and
I hit it all the time and I kind of Miss
how much travel the old one had but
maybe i'll get used to this one who
knows we'll see that's a quick look at
the brand new peripherals over here from
Apple the rechargeable ones I realize
you guys have been clamoring to see what
they look like in the flesh you can
check out a bunch more information on
the site and as always thank you guys
for watching be kind of one another and
i'll catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
