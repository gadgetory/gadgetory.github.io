the term cloud computing what that means
is controlling a computer with an
operating system operating essentially
in the clouds meaning you're using a
server located somewhere else in the
world and you're doing everything just
through your browser with nothing stored
locally well virtual operating systems
have been around really not a cloud
based operating system and this company
called iCloud is actually the first one
to put out a beta and alpha release of a
full web-based operating system so go
ahead and show you what this looks like
if you're using Internet Explorer for a
PC it's in beta for using Firefox like
I'm using on a Mac it's just in alpha so
you can see the website here it's ofci
cloud comm and you can sign up for a
free username and password so I'm gonna
log in here and show you guys what that
looks like now since this is an alpha it
runs a little bit slow and a little bit
buggy but it still is very impressive
but you have a full operating system
right in your desktop meaning you can
download a file or save an email close
your desktop and open up your browser on
another computer at your office or at
somebody else's home and have all access
to your files it actually is very cool
but saying right here welcome to the
social cloud show you some widgets and
stuff well close this right now
some status messages appear online so
here it is this is your operating system
you've got a trash can a calendar you
can invite friend your mail your movies
my cloud photos and write all right up
here down below and just have a sort of
windows vista XP look to it
down here you've got control panels I'm
an assistant manager you can see all
your processes that you're running
they documents or transactions that
you've done actually have a full command
line prompt if that's you're saying you
want to control it's from a boss like
standpoint you also have full control
panels here telling you about your
system you can see it's running a little
bit slow and a little bit buggy but you
can definitely still see what's here all
your applications that you have open
file types it doesn't seem to be a
relatively robust
and it's it's amazing that it's actually
just on the web it seems to be as usable
as some of those instant on Linux OS ins
I assume that this is Linux based you
can select your language right down here
so let's see what some of this stuff
looks like here let's open up write and
see what happens it compatible with your
browser we like to continue so this is
an example of just being an alpha
release let's say yes and see what
happens okay it's opened up anyway
you've got a like a simple text editor
here similar to WordPad go ahead and
close that up
photos you can still view all your
photos in a storm just in the cloud I'm
not so sure how much harddrive space
they allow you or how many gigs of
storage you can have but it's very cool
that you can have you option do this
here's my cloud see that gives us some
more information so you get a full
document Explorer - this looks very much
like Windows Explorer whether you can
just go through and tell all your
documents you do not have the ability to
right-click however you can just
left-click so very Mac friendly my cloud
OS it just lists everything kind of
hierarchically applications appointments
bookmarks is your Cloud Drive so go tell
me how much harder is base a little nope
it just lists what's in it it's got a
full mail client you can watch movies
supposedly as is platform of charge from
alpha and then to beta and then to
release candidate I think you can really
can be used as a very useful platform it
really could take computing to the next
level you don't have to worry about what
OS you're on you just all you just web
browser which is actually very neat in
that web browser certainly has to be
running in some sort of operating system
but you can run in a very rudimentary
operating system and still have some
access to all your files if I were to
you know maximize the window kind of cut
you off but you can see you got a run in
full screen and ready to look just like
any other router I don't have any movies
here in this iCloud but they will play
right here
and now it's loading up YouTube let's
see how that looks so again slower a
little bit buggies and just an alpha
candidate anyway guys I wanted to show
you this really cool webOS you see up
here Firefox alpha brought to you by
iCloud game guides John Retton juror for
