TechnoBuffalo and you may be asking
yourselves what am I doing with the
Samsung wb800f some galaxy s2 find out
after this awesome intro so this is my
review of the Samsung wb800f camera
fortified with Wi-Fi it belongs to
Samsung's family of smart cameras
cameras that do the thinking themselves
however I had to do a lot of thinking
for this camera but we'll get to that in
this review but for now we'll kick
things off with design aside from the WB
150 F snazzy matte black finish it's
pronounced right-hand grip and it's
independent video record button there's
really not much that separates this
camera from a traditional
point-and-shoot design we have a 4-way
directional pad on back there's a 3-inch
460k display and i got to be honest the
quality of the display is not that great
it's pixelated and exhibits jaggies on
edges the one big benefit though of this
camera is it's 18x optical zoom
however the f3 point to base aperture is
not that impressive when you compare it
to brighter lenses now as for features
the WB 150 F is packed to the brim for
the average consumer this camera has so
many different modes and we'll start
with the more advanced modes there's a
full manual mode with a shutter speed
that goes down to 16 seconds for longer
exposures there's an ISO range that goes
up to 3200 and we have aperture
adjustment as well exposure compensation
the whole nine yards and we have a
regular PASM assembly now if you're more
of a scene mode shooter and you like fun
creative effects this camera has you
covered
aside from a slew of scene modes
including a panorama sweep mode there's
also a library of different fun creative
effects and filters things like putting
your face on a magazine cover a
billboard crazy sketch filters artsy
filters the WB 150 F had more creative
and fun art filters than I've ever
seen on any digital camera to date and
now for the negatives the interface was
exceedingly sluggish and the battery
life was kind of mediocre but the big
news in the feature Department is the WV
150 FS Wi-Fi mode let me walk you
through the Wi-Fi mode on the WV 150f so
first we're going to choose social
sharing and you have to enter your ID
and password your Facebook ID and
password and you have to do it using
this four-way directional pad which is
really kind of ancient and medieval okay
so once you have finally have that enter
you can select through pictures and
videos check them off you can see the
interface is a bit sluggish on this
thing too and you could type in a
comment if you want and then you just
send it right over
now we're going to do something
involving a Galaxy s2 which will
interest a lot of TechnoBuffalo of yours
here we're gonna do mobile link connect
to the WB 150 F okay now it's connected
okay now we can do mobile link here we
go and the two devices are communicating
right now so all of my images are
showing up on the phone so I can do
basically the same thing as I did with
Facebook check them off and then
transfer them over all right here we are
wireless viewfinder and look at that so
now the phone acts as a wireless
viewfinder this was my favorite feature
and you could use this without having to
connect to a wireless network by zooming
in here it's it's really sluggish though
and I can also take a picture with the
phone using the phone as a remote and
then the picture saves a picture of
video saves on the phone and the camera
and now for image quality I usually
don't get a chance to be hard on a
camera in this department but this is
one of those rare occasions where I'm
gonna have to do that
the Samsung wb800f cs2 I discovered a
lot of issues first of all there was the
ghosting and the flaring and that was a
tribute
- the Schneider lens unfortunately a lot
of these images are gonna look hazy and
around the edges they're gonna look soft
in addition anything past ISO 200 is
going to get really noisy the small
sensor just can't handle all of the 14
megapixels this carried over to video
mode as well which has a max resolution
of 720p 30 frames per second in video
mode I found a lot of compression a lot
of jagged edges and long lines and just
an overall lack of color depth so
overall what I got from the WB 150th was
a very basic point-and-shoot performance
on par with a samsung galaxy s2 so now
it's time for my buffalo call with the
Samsung wb800f controls and it has an
18x optical zoom it also has that snazzy
matte black finish but is that enough to
make you put down your Galaxy S 2 for me
it really wasn't the image quality alone
on The WB 150 F was just not worth it
unless you're taking super close-up
macro shots or you're just using a bunch
of creative filters to put on Facebook
this camera cannot be taken as a serious
contender when compared to the
competition from panasonic and Canon
furthermore I really didn't see any need
for the Wi-Fi functionality on this
camera
other than the wireless viewfinder which
is pretty fun and that was just about it
yes it's nice to have Wi-Fi features on
a point-and-shoot but the interface
needs to be severely revamped for the
full Samsung wb800f low calm until next
time I'm Mike Pearlman
what for crazy boy stay cool boy got a
rocket in your pocket dude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
