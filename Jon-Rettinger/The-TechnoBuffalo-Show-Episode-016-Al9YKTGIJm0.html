techni Buffalo show I'm live your to
host for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site and i'm joined by executive
editor mobile Todd Hazleton hey
everybody yes no Joey this week he's on
vacation but to be fair next week there
will be no Todd because he'll be on
vacation yeah that's right that's um a
year it's that time here except for me I
you know I wait till November yeah when
it's cool and you go to cold places you
know the funny thing is England which
I've gone to for the past three years is
actually warmer than kirksville wow
that's pretty I said it'll be like in
the 20s here and when i get to
manchester i'll be like 52 no I mean
yeah I get Stan into like the high 30s
at night that's warmer than Missouri for
whatever odd reason so with even without
Joey we have several things we want to
go over first half Todd I would like to
start showing you pictures of sad
puppies and see how this affects your
emotional state facebook yeah I know
that wasn't on the show notes but the
more i think about that they have to
talk about yeah i'll turn on my little
logo down there yeah that's crazy so
facebook published a report in a journal
that they were tooling with the emotions
of their users in a way that so like
some users would see i think was like
six hundred eighty thousand users right
so some would see primarily posts that
were negative feeling and the others
would see positive and then what they
found was that they can actually change
the emotions of their users by showing
them different types of posts now that
seems kind of obvious right like if
you're watching a sad movie you might be
sad you're watching a comedy you might
be happy but i think the big question is
did facebook invade our privacy or you
know that protected however we're
protected online and now one of the UK
regulators independent regular said
today that they're going to investigate
facebook to see if they broke those laws
and the facebook faces of fine I think
of like 500,000 pounds which is less
risk for facebook like we said the
article but they could also force
facebook to change policies which I
think would be wise I mean obviously
everybody's doing a/b testing that's
what facebook does on a daily basis see
what their users are doing how they're
interacting with this site I mean you'll
see a lot of big news sites we don't do
it so much but big news sites will have
like two headlines and they'll see which
ones more attractive depending on the
demographic and stuff so that kind of
testing I feel like is fair game but
this whole like psychological like
they're actually tooling with people's
emotions making people sad by showing
sad content that's kind of weird well
there are times where we send out one
headline to the actual site and we send
out a different headline to Google right
right that's not an emotional test in
there is the I I've grown up around
psychologists and I have psychologists
friends and this has to be about the
most unethical test I have ever heard of
in my life right yeah it's crazy yeah I
can't believe you I mean and it's public
to like they're not keeping a secret
they actually published the results in a
general but I love how they're like we
don't see a problem with this you know
it's one of those things we're like you
start to wonder like I don't like
honestly I'm not worried about my
privacy on facebook whatever but I'm
just like wow there's it's just a
company that's doing that I don't really
want to use that service and it reminds
me of a rumors is a rumor I heard but I
forget who told me the Foursquare CEO
dennis crowley apparently copied a bib
for the Boston Marathon this year a bib
number that was somebody else is just so
we could run in the race and knowing
that the CEO of a company that i use did
that I was like wow I really don't want
to use foursquare anymore like that's
such a terrible move so like that's what
bothers me that people think they can
get away with this kind of stuff I i I'm
I'm befuddled I am completely befuddled
but I I had to address that it's been
bothering me all week I I don't use
Facebook that much you know so I really
can't tell you you know if I was
involved in the test or not because most
of the time my you know timeline is
filled with old high school friends
going
hey what's everyone done yeah yeah see I
use it more when the news feed was in
order of most recent and now it's just
sort of the way Facebook's playing with
this like they're just throwing the most
popular one so it thinks you're gonna
want to read and that's not how I
operate well you know what's for my
personal blog that was actually I
published my full post to my facebook
page and that was actually how jon
rettinger kept up with my blog and now
under this new system he can't remember
the last time he saw one of my posts and
we both thought that you know there
should be a way for him to mark I want
to see these right you know and there's
not you know Facebook is what's
important to you and that happens with
fan pages to like if you like
TechnoBuffalo that doesn't mean you're
gonna see our posts unfortunately it's
like it'll populate but it doesn't mean
that they're always going to be right in
front of you because it is their
algorithms which is why exactly so we
did have some topics we wanted to get to
this weekend and I wanted to sidetrack
there for a minute so galaxy s5 mini was
announced this week who what do you
think is the reason that the companies
have decided you know why not call it
something else why call yeah I can see
them well I've talked to when like some
of the presence of HTC for example the
president Jason Mackenzie had explained
once that one of the reasons they have
these many devices is to fill out the
families so like you someone goes in and
store if they're not gonna for whatever
reason the HTC One m8 screen is too big
but they still want like a premium
product of one that matches that family
then they go with the smaller one which
is often more affordable they put
slightly lower clock speed processors
and stuff like that inside of them so
that was the explanation I've had and
then they usually have like in the case
of HTC they another family of devices
for the mid-tier so like in that case
its desire for that even lower price
points and so I think that's what
Samsung's doing here and also in a lot
of the in the talks I've had with other
journalists you I know there's a demand
for bones with like 4.5
4.7 inch screens so I think Samson is
also meeting that market and probably
giving everybody the options across the
board which i think is good and I think
it's great that they kept things like
the heart rate monitor and the
fingerprint reader and all of that so
it's not really a huge sacrifice ip67
resisting its water and dust well the
thing with the seemed to me the mini
name doesn't say like budget to me it's
right if it's someone those walking in
it would make me think I'm getting less
for my money hmm yeah which is true in
some cases in terms of like the
processor in storage in law cases but I
don't know um I do know that they try to
like keep that name the galaxy s5 in
these products and then just sell like a
smaller version too so that people who
don't buy the five have that other
option right a me and with the galaxy s5
a especially with the galaxy s4 it was
definitely a fact that it was a family
because you had the zoom the act of the
many and the galaxy s4 itself and in the
same track is happening what they call
the active for the s5 what was the sum
they called it the active again but they
didn't a sprint has a different version
I remember that that's right I'm staying
at the sprint version yes so I can
understand I just the whole concept of
the mini phone I and I again I
understand word we're different
creatures were not your average consumer
you know whenever they come out with a
product and they say yo starts at this
price we all immediately go okay now how
much is it going to cost for our version
right and we're going to maxs everything
out right 32 gigs of storage version
yeah it's just usually I mean you look
at it's usually like a hundred bucks
more for whatever reason even though
story is dirty for these companies well
especially like you we keep talking
about project ara yeah they're like oh
the frame will be fifty dollars over
like yeah and how much are we going to
spend on my lap and everything else I
want yeah right right left right we're
going to buy the best camera we're gonna
buy the largest memory capacity we're
gonna buy
the best processor yep it's true end up
being a thousand-dollar phone right yeah
I don't know and then yeah it will be
expensive yeah it'll be nuts I mean you
look at what we're talking about even
with the iphone 6 rumors in the 5.5 inch
screen that's apparently going to be a
hundred dollars more but that makes
sense right because the display is the
most expensive component typically and I
think Apple was going to add other
standout features like the optical image
stabilization OIS and stuff like that so
so we have a question here from plays
Flame do you think the quote mini
unquote phones released by Samsung HTC
etc with their four and a half inch
screens has had an impact on iphone
users with their 3.5 or four inch
screens yeah certainly I think that's I
think a huge impact to the point where
Apple was addressing it now with the
rumored 4.7 inch iphone to sort of you
know come back and answer these 4.5 inch
in 4.7 inch screens because I think HTC
Samsung LG have all done a really really
good job motorola especially with the
Moto X showing that you can have a 4.5
inch 4.7 inch screen that's not too big
for users who still think five inch
screens are big and they are out there
like I'm pretty used to a 5-inch screen
these days but I still go out with
friends and they're like what are you
carrying a tablet you know because I
deal with it every day to me it doesn't
seem so big but so yeah there you go
galaxy mega was at 63 yep the 6-3 yeah
so yeah so I think they have had an
impact for sure on out and of course
that you know the question falls when
can I get a galaxy w yeah so big though
I mean even the the what-is-it Lumia
1520 with the 6 inch screen I feel
really weird holding that up to my head
damn but I mean likely I'm a giant
so I mean yeah you look at the 6.3 my
hand it doesn't i have anything really
nothing i don't think i have anything
that big floating around
yeah I mean am I and for those of you
listening on audio i'm holding the 6.3
and i i'm i'm still it's normal yeah I'm
six foot four Sammy it looks like a
normal-size phone it does now they're do
kill my hand with I don't know and I
forgot to turn off my air conditioner so
excuse me for just one moment Todd while
you talk about mini phones hahaha hey
everybody I'm just here talking about
mini fun maybe you'll open up that
curtain today huh anyway so I guess what
shawne's getting on about and we're
getting back to the answer there was
these mini phones and can they take are
they an answer in an impact on the
iphone and i think absolutely they are
and that's why we're going to see Apple
boosted yet again because it already
they already moved up to 4 inches and
now we're going to go to 47 which i
think is the right move and now you know
with the screen technology and parts
getting smaller than ever you can
actually have those nice big displays
and like Moto X showed us without that
too much bulk in your hands that's uh
was that Christopher miles questioning
your answering tub yeah I was just going
back to that okay no problem well I
should know this is the question for
cursor miles with the iphone probably
going to at least 4.7 inches do you
think android vendors will try to
seriously address the sub 5 inch market
that's an interesting question because
they've all been going to the phablet
size is there a chance that they're
going to try to come back under 5 inches
to compete with this um yes i think will
always see that and that's what we see
with the s5 mini the one mini i think
they're going to continually hit that
market yeah i mean i don't think
anything's going to change in that port
I think it's actually Apple answering to
these android devices rather than
android and answering Apple especially
if you look at the market share globally
it's it's going to continue to be that
way I think well Christopher miles has a
follow-up question that is definitely
fitting do you think other OEMs will
follow Sony's lead with the z1 compact
rock like level smaller phone I really
hope so but from what I've heard when I
talked to companies there's no interest
in doing that so
I don't think it's gonna happen why not
though I know I think it's a great idea
i'd love that Sony did that I think a
lot of people did it got great press and
yet people I mean nobody else has done
this and we unlike with HTC for example
a lot of times before the one mini came
out last year we really thought that
they were gonna sort of beef that up and
and it didn't happen and this of course
didn't happen this year which is wild
because what they do then is launched
bigger phablets with all this hardware
and I think a lot of people want the
smaller phone so yeah there's definitely
a market there you know I not everybody
wants their flagship phone to be you
know 5.1 5.2 you know or larger so you
know and so if the rumors are true about
the iphone 6 a in theory we're going to
get the exact same specs in two
different sizes phones mm-hmm but you
know that that says a lot I think you
know I I think there is a market out
there of course I mean apples Apple
they're going to do whatever they want
so right but i think if this 5.5 inch
iphone is real and it seems like it is
this is definitely an answer to all the
phablet's out there to Samsung I mean
finally because when the note the
original note came out that was like
almost a joke or every was like what
that's huge is crazy and now it's such a
popular handset everybody's looking
forward to the note for this year and so
Apple is answering that and particularly
in the in the conversations I've had
with these companies Asia is a big
market for these big screen devices and
I think apple is obviously trying to
push forward in China China Mobile's the
world's largest wireless carrier so I
think it's pretty important to have the
devices they want their although the
price points the apples been missing the
price point they don't come low enough
in China group well speaking of options
you know like many phones and z1 compact
and all that something I wanted to
address that you and I have talked about
time and time again annoys us both
colors yeah oh I don't to show me
nothing ain't I cannot for the life of
me figure out nobody in their right mind
is going to go out and buy say
white galaxy s5 and then three months
later a blue one comes out they're gonna
go oh I got great adeline but that's
what's so annoying right because I want
the blue one at lodge like or the red
one Emmy which looks amazing by the way
but it's exclusive to verizon I I think
what the companies aren't think about is
all they're actually doing is setting up
animosity from their current owners
right and like the early yeah the early
adopters who are kind of like ah yeah so
more and more people are going to end up
waiting three to six months because they
want a specific color hey exactly which
is easy I understand like I talked to
tmobile and Sony once when they were
launching the i want to say was this d1s
and they said well purple only available
online not store and I'm like why is
that and they said well and I guess you
know from retail experience to that they
can't carry all this stock of like all
these different colors in each store
versus having a warehouse where it ships
from from online so I get that but like
the galaxy s5 if it's just online in
blue from AT&amp;amp;T I'd like to be able to
buy it but it's not even available from
them and then there's a position you you
put a color card up because people that
tend to go to carrier stores aren't
going to be the same ones that shop
online so they're actually missing sales
by not least having a color card up in
the store saying we can ship you the
purple yeah but it's a crazy thing I
guess is that in what we're talking
about is like eighteen t say or whatever
t-mobile who cares has their current
black and white models of the phone and
then all of a sudden three months later
Samsung's like oh now we're giving you
the exclusive blue model and that's
what's so frustrating it should have
just been available start and believe us
folks we know we're being nitpicky we're
talking about colors for crying out loud
but we should say why we're talking
about it because the rumors of this
yellow Nexus 5 that keep popping up and
Sean and I are both just like are you
kidding me it's a year old phone I mean
I love the nexus 5 it's great phone oh
yeah meanwhile these pictures are it's
it's the picture of the phone
bumper yeah well it now to be fair there
was the one mention of the word yellow
on the site so it's possible yeah yeah
but I just I I don't understand why they
don't do all the colors at once I yeah
you tried to offer as much choice as you
can at the beginning to appease every
customer because if a customer comes in
and they're looking and they go well you
know I by the galaxy s5 if it was in
blue but this phone in blue over here
I'm gonna go with this one and then
three months later oh now they release a
blue yeah right it's crazy you know I
just think you know the yellow Nexus 5
let's just stay it's not called lollipop
and it's called lemon something then I
could see why that's launch okay here's
why they will never call it lemon why oh
cuz yeah if you like a lemon like a bad
car they they will not call it lemon
meringue they will not call it lemon
tarts I will not call it lemon yeah
you'd have reporters out there like
Android lemons a lemon exactly no way
lemon is involved in that tight hole
yeah you're right but anyway that was my
theory now here's an interesting thought
from Brantley gemston should they have a
phone with a body that changes color
with LCD light Debbie create that
awesome your battery life would be awful
nah not really with LCDs yeah I know but
when you look at these devices most of
the time I guess they're better now but
usually under battery it's the one thing
that's consuming here yeah but uh or go
to the mo letters I just bought my first
LCD light bulb oh yeah and it's drawing
9 wats up now that's led o le D I'm
sorry yeah you're Kelly Dean only be
because the pixels turn own and often
stuff like a light yes your you are a
hundred percent right now I imagine
that's probably what Brantley was
thinking as well yes LED would make a
world of difference but yes so a phone
line with LED
lights that you could change the color
as you want or make a blank or not be
bent in half and half their baby hey I
just I just bought my first LED light
bulb and yeah it was expensive as heck
but man it puts a good light and it's
drawing nine watch for 60 watts
equivalent of incandescent blah i'll
tell more attractive looking than the
curly CFLs here and he'll me lime pie
that's a good question um is lime pie
really a dessert no I think it's key
lime pie yeah yeah because we actually
thought we thought Kit Kat was going to
be key lime pie for a long time mm-hmm
because we didn't realize license names
were a possibility yeah and that's a
funny story back at Mobile World
Congress I guess what was it 2012 i
think they met with nestle and decided
on that free well yeah uh from
christopher miles how big of a factor do
you think color plays in choosing a
phone it didn't seem to help out that
much with moto x all that much that's a
good question i think it's video yeah no
I and to be very blunt we don't think
color plays a lot of options and they
get a case in like if it yeah I mean
wouldn't be my iphone is in a case all
the time and yes I purposefully bought
an atrocious color so I yeah everyone
always asks me by the my phones in such
an ugly case but yeah I eat so we don't
think that the color really does play
much of an option it's just we don't
understand why the companies don't just
release all the options at once to
appeal to the most consumers possible
yeah that's where we're confused exactly
and the Moto X I think it actually did
help because it's one of the few phones
I mean the only phone in the United
States where you can go and it's a like
I want the pink one with the blue camera
well that's the only one good yeah
exactly whether that was kind of cool
and it's grateful yeah I was tempted to
get to get a moto x the the whole thing
was the screen size was a little small
for me I
i was i'm still using an LG g2 yes i
have three phones i'm currently using
and it will replace my LG g2 and like I
really like the LG g2 screen size so
that's why I didn't end up going with a
medal of X yeah that's a perfect example
of a phone with a big screen in a
compact body because the bezels just do
not there the g2 is an awesome phone I
can't wait to i'm going out to irvine
here in a couple weeks and I'll finally
get to play with the g3 yeah I want to
play with the g3 more I haven't had food
for much so we'll see if I make it out
of the office with the g3 when i leave i
got no you seen the g3 bye everybody do
i do the Nexus 5 I just bought it off
them oh why not yes uh let's see what
else would we hope I I don't even know
how to address this because I don't
fully understand the whole t mobile
billing situation yeah I know I'd you
know what Brandon covered that more than
I did so I was only reading his coverage
but you know it's apparently they were
tacking on these premium SMS charges
onto customer bills but make kind of
hiding them apparently so it was hard to
see so there's billions billions right
they said of dollars or was it million
Sonny was billions which is crazy um and
then t-mobile CEO comes back and says
like look we've been fighting this it
wasn't us it's it would might have been
these like third parties i think he was
saying and to be so remember llegara has
not been the CEO that long right but
apparently it's been going on since what
I mean 2012 and I think it was ongoing
it wasn't so no no it start they did it
back to two thousand four I went back
that far yes that's way before his time
with them yeah wait and and his fight
now is like look I'm trying to be
transparent i'm saying i am you know to
be fair with that i don't see them being
transparent with everything i think
often we have to come back is the press
and say
like well look I think you really met
this meant this in the case of the the
free music streaming with unlimited ray
plans it's not all unlimited plans as
you found out so I think there are some
cases where they're still not very
transparent and you know we'll just
watch this and see and see how it
unfolds but right now t-mobile's being
accused attacking on billions of charges
and t-mobile says it seems every time
the music streaming commercial comes on
TV now I just SAT there girl mmm yeah
because on stage they said for our
limited subscribers yeah I don't have I
saw subscribed in October I yeah it's
not like it's years ago you don't have
that much to be grandfathered plan yeah
I know exactly so at the time let's see
the November December January February
March April May so it been seven months
since I'd signed up yeah I no longer
qualified as new yeah you were already
grandfathered within a year it's nothing
booth in like a half a year yeah yeah so
that's a problem uh yeah I it was
playing though is that the whole thing
was rolling out yesterday John Legere
who is a very frequent wheat mayo
Twitter user he's just my silent Oh
sudden yeah he came back a little bit
later but he also wasn't making sprint
like hell jokes or ATT jokes or verizon
jokes yeah so I mean that's yeah when
you're trying to fight against all I
mean I'm not even gonna quote what he
said but he was saying that the other
carriers are really bad guys and then
all of a sudden you're accused of
stealing billions of dollars from your
customers like yeah oh that doesn't look
very good yeah thank you for not quoting
on yeah that's a thing like a CEO said
this and like I can't even quote him on
a podcast looking up though yeah right
it's easier to find my every way uh the
the final topic we want to touch on them
we'll get to the other questions I've
come in so the AP now this is this is
not new week
we've heard of this before the AP
announced this week that they're going
to be employing robots to write stock
earning reports mm-hmm and God bless
them because those reports are not fun
they're not fun but I the first time I
heard about robots being used to write
stories was sports reporting and just
like the effort game ends you know it
reads the score reads through the stats
and forms a story and publishes it and I
think it was on average each tree was
going to run them like I want to say
like eight dollars or something like
that right you know which is cheaper
than a human writer in a lot of cases or
not in some cases of places i worked
before TechnoBuffalo yes free lancing
it's not fun yeah I worked one place
where and three dollars opposed yay yeah
I've been paid by the word before it's
weird uh when I was a magazine writer i
was paid by the word yeah yeah yeah yeah
and the best i ever did was fifty cents
a word I don't even remember it wasn't
very much yeah that well it was for as
special unlicensed Star Wars magazine
which I got offered the job right after
I had been approved by Lucasfilm to work
an official Star Wars publication so I
couldn't write under my name oh wow I've
don't pen knees before too yeah so I
will not reveal the pin name but there
are four articles after her under any
way about a dozen under a pen name from
years ago yeah but it was a large
paycheck so I was like a pen name yeah
exactly and they were fine with it so I
was like okay send me a check just make
sure it's not made up to the pen name
yeah a robot that's crazy that they
would actually that they're capable of
doing this I mean I think it talks to
the advances of technology and dictation
but wow we're in trouble
what in the case of techno Buffalo
something I've worked very hard to do is
I don't I try to allow all of you guys
to have your own voice mmm if you read
one of brandon's articles you will not
confuse it with one of your articles
right I'm kind of a boring yeah you
won't confuse me with Joey and so on Amy
and there are sites out there that they
homogenized the way their writers work
and I couldn't tell you know i'll reach
start reading the stories and i have no
clue who wrote it until i look at the
byline right like when you look at for
example the AP when they have these
magic style guides and stuff exactly and
we do follow style gallo we fall style
guides on small things like you should
there be a hyphen and Wi-Fi and you
italicize this type of word and so on
mmm but for the most part you know i
encourage all of you guys to have your
own voices you know and now yes Todd
when you're doing like a stock report
yeah it's dry but when you write one of
your editorials is def not right handed
right definitely not dry the now I
understand that the AP is only playing
to use these robots and business
reporting which is a dry area but it's
so it's gonna be very odd there's gonna
be absolutely no human flavor to it
right yeah I mean it's just gonna be but
I could see like in terms of trying to
get breaking news up quickly which I
assume it's the only reason you really
want to do this I mean I guess if you're
trying to save money on boring stories
but I think for like sports scores
earning to report stuff like that was
like boom it's up then it probably makes
a lot of sense well let's just bring the
headlights like how many I'm curious
about how the headlines will work
because that's one of the most important
things in an article and how does a
robot make a good headline I guess I
could just say like GM q4 earnings yeah
but are you gonna click on that no
that's the same so how know it I can see
where there's an
bitch of readers that will want to read
the style of writing mm-hmm if you can
even call to style because it's an
algorithm um the robotic style I don't
know I I don't feel threatened I don't
see jon rettinger going out and hiring
you know the Todd bought 100 yeah I get
through different industries it makes
sure when the thai baht 400-plus comes
out you know oh I gotta upgrade it got
faster processor it's awesome even on
its worst day it's still running faster
than Todd ever dead that's slowpoke yes
you wanted one of the listeners here
watchers Christopher miles says maybe
OEMs delayed colors to keep phones in
the headlines every couple of months
that's absolutely true yeah i saw that
question i was thinking about as we were
discussing other things i think that's a
very interesting idea there because but
at the same time you're like mainstream
press isn't gonna be writing about only
press like us is going to write about so
are we a big enough your factor for the
companies to i believe what we cater to
to fans right into to enthusiasts and
that's sort of like that's perfect for
these companies releasing new colors but
i think also you'll see and i know that
like Samsung will sometimes come into
New York City and I'm like all you guys
are in town what's up there like well
we're beating with the lifestyle
magazines because we have you know we're
showing them the new colors of the
galaxy s5 and then they get they bring
them in they get photographed and they
show up in next month's issue so in a
lot of ways colors do go to the
mainstream press just not obese Main
Street tech press gotcha no okay that's
interesting hey I like fashion week
stuff you'll see like sometimes they'll
have limited edition cases Oh Fashion
Week okay
Todd I'm sending you there on assignment
yeah yep yep you're going to Fashion
Week there's no choice i want you to
report on all the latest Betty Johnson
designs yeah it was fun with a flourish
yeah wild uh here's a question that is
sure to ignite a firestorm from u sama
Ilana I apologize if I mispronounced
your name which is the best operating
for gaming iOS or and I'm gonna hide in
the corner behind the sheet you know
that that's that's totally unlike I
guess if the games are available that
you want to play pick that platform I'm
trying to tread carefully here look
Android in some ways could be better if
you want a phone with a bigger screen
maybe but you can also play on an iPad
that's all yeah I mean I what mobile
gaming I do I typically do on my iPad so
though terms of graphics though they'll
I mean these things i think the high-end
Android and iPhone look pretty similar
to me I don't really do them side by
side and then we have android has their
new gaming uh engine I guess coming out
but it's named so developer friendly and
not consumer friendly that I forget it
but also iOS Apple has metal that
they're calling and that looked really
really amazing a during the WWDC so
we'll see what comes out of that too but
I I think a lot of it depends on the
hardware that's in the tablet too so
yeah yeah no uh from Sasha Mahal there
he is I wondered where he was yeah what
are your thoughts on google and OEMs on
Android wear TV and auto and how they
aren't laying them put skins on thank
you thank you thank you i love that i
mean and i'm a fan of some of the skins
actually I like since six a lot but i
love the nexus 5 2 and how it's just
pure and simple and i think with Android
wear and the car stuff just leave it
simple otherwise especially if you want
mast adoption among consumers like you
can
I have all this stuff floating rather
you like what the heck's going on I
don't want no I i am totally behind this
because you know somebody that picks up
an HTC phone and then looks at a touch
ways the other grand feels somewhat
similar but at the same time they're
going to go well this isn't exactly like
what I had with the television I think
the you know the best example I heard
about the television is if you're using
a television in your family room it
should have the same interfaces the
television in your bedroom even if it's
from a different manufacturer that
nailed it yeah that's a great that's a
perfect example of how it should work
yeah and why it should have skins the
thing I guess that's crazy though it's
like so Android auto runs on your phone
right you plug it into the system so
it's entirely powered so even though
your phone with android l still has
touchwiz it's just completely stripped
off for the yeah i think once you plug
it into the car it's gonna strip off
TouchWiz and just keep it basic right
and be a different interface on the
witch again I bring up how many cars
actually have displays in them yeah I
don't know I mean you were once right
but like I don't my car doesn't know I
mine definitely doesn't and like I said
last show I just I like putting my phone
up on the dash turn on my directions
that's that from Nathan goalless Rin I
again guys I'm sorry Oh will the Android
L developer version have regular updates
till release Todd you've dealt with the
great question i just installed it on
and it seemed it's actually really
stable for my use i have it uh pretty
much as a daily driver but not with this
same garden i'm carrying it with Wi-Fi
is charging rhino um i hope so because
i'd like to see what else changes and
there are still like bugs especially in
some apps like facebook if you click a
comment does all this weird stuff at
least on my phone so I hope there's
regular updates but I'm also happy that
it's not so buggy that I can't use it
which is what happened to me with iOS 8
honestly beta 2 was still way too buggy
for me I went back
22 7 11 so yeah I don't know I hope it
was regular updates because it'd be cool
to see new features yeah I think there
will be regular updates from taj mahal
do you think android l will be version
4.5 or five point oh I am betting 5 i'm
gonna go 52 because it's such a major
update i mean they they're saying that
they're changing everything and they
really are so i think we'll see it go to
five second geeky reason why L in the
Greek alphabet is 50 oh that's awesome
didn't even know that there you go Nick
yes I yeah I think that's one of the big
I'm really curious why they didn't
reveal the name for Elliott the like
like why hold that back because laughter
taffy is holding up for more money yeah
right there you go will we see shyla
Buffalo on the show Shia LaBeouf lows in
the irvine office so if i do a show
while i'm out there yeah uh from mr.
I'll a buffalo by the way for people who
don't know is a statue of a buffalo that
we have been in the office it was just
featured in the YouTube video it's okay
if you don't know why it's called Shia
LaBeouf alow that dates back to the very
early days of technobuffalo when we held
a contest to name the buffalo and the
logo yep inshallah buffalo won the
contest from mr. Krabs man one two three
what do you guys think of the new
software buttons and android l i
personally prefer the old ones the new
ones look like weird playstation buttons
yes they do they do look like weird
playstation buttons and they look uh I
don't like Toya schleich comical almost
I don't know not comical in the way that
they're funny but like I don't know they
just don't seem very solid me am i funny
to you are you smilin I know comical is
not the right word I meant like comic
sans comical I don't know they just like
rounded but they do look like the
PlayStation buttons which is weird you
think I would have been like uh maybe we
shouldn't put those yeah I I'm not a big
fan of the new buttons I think they look
very much like PlayStation buttons but
yeah well wait for Sony to file a
lawsuit yeah Samsung's gonna slap their
own buttons in different orders all over
the phone anyway everybody will I'm not
singling out Susan well I I wonder how
it's going to work on let's say you
update older phone with physical buttons
yeah yeah obviously nothing's going to
change but yeah and they're gonna be
your brain might explode well I think
that is going to bring this week's show
to an end do you have any final thoughts
Todd no that's it that's it for me I'll
