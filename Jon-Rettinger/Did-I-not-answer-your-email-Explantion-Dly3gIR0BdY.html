probably been a while in the making i
get this comment a lot i sent you an
email why didn't you reply you don't
care about the subscribers you don't
carry out people a lot to talk about
your videos and i thought they need to
respond to that first off i started
making videos just to share my
experiences with the world I didn't know
that making videos was going to parlay
into being tech support for a lot of
people I get upwards of 60 plus emails a
day ranging from anything to what
computer should i get ? no explanation
to people that really have a genuine
question or did we need for help so
answering 60 emails a day plus working
60 hours a week and then starting school
on top of that it's just it's not
feasible and me having a life so I
choose 10 to 15 a day that I respond to
during my lunch hour at work and guys
it's really just the best that I can do
you know I want to be able to help
everybody I want to be able to answer me
but these questions but I can't do it
you know these videos are a hobby and
something that I enjoy what they're not
my full-time job and I know that your
question is important to you and I'm not
trying to belittle it but it's still
just one email you know I've been on the
other end of it I send emails to
thousands of people I never had anything
back it sucks and I know that it sucks
and I'm sorry that I can't respond to
everybody but I just can't I've you know
I've got outside extra outside
activities I have a girlfriend you know
I've got things that I'd like to do um
and it just gets to be you know a little
overwhelming at times so if I didn't
respond to your email guys I promise you
it's nothing personal I'm just trying to
retain some sort of life and I do answer
people a lot of people here i'm sure
will testify to that but i just can't
respond to everybody guys I'm sorry but
conversely i do read every email every
one that comes through i do you read I
just can't always send a reply back guys
I just wanted to get a little bit of
explanation I hope it helps I do care
greatly about my subscribers and I make
these videos where you guys give you a
place to talk and maybe share some
experiences
and if I've offended you by not
responding not my intention guys you
know it's just that i have like you i'm
sure have had a lot going on and imagine
with your busy schedule if you had a
reply to you know 60 70 emails a day and
not just with a yes or no answer how to
apply like to give an explanation you
know it's it's just too much so you guys
are still welcome to send emails i
always appreciate getting them like i
said i always read them and i do reply
to a fair amount of them I just can't
fight everybody guys so I'm sorry if I
offended you it was never my intention
like to keep things here light and
friendly so you know leave it at that
i'm wearing my angel sat here but the
lakers are in the finals against the
celtics so that's exciting as well I get
that question a lot to yes i'm a huge
Laker fan hence the name John for lakers
anyway guys I will talk to you soon got
some new videos coming up got some new
products hopefully don't box in next few
weeks and talk to you guys soon my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
