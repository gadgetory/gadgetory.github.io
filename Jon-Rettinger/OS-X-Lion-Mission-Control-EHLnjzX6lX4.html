technobuffalo here and it is the morning
of July twentieth which means OS 10 lion
launched today I just got it all done
and installed after the download the
install process took about 20 minutes it
was completely seamless and is now up
and working as you can see you right
here version 10.7 so it is up working in
life but I want to show you some of the
new features that are going to be found
in on what's 10 lion so it'll be a
series of feature videos let's go ahead
and start with one of the ones I was
most excited about this is a mission
control so i'll go ahead and launch it
you can launch it in one of two ways by
default when you install OS 10 lion if
you use a magic mouse it's going to
install a double tap so if you lightly
double tap the mouse with two fingers
don't actually quick it in but just pads
habit you're going to launch Mission
Control I'll go ahead and click it here
and this is what it's going to look like
nothing too exciting if you have
multiple monitors you'll see the same
thing and multiple monitors it's
actually going to replace you know the
old expose kind of thing you can see all
of your open applications but hey I
don't have any so let's go ahead and
open up a few and see what it looks like
so I will open up the mac app store
let's go ahead and open up Microsoft
Word will open up the document there
we'll put a power points let's say I
want to bust open itunes it's an itunes
going i want to show on the calculator I
all kind of stuff up from now now if I
double tap my mouth it's gonna launch
everything that I got which is kind of
neat so you can see everything sort of
in a very clear window on your desktop
what if you have multiple things openers
the same program so let's open up word
it's going to open up a new blank
document so I've got a couple open here
double tap my mouse now you can see that
everything stats very very nicely you
can see I've got to Microsoft Word
applications here there's a calculator
there are represented by an icon to the
calculator
come on record soft word icon app store
whatever else you got you can jump right
to anywhere you want including you can
go right to your dashboard which you can
clearly see I don't use all that much
let's go ahead and exit out of that jump
into some of the word documents it's a
very easy way to jump around sort of
manage all of your open windows if you
have a lot of stuff open it's extremely
helpful so I shall go ahead and open up
everything here and let's see what it
looks like when I am just a ton of
things open up don't don't don't so go
ahead and put at least most things that
I can that I don't mind showing going to
open up some applications I'll even open
up Final Cut the motion which I still
know you how to use and compressor
alright so you get all kinds of business
open up here and I'm going crazy you can
see it all all on today first see my
computer can handle it and now let's see
what it looks like with Mission Control
boom midget controlled so looks like a
lot of stuff but you can really see what
do you want to jump to honestly we're
having these icons is really handy and I
think move your mouse over it turns blue
if you can sort of see where you're
going to be jumping to this is a lot out
application it's probably more than you
might have on a regular basis but you
can see them all open in a very clear
succinct way launch Fred's a pretty cool
feature stay tuned for more of the OS 10
lion features I got up early it was like
five thirty in the morning California
time so I'm very excited to start
playing with this and put my morning to
good use leave a comment down below let
me know what your favorite OS 10 lion
feature is if you like it you don't like
it you want to go back to the snow
leopard or the leopard or tiger or
panther or whatever else there might
have been the house cat let me know in
the comments down below i'm jon
rettinger technobuffalo and i will see
you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
