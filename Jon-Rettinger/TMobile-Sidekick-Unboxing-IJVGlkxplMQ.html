from John four Lakers comm here with an
unboxing for you of the t-mobile
Sidekick 2008 also known as the t-mobile
Sidekick this is the most recent
sidekick that has been released let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing the camera
down
all right here we've got the Fed Ex pack
let's go ahead and give this an open
can't quite use my knife that I usually
use I wanna stab myself open this
alright let's see what we got inside
return stuff to PR folks alright
here we've got the t-mobile Sidekick box
I don't know if this is a new device or
if it's one that's already been tested
but here it is t-mobile Sidekick front
picture the green device on the back
this one has customizable shelves so in
green is just one that they're showing
and kind of an embossed sidekick logo
there actually looks pretty slick
sidekick on the side just pictures all
around let's dig in see what's inside of
here oh so slides right out and here is
what we're left with a little bit more
t-mobile Sidekick with a picture of the
phone and some of the skins one of the
cool things about this I know you can do
is go to t-mobile site actually create
your own skins and in a few weeks we'll
actually mail them to you and you can go
ahead and put them on they actually
called shelves rather I should say not
skins go ahead and open this up alright
slides right open and there's device
presented right on top put that aside
for just a minute doesn't look like it's
a new device looks like it's probably
been tested before but we'll see what
else we have in here looks like this
opens up
nothing inside of there so it maybe
doesn't open let's keep digging in and
see what's inside of the box that slides
open there's the black piece of
cardboard right there that's like
underneath it is where all this stuff is
so let's see what kind of stuff it is
we've got a wall charger looks like it's
probably some sort of no it's not
proprietary it's a a mini USB that's
nice to see good for t-mobile and good
for a sharper to actually make the
device let's keep digging into the box
room to tell other kind of goodies they
threw in we've got looks like a SanDisk
512 megabyte micro SD card so I was
kinda done to throw that in
we've got headphones with a 3.5
millimeter jack that's nice as well
syncing cable to your computer and an
extra black shell with the directions on
how to replace your sidekick Shell's
Cobain cut all that stuff to the side
actually I will show you guys what the
show is here so you can see it on the
other device just two pieces of plastic
goes on the back and the sides actually
covers the whole back and both sides of
the device so here is the t-mobile
Sidekick looks like they put on the blue
shell I think she looks pretty slick umm
feels very uh feels very nice in the
hand and of course it has the patented
t-mobile Sidekick slide up which is
pretty cool and slides back down
sidekick was actually one of the first
QWERTY feature phones that really hit
the mainstream and t-mobile has been
she's been building on its success ever
since and clearly haven't messed with it
was an excellent device so let's try
that again
slides up like that kind of switchblade
motion it's pretty neat device feels a
little bit slick on the back but it
looks nice definite looks pocketable
I'll do a hardware overview and review
the device after I use it for a few days
and let you guys know I think got the
familiar scroll ball
some of blackberry devices oh I think
the sidekick actually had it first
I'm actually very excited to use this be
nice to have a device with a full QWERTY
keyboard I had a sidekick
- had a sidekick - back in the day and I
really enjoyed it so I'm really looking
forward to seeing what improvements to
mobile is made with their most recent
device so guys this is John Rhett enger'
