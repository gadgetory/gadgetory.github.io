you by netflix go to ww netflix.com
slash buffalo for your free trial
membership today what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here and
welcome back to another edition of ask
the buffalo a pretty simple format i put
a post up on technobuffalo and you guys
can ask me any question you want tech or
personal so let's go ahead and get
started i'm going to go ahead and very
animated fashion glance right word first
question is from user probably everyone
what was up with that intro i am super
super excited to announce a partnership
with the folks at revision3 my opinion
is the best online television network
out there they've got a really
impressive lineup of shows that i watch
regularly including tekzilla and
diggnation a ton of others definitely
check them out on netflix is now one of
the official sponsors the TechnoBuffalo
you might see them pop up you know every
two or three videos of such I'm you know
in place of those pre-roll ads that you
sometimes see on youtube videos so i
hope that you guys enjoy understand and
support the show as you guys always have
in the past okay so and just know that
is part of regular growth so let's go
ahead and i don't know what the hand
pyramid is but let's go ahead and answer
some questions the first one comes from
user shahi kamal uh what video editing
software do you use oh well I've got
final cut express and I movie 2011 and
sometimes I'll use some final code I
need something especially fancy in there
but generally I just use iMovie it's
super easy to use like ending done nice
and quickly and the effects work so I
movie primarily is what I use alright so
let's go ahead and look the next
question do you think people should get
a palm pre chew on variety things HP
just announced the pre 3 which outshine
the pre to to every aspect and the
answer is no do not buy a pre
you for any reason at all don't bite a
pretty too don't even think about it
take your mouth off the order page or
the pre-order page and don't do it the
pre three kills it in every way and
screen size and keyboard and processor
everything the pre and the pre to the
screen size was very small keyboard
borderline unusable the pre three fixes
both of those and augments with a much
faster processor which is really going
to be the one to have oh they haven't
announced any carriers information yet
but assuming it'll come to probably
every carrier that the pre's been on so
that would be AT&amp;amp;T that would be sprint
and that would be verizon so definitely
wait if you're interested in the pre
three i really like webos and I think
dupree three finally gives webos the
hardware they're pretty impressive
operating system needs alright so and
deserves for that matter all right from
George garage what's your greatest
achievement in life what do you hope to
accomplish regards to TechnoBuffalo in
the next 10 years George it's actually a
really good question um one of the end i
get i'm sort of outgoing in general but
I get very bashful talk about stuff like
this um my goal in life when I look back
10 years ago was just to be able to
provide for my family have a job that
was stable I never dreamed in a million
years that I would have the opportunity
to review technology for a living this
is what I love I am just a gigantic nerd
at heart I used to go and walk around
best buy just for fun and look at all
the cool stuff and ask questions and
trying to get my hands on with it in
fact yesterday I dragged my wife to best
buy anything I just to walk around like
a technology um I just love tech my
greatest thing in life that I'm most
proud of I guess in addition to getting
and in my wife do agree to marry me and
to marry my best friend it is definitely
the fact that I get to talk about tech
for a living it is a dream come true an
opportunity that you guys give me and
one that I do not under any
circumstances whatever take for granted
and one that I'm really
above as far as technobuffalo in the
next ten years a very grand visions and
I really want technobuffalo do the
premier resource for people go for their
tech lifestyle it's not just a recap of
phone in the specs but showing of the
phone in those specs that go with it I
can help even how you can use it will
you go to get sort of the video content
I they expect from these devices so 360
sort of view where the audience can feel
involved in the audience have a voice
it's really important I want you guys to
help shape technobuffalo wanted to be a
site for you so a lot more audience
interaction a lot more chances to
interact with people that are at
TechnoBuffalo a lot more chances to get
the user-generated content up on the
site it's really the direction that i
would love techno Buffalo to go in the
next 10 years so thank you for asking um
nice question when we see an update to
the macbook and what features can we
look forward to um the answer is
probably sometime in March I will
probably go to look forward to the Sandy
Bridge processors which is a fancy way
of saying next generation intel
processors um sort of it a little bit
faster kind of stuff I don't get it it's
all the technical terms but probably in
the next I'm gonna like it doing this 30
to 60 days is when I think we'll see it
I'm giving you a back massage all right
I will answer a few more questions do
you think apple will ever give in to
flash um I don't know why I just off
laughs and I thought it was going to be
a dirty question uh nope I certainly
don't think that they will Apple really
pushed html5 standard and we're starting
to see a much wider adoption of html5
throughout all the weapons are
permeating it I haven't seen a really
good implantation of mobile flash the
demo that they showed at the HP palm
event when they launched or announce the
touchpad flash content looked really
good on it but it might have just been a
demo html5 is a bit more optimal for
mobile viewing not to say that flash
doesn't have a place but as a long
answer to no I don't think apple will
ever do that already Oh what about the
LG optimus pad 3d is time to have a 3d
tablet slightly preface this by saying
I'm not a big fan
3d technology in general I don't really
like 3d movies that much I saw avatar in
3d I thought it was kind of neat 3d tvs
I have very low interest in I'm not
gonna wear active or passive glass as
well and they're watching television I
can barely see any way about my own
glasses and put glasses on top of
glasses I find incredibly annoying some
of the glasses free technology I've seen
is a bit intriguing but I don't have it
did not something that I feel like is an
essence st it also kind of hurts my eyes
so I guess having the option to have a
3d on its have what's kind of neat can
use it when you want to I think it could
be fun for gaming um a really cool
implementation and also for sort of
recording your own content in 3d and
viewing it back could also be kind of
fun I wouldn't be a must-have feature I
wouldn't don't think i'd pick 3d over
not 3d if I sort of looking at two equal
products but as far as an augmentation
to an already pretty cool package I
guess it could be kind of fun let's go
ahead and keep it looking right word
like hollister and i will do a little
dance for you bang on out shhh hey uh
yeah I I like him i guess i got like a
weird long torso my legs aren't that
long with my torso is so shirts don't
always fit me very well um so it's hard
to find something that works and the
hollister close to have a reason tend to
fit sided particularly love the brand or
anything but they fit me so i tend to
wear alone if that answers a your
question um let's go ahead and ask
answer one more question here from
muffled do you think they'll be an
iphone nano so all the specs of it be
anybody tells you they know is lying to
you i think that it would diminish the
apple brand personally an iphone nano
certainly Apple needs to compete with
Android and needs to sort of keep up
with the lower end devices but apples
really carved a niche in the high-end
devices so I think they're testing it
certainly may be one of those prototypes
has been seen I'd say it's very doubtful
that we're going to see
iphone nano teeny tiny iphone and I guys
hope you enjoyed this particular episode
