brought to you by full sail university
well hello there hi how's it going hi
it's John Q here from technobuffalo hope
you guys are doing fantastic co
fantastic chisholm welcome to another
episode of whats the apps today we're
gonna get a translating on with a little
app called i translate voice yes
developed by sonicare mobile i translate
voice as an iphone app that provides on
the spot visual and or audible
translations that currently supports up
to 31 languages from Cantonese Chinese
to Swedish the sleek yet minimalistic
app works by tapping either on the left
or right mic button then saying whatever
it is you want to translate tapping and
holding the button will allow for text
entry when you're done the app will
automatically process the input and
provide you with the translated output
tapping on the Settings button will
allow you to pick and choose whichever
languages you want to be I translated
personally I don't understand too many
languages that i do makeup fortunately i
do understand chinese cantonese and the
translations provided by the app were
pretty accurate enjoying auto cheap hung
on some dicks are you touching me as you
may have noticed the whole voice
translating process is similar heck
identical to Apple Siri the little beeps
and blips even sound like Siri I would
say that this is a good thing okay it's
a good team good Kings be happening
because it keeps the usability and
experience familiar for users so that
they can just dive in and use a thing
right away not to mention the
translation process is also pretty zippy
text translations are even faster but
that's to be expected I wanted to see
just how accurate this thing really was
so I set it up next to my iPad which was
running who his translate by the way
Google Translate provides basically the
same features and functions with support
for more languages plus it's free
unfortunately Google Translate didn't
have chinese cantonese so i had to test
it with a bunch of different languages
that i didn't understand the results
were slightly different but it sounded
like it was legit for those of you out
there who understand these languages
feel free to rise up from the comments
to say hey bro man
man that ain't right bro you know bro
feel free to use bro excessively as well
okay well hello kitty stone it's gated
Ashoka otay this application is pretty
practical I mean one of the uses would
be to learn a new language like um like
here when Gatins wired will ished faust
when I'm I'm I'm I'm honestly trying my
best when God instruct one gun inched
word will ish to fed and oust when if I
then dropped the wise work wise words
spoken by the German band Ramstein for
from their song America van kooten
spilled fuel ebony hi if I allow the
great yeah that's exactly I that's
exactly what I said it sounded just like
that I could be one of the I could be
that voice right there when a gut as
awesome as I trans a voice maybe and
others have mentioned this as well a
potential downside is that it relies
totally on data in or Wi-Fi to make the
translation thingy happen so say you're
on vacation okay you want to take a
fancy vacation to a country or an area
that doesn't speak your language because
you think that's so fantastic and fun
and you just happen to bring along your
iPhone because the thought aborting a 15
hour plane ride without these soulful
and smooth sounds Miley Cyrus is it's
just blasphemous to you you need to have
your Miley on board and when you arrive
within this new region you just happen
to get lost in the middle of nowhere
with no Wi-Fi and really really poor
data connection and almost no data
connection is struggling on one or two
bars no now one bar that's gone where to
go you don't know and far into the
distance you see this guy slowly walking
towards you this there's no one else no
one else just this one guy while he's
wearing a poncho you don't know why he
just is and in your state of panic you
raise your hand and say excuse me sir
reach your hand like you're trying to
answer a question in second grade excuse
me sir and the most comest tone you have
and of course it doesn't understand you
that is when you pull up your iPhone
your your Miley Cyrus loaded
phone pull up the I translate voice app
and nothing happens I trans lady voice
he doesn't do anything that's when you
go to plan B you reach into your other
pocket while the guy is still there
staring at you you pull out a pen and a
piece of paper and on this piece of
paper with the pen you masterfully draw
with shading in and details and ratios
and whatnot you don't know all this it
just came to you you know I don't know
where because you're lost but it doesn't
matter you just masterfully draw exactly
what you want to look for on to that
piece of paper you look at the guy you
give him the piece of paper seconds
later he glances at your da Vinci esque
masterful drawing you have nods he
understands any points into that general
north west south is she you don't know
you don't have a compass you don't know
where that is you just point and nods
without saying a word he walks away and
there it is that's the thing you were
looking for right communication it was
established with that poncho wearing guy
and there's a thing you were looking for
all along it's the nike store the nike
store of all nike stores there's a
swoosh on there the biggest worse you've
ever seen okay and any anytime someone
walks into the door you know how
automated doors are they go like Bing no
this one this big switched nike store
any time it opens it was like wow and
it's just fun as you go in the air
conditioning just slaps your face and
you don't have a lot of hair you have my
hair's not very long but if your hair
was like my hair it would be a flowing
into the wind as you brace yourself and
you enter the nike store of all nike
stores and that is why it kind of sucks
that i translated voice relies on Wi-Fi
and or data to make that translate
anything you happen and speaking of

what it does I translate voice is a
really nifty app the translation seems
accurate it works very quickly and it
supports quite a few languages it's
actually on sale right now for 99 cents
so if you're in the market for a
translator voice app you might want to
check this out alternatively Google
Translate offers basically the same
services but for free not to mention
it's available on a bunch of different
platforms just keep in mind that both of
these applications and services rely on
data and/or Wi-Fi I translate voice 4
