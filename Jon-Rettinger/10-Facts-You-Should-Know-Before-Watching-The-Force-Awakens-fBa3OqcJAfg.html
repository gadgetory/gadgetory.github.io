to you by one razor
yeah
Star Wars shattered Empire this thing is
a brand new trade paperback by greg
rucka was a great great writer and
especially now that Star Wars is in the
Marvel Universe there's a lot of great
comics for it this week
the Star Wars Force awakens premiere is
happening on Thursday and I realized it
might be a lot to take in if you haven't
seen the original movie so we've got ten
things that you need to know about the
original movies so that you feel ready
and prepared emotionally and mentally
for the premiere this week
let's get into the top ten r2d2 and c3po
yeah I'm sure you recognize them you've
seen them around they were very very
important in the original trilogy and
they're basically our narrators so
you're gonna want to pay attention to
them this time around - not sure exactly
how big of a role they're gonna have but
you can bet that they are gonna be
involved little-known fact
there's only three Star Wars movies that
have ever come out episodes four five
and six
super weird there were some prequels
planned and in those prequels we do get
to see the Millennium Falcon or at least
we were supposed to makes a little cameo
the amount of time that would have
passed between those prequels and what
we're about to see in the force awakens
is approximately 60 years so yeah that
ship is pretty darn old and yeah like I
said there's only three Star Wars movies
I don't know what all this hubbub is
about about prequels Luke Skywalker you
know the name but did you know that he
is the last of over 10,000 Jedi that
once existed in the universe so
obviously he's probably gonna have a
pretty important role especially
considering something that we're gonna
talk about very shortly his lightsaber
winds up with one of our very favorite
lead characters thin oh my god that is
unlimited power Wow
this v have a lot of power they're
basically evil Jedi but there aren't
usually a whole lot of them in any given
location they tend to power struggle a
lot as Yoda says actually in the movies
always two there are a master and an
apprentice which one is kylo Ren I don't
know either but we're gonna find out
this week while there sure is a lot of
familiar tech in the force awakens as
I'm sure you're going to recognize
there's something that did get a little
bit of a makeover x-wings in the
original trilogy they were in Conti 65s
in the force awakens they're actually T
70s it's only been 30 years but that's
definitely an upgrade number six
while these stormtroopers in the
original trilogy were indeed clones of
Jango Fett these stormtroopers that we
see in the force awakens are actually
all different they're all different
people altogether they were actually
raised to believe that the Empire was in
the right as opposed to cloning someone
who thought that that was true those of
you who are interested in Tech primarily
Apple tech you'll recognize the name
I've well he was at dinner with JJ
Abrams he actually expressed to him that
he feels like the old look for
lightsabers so clean and pristine didn't
really make sense for something quite so
powerful so he actually said maybe
lightsabers should be a little bit more
spitty and hot and radiating power
that's actually how they wound up coming
to the lightsaber for kylo Ren err I
think it's actually a really cool new
look
if the lightsaber that finn is using and
the trailers it's a little confusing for
you it's probably cuz you've seen the
original trilogy and you know that that
looks a lot like Luke Skywalker's
lightsaber well it actually is the last
time we saw it though was in Episode
five when Darth Vader cut off Luke
Skywalker's hand and the lightsaber
wound up going down the mining shaft in
the cloud city of best Bend so who went
and got it out and where the hell has it
been for 30 years in one of the trailers
for the force awakens we see Han Solo
say who his best friend Chewie were home
in what actually looks like the
Millennium Falcon that might seem a
little bit weird to you because you know
that the Millennium Falcon was an old
Korean fighter that Han Solo actually
one from Lando Calrissian during a game
of sabic but apparently it doesn't
belong to him anymore not exactly sure
what happened to it over the last thirty
years but it's nice to see if they get
reunited Emperor Palpatine it's not me
but he is also known as Darth Sidious
and in Return of the Jedi Darth Vader
just accident
that actually was super exciting for
everybody in the galaxy because we all
thought that the Empire had crumbled but
now we know that the Empire just morphed
into a new organization called the first
order and the Rebel Alliance is now
known as the resistance why the name
changed well we don't really know for
sure just yet but hopefully this week
we're gonna get to find out what
happened these last 30 years in that
galaxy far far away
alright just this if you have not seen
the original trilogy and you need a
little bit of a catch-up or even if you
have this shattered Empire is a great
place to start it bridges the gap
between the last movie and the force
awakens which comes out this week so you
better make sure you have your tickets
we all good awesome thank you very much
my good friend catch you later
Hey comment like subscribe let us know
if you enjoyed this kind of video we'll
do a whole lot more of them oh man it's
been a long week this week already it's
only Tuesday
but last week was even longer because we
were building this sweet little baby
right here I was here till like 2:00 in
the morning she was seeing me I was all
like disgusting had to ride my bike home
ahead and shaved but I did actually wind
up shaving soon thereafter and I wish I
had been able to shave with one of these
the one razor one razor calm this is
it's this new site new product it's
basically if you're familiar with like
straight razors like you know like the
old school situation safety blades and
whatnot it's basically a really nice
handle for what amounts to safety blades
for you to shave with it's really easy
to maintain it comes to 12 blades and
then 12 bonus blades which means you get
24 blades so that's quite a bit and
considering how long this should last
you should be set for a good long while
anyway go ahead and check out one razor
calm I got to get back to editing some
sweet videos or you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
