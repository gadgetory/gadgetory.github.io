coverage ultrabooks ultrabooks
everywhere what are they and why should
you care what's going on we're
TechnoBuffalo from CES 2012 in Las Vegas
and one of the big stories of the show
is ultrabooks whether it's a revolution
in lightweight low-cost computing or
just a marketing name thought up by the
bean counters in Intel no matter
ultrabooks are everywhere intel took the
wraps off of a whole bunch of nifty
prototypes including one that has a
see-through trackpad area that you can
use as a sort of giant smartphone with
widgets when the laptop is closed we've
seen ultrabooks come out this week from
the likes of HP samsung a sous and
lenovo just to name a few and we're
hearing that they're going to be as many
as 30 to 50 possibly more of these
beauties launched before the end of 2012
right now you can see me scratching and
scraping on the gorilla glass that
literally covers just about every square
inch of the HP envy 14 Spectre one of
the new ultrabooks is getting a lot of
attention this week at the show look for
all kinds of ultrabooks to hit with
Windows now windows 8 later on this year
at price points starting at around a
thousand dollars the Ford evos concept
marks the next evolution of ford's
global design language it was created to
push and stretch for design even further
and shows where they intend to go making
the design of Ford products even more
emotional premium and engaging thanks to
Ford for powering our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
