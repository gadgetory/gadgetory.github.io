it's important to look back from where
you came from and where Android phones
really started to come into their own
where the Nexus line was born was in
January 2010 it's a very first Google
phone the Nexus One want to take a bit
of retrospective about this phone look
at it objectively and see how crazy far
technology has advanced in still just
under seven years so while this phone
was officially announced in January 2010
it was rumored for years before in fact
a few months before go announced that
they gave a few these devices out to
employees and very like wink wink asked
them to not show them publicly and of
course this phone which is leaking all
over the web which kind of started
history of Nexus devices leaking and
that's a trend that has certainly never
stopped so when this guy launched was
$550
so pricing has stayed relatively
consistent for his Nexus line of phones
it was a very first device to launch
with Android wait for it 2.1 if you
weren't alive back then or maybe didn't
have a phone or just forgot like me
Android 2.1 brought a lot of features to
Android there's a first woman to have
live wallpapers for example I remember
playing for way longer than I should
with those little rays of color just
tapping the screen Mauri view this was
actually most me just just tapping on it
it brought a very odd 3d animation
setting to kind of like cubes that you
scrolled along it brought voice controls
it up to number of home screens you
could have from three to five this was
long before chrome when Android just had
a browser and I should mention there was
no multi-touch on Android back in the
day 2.1 also brought a weather app for
example so a lot of new features these
that were new at the time that we really
take for granted really started their
Nexus so to speak with the HTC built
Nexus 1 it was fun to go back and watch
my review about this when I raved about
the specs it had a beastly 1400 milliamp
hour battery and the 3.7 inch OLED
screen at the 480 by 800 resolution I
said quote was gorgeous it just looks
absolutely gorgeous and it was at the
time makes you kind of wonder what we're
gonna think about phones now in six
years you're like oh 2k or at 32 K how
do we even live with phones of such a
little resolution but looking
the next one now I gotta say the screen
still does look pretty good there are
some weird design things that are going
on with Android and especially with the
HSE one at the time so Android phones
had four navigation buttons a Nexus One
at four capacitive versions of them and
they did not work very well at all I
really had it give him a solid tap to
make sure they registered was a back
button it was the Menu button it was a
home button and that search button which
is long gone
away going back and watching my review
of this I mentioned my three favorite
phones at the time for the Nexus One the
iPhone 3GS and the Palm Pre just for a
little dose of nostalgia there's a
trackball on here as well it was sort of
one of the de facto waste cavity phones
it was popular in blackberries of the
day I never used it did bring with it
some new stuff like trackball
notifications it marked a lot of firsts
for Android who it wasn't really
wireless charging was plugless charging
there's some pins at the bottom
Google eventually sadoc for you just
drop it in and the phone would start to
charge now if you remember this phone
was sold and locked it was edged only
for AT&amp;amp;T just to show you how far back
things have gone but you could get 3G
for t-mobile which was like a big deal
back at the time to have half 3G on a
phone Google was trying to shake up the
way phones were sold and it just did not
work out well they sold it at the Google
web store and it was google.com slash
Bowen in the United States the only
place you get purchased Nexus One there
are a couple of options first or
unlocked one unsubsidized GSM Nexus ones
and they promise a virgin's gonna work
on Verizon that got killed you're trying
to do some new things it just didn't
work could try before you buy there was
some other kind of niche options and
Google killed it relatively soon in fact
Google stopped selling the Nexus One in
July of 2010 but I got to say picking
this phone up again after many many
years it's still working and it's so
relatively zippy and you could still
probably use it although I I wouldn't
recommend it
but it does still function there's no
real lag when I'm scrolling around least
just for general tapping around the
homescreen it's just fun to see how far
the technology has advanced and also to
look where things are going to be in
another six and a half years I think
we'll probably still going to be at the
same price point we're at with this guy
500 600 bucks for top of the line phones
but man that features we're going to get
our be crazy I'm still waiting for the
holographic phone where I can ask
obi-wan for help so you guys remember
the Nexus 1 did you pick one up if you
guys want to see more sort of
retrospective reviews and look back some
of the flagship products with past the
video a thumbs up and let us know hope
you guys enjoy it until next time from
