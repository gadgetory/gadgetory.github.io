to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
welcome back their pursuit of rumor
roundup I'm your host John Rangers to
show we take all the tons of Tecla from
the week and I condensed them into the
three or four that I think are the most
exciting or most outrageous of this week
though we got four that I think are
pretty possible the HTC one follow-up is
coming very quickly supposedly the
iPhone 6 is gonna get a little more junk
in the trunk and get a little bit bigger
unlocked phones could be getting way
cheaper if Motorola's anything to say
about it and that the galaxy s5 could be
coming very very soon this rumor roundup
let's start rounded things up let's
start with the follow-up to my favorite
phone of 2013 HTC One although I kind of
hope they call it the HTC 2 we're
hearing it's gonna be called just the
HTC One again so according to a leaked
case design by sunny Dixon we're seeing
a couple new things so the case first
featured larger cutouts that was
standard in last year's HTC One we're
guessing probably where the cameras
gonna sit along with two more
unexplained holes to the top of the
device so we're not really sure what
those holes could represent but the
obvious and probably most logical bets
are either a small fingerprint scanner
where a speaker or just maybe one from
microphone who knows but HTC has been
toying with the idea of a fingerprint
scanner we saw in the back of the HTC
One max it would make sense that
technology would follow over the HTC One
sequel if I were you I would wait to
pick up HTC One I'd expect to hear
something a next four to five weeks
especially with Mobile World Congress
coming up from the iPhone 4 to the
iPhone 5 it got a little bit bigger in
this green department and it's looking
like that trends and it continued from
the iPhone 5 to the iPhone 6 so first I
know analysts like to say some crazy
things like that uncle that can go over
for Thanksgiving and as a few too many
drinks and just sort of spouting things
off but any recent investors note Cowan
and company's very own Timothy a query
claims the iPhone 6 is going to feature
a
wait for it four point eight inch
display so he's not just making us up
allegedly as climis got sources inside
of Apple supply chain so sizes and
always claiming he's also predicting
they were going to use new services like
ibeacon and touch ID along with passbook
to push mobile payments which would lend
some credence to perhaps NFC finally
coming on board to the iPhone world so
my estimation Motorola has been on a
freakin tear when it comes to marrying
prices with devices the Moto G and the
Moto X both absolutely nailed it and
most the TechnoBuffalo staff named the
Moto X a device of the year in an
interview with trusted review CEO Dennis
Woodside said they're gonna get a little
more awesome they're gonna release a $50
unlocked unsubsidized handset in the
future which is friggin crazy that's not
all you also T's moto maker upgrades
that aren't just cosmetic such as
two-color I'm talking screen size
processor battery life and all kinds of
other crazy things that we heard
initially rumored wouldn't make her
first launch the spending on did 79
bucks on a new smartphone might sound
like a pretty sweet deal but would side
notes that for plenty of people around
the world that's still a butt ton of
money that wasn't a quote he actually
used the word ass ton he didn't really
don't really he said it was why can't
devices be $50 so there's no reason that
can't happen so we're going to push for
that and that was an exact quote
supposedly the galaxy s5 is coming very
very very soon so the latest galaxy s5
rumors come from elzar Mortes ian
technology journalist who is pretty well
known for leaking his own mobile news
himself occasionally we're tasing even
goes as far to predict the exact time
and place of the launch claiming
Samsung's gonna hold a press event at 6
p.m. on February 23rd in Barcelona just
ahead a Mobile World Congress which
kicks off on the 24th we don't often see
things that exact usually hear like hey
maybe in September or maybe in February
this is the exact time that is going to
be announced so pretty crazy I know you
Galaxy heads I just made that up are
pretty excited certainly we are as well
considering the galaxy s5 will usher in
probably 90 other variants of galaxy s5
phones galaxy s5 zoom galaxy s5 neo zoom
galaxy s5 camera zoom galaxy s5 notes
and then the 12 inch Galaxy s5 note
camera so all these devices potentially
coming are you most excited for the new
HTC One iphone 6 Motorola's entry-level
device or the galaxy s5 I want to hear
