indifferent TechnoBuffalo here this past
March was the five year anniversary of
TechnoBuffalo and throughout the past
five years I've shared a little bits of
the story that went into how Tecna
Buffalo came to be but I've never told
the entire story what happened it's
beginning went up at the end and how we
got to where we are now and how we're
gonna get to where I hope we're gonna be
so you've ever been interested in
starting you on a web site or starting a
business any wonder your the pitfalls
and sort of what happened you can learn
the actual people that helped us grow
and got to where we are sit back relax
grab some popcorn we might have to cut
this video into two parts because I got
a lot of story to tell it's gonna get
started the beginning of this story I
was in marketing long before
TechnoBuffalo ever started I love
technology I love just gadgets I used to
go walk around Best Buy to relax myself
after a long day I just always had a
passion for technology I remember being
at work this software development
company running their marketing
department I remember sitting there
reading and gadget and CNET and Gizmodo
I'm just having them just constantly
reading I probably spent more time
reading those than I did anything else
and this was probably around 2007 2008 I
just loved technology so this is how the
YouTube channel started I'll sort of
give this story very briefly I wanted to
get a Mac up using a giant about 15 inch
HP computer at the time I never used a
Mac I didn't know how to use a Mac and I
figured you know what it'll teach me how
to use a computer if I force myself to
make videos on it I tried to find videos
on YouTube on how to use the computer
there weren't any so it's a good excuse
this time YouTube was just cat videos
and guys getting kicked in the balls so
you know it's pretty easy to get
recognized and notified on there so I
did that and it grew and got sort of
more successful a couple thousand people
started to watch the videos and I
couldn't believe that people actually
cared what I had to say it was just
incredible I respond to every comment
and I was really really happy about it
but again back 2008 YouTube not people
knew about it it was sort of a fringe
kind of thing I was a little bit
embarrassed I didn't even tell my
girlfriend who became my fiancee my wife
at the time you know for a while that I
was that was doing it and then the
YouTube Partner Program came around
that's where partners and creators are
able to share in the revenue from the
videos and this is
something that we all take for granted
now but didn't exist back then so I
remember finding the gentleman's name
who started the partner program I had
about 8,000 subscribers at the time and
I wrote him about a two pages letter for
I thought I should be accepted and I
surprised I got a personal letter back I
was accepted into the partner program so
the job I was at this marking Department
and it's a reason for the story I hated
it it was a good company good people but
I hated the job to the point where I
hope I get in like a minor car accident
so we have to go in like not nothing
where anybody got hurt but like maybe
hit a stop sign so a partner program
started I was able to make money from
YouTube videos which is absolutely
incredible
I mean I couldn't even believe that was
a thing and I still have a hard time
believing that I can make a living from
talking about technology but sort of
long story short very soon how is that
almost in compared with a job I hated
and making videos for a living so it
became a very clear choice that I was
going to do and this now was about 2008
2009 sort of really the height of a
downturn of the economy I remember
telling my future wife and my future
mother-in-law those leaving my job and a
really bad economy to make videos for a
living and my wife he's so supportive
said I'll never forget I believe
anything you can do it try it and I
wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for
her saying that and believing in me so
you know that was kind of kind of cool
so I left my job and I wrote a business
plan to protect my Buffalo I was reading
all these tech websites there wasn't any
emphasis on video at all and I figured
you know what I've got a you know
decent-sized following on video I've
always kind of liked the idea working
for myself I always had a bit of a
problem with authority company is that I
worked for in the past so that's a whole
other story so I wrote a business plan
where venture was gonna become
TechnoBuffalo so the plan that I wrote
had three parts Seconal Buffalo some of
you that were around originally you
might recognize this the first was a
social network built in two
TechnoBuffalo it was called Buffalo net
where people could talk about gadgets
and what they liked second part was sub
blogs you could sign up for your own sub
site TechnoBuffalo comm slash whatever
user name was and you've got sort of a
WordPress format at site you could put
in your adsense code and you can
actually you know make money from that
that having to worry about hosting your
own site and the third part was the
regular sort of blog role that we have
right now so I hired a developer from
the software development company that
was working with hey I raised
initially I raised the $40,000 it was
bootstrap from friends and family I
think I remember I initially sold I
think it was 1% of the company for
$5,000 I think was what I ended up doing
and then I started TechnoBuffalo with
Brandon minimun from formerly from
pocket now and we each put in five
thousand of our own money and we serve
radiused the other 13 that was all the
money that we had so we hired a
developer from the company I was working
for I could see him I could talk to him
I know anything about starting a website
I knew nothing about coding I knew very
very very little about any of this at
all so we started sort of working to put
together this website while this is all
going on I went back to school to get my
MBA to sort of learn how to best run a
company I did that at night which is
also a side story where I ended up
meeting our managing editor right Roy
that refuses mine my friend and
classmate so working on this website
developer is is coding it he put it on a
Windows machine I don't know what that
meant and we were getting ready to
launch we were going to launch in
September of 2009 and we had burned
through about $30,000 of our 40s we
didn't have much money left at all I
wasn't taking a salary I was using the
money I was making from the videos to
live on and I think Ben Brandon wasn't
taking any sort of salary there either
and I remember hyping up TechnoBuffalo I
used every outlet I had social media
video just to be like check this site
out it's a voice of the consumer you can
create your own website we've got a
social network built in like check it
out we did a little bit of a closed beta
we had 100 users in there and everything
was super smooth and then launch day
came September of 2009 and we Unleashed
TechnoBuffalo to the world and the site
crashed
epically within about 35 seconds and it
wasn't because we had so much traffic
coming to it it was just the code was so
awful and so bad the server was setup so
horribly that the site completely
crashed and I was devastated
I had no backup plan I mean it was I
left my job I was without a net and I
was mortified and I was scared I just be
able to sleep
hey when I was in college I would sleep
through my 2:00 p.m. class I could sleep
like a champ it was during this time I
developed a really bad
insomnia I couldn't sleep at night I was
I urged ten years during this time we
had no money left either you know we had
ten thousand dollars so we invested
every last cent we had to try and redo
the site essentially recode it from
essentially scratch and it was
frightening and you know I had lost so
much in the way of reputation the site
had lost so much to waive reputation cuz
I talked about and then it wasn't there
and it wasn't until that middle of
December 2009 so three months later that
we finally got the site up and launched
and live for more than you know a minute
it was really really bad
three months and the video is talking
about TechnoBuffalo launching and
TechnoBuffalo not working or still up on
the youtube channel you can go back and
check them out they are still there and
you can see the worry in in my eyes I
remember thinking to myself like what am
i doing why am I doing this it would
been so much easier just to work my job
I was at and collect a paycheck I kept
getting promoted at it and it was fine
you know was a stable job what am I
thinking trying to make a living making
videos and trying to start a website
from scratch and those thoughts and
doubts you know creeped in a lot and
they crept in a lot through the early
years and sometimes you know they still
creep in so TechnoBuffalo launched
brandon was running pocket now at the
time he realized he couldn't split his
time between pocket and TechnoBuffalo
and sort of give both the attention he
thought they deserved so he left and I
sort of took over a hundred percent of
TechnoBuffalo and we had barely enough
money from ads to hire one writer and
that one writer was Sean Audie whose
name you might recognize who's now our
editor-in-chief
I remember when Brandon left I talked to
Sean I'm like we don't have Ned in chief
now Brandon was like we can't hire
anybody else I mean do you want the job
Sean had a pretty impressive resume at
the time and still obviously does and
it's that little that that thing sort of
started what became a really great
friendship with Sean and Sean has been
incredible under in chief and still is
to to this day so we had all those other
parts of TechnoBuffalo the social
network side and the sub blogs and it
was killing us development wise it was
absolutely just we're spending so much
time and so much money to try and keep
him aboard
it wasn't doing anything for us so right
they're really tough decision to totally
ax him like just axe him completely and
the currency just become a blog like
like we are now it was a really tough
decision to make you know but we did and
the site itself was probably making on a
good month
are we good month maybe we had a hundred
thousand page views if even that and we
were probably making five hundred
dollars a month so and I still wasn't
taking any salary Brandon wasn't we used
every cent we were making it essentially
pay Sean you know that number went up
certainly Sean had other job he's
working at the time and we were just
sort of trying to get by and it was
really really scary and I remember
looking at her bank account one day this
is sort of right after Brandon allowed
to me like I don't know if any to keep
the lights on you know I can still make
videos but I don't know if the site's
going to last and it was really really
frightening for me and for my girlfriend
again who became my wife ID I was having
such soso food with regret and I didn't
know what was going to happen what's up
