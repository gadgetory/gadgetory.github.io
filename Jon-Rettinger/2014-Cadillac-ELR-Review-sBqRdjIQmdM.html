to you by harry's what's up everyone
john wrench from TechnoBuffalo here that
beast behind me is a 2014 cadillac ELR
putting through its paces for the better
part of a week and I want to share
everything about this car the good and
the bad let's go ahead and take a look
at this plug-in hybrid so looking at the
Cadillac ELR you think it's maybe makes
better sense to have it on the
Nurburgring it looks like a successor to
the cts coupe as opposed to what it
really is which is a variance of the
Volt's so it's a very interesting car so
first it was unveiled at the 2009 North
American Motor Show based on the
converge concept and it kept pretty true
to what the concept looked like it's
absolutely gorgeous from the 20 inch
wheels pushed out to the corners the
jeweled LED headlights the fins on the
back that harken back to Cadillacs of
yesteryear to the gigantic two doors on
this coupe it is absolutely stunning it
is technically a four-seater he only put
the other two people in the back if you
really hate them there is no room at all
this whole beautiful package starts at
$76,000 ours is loaded up to well over
80,000 so this is not a car for the
faint of heart or those light on the
wallet so what are you gonna get for
your $80,000 one thing you're not gonna
get is any sort of hydraulic lift for
the hood that's just an old-school metal
bar that props up the hood powering this
guy there's a lot of stuff going on here
so it's a plug-in hybrid not a plug-in
hybrid like you've seen before what this
does is it uses the gas powered engine
to actually put electricity back into
the battery not really connected to the
wheels at all so think of it as just a
generator so what it is it's taken
straight from the Chevy Volt it's a 1.4
liter four-cylinder gas powered electric
generator it does take premium gas there
was a big caveat that's gonna power the
16 point 5 kilowatt hour battery so
those two combined are good for 181
horsepower and a whopping 295
foot-pounds of torque of course being an
electric vehicle
it's crazy torque II think of it like an
electric drill so
you push that trigger it's spinning at
full speed same thing here you get max
torque from really one rpm as soon as
that car moves so this thing gets out of
its own way pretty quickly it's gonna
have to move though a 4050 pound car so
it's gonna get from 0 to 60 eventually
in 7.9 with an electric car the zero to
30s we get a lot of the fun and much
more of the speed so with all this
electric and hybrid technology it's
gonna be good for 82 MPGe when you're
running on gas it's gonna be equivalent
of 31 to 33 miles per gallon if you
combine the two the gas and the electric
so a full tank of gas and a full charge
to be able to drive about 345 miles
forgot to refill that 16.5 kilowatt hour
pack it's gonna take four to five hours
on a level to 240 volt charger so
Cadillac for the past few years has
really been known for technology and
there is a ton at cran it's the cabin of
the L R so I'm a bit useful if some of
it's just tech for tech sake look at
these cupholders it's got a power
retracting door I don't know what it
would cost to replace that motor but I'm
wagering it's not going to be cheap you
got a ton of hidden compartments here if
that wasn't enough for you let's say you
want to hide your sunglasses somewhere
or something else go ahead and tap that
it's gonna pop right up grab your
glasses and you are good to go put the
sucker right on down look at this car
you'll notice that there are no knobs at
all it's very very sleek everything here
is all electronic if you look at this
main system here it is Cadillac Q which
has haptic feedback that means as you
touch it it gives a little bit of
vibration let's know you hit something
we talked to you launched a few years
ago and was a bit of a convoluted to use
Q in this iteration that was actually
pretty intuitive as a fun side note my
mother-in-law who's not so tech savvy
drives an SRX she doesn't had a youth Q
on her own very easily so Cadillac
claims it worked very similar to a
tablet so looking at the screen right
now there's not much information
information right there but it does have
a bit of a proximity sensor so as I
bring my hand close to it you'll see
information starts to pop up it looks
cool
why can't I have information the way I'm
driving all the time once you have it up
here though it's very easy to navigate
ripping across the tops and to get you
to the main functions you've got of
course your radio I've got phone
we've got GPS which is quite nice this
is real GPS it's not based on OnStar all
your climate control and then if you
want to
Benten see sort of your driving
information how the battery is getting
used in my opinion one of the coolest
features though of Q is in the audio
setting you can pause audio so let's say
you're listening to Howard Stern you
don't want to miss Robins news but your
mom calls you go ahead and pause that
and pick it right up later and scrub
through commercials let's get to where
you want to go it's a really neat
feature and I'm really happy to see it
standard with Q so like the volt the ELR
has four main drive modes the first one
that you're gonna be in most is gonna be
tour that's sort of your general driving
it's optimized for mpg and performance
kind of tries to find that happy medium
point the next one that you've got is
sport and that's obviously what it says
it's gonna drain the battery much
quicker you're gonna get more electrons
coming out it's gonna work that inverter
a little bit more to get as much power
and performance as you can of the car
you'll see about a twenty to twenty five
percent drop in electric range Oh me
drop into that one next is going to be
Mountain and you're gonna use Mountain
when you want to conserve the battery
and put as much electric juice as you
can into it so it's gonna burn them more
gas to put electric power back in it
figures that you're going up a big hill
and you're going to want that extra
power and the last one that we've got is
hold mode not just essentially turns it
into kind of an a regular internal
combustion engine it's saved as a
battery so that's to say it's constantly
generating power to keep a constant
level of charge inside of that battery
so driving it in TOR which is the main
mode are going to be at most of the time
it's surprisingly a pretty stiff
suspension it feels almost sports tuned
so you're gonna feel the bumps in the
road not so much that it's like you're
driving a huge pickup truck or something
it definitely feels more along the
suspension of a BMW 3-series
where you serve you feel what your going
over but you're not sort of rattling
into your jaw a wall you're driving and
because it's electric you've got a
completely linear power curve at least
when you've got a fully charged battery
so when you step on it you really start
to move something I really enjoyed with
the car so big an electric car it's got
regenerative braking but they've done
regenerate braking a little bit
different let me explain quickly if you
don't know what general braking is a new
traditional internal combustion car when
you brake the calipers condensed down
you're gonna have heat and that heat is
usually just lost its kinetic energy
what regenerative braking does that we
captures that kinetic energy puts it
back into the battery pack most cars
most electric cars are at the Tesla
Model S have a really aggressive region
so you take your foot off of the
accelerator pedal like I can't say gas
here it's gonna almost slow the car down
similar to down down a manual
transmission and all the energy is gonna
go back into the car
the ELR star takes a bit of a different
approach when you take your foot off of
the accelerator pedal it could've
focuses on coasting and coasting uses no
electricity whatsoever sort of optimize
your range but it does have a light
regen if you want a more aggressive
regen you could drop the stock down into
L and L is gonna give you that more
traditional electric car type region but
that's not the only way to do it here
calyx something really interesting on
the e a lot and they listen to one of
complaints and feedback people have the
volts and they added paddles and you see
these paddles usually on this side and
regular cars and you can up shift or
down shift gears but you know really no
gears you're an electric car what this
is gonna do on both pedals of the same
tiles are the same thing when you push
it in it activates your regenerative
braking so you get regen on demand so
you can keep it in your normal Drive
mode push that in you can sort of slow
yourself down and you could really feel
it's a very sort of jarring stop so you
can almost do one pedal driving it's a
really neat implementation that I've
never seen the paddles before and that
got used to it in about two days and I
kind of liked having it I do a show like
all paddles that are mounted to the
stock and not the wheel itself so
they're kind of hard to find if you're
turning but that's a really small gripe
also plastic pedals on an $80,000 car
like the more premium material there but
that's a small grade slow meter up to
this awesome car video for just one
second listen I'm online I get called a
lot of things online I could call the
guy dumb face
people tell me I look fat you've gained
weight people say I'm dumb know what I'm
talking about on people call me an Apple
fanboy call me an Android fanboy but
hurts me the most right here my heart is
when they call me a hairy beast because
I hate to shave and it's true I hate to
shave so let me tell you about our
friends at Harry's which is a pain to go
buy razors you got a car go store ask
the people Harry's makes it super easy
deliver really really quality products
Harris's chemical company they're new
they're less than one year old and
they're already doing super disruptive
stuff in the shaving industry they're
offering a better shaving experience a
better value than the big old Giants I'm
not gonna mention their names they rhyme
with flick and filete the company makes
awesome german-engineered blades and
they care so much about the quality of
the shave they actually just purchase
the 93 year old German Factory that
actually makes them which is kind of
cool check them out go to harrys.com and
use promo code techno to say 5 bucks off
your first purchase 15 bucks they can
get you a set that includes a handle
three blades shave cream shipped right
to your door Harry's even offers a
custom engraving option to engrave your
initials right on the razor so everybody
knows that is your razor so your wife
girlfriends has no excuse to use your
razor BIC no no it's got my name on it
you should should know that again check
them out at Harry's com the car is
really quiet especially when you're
using the battery that's true with most
electric cars or Cadillac did a great
job dampening all outside wind noise
which is not true with most electric
cars so when you've got this running an
electric and you got the windows up and
you've got the a/c turned off you really
don't hear that much noise that does
change though completely when that
internal combustion and starts kicking
on and you get rattles you can hear the
engine whirl and grind you can almost
feel the Pistons pumping up and down
tell most feel vibrations up your arm as
well it's two totally different driving
experiences here so what's the verdict
on the ELR on its own it's really fun to
drive enjoyable car and I'd like to
driving it but I cannot recommend it due
solely to the price look at it this way
a volt start to 34,000 dollars maybe you
can get two nicely option volt for less
what this is gonna cost BMW 6 Series
starts $76,000 it's a good 60 kilowatt
Model S start to $69,000 Porsche
Panamera starts the same price and the
list goes on and on the math on this car
just doesn't add up I'm not really sure
what Cadillac made this car to compete
with the now-defunct Fisker Karma
if you decide that money is not a factor
for you you'll be left with a very
competent enjoyable car to drive that's
also really good-looking but forgot
8,000 dollars to spend on a car you
might want to see what else is available
thank you guys for watching if you like
what you saw please subscribe they'll be
the first ones to know when new videos
come up we have a ton of stuff we do
unboxing to do hands-on reviews cars and
everything in between the Nets do
