to part two of my tour of the AT&amp;amp;T tilt
two or the touch pro two as it's known
regionally and internationally in this
edition we're going to cover the locking
screen the keyboard the browser the
innovative speaker phone technology and
some of the hardware so let's start with
what you'll see when you use your phone
for the first time almost every time the
lock screen those of you that may have
used in older windows mobile device feel
free familiar with the locks Korean that
was quite cumbersome you had to hit two
keys a soft key really was not an
elegant or easy way to unlock a
touchscreen device Microsoft is fixed
that with windows mobile 6.5 or Windows
Phone as their rebranding so right here
you get a new slide bar and one thing
that's new at the slide bar that's
notification so you'll see I've got a
one right there if I tap it tells me
I've got one missed call and if i tap
that one missed call it's going to take
me to the missed call menu on the phone
which is actually pretty nice and easy
to use solutions so to unlock it take
your finger and quite obviously swipe it
to the right and here we are in touch
flo 3d so the big difference between the
tilt two and say some of the touch
diamond2 models is the keyboard so let's
take a look at the keyboard and see how
it works so we'll go into word mobile so
we'll open up the Start menu here and
see the new honeycomb open up Office
Mobile which of course with a windows
mobile phone you get full office
compatibility open up word will open a
new document could see how quickly it
works on this processor and we're
greeted with a soft touch keyboard that
you've seen on most touchflo of 3d
devices it's not the best keyboard in
the world but it's usable and you get
the nice functionality where you can
drag your finger over the letters to see
what you're typing I'm not that accurate
with it I think it's a little bit
cumbersome to touch type on a resistive
screen but it's not bad most of your
text input however is not going to be
done via the on-screen keyboard it's
going to be done using this actual
physical keyboard here so let's do a
quick test and see how this works so
let's
so we can even tilt the screen up hence
the tilt name
so as you get used to type around this I
think you're going to get much faster
but I was pretty accurate on here this
is one of the better physical keyboards
that I've used I think HTC did a
fantastic job the five rows the
dedicated row of symbols make text entry
and obviously entering symbols very easy
looking forward device with a full
physical QWERTY keyboard you're going to
have a tough time beating me tilt two I
think they just did a really nice job on
now you're also going to get a few other
options with this as well if you don't
want to slide it out you can also have
access to a full landscape soft keyboard
again it's going to depend on what your
personal usage habits are but it's
functional if you want to just enter you
know a few numbers oh I think most of
your text email and mms is going to be
done via the physical keyboard so next
let's take a look at the browser this is
of course a 3G device now what's
interesting about what HTC did with this
they put pocket Internet Explorer on it
but didn't make the default browser they
actually made operative default browser
which I think was a very good choice
opera is a very full-featured browsing
option so we'll go over to the browser
we're in it and you've got some
interesting things here add a new push
page i'm going to show you what that
looks like in a minute but for right now
let's launch the web browser so go ahead
and tap it and here we are on CNN mobile
so let's go ahead and open up a site and
we'll see how it renders let's go to
let's say ESPN is a little bit of a
larger page and we're just on right now
a 3g connection certainly this has Wi-Fi
as well B&amp;amp;G so i'll go ahead and hit the
button at the bottom brings up a full
menu actually we've got the my 18 th
loaded here that'll work well for
testing so one of the nice things about
the touch pro 2 in this case touch
diamond2 it's got a zoom bar across the
bottom now if you use the HTC fuze which
was the touch pro one you notice it had
a capacitive area in them in the middle
where you could use your finger to
circle around and zoom in that
capacitive area is gone and replace it
with this extra existed zoom bar let me
show you what this looks like how it
works page is still finishing loading
take your finger and you just zoom
cross and it's going to zoom it it's not
so accurate sort of zooms in on
arbitrary area if you can scroll around
and get where you want to go it
certainly is not any sort of multi-touch
zoom although you can double tap to get
into an area i think the zoom bar is
useful but nothing that i would probably
use on a regular basis for internet
browsing i think when you get into the
photo viewer it's a little more handy so
zoom in zoom out just using this bar and
you just see it does render full HTML
pages you get finger scrolling and
flicks growing it is actually pretty
smooth I think the browsing capabilities
on the tilt two are pretty good fills
you that are familiar with opera you're
going to know what you're going to get
here so if you can rotate it and of
course it has an accelerometer so one of
the big questions i always get with
these devices is will it play youtube
videos does it have flash afford so i'm
going to show you we're going to load
youtube up here and we're going to see
what it looks like so i will use the
keyboard since i'm awful that's using
the soft keyboard got youtube com go
ahead enter and let that load up for you
alright subscribe to that we do get the
full version of YouTube that loads up so
let's click on a video and see what
happens well zoom in alice in wonderland
halloween tutorial so click it and see
what happens and you get the same error
that you see on most devices you don't
have javascript enabled so unfortunately
this does not have flash capabilities
however you can download another browser
for instance skyfire which will give you
fall out capabilities so if you are
going to get this just know you're not
going to have that right out of the box
so let's go back to the home screen to
exit out of windows mobile programs just
hit the X you've got this thing called a
push page which is quite interesting
you've got a few of them right here what
this does it actually will well push a
full internet page right to your device
let's say you check ESPN every hour and
you don't want to wait for ESPN to load
every time you do it so you can set it
to actually pull down the page for you
at given increments
so you can title it hit any address so
you can do www ESPN com can say your
frequency for really whatever you'd like
and it pushes that website right to the
device so anytime I hid it in a lot of
matically be there it's a really cool
feature it's something very simple that
I would have expected a lot of devices
implement and I think that because of
this presence here it'll probably filter
down to other devices as well so next
let's take a look at the innovative
speakers drone technology that's found
in the AT&amp;amp;T tilt two I am on a call can
you hear me perfect so if you're on a
call and you just got the phone up to
your ear you can talk like normal it's
got a proximity sensor so when you hold
it up to your head it's going to turn
the screen off but if you take the phone
and you flip it over it's going to
recognize that its flipped over going to
get a little bit of a vibrate and now
speaker phone is on Armand can you hear
me alright perfect so you can hear
speaker phone is quite loud it's got two
microphones it's got one on the side and
one on the bottom so you can use this
actually as a real office speakerphone
and it's got a button right in the
middle for mute so if you want to fall
on a speakerphone on a conference call
on the guidelines a real jerk you can
mute it Vic man that dudes a real
asshole you see the thing glows red to
let you know that you are on mute go
ahead and turn me off and you can say
hey i love you did a great job and it's
got to actually stereo speakers behind
the squirrel this whole middle part is
actually the grill and when you're done
if you just turn it over it's going to
automatically go off of a speakerphone
if you flip it back it's gonna on map
you turn back to speakerphone if some
one of those technologies that you don't
think is going to be that useful but
you're going to use it quite a bit even
if you're in the car for example when
you flip it over and put it on your knee
get me something that you're going
definitely going to use so let's hang up
this call ones continue our tour and if
you're done you get the option to input
the contact if you'd like so the next
thing that I want to talk about is some
of the the hardware of the device so
from a battery standpoint you're looking
at a 1500 milliamp hour battery which is
relatively big you're going to get eight
and a half hours
talk time and standby time up to 20 days
it weighs about 6.3 ounces it's got 512
megabytes of internal storage but
certainly you can of that with a microSD
card and it's got to be can go up to 32
gigs for that it's of course quad band
and 3g the display is a very generous
three point six inches when you're
looking at video on this thing it really
just looks fantastic resolution is 480 x
800 which is the maximum resolution that
Windows Mobile supports and of course
you're going to get a full qwerty
keyboard that I showed you guys earlier
so this is part two of the tour of the
18 details to or the touch pro 2 hope
you guys enjoyed stay tuned for the
channel for a full comparison of how
this is going to work again some of the
major devices most notably the iphone 4
