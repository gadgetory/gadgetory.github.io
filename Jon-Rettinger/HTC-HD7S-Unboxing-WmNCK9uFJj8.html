technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
the HTC hd7 s this is a new windows
phone 7 device coming to AT&amp;amp;T on june
fifth for a hundred ninety-nine
ninety-nine let's go ahead and dig in
so we've got a picture of the 4.3 inch
device on the front the S stands for
super because it has a super LCD screen
which is what separates it from its HTC
hd7 stablemate in t-mobile lineup so we
got the usual box off letting you know
it's a world phone it's got Wi-Fi by
mega pixel camera what's in the box will
see all that business and some specs
let's go ahead and dig in in case you
guys want to see a little bit sort of
behind the veil this was what was sent
from AT&amp;amp;T and HTC they always send along
a little bit of a product sheet with the
phone this is a review unit although I
wrote that down so I wouldn't forget go
ahead and open it up and boom we've got
a quick start guide letting you know up
top here welcome to AT&amp;amp;T thank you for
purchasing I'm go ahead see we got a
quick start guide more information oh
this is not running the mango update i
should mention that it does have the
most recent update that's available the
node 0 update which brought copy and
paste mango will be coming in the fall
and stuff I certainly will get that
upgrade connect to Wi-Fi no additional
charge check out the uverse mobile
application I actually have uverse i use
it at my home the uverse mobile
application for windows phone 7 is
really good for Lee whatever device you
have out there they've got a u-verse app
so if you use that for your TV super
handy alright so here is the device it's
like it doesn't have any plastic on it
they must have popped the sim card in
here before you can see what it looks
like it's got that weird battery
compartment down on the bottom push that
off to the side for just a minute let's
see what we got in the box so you've got
this eco-friendly packaging let's see
what I think it's me data all right horn
meat product if I remember correctly so
you're gonna have a micro USB cable yay
with the rubber band yeah if rubber
bands uh your standard HTC wall plug
with USB and
pair of headphones and see if they've
got a microphone on it so there's a kind
of headphones er no too bad some HTC
innovation stuff and got a microphone so
usual accessories that you get in the
box let's go ahead and take a look at
the phone and let me put the sheets that
AT&amp;amp;T and HTC sent to good use and let me
tell you what you can expect from this
device in the spec department so I'll
bring in the camera a little bit I'll
power it on to while we are talking so
you can have something pretty to look at
get the HTC splash screen there so this
has a 4.3 inch display and it is super
LCD wvga so that accounts for the s name
in it windows phone 7 platform dolby
mobile it's got integration for xbox
live on the back 5 megapixel camera with
dual-led flash and autofocus kinda
awesome 512 megabytes of wrong 60 gigs
of internal storage 7 or 5768 megabytes
of RAM before point 3 inch screen has a
resolution of 800 x 480 it's got a 1230
milliamp hour battery the 5 megapixel
camera and the rest of the windows phone
7 stuff that you've come to expect let's
take a quick tour of the device here's a
windows phone 7 home screen with the
live tiles oh right on the top you're
going to have the power and lock button
right hand side is where the volume
rocker up and down is going to live as
well the dedicated camera button windows
phone 7 actually activates a camera very
quickly when you push it push it
generally the camera shows up pretty
fast oh now it's a Nazca Fontes use my
location we're go ahead and cancel let's
try that one more time camera button
pushed and there's a camera you can see
my hand hi all right nothing on the left
hand side we got nothing there is your
micro USB charging port 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and you can sometimes use
expandable storage with windows
17 it's a bit statutes whether or not it
works in which one it works with so just
now you're going to have 16 gigs of
internal storage here there is the
camera that we just talked about and it
is a 5 megapixel camera which can't
shoot HD video at 720p hidden behind
this camera is a bit of a kickstand boom
and now you can prop it up and you can
watch stuff or you can just kick it with
your kickstand the 1200 milliamp hour
battery or a little bit over that
actually it's going to live under here
it's also where the sim card slot it's
going to be got the microphones and the
rest of that goodness that you'd expect
from a modern-day cell phone let's do a
real quick size comparison here so
here's a 4.3 inches boy let's bring in
its friend in a teensy stablemate oh
we're going to look very similar the htc
inspire 4G until these two phones were
probably carved from a similar mold
course you got the android buttons down
here and Windows Phone 7 buttons down
there and these are capacitive and all
standard so you've got your back buddy
which is also going to be used for
multitasking in the mango update you've
got your windows home button and get
your search button which will bust you
on over to Bing mmm oh go ahead and
allow it and there is Bank it's a puffin
I don't know why I know that quick size
comparison and see what these two look
like if you've seen and inspire 4G
you'll know I'm so happy that HTC got
rid of that awful sim card slot that the
inspire 4G had so hard to get into that
another 4.3 inch foam let's bring in the
charge for verizon see if this look like
the charge is probably a little bit on
the fat side it is a little bit fatter
side so this is just a 3g phone so no no
4g here could see a 3g so they did
include a sim card and this has been a
first look it's going to be available on
june fifth i'm on a big fan of the
windows phone 7 platform my name is
going to get even better and even more
viable with a mango update coming soon
so you've been in the market for you
larger screen in Windows Phone 7 device
this looks like it's going to fit the
quite nicely stay tuned to technobuffalo
for all your windows phone 7 HD 7 s
coverage I am John render and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
