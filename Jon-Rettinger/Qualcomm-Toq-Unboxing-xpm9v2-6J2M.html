TechnoBuffalo here with a smartwatch fan
unlikely maker this is the Qualcomm Talk
the company that's probably powering
your smartphone is trying to get onto
your wrist it packs a lot of really cool
cutting-edge feature let's go ahead and
take a look and see if it's worth your
SmartWatch buying dollar or the Qualcomm
talked a lot of cool proprietary
technology I went into this guy so what
the box includes and that kind of stuff
but we will run through all that
business one thing to note though
Android only right now will require
version 4.0 point three and a bug to go
ahead and slide off the sleeve this is
sent to us from the folks at Qualcomm PR
department I will go ahead and use the
ridiculously unnecessary in boxing knife
to cut that plastic attempt to cut that
okay ha
let's go ahead and open this sucker up
its competing in really is becoming a
very crowded SmartWatch world this one's
got a few trips tricks up its sleeve
that no one else has pretty cool box I'm
getting started stuff up here do not
discard this is gonna let you adjust
your watch strap there are some pins use
your SmartWatch customize the strap and
that is about it here is the Qualcomm
talk I've never had a chance take a look
at this guy so I'm kind of excited to do
so push that aside for just a quick
second this I assume has something to do
with accessories so some quick charging
information stuff in here this is gonna
be your charging pad it does use
wireless charging but it's not the Qi
standard its Qualcomm zone we power
there's a kind of cool little kit also
if you want to get a pair of headphones
that Qualcomm will provide you go ahead
and buy those and it will store in there
separately but company how this works so
you press the button and you place the
device right there it will start
wirelessly charging you plug it in via
micro USB kind of neat
rested in the box you've got in micro
USB favor cable and a wall work and that
is about it
let's take a look though at the reason
you are here this is the Qualcomm talk
so you're looking at a Mirasol display
you're probably saying what the heck is
that some crazy LCD right well then
chily it's Qualcomm zone technology uses
sort of ambient
from the outside to light up the screen
so supposedly in direct sunlight you
could view this guy without any issue is
all which has a huge benefit over
devices like the Galaxy gear which
really become useless in direct sunlight
it's a 1.5 5 inch capacitive display the
222 PPI so a relatively higher
resolution again to work with jellybean
or above if you notice that though or
any button so you're probably thinking
how do I turn this thing on they're
actually in capacitive strips on the top
and the bottom here which make it work
which are kind of cooler touch centers
that are built right into the strap
it's got 240 milliamp hour battery in
there as well and wireless charging
again as qual comes when we power let me
bring in some competition to compare
here is the Galaxy gear this is also
gonna run I should mention 349 dollars
so it's not a cheap investment so here
it is next to the Galaxy gear you can
see a real quick thickness comparison it
definitely looks a little bit on the
thinner side and here it is next to the
pebble smartwatch
now you can see what these two look like
next to each other and top and bottom
somebody had power this guy don't take a
real quick first look so here is the
talk watch all powered on I wanted to
illustrate again how the charging works
because it was really unique I've never
seen anything like that so this kind of
pill box music box looking thing is
actually how you're going to charge or
they mentioned earlier if you buy the
external headphones you can save them
right there so there is a power cord to
plug that envy on micro USB that goes
into a wall then you go and push this
little button right here this rise is on
up and then you take your talk watch you
put it with this side facing out and
that's how it'll charge it uses a
Qualcomm proprietary inductive charging
standard and it'll charge just like that
doesn't have to touch it actually to
charge it just to be near it and you get
a little LED indicator light right there
to let you know that it's charging kind
of neat
I was very ingenious would probably be a
bit of a pain to travel with this giant
thing but that is how it works so those
aren't the only touch areas though on
the watch the little black area is also
touch incitive area so you can scroll to
see other watch face it's like scrolled
there that one would show me that I have
any meetings you get some different
designs there are a ton of different
options out of choose from and of course
you be able to download more as they
become available let's go ahead and
unlock this real fast
I'll give you a quick tour of the UI and
then I'll walk you through it again a
bit more as I use the device so it's a
grid icon you can tap it to open a
particular application you scroll down
so you can see stocks or status will
jump up the settings will faster that
looks like scroll up and tap it it's a
pre responsive screen is capacitive and
it works very well and presumably it's a
Qualcomm power and sit expect it to be
very fast and if we were power off and
factory reset our it's a pretty nice
looking watch as well it's a little bit
on the bigger side but it's not overly
thick so it looks pretty nice on our
wrist I don't have giant wrist I don't
have Loras I got sort of average wrist
so it looks kind of cool looks very
futuristic I'm really excited to use it
put it through its paces and see if I
can learn all the gestures and see how
it performs looks like Qualcomm might
have a winner on their hands here if
they get this guy adopted by sort of
mainstream SmartWatch users and perhaps
even some folks don't even know their
SmartWatch users I might want to
consider picking one of these guys up
anything that you want to see in
particular that we should leave in the
comments down below and I will give you
guys a full walkthrough of what this can
do anyway
I'm John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see you guys in the next video
