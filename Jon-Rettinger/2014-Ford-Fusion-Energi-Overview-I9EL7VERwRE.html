to you by Full Sail University what's up
everybody
John rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo
here over the past week we've been
checking out this beauty behind me it is
the Ford Fusion Energi it's a plug-in
hybrid and it looks absolutely gorgeous
so looking at the car you'll notice a
few things about the design first the
let's just kindly call it Aston Martin
inspired grille sort of the new face of
Ford we see it trickled down to almost
all their whole product line it is bold
its strong and it looks really really
nice the redesigned fusion looks also
equally as nice as the grille it's got
really nice low lines LED headlights the
back could look a little bit less
generic but the front of the car more
than makes up for it so what's going to
power this guy is a plug-in hybrid so
it's got a 2-liter Atkin cycle 4 liter
engine paired to a 7.6 kilowatt hour
electric battery it's gonna combine if
you have a full charger full tank of gas
4 620 miles of total range if you just
want to go and pure electric style
they're really gonna get about 20 miles
depending on how fast you drive but
don't go fast in 85 miles an hour or the
gas engines going to kick in they've got
a charge this guy up on a standard 120
volts can take you about seven hours and
that's just you know whatever you plug
into at home like you'd use for anything
else or a 240 it's gonna take you about
two and a half hours when you're just
using the gas side of it you're gonna
get a really respectable 43 miles per
gallon which is feel pretty nice for a
car of this size so this doesn't work
like the Volt the Volt for example uses
the gasoline engine has a generator
this works as a true plug-in hybrid so
they work in a few ways it could work
together so as you're accelerating it
could pull power from the electric pack
and also from the gasoline-powered
engine you can also go pure electric and
then when that starts to die out it'll
switch on over to electric but they can
work side by side so with two power
trains on the Ford Fusion Energi both
can power the wheel so they could work
side by side or one going and then the
other so primarily the way you're going
to use this is you'll drive your 20 mile
on Pierre electric range if you have
less than a 10 mile commute to work or
20 miles the place you can plug in then
no problem you'll run almost 100% on
pure electricity assuming that you're
not going to go fashion 85 miles an hour
but what happens if you're driving
longer than that then the gas engine is
going to kick in and continue to power
you just like any other gas-powered car
would if you've got it in standard drive
mode you want to accelerate really fast
it'll pull power from the electric and
also from the gas give you a bit more
acceleration so kinda nice you get the
best of both worlds with a car like this
it's gonna be available in two trims the
SE which we have and you can get sort of
nice things all a cart we've got pretty
much everything decked out on this or
the titanium artis is fully fully loaded
with all of the tech trimmings inside
it's got Ford's next generation smart
gauge with eco Drive which shows kind of
cool leaves growing on one of the two
customisable LCD displays so you a
couple of that at the heads-up display
which simulates brake lights flashes on
the windshield and if you don't react in
time the brakes will pre charge it
increase the brake acid sensitivity to
provide full responsiveness when you
brake so he'll protect you in case
you're not protecting yourself I also
has standard Ford things sync like my
Ford touch it's got lane keep assist in
active parking assist will actually a
parallel park itself which is really
kind of cool to see so driving the car
is a bit of a mixed bag driving
electricity is absolutely awesome and
get that instant torque I think of it
like an electric drill as soon as you
push that trigger that thing starts
spinning at full torque same thing with
the electric car we're they get one rpm
you are getting full torque and it's fun
to drive when you're using the
four-cylinder engine though it's the
less fun to drive it revs up really
really really high there's very little
low-end torque when you're running on
gasoline when the car is running
services as a hybrid with both a battery
charge and a full take a gas it was a
lot of fun to drive when I started
running just on gas though it was a
little less of enjoyable experience
so at 7.6 kilowatt hour battery pack has
to live somewhere and the most likely
place is going to be in the trunk so
you're gonna lose a lot of storage space
if you pick up a Fusion Energi so make
sure you can live with that the way the
charge of car is pretty standard for EVs
now a day it uses a standard j1 172
which you'll see pretty much every
public EB charging station Tesla's the
only companies that provide
you will be fine trying to plug in
anywhere you want it does not have
support for the faster DC Chatham Oh
charging at least be aware of that if
you live near one of those fast chargers
take a quick minute to thank our friends
and overall good people at Full Sail
University you've got a smart phone you
know apps are freaking everywhere but
did you know that by 2015 mobile app
development projects going to outnumber
native PC projects by four to one so you
can get in early sort of on that upward
trends if you're interested and a future
and technology mobile is gonna be where
it's at and Full Sail University is
online and on campus mobile development
Bachelor degree program you can teach
you the skill set you need to get in
early hopefully make them sweet beaucoup
bucks their Full Sail universities
product launch box students are going to
get a free MacBook Pro Industry software
plus iOS Android devices because you got
to know what you're testing on its ready
to master your technology and software
to compete in this rapidly growing
industry check out Full Sail edu slash
TechnoBuffalo to learn more again that's
Full Sail ddu slash TechnoBuffalo go
back to the video so the Ford Fusion
Energi combines a lot of technology into
a pretty nice-looking package if you're
looking for sword the benefits of
electric vehicle with the freedom of a
standard gas-powered car this is a
really really nice option if you drive
much farther than 20 miles an hour be
aware you are going to have to obviously
use that gas engine which is not the
most responsive
fun type of drive but if you can keep
your commute smaller and primarily use
the electric side of it you're gonna
have a great fun car with plenty of
torque so it's not like a cell phone
where you just be like hey you can drive
this for the next two years a car is a
huge huge purchase so you're gonna want
to do ton of cross shopping with other
competitors in this market and there are
a lot of hybrids not necessarily plugins
but a lot out there so you guys will
tear your thoughts will you think about
the Ford Fusion Energi you like the
looks of it you like the car I wonder
what you have to say from zero in the
comments right down below till next time
I'm John rende you from TechnoBuffalo
see you guys next video
