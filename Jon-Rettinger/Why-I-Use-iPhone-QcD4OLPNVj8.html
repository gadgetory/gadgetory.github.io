to for two and a half years the first
iPhone I bought I had never seen
anything like it before I mean I
remember when Steve Jobs took the iPhone
turned it and we saw coverflow
for the first time that was unbelievable
to see men yell to pinch-to-zoom in
photos was awesome
and typing on a keyboard that was just
on glass something that was completely
new I bought the first iPhone even
though I couldn't afford it at the time
because I loved technology at the time
that was the most cutting-edge
technology that felt like I was holding
the future in my hands it's hard to
believe the iPhone 10's has been out for
six months it's pretty much halfway
through its lifecycle before Apple
replaces it with whatever is next during
that time I've reviewed a lot of
different phones and iPhone in love with
some of those devices that I've tested
but in between those review periods
I find myself always coming back to the
iPhone before we continue at the video I
want to thank you guys for watching
hopefully you've seen a change in the
videos the past month we've had a lot of
fun making them there's plenty more
coming your way so be sure to subscribe
int that little Bell so you can notify
when new videos are out and I want to
give a big thank you to this video
sponsor Robo rock so you've seen robot
vacuums before but if you've seen robot
vacuums with lasers on their heads
that's what the Robo Rock s5 has it's
gonna use lasers to map your house so
that it'll always get every area clean
it's got usual stuff you'd expect got
sensors so it's not gonna like fall off
the stairs but it does more than just
suck things up it's also got a mop head
on it so it can mop your whole floor as
well pairing is super easy if you're
using an Android phone actually just put
the phone right on it to get it to pair
via NFC as you can do with most things
nowadays you can use an app it's got the
my home app but you fully control the
vacuum via your phone there's like an
area that you got especially dirty it's
really awesome and
it has the best sucking power that I
have ever seen in a robot vacuum so
somebody who's not home that often one
of the coolest features you couldn't
schedule it at a certain time of day or
several times a day to go out and just
vacuum her house on its own then it'll
come back to the charger when it's ready
for interested in checking out or even
picking up the Robo Rock s5 for yourself
we'll link to it down below and again a
big THANK YOU to Robo rock for
sponsoring this video
so the 10s in this case the 10s max
isn't that different than the 10 that
came before but you get some nice
improvements the big one is obviously
the larger screen here but then the
general s stuff I usually get get a
faster processor and better camera all
that comes together into a package that
makes for in a slightly better
experience what you had with the last
gen but most importantly with these
changes now six months later they're
still noticeable
the best 10s features actually the 10s
max feature the fact that I can get a
bigger screen and also have better
battery life to go along with it I've
always liked big screen phones and I
will probably always go with the biggest
screen iPhone that I can get my eyes
kind of got used to the original retina
displays which I don't think we're the
best screens but since they went to the
10 and out of 10s and the 10s max the
screens are awesome it looks incredible
colors look vibrant the blacks look
black you get the best of OLED I think
here and this is definitely the best
screen the apples ever put on a phone I
like to think I take pictures pretty
much every day and they're usually
impromptu pictures generally it's the
only camera that I've got with me so
probably my favorite 10s feature is the
camera every picture I take look some
version of good you can ask anybody who
knows me I generally have my head down
and I'm staring at my phone so good
battery life is really important I've
been able to get great battery life
ahead of the 10s max I charge my phone
every night so long as I can get through
a full day that's important so as much
as I wanted iOS 12 to be the big design
change it was definitely more
incremental but the few things that I
really love in it I think that probably
the biggest one though is just overall
stability sort of fixing some the
problems iOS 11 had 12 has been really
stable almost from the get-go all that
is fine the iPhone 10s is a good phone
but it takes more than just a good phone
to get me to keep coming back nothing in
the phone marketplace is perfect but the
iPhone 10s pretty much checks every box
that's at least important to me
Apple's always been known for certain
things and it's kind of like the Trinity
of the phone world you've got amazing
hardware really solid cameras and of
course iOS when I pick up an iPhone I
know maybe it's Apple's Johnny I've
voiced over brainwashing but I feel like
I'm holding something premium like I can
feel the quality in it and certainly
that quality comes at a premium but
always know that I'm not gonna find
anything else
it really comes close to how that phone
feels in the hand may subconsciously
it's part of the reason that you know I
like the iPhone iOS itself is the
biggest reason that I keep coming back
and it's because I can't get that
experience anywhere else and it's three
main things in iOS that keeps me coming
back to the iPhone first its iMessage
being able to have group threads get
receipts
I love having iMessage the second thing
is airdrop and the biggest one probably
right now is Apple photos and my 90 year
old grandparents using an iPhone SD and
I have a shared gallery I share pictures
of my family my grandparents see those
pictures and they respond almost every
single one it's kind of cute they think
I'm sending them just to them but I'm
not going to teach them how to use
Google photos they barely can use the
phone as is the fact that my
grandparents can see pictures of my kids
as they're growing up things are
happening on a daily basis and they get
that kind of intimate connection with my
family is reason that I would come back
to do iOS one of the reasons people
knock the iPhone is it so simplistic but
the simplicity I think is part of its
elegance too you don't really have to
think that much about what you're doing
the phone kind of works very intuitively
and that's one of the biggest reasons
that I generally recommend an iPhone to
somebody who doesn't have an OS
Allegiance so if you take all of these
features on their own there are ways to
duplicate it on other operating systems
but you put them all together let's
restart to see sort of the elegance of
what the iPhone offers and I'm not alone
here
howdy there folks I'm Quinn of snazzy
labs hey guys lost it one of the things
I really love about iPhone is that it
just works the reason I use an iPhone is
pretty basic right I mean first of all I
do prefer iOS over Android I mean it's
just a straight-up like my own personal
opinion the default settings are
fantastic third-party software works
amazingly well I couldn't even tell you
the last time I rebooted my iPhone
because something went wrong apps just
still even all these years later do feel
a little bit better on iOS and also
things like iMessage are even though
there are ways to get around it now
still so much easier to use when you
have a Mac you have an iPad you have an
iPhone it's just the standard Apple
ecosystem stuff right
I loved it seamlessly between my Mac my
iPhone and my iOS devices I can send
text messages and sync photos and send
files it's just a really really great
platform is it that exciting no gonna do
the latest and greatest no but it does
everything I need to do really well and
all the time so I know what you're
thinking John there's plenty wrong with
the iPhone and to you I say yeah you're
right Apple is not quick to make changes
and you can see it by what the Android
flagships are offering you've got things
like reversible wireless charging which
you charge other things from your phone
that's really nice to have I mean my
wish list would be USB sees when we have
to carry one cable when I'm traveling
that would be awesome to have and I
think really what the next iPhone needs
is on the operating system side iowa's
13 needs to bring some visual changes
need to bring some more customization
options I keep harping on this the
biggest nock though on the iPhone 10's
generation is the obscene pricing that
Apple has going on I don't care how they
let you finance it or what incentives
carriers are offering the pricing on the
iPhone is insane and they are pricing
the 10s making it seem like an elite
phone it's a hard phone to afford for
anybody it's a lot of money to spend on
something there's gonna be a better
version of in 12 months any way you look
at it whether you upgrade your phone
every three months six months 12 months
or every three
the iPhone 10's Tenace max are too
expensive there's been over 20 different
versions the iPhone between pluses and
Max SES and C's and there's been a lot
of issues in a lot of those generations
things like being able to hold the phone
wrong software bugs security concerns
phones that are bending these have not
been perfect devices out of the game
every time but assuming you know you're
you're holding it right you know what
you're getting with an iPhone and that's
to say you know what iOS is going to
give you get a few more customization
options each year it gets a little bit
faster but for the most part the
experience has been the same I think
more importantly consistent and there's
beauty in that consistency and that
keeps me coming back to the iPhone
generation after generation and that's
not to say there aren't good options
from other operating systems but I like
that consistency I like what Apple
brings to the table and it keeps me
coming back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
