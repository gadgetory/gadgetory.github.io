from technobuffalo here when it comes to
released android handsets there are two
that are vying for top spot we've got
the HTC built-in nexus one which can be
used on eighteen t or t mobile's 3g
network and we have the HTC built droid
incredible running on verizon's network
these two are very close kissing cousins
if you will that share a lot of the same
internals up there are some differences
that i want to go over with you so let's
talk about some of the similarities
first they both have 3.7 inch capacitive
screens with the same resolution and
they're both o led with 480 x 800 pixel
density and 65,000 colors they're about
which is 16-bit for those you guys
keeping it home keeping track at home
the nexus one here is running on gsm
networks the droid incredible is on cdma
and a lot of you were waiting for a
nexus one on verizon however google said
today that will not be coming so if
you're looking for an Android experience
on verizon the best is the incredible
that we have in the front of us here
battery life there a little bit
different the drawing incredible is
going to get you about 5.2 hours of talk
time in about 144 hours of standby time
the next one however is going to get you
seven hours of talktime and about 250
hours that goes to show you a little bit
about how the interface is consumed
battery life I'm go get the users your
interfaces in just a minute both right
the newest version of android 2.1 the
nexus one has a 5 megapixel camera on
the back with a single LED flash the
droid incredible has on the banquet for
jet backup has a 8 megapixel sensor with
dual LED flash so a little bit higher in
the camera resolution departments and
double the flash alright so we've talked
about specs that both running the same 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor very very
similar respect however little different
experiences so they both have capacitive
buttons across the bottom the same for
button array I've got an early model
nexus one this is a came out I believe
the day it was released we had this unit
in so I've had some problems with these
capacitive buttons at the bottom they
have been so responsive you tap and tap
them too often times they don't work
however newer reports devices that is
shipped in the weeks and months since
release claim that has been fixed but
some of you guys may be have that
problem or be plagued at that issue if
you have a newer model nexus one or you
bought up craigslist for example or ebay
other capacitive buttons here on the
incredible or very responsive and work
just as well as physical tactile buttons
the other big difference here you're
going to notice is the trackball is how
you do your navigation to move around
you can get some physical tactile feel
there and you can push it into select
we've got sort of a more high-tech
optical trackpad here on the incredible
which also serves exactly the same
function you can push it in to select so
for all the games that need a trackball
or trackpad you can use you to one of
these and look probably work just as
well it's really six or half dozen they
both do same thing can depend on which
one you prefer personally I like the
optical trackpad like it's minimalistic
look out of anything protruding from the
phone but that's just a personal
preference alright so let's talk about
the user interface user experience
that's where the big differences are
here this is an unskinny in its natural
habitat android 2.1 as a google
programmers engineers designed it to be
which is definitely not a bad thing
android 2.1 offers a lot of really cool
features can see those little swirling
lines the background it's part of the
live wallpapers that the operating
system offers sure to get some
interactive and immersive desktop
experience so with the nexus one stop
android 2.1 you get five home screens so
you can scroll through and see there are
five right here go back the other
direction exit the rest of them now if
you want to jump from one home street to
the other you can certainly slide your
finger crossed or use the trackball guy
did right there or you can hit those
little dots at the bottom which actually
pulls up almost a deck of cards living
feature i can get it there we go and you
can jump to whatever home screen you'd
like on the other hand the incredible
take advantage of HTC's custom-built
sense user interface which not only adds
to extra home screens for a total of
seven but handles the way you move
between your windows of it differently
it's got something called leap so i go
ahead and pinch
access the leap features only have three
windows to actually have anything on
them but the rest of them are down here
I can tap and go to any of them that I
choose so I've got a blank one right
here I have to tap the home button I'll
take me back home if I long press it it
will go back to leap as well so again
personal preference how you like to
navigate I like delete function I think
it's very intuitive to just swipe your
fingers across it and jump to the home
screens you look at the menu trace
here's where another indifference comes
in it's sort of a 3d menu trait and see
I'm folding into the background the
Snapdragon chip in here can handle
decent man through your processing same
thing with the nexus one you've got 3d
processing of here as well although you
get just sort of a static array same
check they have a quite a bit but a
little bit more eye candy at least as
far as this is concerned on the nexus
one and this is probably one of the two
places where you actually see a little
bit more than I can you so we'll go
ahead and exit additives let's go back
and talk a little bit more about the
user interface so the big deal about
Android one of the reasons I think it's
been so successful is because it's based
on widgets it means you can have a lot
of little programs running on the home
screen so here I've got a widget that
controls all of my power options but
hold down the home screen here you get
ton more widgets the initials are the
standard Android widgets and some that
i've downloaded extra i'm sure you've
seen these many times I've gone through
them on countless videos however with
the droid incredible you get these
widgets plus a ton of extra HTC one's
let me show you it does look like so
here are all of standard widgets plus
the HTC One think see there are many
many more a lot of either just HTC is so
right below on so stocks HTC Twitter's
HTC weathers HTC you get something
called friend finder and friendfeed so
aggregates all of your social network
clients you can sort of pull everything
at all at once there are a lot more
options for customization here at least
the devices out of the box you can
download extra widgets and itional
functionality on the nexus one and you
can even port the ROM over to the nexus
one however I want to give you a
demonstration of what these devices look
like when you just pull them out of the
box I got very excited right there so
one of the things that I really do like
about incredible and this is just me as
I like the big clock in the weather
integrated right there now there are
weather widgets you can have in clock
widgets for the
just one but I liked how really nice and
integrated says I can tap it I get a bit
of a 3d animation about the weather you
can see it's a little bit cloudy and
sunny if it was raining here raindrops
and start to show you can scroll through
and see different areas it see there's
some raindrops right there in New York
and go ahead and wipe some away just
seems to be a bit more polished
experience I think that sense takes
everything good about android 2.1 just
quite a bit it adds a little bit more to
it one of the other places where I think
that perhaps a stock Android build maybe
add some functionality is in pictures
let me go ahead and find where the
pictures are right here gallery the it's
sort of a 3d look of pictures you can
see some video that I've taken there you
can jump right to the camera will go
back because just but probably a little
bit more 3d immersive environment than
you get otherwise you're kind of hit the
button to go back and have in difficulty
so represented I think of the capacitive
buttons here so some 3d rendering kind
of neat here pictures aren't handled
nearly as eloquently let's go ahead and
find photos and those who just handled
in a grid however you can serve scroll
through these bottom part to see all
your photos from Flickr they've
integrated from facebook and then your
album photos this you how the
differences here the keyboards are
definitely different on both these
devices let me show you what they look
like we'll go ahead and go into
messaging and post opposite side create
a new message this is the stock android
keyboard that's going to come with any
android 2.1 device out when you rotate
into landscape to get the landscape
version of that you take a look here you
get actually HTC keyboard oh it's just a
little bit different it's a bit smaller
width wise the keys are a bit longer
comes it actually a little bit easier to
type on the HTC keyboard than I do on
the default android keyboard I'll share
what they look like as well in landscape
now androids got a fantastic autocorrect
and HTC sort of built on top of that
added some more auto correction features
so again another a little nice advantage
so I think having the sense UI you also
get a bit more sort of bundled in
what you get with the device a little
more applications so you get card panel
it's essentially your Google Maps
Navigation a few other features with or
with a nice user interface on top of it
we go back continue here you get a city
ID essentially a phone book look up desk
clock it comes with FM radio footprints
which is geo tagging of your pictures
anybody that uses that French dream is
that contact aggregation for social
networks that were talking about so
pulling all of your social networks you
can see what your buddy jim is doing on
Twitter and Facebook it's got a built-in
Twitter clients PDF viewer we've got
quick office or in here stocks
application you've got a teeter game
which is sort of like a labyrinth
accelerometer thing voice dialer voice
search and then there's the weather and
still YouTube that you get on other
Android devices let's take a look at the
applications that come standard with the
nexus one will go home launch
application tray so you get quite a bit
here as well but not nearly as much some
of these are applications that you
downloaded and again you can make up for
the lack of included features on the
nexus one simply just by downloading
them from the ever-growing android
market however when it comes down to if
i have to pick one of these two devices
it's a no-brainer that i'm going to go
with the droid incredible it's quick
it's got HTC support and HTC usability
what just adds a lot of nice little
features that you'll notice so another
one of those instances go to messages
they can back out the messages list so
nice way to scroll through and select a
little visual candy but this reason that
extra visual stuff does take battery
life so battery life is important to you
soft nexus one may be a good way to go
over if you have no problem getting
through a day and a half before trekking
the device I think the incredible is a
fantastic phone and a great choice call
qualities but excellent on it user
experience is fantastic they both have
multi touch capacitive browsers saying
almost exact same network a processor
speed and they both do just quite a
quite a bit however it comes out the
personal choice I prefer the incredible
you can see right there it gets really
glowing trackball on the next
one so before I sign off actually there
is one last future that I want to show
you what the web browsers other both
running race similar browser if you got
TechnoBuffalo keyed up on here and we'll
let the side load of Google both
multi-touch pinch-to-zoom and let's
check out a website with Flash content
will go to flash com which is adobe site
logo flash com here I'll go to flash
column on the incredible and type
sideways harder than it looked alright
we got flash mob here so on this one
we've got a you must download the adobe
flash player which adobe says is going
to be coming but they have not released
it yet however on the nexus one we've
got flash already integrated into the
browser now it does not be unfortunate
you can play hulu hulu won't work but
other flash content like flash games do
actually load and look these in a little
bit choppy you'll see right here in a
minute so there's flash content loading
/ pre fast Wi-Fi network exhibit so you
can see it
so for those he that flash is very
important you gotta have it got to have
it got to have it then incredible it's
really going to be the best way to go
because it hasn't right now and that's
just one other Android devices will be
getting it soon you can see it's a bit
choppy but it's usable and washable
there's something that I felt that I
needed to share with you guys that is
one of the other fundamental differences
between the two phone and I hope you
guys enjoy it and sort of curious to
know which one you prefer which one
you're leaning towards if your verizon
user definitely got the incredible if
you're a GSM user so if you're on AT&amp;amp;T
or t-mobile you are not going to regret
a nexus one purchase it is still a
fantastic phone running a very robust
and growing operates ism so guys hope
you enjoy the jon rettinger from
