from TechnoBuffalo here with a
head-to-head comparison of the old
versus the new we've got the former
top-of-the-line blackberry the Bold
97-80 against the new king in town at
the 9900 we're going to put these two
head-to-head and see the differences
really are so with very little doubt the
9900 is a superior phone from almost all
stand points than 97-80
but the big question is how much better
is it and it's that difference going to
be worth an upgrade for you is it going
to be worth you wanted to buy a new one
or perhaps getting a great deal on a
discounted 97-80 let's go ahead and put
all these guys through the test and see
how things come out just to sort of keep
things fair we're going to do a complete
reboot of both devices so we're starting
from least a fair comparison purposes so
I'm gonna go and pull the battery on
that I'll pull the battery here as well
we're going to go ahead and run through
the specs of both of these as they start
to boot up then I'll probably have to
speed it up because this guy takes quite
a while to boot up so battery's pulled
here on the 9900 it's been pulled pop
that back in and I want to do this on
camera so you guys can see that we are
running this is fair comparisons as we
can do here alright so let these guys
boot up want to go ahead and run through
all the specs on both of these so this
is the Bold 97-80 this is an unlocked
version which is using a T's 3G networks
it's running OS 6 as compared to the
9900 running blackberry OS 7 more on
that later
two point four four inch non capacitive
non-touchscreen at all versus a larger
2.8 inch this is a touchscreen
resolution here was a bit low on the 480
by 360 if you looked at images or text
you certainly noticed it higher
resolution here 640 by 480 from a weight
standpoint 122 grams and a little bit
heavier but not much at a hundred and
thirty grams a bit of an anemic 624
megahertz processor here and a much
faster
borderline modern processor 1.2
gigahertz 512 megabytes of RAM 768
megabytes of RAM they both rock
by megapixel cameras well this guy can
shoot 720p video but does not have
autofocus unfortunately they tried to
keep the fitness down so the autofocus
sensor got axed 512 megabytes of storage
and 8 gigs of storage so there's a lot
of differences here in specs I wanted to
sort of show you and tell you at least
what those were so while these guys are
booting up I will come right back
alright so our full boot ups are
completely done I've used both these
songs as my daily driver
I used a 97-80 for about two months and
a 9900 I've had for just about two weeks
since it first came out if you want to
see my review and 9,900 link for that
will be down below so we're going to
talk about size keyboard navigation
speed feel OS and some button business
let's first talk about the size this is
a pretty big blackberry harkens back to
the old 9000 the original bold and
clearly see that this is a much larger
phone and you feel that difference when
it's in your pocket you can see that
screen size right there when you're
stacked up on top of each other do a
little more level there you go and now
you can see that it is definitely a
larger phone certainly the thinnest
blackberry around so those make up for
it in that department
but if we're going to keep this in your
pocket and you're wearing some skinny
jeans you're definitely going to know
that it is in there alright so let's
talk about the big thing here what makes
a blackberry bold a blackberry bold and
what blackberry is really known for and
that is this keyboard so the keyboard I
97-80 was a pretty solid keyboard it
worked well keys were a bit small I've
got pretty decent sized thumbs and they
able to get used to it pretty quickly in
fact I thought this was one of the
better certainly not the best but a very
decent usable keyboard now if we jump on
over to the larger keys here on the 9900
about six percent bigger and boy you
feel that six percent this keyboard is
absolutely amazing as hands down the
best keyboard I have ever typed on
easily besting the outstanding HTC
status and a t-mobile sidekick 4G this
keyboard is unbelievably easy to type on
the keys feel a bit different they've
got a bit more click eNOS to them
something you have to really feel to try
it for yourself with a keyboard here
absolutely awesome if you are a heavy
email or a texter you are definitely
going to want to try this phone if
you've gotten used to
let's say and on-screen keyboard like an
iPhone or someone one of the Android
devices this is going to be a really
welcome experience I got really used to
fit the virtual keyboards I was an
iPhone user and I got very quick at it
this I am probably twice as fast and
twice as accurate really an amazing
typing experience and once I started
getting used to physical keyboards I
remember why I liked them so much so
definitely a huge step up
there's a reason alone to upgrade
difference in keyboards from this to
this
ah definitely takes that cake alright so
let's talk about navigation so you want
to navigate the BlackBerry or any
BlackBerry prior really this one
exception the torch you got to use this
guy you can never get around you can
scroll go to different panels find what
you want doing this not gonna do much
for you other than maybe dent your
screen now you've got that same sort of
navigation options you can go ahead and
have to get around just as you could on
the other phone you can see how it kind
different stuff
there's things there you can swipe
different panels however now you can
also do this and you can tap things you
can go back and flick sir yes I'm sure
you can navigate with your finger hooray
because it is a touchscreen it also
means like things like websites for
example you could pinch to zoom I'll
talk about that in just a minute you
don't have to navigate any more with
just your finger which is pretty awesome
so let's take a look at media we'll go
ahead and look at pictures for example
and let's take a look at some wallpapers
to look at that one that's pretty if you
wanted to zoom in on the old wallpapers
here we go to media go and do that same
thing pictures let's go down to
wallpapers and find one look similar
how about well it ones close out you
want to zoom in you had a select it and
it keeps ooming and here if you want to
zoom you can just do that it's actually
very very smooth at 1.2 gigahertz
processor with the graphics acceleration
really is quite nice rim is calling that
liquid graphics which is really code for
our phones not slow anymore things
actually work for anybody who ever used
in older blackberry being tried to
install an application you constantly
had that little ticking thing that went
around or just using the phone you had
taking thing that went around and
rendered the phone I'm usable until it
was done thinking I've very rarely seen
that on this phone even when I'm
downloading an application surprise
surprise I can still use a phone that's
like you can on every other modern
device so hooray for rim for throwing
some pretty decent hardware now behind
their operating system so much faster
experience overall alright so let's go
ahead and talk about speed we're going
to talk about burroughs air speed now
and to do that I'm going to do a
clearing of cache and all that business
so we've got a apples to apples
comparison so I'll run down to options
scroll down here we'll go ahead and
clear cookies will clear them everything
clear now I want to do this again live
on camera so you guys can see that
there's no funny business going on
nothing's being edited I do have the
mobile network turned off on both of
these this is my regular phone and
didn't want it to ring or buzz they're
connected both to the same Wi-Fi network
so I'll do the same thing here it's
rolling over to browser I'll go to
options options and we'll clear
everything out here as well all right
clear cookies because nobody likes
cookies push content and we will clear
now delete cleared memory all right so
everything is now good to go
let's go ahead and open up one of my
favorite blackberry site instead I've
been reading quite a bit let's go and
check out crack break well go ahead and
load that up here even typing again on
this keyboard after using the 9900 just
feels weird just feels worse you'll have
a good anymore crackberry.com all right
I will do the same thing on this guy all
right so should be much easier now to
get these to go at the same time get
into the same Wi-Fi network everything's
been cleared a know ATT going on here
that's been turned off it's on the same
Wi-Fi alright so let's go ahead and load
them up and it's going to load the
mobile version so I showed up here first
on the 97-80
and is not yet shown
on the 9900 still loading there we go
and it loaded the same webpage so you
can scroll through H no checkerboard
scroll through here
no checkerboard let's go and look at
some navigation so here's the article
there's an article here's an article if
you want to zoom in sir tap it sometimes
you never get to hit the option and zoom
in you can do some keyboard shortcuts to
a bust easiest way to zoom here pinch
and zooming works very well look at that
it's smooth and it's fluid hooray for
that alright so now we've looked at
crack break aam it's been loaded here
for the first time what if it was
already stored in our memory we'd
already looked at it before it's like
that we viewed quite a bit let's go
ahead and refresh it and see what was
going to happen so we'll go ahead and
hit enter
hit enter and see if that speed is any
different I ate this one maybe a second
before just as a heads up so almost
identical here from speed Department
let's go ahead and try loading a few
more websites let's try my favorite
sports site ESPN it's going to load the
mobile versions of each of these and
again never been loaded on either DS tap
that ESPN ESPN I got that already queues
it up there and we'll do ESPN here esp-2
type in you thank you yes p.m. that
didn't launch it upper dot-com all right
so we're going to go to the mobile
versions of both of these we'll go ahead
and hit go go and we are off doing some
ESPN action so a little bit quicker here
on the 9900 low times
generally I found a 9900 to be a little
bit faster but not by much but once the
page is loaded you can only see
difference between the two here the
browser speed is supposedly about 40%
faster on OS 6 at a hundred percent
faster than OS 5 so you've got the same
things here at pinch to zoom and is very
smooth the fluid as smooth and fluid as
androids been or iOS
so really nice job with the browser so
if you were a blackberry user in the
browser was important to you you're
finally gonna have something decent all
right it's going to take a look at some
apps
let's open up see what kind of download
stuff I've got stored in here go ahead
keep trying scroll over to my finger not
going to work so let's open up some
applications let's say I want to open up
what's similar let's go ahead and try
Google Maps oh it's not going to load up
probably but you can get a sense of
speed so I'll do Google Maps here Google
Maps here and open well I'm not
connected not probably the best test
slice to say that this is actually much
much much faster whether or not you're
launching menus or moving around moving
around applications here you have
several things open at once you really
notice the speed of the extra RAM
now really enjoy the 9900 it's you don't
notice that things are slowing down
whereas an older BlackBerry device
you're very cognizant of things you
could and could not do and anybody you
use an older BlackBerry device no yeah
it's sort of live within its limitations
not so much anymore you can actually use
your phone like a normal phone so hooray
for that alright let's talk about the
feel of both these phones it seems like
a weird thing to talk about the feel of
the phone but it's very important here
with these two all plastic here on the
97-80 I got sort of that aluminum or
aluminium depending on where you are
feel and look to it plastic you can hear
already got some creaks to it it has a
nice quality build but it feels a little
bit cheap because all the plastic here
with that metal accents that sort of
woven glass back soft touch on the sides
this film feels really solid in the hand
and it feels really great to hold into
use this one felt cheap certainly the
thinner side but it wasn't awful I had a
bit of a hollow feel to it there's a bit
of room here between the battery door
and where the battery actually is not so
much here so there's a much more solid
feel to it I like the way this feels in
the hand it definitely feels a bit more
solid speaking of having the phone in
the hand speaker quality is absolutely
outstanding here that any 900 on the 97
ATI to have the volume turned all the
way up to have sort of ample
while making a phone call here about 60%
it's perfect for me so speaker volume is
really loud on the 9900 alright so talk
a bit about OS I'm not going to get too
much in detail about OS 7 so I've
covered it sort of to death but there
are differences here so you can scroll
around through all your panels so now
you can get rid of panel so I only have
media all' and download here you can't
really do that so I got downloads
frequent all favorites and then media so
a little bit of a tweak I've got some
voice search here now so I can search
for voice didn't have that here
overall some niceties beneath the
surface here with the OS 7 who got that
liquid graphics which is code again for
our phones not slow one of the things I
don't like the sort of kind of nitpicky
I want to scroll up in screen to screen
it sort of locked right that see that if
I don't go all the way it sort of snaps
back I know it's because I'm not going
all that far but I wish if it knew I was
moving there that it would just continue
to scroll through screens but stuff is
very smooth here to liquid graphics do
work very very nicely so strange to sort
of talk about you know all of that how
it feels with your finger it's certainly
going to be subjective Oh from my
standpoint it really makes all the
difference one of my complaints I had
with the 97-80 was at the top of the
phone here this is how you unlocked or
locked the phone you pulled it out of
your pocket sometimes if you put it down
face down into your jeans or whatever
you're wearing
you'd hit this button and something you
realize that your pants felt very very
hot cuz your phone a bit on for a few
hours and your battery was getting
drained um it was just very easy to hit
on to the other side of that so on the
right was the mute button on the top of
the 9900 that's been fixed you now have
a almost recessed power button which if
anything is a bit hard to hit you're not
going to edit by acting definitely got
it people know that you're want to hit
that and that mute button has been moved
to the middle of the volume rocker which
is a bit oh when you have the phone up
the side of your head you want to adjust
the volume generally you think of just
having two buttons you have to serve
train yourself to think there's let up
down and then one in the middle so a
little something to keep in mind overall
I have been absolutely ecstatic and
thrilled with the 9900 the phone is
quick it's fast handles email with
awesome alacrity it just does a really
really nice job of everything I've
thrown at it here apps turn there aren't
as many apps as other ecosystems and
that's only one of the knocks on RAM and
black bear as a whole it's once you use
the phone it's pretty solid with the
ecosystem of getting stuff onto it and
transferring information can certainly
be less let's just say eloquent which is
sort of a bad word to use elegance
elegance what I'm thinking of less
elegant than other ecosystems but I love
the 9900 it's going to be my daily
driver for the foreseeable future I wish
it a better battery life we have about a
12 hundred or so milliamp hour battery
here in about a fifteen hundred million
power battery here and you have to be
very judicious with your battery on the
9900 sorry I have to turn my brightness
all the way down to about 50% I usually
am a high brightness kind of guy and if
I'm near an outlet I'm gonna plug it in
for about an hour so so better your life
certainly not outstanding so this has
been a comparison head-to-head if you
will of the 97-80 versus 9900 and in my
humble reviewing opinion isn't extremely
worthy upgrade um I just can't tell you
how much this experience as a whole has
been improved from little things like
the glowing trackpad to the awesome
awesome keyboard and field vos 9900
finally is a blackberry that BlackBerry
users deserve I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you next
video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
