TechnoBuffalo here I've been getting a
ton of questions about the performance
on the new core i7 I'm at thank you may
I begin to use the computer and get a
better sense of what it can and can't do
all the answering start of each of those
individually however one of the more
popular questions that I can't answer
right now is how is a boot up time with
the solid-state drive this has a two
terabyte spinning drive and a 256
gigabyte solid state drive that the
applications and operating system are on
so I'm going to go ahead and do a quick
do it up here and let's see how quickly
it loads all right so I've got the handy
timer right here so you can sort of
check things out and I will start the
timer and hit the button here at exactly
the same time so we go one two three go
alright so the computer is booting up
we're at just about 5 seconds out and I
will say they had to go into my system
preferences and I had a select a
solid-state drive as the boot drive and
that did make things much quicker so
it's loading right now right about
nineteen seconds and there it is about
23 seconds or so as the full boot time
very quick applications launch very
quickly as well let me show you the
application launch people decide later
here for Time Machine go ahead and
launch iMovie and all these are loaded
right on the solid-state drive iMovie
launches very quickly you can see it
just launched up there on the other
monitor let's take another application I
will do a head tag comparison to with
the old iMac to see whether or not
there's a bigger performance difference
let's go ahead and launch let's say
something like iTunes for example so
pull that up very quickly and launched
right afterwards it's really very little
delay between hitting the button and
seeing the application actually launch
here's Firefox for an example things are
just very very very quick and that may
be due to the faster processor or the
solid-state drive and the more ram or a
combination of all of it the thing that
really do launch much faster than I
expected and I guess put this answer at
some of the quick questions that you had
about the core i7 I'm a solid-state
drive I'll be answering many many many
more including gaming performance again
I'll compare it with the old iMac and
I'll do some benchmarks to see how the
sync stacks up all right John render
TechnoBuffalo not see you the next video
bye-bye
solid-state drive is worth it on the
core i7 iMac and these question I've
been getting with the solid-state drive
so this does have a 2 terabyte solid
what's up everyone John Redinger and
TechnoBuffalo here are beginning a ton
of questions about the performance of
the new core i7 iMac one of the
questions that I've been
