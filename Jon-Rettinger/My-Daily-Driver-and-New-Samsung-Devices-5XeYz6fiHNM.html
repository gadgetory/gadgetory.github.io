to you by full sail university hello
YouTube walk back there pisode of asta
buffalo i am your host John Rogers to
show where you could ask me anything
techie that's on your mind sometimes
stuff that's super duper not techy let's
go ahead and jump right into the first
question it comes from at MTG 2016 who
asked at job for Lakers would expect
from Samsung this year I expect a lot
from Samsung highlighted by better
design new design more industrial design
I like to assume that gone are the
plastic days of galaxy s4 and even the
galaxy s5 the keirsey view design
language that we saw start with the
Galaxy alpha and continued in the galaxy
note 4 we're going to see more sort of
prototype designs to get released to the
market we might see galaxies edges start
coming out with two curved edges
continuing the line that we saw with the
Galaxy Note edge in addition to designs
we're going to see more metals being
used less plastics less fake letters of
course we're going to see lollipop
permeate all the way through remembers
all sorts regulating we're going to see
way less TouchWiz and smaller TouchWiz
footprint on sampling devices which I am
personally cross my fingers for next
from at Joan the boss 24 ass at john for
lakers is it possible for oxygen as an
over-the-air update for the 1+1 so
better perspective one plus says parted
ways unfortunately SI engine and they
announced their new software is going to
be called oxygen don't know much about
it other than of course at its
android-based last week we saw some
leaked screenshots or was allegedly
oxygen OS the answer to your question is
can it come over the air guess of course
and come over there can be a huge file
it's gonna be Wi-Fi only but any update
can pretty much go OTA so whether or not
the original one plus is going to get
that or have the option to get is yet to
be seen although if i were you i would
tip us on engine but least until we know
more oxygen just my opinion next at
swarmer 1986's at john for lakers we're
expecting from the alleged upcoming
macbook air refresh so for clarity this
is not the rumored 12 inch macbook that
we've seen rumor for about a year with
the fan lyst design gonna come in
different colors this is just an update
to the existing map
your life I think we'll get an ounce
without much fanfare supposedly on the
twenty-fourth of this month people say
gonna be just processor upgrade zappa
can pick from the two-point do gigahertz
core i5 a 1.8 giga its core i5 chip and
a 2 gigahertz core i7 processor while
keeping sort of their already existing
11 to 13 inch form factors with current
macbook air's until if you don't know
launched the new broadwell processors
that are perfect fit to the current gen
MacBook Airs last month so it makes
sense about four to six weeks later we
see them permeate down to apples actual
computers nothing giant not gonna have
an event for these just small speck
upgrades the existing MacBook Air Lines
I would guess it's probably the last
upgrades we're going to see until the
macbook air gets well endowed with
retina displays let me stopped real fast
to thank our friends at full sail
university as you probably know every
industry relies on some sort of software
