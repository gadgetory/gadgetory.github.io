anchor and the Power Core 2 portable
battery for making this epic video
possible keeping all our gear charged up
so this is a Tesla Model X it's actually
my card I've been driving it for the
better part of a year we've held off on
her floor review because the car was
delivered to me initially it was missing
a ton of features ultimately came over
the air so it has the autopilot 2.0
hardware but at delivery none of it was
active in fact the car could do less and
older cars that are quipped with
Hardware 1.0 when I mentioned autopilot
to Hardware essentially it's 12
ultrasonic sensors all around the car
and eight cameras gonna make this thing
eventually
according to Elon Musk and supposedly by
the end of the year be fully level five
autonomous so this version that I have
is a seventy five D the 75 means it's
got a 75 kilowatt hour battery in the D
is dual motor so essentially it's
all-wheel drive it's got an advertised
range of about 237 miles but I've never
once gotten close to that when I do
almost a full hundred cent charge
generally shows about 220 miles and
that's not actual range it's gonna
depend on your driving so you got to
really use the car to see how many miles
you can actually get Tesla's recommend
you charge the card up to a hundred
percent the recommend about 80 percent
so sort of cycles through the cells it's
gonna be a 0-60 time of about four and a
half seconds I've actually clocked it
that's where I got so it's not a slow
car for being something this big you
could option it up cuz let's sort of
change your battery pack size and get a
100 D give you a faster do 216 up your
range just under 300 and if you want the
fastest Model X available you can get a
P 100 D so bringing it down to about
four seconds or under four seconds and
keep that almost 300 mile range of
course things start to get super
expensive from there so driving an e V
is different for some people it's
obviously no gas and other questions
that I get is what is it gonna cost to
actually fill up or charge the car so I
charge my in off hours here in Southern
California so it's about ten to eleven
cents per kilowatt so from zero to a
full 75 kilowatt hour charge it's gonna
cost me about $8.25
so to go 200 ish miles it's about eight
dollars for me so way less what you get
with gas charging up tamal X is pretty
easy I installed the 240 outlet at home
when I just use the standard charge that
came with the car
it'll charge generally about 20-ish
miles an hour you can get bigger faster
charges but for me that was totally fine
it's like a cell phone I plug in at
night and I wake up in the morning and
it's got a full charge I never have to
deal with gas station tracer or issue at
all but if you need faster charging you
need sort of more regular charging
definitely got super chargers all over
the US in fact they're expanding I think
they're gonna go like 2x which is what
they have right now I would can charge
your car up to 80% in about 30 minutes
and it is insanely fast it's not quite
as fast as Gaston yet but it works and
the stations are almost everywhere and
actually inside the car will tell you if
there's a stall available mixer etymon
Alexa was the doors the Falco pink doors
people love them or hate them I'm kind
of in the middle
I certainly liked them when I got the
car sort of the big appeal of a car like
this and practical use they work very
well in certain situations and others
they are definitely an inconvenience
they used to be really slow when the car
first shipped it would take almost four
seconds the doors open up but as how
software updates have come doors are
opened up a way faster and I will say
even in tight spots I have never once
hit another car the cards are really
good about detecting overhead beams ever
hid overhead beams either putting kids
in out of the car it's been really nice
to have those I have to sort of twist of
my back to get kids in and sort of walk
up to the car and you can just put the
kids straight in so the Falcon wing
doors have held up really well I haven't
had any issues with them but my
passenger door it's a little bit a
creaking it you can you can hear what it
sounds like doesn't affect the
performance at all or detecting anything
it just sort of is a bit of an annoyance
so aside from the Falcon doors another
highlight feature of the Model X it's
kind of helicopter type of windshield
and you sit in the car it's unlike any
other experience you can look up and you
can sort of see straight up a difference
that a panoramic group you don't have
I'm sort of cross beam and just sort of
glass all the way up and it sounds
awesome on paper they put some sort of
tint on it to drive and block episode
and they claim it blocks 97% of UV rays
and the heat but it gets really hot so
Tesla does some things really well
they're innovators and technology but
some stuff is just kind of baffling to
me why
they would do it the visors on the model
X are weird it's like a strange magnetic
dance you got to pull it and snap it and
then pull it down again to get the visor
to come out and if you want to block the
Sun so you got his freakin glass over
you
it's strange to do and it's so little
profile doesn't do much so you can
configure the car with different seating
arrangement so you can get a five seater
a six seater or seven seater I opted for
the six seater I like to serve that
alley in the middle I mean it's gonna
give you two captain chairs in the
second row and then two seats in the
third row you get a ton of storage back
there that sort of a hidden compartment
in the back sort of store stuff kind of
like a minivan kind of looks like a
minivan anyway you've got the front
trunk two stories for sorting some kind
of extra stuff that you might need it so
I opted for the white interior and when
I first did our video on the Model X I
got a lot of like what's wrong with you
you got kids why would you go white so
according to Elon Musk
the vegan material that goes into this
is the most durable of all the Tesla
materials that includes their leathers
and synthetics so I was a bit dubious to
have white in my car someone who wears
jeans every day so going on now a year
I've had ketchup spill on those seats
I've had coffee spill on those seats and
I've had other gross stuff that kids
tend to eat on those seats and I can say
the seats look almost brand new so if
you're nervous about getting the white
actually seems to be really good even
more durable and some of the leather
options at Tesla offers so I option in
my car with the air suspension that
means you can sort of raise it up or
down you can sort of do it manually
it'll remember locations so if you'd
like to raise it up when you go to work
it'll do that automatically you get
there it's a really cool feature that
the car has the main reason that got it
thought is gonna make the ride seem a
little smooth I can sort of adjust
itself as it goes over bumps it turns
out the suspension on this thing is
tuned like a sports car you feel every
single bump in the road but I don't
matter you've got your suspension or not
I was kind of disappointed the
suspension of Tesla put in here it's a
way harsher ride that would have wanted
from the big family hauling SUV if I had
a Model S maybe I'd expect it if I had
even a model three or a roadster you
kind of want that hard suspension you
want to feel the bumps in the road but
like this that was not a welcome
surprise the biggest reason that I got
the Model X was autopilot I loved what
it could do and I loved the promise of
what it was ultimately going to be able
to do but as it stands right now it's
like leveled to a shot I mean it means
it can do some stuff they got to stay
aware and stay diligent but when it's
doing its thing in the right conditions
it is awesome so you give the cruise
control stock a little DoubleTap towards
you it's gonna activate autopilot and it
works you can essentially take your
hands off the wheel while paying
attention and the car is going to
navigate itself it's meant to be used on
freeways it's still technically in beta
but it works in all conditions
it works on turns it works in the rain
it works out of anywhere you want to use
it on a freeway damn is it cool if you
want to change lanes you put the signal
up and it'll change lanes for you on its
own it'll make sure things are clear and
it'll go it won't keep going if you keep
the signal on that you got to turn off
and turn it back on again and it'll keep
speed other features are coming like
being able to pass on its own and that
kind of stuff but as it stands right now
it works really well with a few super
dangerous caveat if it can't track the
lanes it'll try and track a car in front
of it you'll see the car kind of turned
blue on the - if flame markings aren't
so bright it'll kind of ping-pong around
it also works on city streets it's not
technically meant for that but you can
turn it on I'm going to go through a big
intersection if there isn't a car in
front you that it can track I mean this
thing can almost veer off into another
Lane so you got to stay diligent and you
got to stay awake when using autopilot
but in the right conditions it is
absolutely awesome it can make a long
drive or stop and go traffic really kind
of usable so I mentioned the cars
equipped with autopilot 2.0 and as this
filming doesn't really do anything that
the original auto pilot didn't but it
does do a ton of stuff so first the cars
got a summon feature which means from
your key fob or the mobile app you can
make the card go forward or back without
anybody in it which is insane and
ultimately the car is going to use the
autopilot 2.0 software to drive itself
so you could park it in a spot you can
summon it the car to come to you it'll
pull out the spot it'll turn
and drive and go right to where you are
doesn't work as of yet
right now it's forward and reversed but
it is really cool I'd also can for a
particular Park itself or parallel park
itself with varying degrees of accuracy
so I love the Model X for me it's
perfect but the car itself is far from
perfect I like what it represents I like
it's sort of electric propulsion I like
them kind of paying to pave the way for
cars like the model three I'm okay with
all of that I wish Tesla would have done
some other stuff I wish there was more
storage in the car I wish dividers
weren't freaking weird
I wish autopilot wasn't kind of
squirrely at times but overall in a
whole package the cars been incredible
that's what delivered on their promise
without going doors are awesome they're
usable they're not necessary but I'm
glad that they're here if anything
they're kind of a conversation starter
I'm really happy with the Model X it was
a three year lease for me and I'll be
sad to give it away in two more years
perhaps my next car will be a model 3a
model wife and another one of these guys
I think Tesla hit a home run with this
car I know it's not growing any beauty
awards but for a functional family
hauler or a car that has a lot of
storage capacity it's really good in
fact that's probably my favorite car
I've never had so much to my surprise
the ultra white seats held up the Falco
in doors have been usable with no issues
the car is still plenty fast enough and
I love it it's not a perfect car but
it's a perfect car for me this vide has
been a year in the making we wanted to
show the Model X when it got to its full
capacity or at least on par with what
autopilot 1.0 could do it's only gonna
get better from here we should have full
autonomy coming in the next two years
hopefully if you subscribe to eelain's
promises more features should be coming
over the next few years this car will
drive itself this car park itself
this car will become even more usable
than day one and I love that as a geek
as a car enthusiast as a tech guy and as
a dad this car has been the most perfect
package that could imagine so like
pretty much all V's for hydrogen the
Tesla uses lithium-ion cells to give it
its juice it's sort of the same with you
mine cells that's something like an
external battery pack would use and I
want to take a quick second to thank our
friends at inker for sponsoring this
video and making something of this epic
proportion
happen I've got their power core to hear
it's a 10,000 million power battery same
lithium-ion technology that's in the car
is in the battery pack like this so if
you want something that's gonna last you
wanna be able make sure your gadgets can
be charged much like you want your car
to be charged so I don't learn more
about anchor or the battery path will
link to them down below so you guys
think I hope you enjoy it's a new kind
of video for us I really want to make it
as epic as possible until next time I'm
John render from TechnoBuffalo hope you
guys enjoyed the review none of our
incredible aerial shots or car tracking
shots could be possible without the
incredibly awesome and talented people
at drone gear wanna check out their
channel link here they also did a BTS
video behind-the-scenes of our shoot day
with them we'll link to that down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
