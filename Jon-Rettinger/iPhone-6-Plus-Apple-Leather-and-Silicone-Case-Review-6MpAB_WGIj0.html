to you by ting mobile that makes sense
what's up everyone
Jon render from TechnoBuffalo here I for
most of my phone using history I've gone
without cases I'm sort of free balled it
so to speak I've taken the risk
I've yet to really drop a phone so I've
been alright that is until the 6 plus
cams I haven't dropped it yet but the
thing is incredibly slippery and trying
to get to the top of like almost had a
topple over so I'm going for a case as I
figure as long as I'm going to put a
case on I'm going to try a case video so
we got a whole bunch of Apple iPhone 6
plus cases here so bear with me as I do
my very first case review so in an
effort to prevent me from just throwing
my slippery phone out of my pocket or
dropping as I'm trying to get to the top
we're going take a look at some of
Apple's cases they're available in two
different options you've got silicone
and you've got leather the silicone
option is going to be 35 bucks and the
leather is going to be 49 and not for
the faint of heart and obviously
available in a cornucopia of colors
let's take a look at one the silicone
options first year I'll take a look at
the blue one
so first got the Apple logo right there
on the back it's got almost a sticky
texture to it so there's a lot of grip
when you put this thing on your phone
it's not sort of a flaccid silicone it
sort of stands out and stands tall and
proud so if you're worried all about
bending which I don't think you should
do let's provide a little bit of extra
rigidity for you the inside is of course
color matched now to the outside of the
case that's got a soft material in there
that'll probably also clean the back
your film it's really keep it well
protected there's a cutout of course for
the camera and flash there's a bit of a
black a ring around it to help with
glare so the case covers all the buttons
but of course you can still push it in
to get access definitely you want to use
it for a little while it takes a little
bit to to break them in but eventually
you'll get the hang of it
say for the profile switch so that has a
full cutout so you can access that with
your finger you've got the iPhone logo
they are designed by Apple in California
manufactured like most of Apple's things
in China let's go ahead and drop a phone
in and see
looks like we'll use a Space Gray iPhone
six-plus to put it in you just sort of
work it on in like you'd expect to in
solid case you should need directions to
install a case so looking at here on the
bottom this is now totally wide open so
if you want to use accessories or put it
in the docks didn't have any issue but
also leaves this open to the elements
other case options will cover it up so
you really pick what's best for you the
corners though do come around to make
sure the phone is in there nice and
snugly and is not going to fall out now
accessing the profile mocks which is
still really easy there just set up a
little bit of a nail on the volume
buttons and of course the power locks
which you can access really easily it
doesn't add that much bulk but it is
raised just a little bit past the screen
so if you drop it face forward it's not
going to land on the screen and
certainly something that you want to
look for in a case so here is what the
silicone case looks like let's take a
look at one of the leather options take
a quick sec to thank our friends at ting
that is t ing and with them they are no
plans at all you're not forced to pick a
plan based on what you think you might
use possibly could potentially use each
month is employee pay for the services
that you use and leave the service
whenever you want with no fees at all
then we hit an admin fee is no sketchy
charges and ting bills are super simple
to understand and only charge you six
bucks per device tax and your usage per
month that's it
so bottom line consumers are just
overpaying and I think under served
current customers with ting will likely
see a significant decrease in their
monthly bill as well if you're ready to
get started go to TechnoBuffalo tang
comments of 25 bucks on your device
purchase or get $25 in teen service
credit to use towards your monthly bill
moving on to the leather case it's a
very familiar story I've got the Apple
logo there on the back so of that same
black ring around the case of course
we're taking a look at the blue one here
color match the outside and inside and
this is real leather this isn't sort of
a naugahyde or synthetic leather you'll
see the same iPhone branding designed by
Apple in California manufactured in
China and that same soft touch feel that
we saw on the silicone case also you can
see it wraps around the same way did on
the silicon options the same cutout is
there and the same sort of slots for the
buttons are there as well
insulation super easy just as you'd
expect go ahead and slide that
and your phone is now protected and the
same story again at the silicon to raise
a little bit so as you drop it or put on
a table it's not going to rest on the
case I will see the blue does look
really nice on the space gray phone
again you can access all the buttons
relatively easily you can get to the
profile switch and the all-important
power and lock switch and on the bottom
this is still all wide open does I
mention these are available in a ton of
colors really pick whatever you want
some of them are backorder for instance
now if you want to order the pink
silicone case for some random reason
it's back ordered until October 31st
online but of course check with the
Apple Store by time you watch this video
because that could very well have change
you guys like sega's case videos let us
know we'll do more if you want I've
never done them before in the past
there's a lot of case options out there
I would be happy to sort of show you and
demonstrate I was fun doing something
new I hadn't done the case video before
