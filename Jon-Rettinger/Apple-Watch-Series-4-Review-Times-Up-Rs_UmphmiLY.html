wrist wasn't a dead giveaway I typically
wear a watch and it's almost always a
smart watch generally going between
whatever current gen Apple watches and
my Old Faithful the mode of 360 Gen 2
I've been using every Apple watch like I
said since the first gen I've been
rocking the fourth now for a better part
of a week and a half and I got some
thoughts and opinions and most
importantly should you buy one if you
want to see more Apple watch coverage
and all of our iPhone cards you have
coming up be sure to subscribe button
that bell I'm going to this video you
will know if you consider picking up the
Apple watch series 4 so to get the
obvious out of the way it expected this
is clearly the best Apple watch Evers of
apples ever made because it's the newest
Apple watch they've ever made duh it
makes me laugh every time they come up
on stage and declare that but the big
difference here comes down to size the
screen is about 30% bigger and it's a
noticeably better screen ordinarily when
I jump to a bigger screen on a phone I
notice it for a couple days and I kind
of just forget about it it seems average
I'm still very weird the screen is
bigger on here and I absolutely love it
text is bigger even putting in the
password is bigger and makes things a
lot easier to use at least for me my
site maybe not the best having a bigger
brighter screen has been really welcome
so Syria here is noticeably quicker than
the Apple watches that came before it
race the talk works well if you're in a
quiet environment but generally I just
end up saying hey Siri to launch stuff
and I was super pumped to use the faster
Siri with serious shortcuts first I'm
using quite a bit on my phone when I try
to use it generally this happens
navigate home hey Siri navigate home
so that's my shortcut to open up ways
and navigate home checking with the app
running your shortcut jacking with the
app I'll tap you when I'm ready so
either get options like a team on your
iPhone or just will tap you when it's
ready so you did the shortcut you
created does work on your watch you have
to wait it'll tap you when it's ready
and it's generally between 15 and 20
seconds after you issue the command for
it to actually happen on the watch
you're better off just taking out your
phone or doing whatever you gonna do on
your own
one feature I love it's not specific to
the Apple watch series for is walkie
talkie that works on older watches but
you do notice here is that the
microphone and speakers are way better
new microphone placement you've got
louder speakers and it's surprisingly
useful feature to have my wife wears an
Apple watch 50% of times we can
communicate I really like having that on
the series 3 I couldn't really hear the
speaker when I was outside - well I have
no problem at all with the series 4 so
that's I'm pretty nice other small
things have changed its ceramic now on
the back I've noticed no difference
there it's also noticeably thinner and
that translates to about 20% less actual
milliamp hours in the battery but it's
only really come down to about 5 to 8
percent less battery life for me than I
had with the series 3 so I'm not a giant
deal and perhaps I'm just using the
watch more to account that battery
discrepancy a button good for apples for
being able to shrink the battery size to
keep the life almost identical having
the EKG option there was nice not
necessarily even for me but if I'm with
a family member who might need an EKG I
was really excited to put my watch on
their wrist and let them test it
unfortunately that awesome feature is
not available on show can't really do
much with that speaking of things that
were surprising and I'm surprised that
wasn't there at launch
there's fall detection built in and you
may have tried it maybe bought a watch
and tried to fall on get it to trigger
if you're under 65 it's actually turned
off by default you got to go into
settings and turn that on and then I
took some stupid Falls to try and make
it work and it didn't work for me but
presumably I was to jump off a ladder
and fall it would it would it would turn
on probably one of the biggest Knox and
Apple products is that they're expensive
and the watches is no exception start to
399 bucks and goes way way up from there
and it's an extravagance product nobody
needs a SmartWatch I can say that
unequivocally
if you like the features of having us
I think this is the best one on the
market some people getting notified on
the risk of ever anything happens is an
annoyance I've enjoyed it I'm starting
to embrace it and sort of learn through
those limitations I still really like
the Apple watch series for I don't like
it anymore they did you have to watch
series three but it's clearly the best
watch Apple's made so if you have an
original Apple watch or a series 2 huge
upgrade for you the bigger screen
speaker placement you're going to really
appreciate what this has plus you now
you can get LTE they're coming from a
series three maybe you have LTE it's
less important of an upgrade unless you
need the fall features you need those
EKG features when they're finally
available but you have wait a year and
perhaps look at the Apple watch design
we've all waiting for when it finally
goes around so Apple watch series four
but I'm using an iPhone it is going to
be on my wrist I still really like it is
not necessary I can't pinpoint why
anybody would need one but if you're
like me and you kind of just want one
it's obviously the best one Apple has
made but what's your guy's opinion on
smartwatches in general are you excited
to see what's next from Android and
Google I'm curious to see what they do
we're prime for a nice wear OS update
there and I'm still hoping maybe series
5 will go around let me know the
comments the video thumbs up we
appreciate it till next time I'm John
Wright injure the TechnoBuffalo
