graces with its presence but you go to
download it and what's this it's a tgz I
just want marshmallow on my phone well
don't you worry I'm our birth center
we're TechnoBuffalo and we are going to
flash stock Android on your Nexus device
first things first we're going to need
to head to the Google factory image page
and grab the appropriate download for
your device in this case we're flashing
my Nexus 6 so we're going to grab the
marshmallow build for Shamu which is the
codename for the device we're going to
leave the link to this this page in the
description down below and we're going
to do the same for all the other links
in this video so check the description
for all the good stuff that you need
while we're at it let's also go download
the Android SDK if you already have fast
food and a TV setup on your computer you
can go ahead and skip this step if I'm
speaking gibberish to you then you're
going to want to pay attention ADB is
the Android debug bridge it allows you
to run commands on your device from your
computer fastboot allows you to do the
same thing but while your device is in
fastboot mode while it's off that allows
you to flash or install that's the fancy
word for it new software on your devices
partitions that it's using while it's
actually on and running once you've
downloaded the SDK we're going to need
to run the Android executable that's
located in the tools folder this is the
Android SDK from here we're going to
select the most recent SDK and the tools
you're going to check them all off and
go ahead and hit install it's going to
take a few minutes if you're on a Mac
and you upgraded from Mavericks to
Yosemite you may need to download the
Java Runtime from Apple without this
patch the executable might not work so
if you're getting a few errors head to
that page make sure you're running the
most recent version of Java while that's
all downloading let's make sure that our
device is ready to go go ahead and head
into your settings on your phone tap on
about and tap on the build number until
you become a developer congratulations
you did it you can now develop apps not
really
this just enables the developer options
inside the phone head into the developer
options which should be revealed now in
the settings and ensure that USB
debugging is enabled Wow look at you
you're doing so great I'm so impressed
okay now let's grab ourselves a USB
cable plug that sucker right into your
computer I'm going to be doing this on a
Mac but you absolutely
can do this on a PC as well you just
need the right drivers for your OEM and
you can omit the period and slash at the
beginning of the commands that we're
going to get to in just a minute pop
open your terminal or HL prompt if
you're on Windows and if this is where
you get a little light-headed stay calm
this isn't terribly hard and if you've
never done it before it'll be a great
great learning experience for you just
follow the instructions and you'll be
running marshmallow in no time
well you can install ADB and fastboot on
your computer we're going to do it the
harder way here it's important I think
to learn what you're doing so you don't
break your device all your computer is
doing is issuing terminal commands when
you're clicking on things in the UI all
we're going to do is cut out the
middleman of the UI and work directly
inside the terminal while we're not
going to install ADB and fastboot let's
at least make our lives just a little
bit easier in finder go ahead and move
your new Android SDK folder to your
Applications folder then make a new
folder on your desktop you can call it
anything you like here for the video
we're going to call it marshmallow move
your stock image that you just download
into it then open up your Android SDK
folder and copy ADB and fastboot to your
marshmallow folder now we need to make
sure that terminal is looking at the
right folder so in the prompt go ahead
and type CD and then users your username
desktop marshmallow and hit enter what
this is going to do is change the
directory that terminal is looking at to
focus on the folder that we're working
inside of CD means change directory in
Unix
so let's make sure that that worked go
ahead and type LS and hit enter that's
going to list all the files that are
inside that folder so that if you see
what we're looking to work with you're
in the right place what you're looking
for is the image ADB fastboot if you see
them great job we're almost there now
that we know that we're in the right
place let's make sure that our computer
can see our device we're going to use
ADB the Android debug bridge to see if
we can see our device as it's plugged in
go ahead and type period slash adb
devices if the computer can see your
phone you'll see a device in the list if
not make sure that you're running the
correct drivers on Windows and that USB
debugging is indeed turned on on your
device if you can see your phone let's
move on now
do you compress the tgz file and inside
you're going to find a bootloader image
a few flashing scripts the up
image and the radio image go ahead and
shut off your device and while it's off
boot it into fastboot mode by pushing
and holding the volume down and power
buttons until you see the android with
this little belly open look at that
you're doing so well
we're almost done you're also going to
want to go ahead and decompress that
image file that you see there you'll get
five other files inside of their boot
cache system recovery and user data
ignore those flash files in the folder
that got decompressed we're going to
flash these one by one your device has
multiple partitions on it and we're
going to need to flash a few of them
from here we're going to be dragging
files into the terminal window for ease
of use otherwise we're going to be
typing and we're going to be prone to
typos first we're going to need to make
sure that your bootloader is unlocked if
it isn't this command is going to unlock
it and it's going to wipe your device in
the process so make sure your stuff is
backed up on your devices screen check
on the bottom if it says device is
unlocked you can skip this step making
sure that your terminal window is always
pointing at the marshmallow folder go
ahead and type period slash fast-food om
unlock enter after each command we're
going to reboot the bootloader by typing
period slash fastboot space reboot -
bootloader you can get to this command
quickly by accessing your previous
commands in the terminal window by
pushing the up arrow since we're going
to be doing this more than once first
thing we're going to flash is the
bootloader so all of these commands are
going to be basically the same except
for the actual image file the name is
going to change so for this one we're
going to do fastboot flash bootloader
and then the path to the actual file
that needs to be flashed like I said
we're going to be dragging these into
the terminal window just for ease of use
but feel free to type it out if you
think you can do it next up we're going
to flash the radio again same deal type
in fastboot into the terminal command
flash Radio this time and then drag in
the radio and hit enter next up we're
going to flash the recovery you guessed
it we're going to type fastboot flash
recovery drag the recovery file in and
hit enter we're also of course going to
flash that boot partition so yep
fastboot flash boot and that file hit
enter of course after each and every
step make sure you're rebooting the
bootloader and finally we're going to
flash the system
fastboot flash system and the system
image file and you're good to go you can
see all the things that fastboot can do
just by running regular old fast food
without any other commands we didn't
wipe the device here so this is a dirty
install you're going to keep all your
data but if you want to start from
scratch just append a dash W before the
command that you want to wipe the
contents of the partition for for
example let's wipe our devices system
and user data before we flash a new
version of Android just remember this
will wipe your device clean fastboot - W
flash system and then the system image
is going to make sure that that system
partition is nice and clean before any
of the system files for Android are
installed and that's it you're all done
you made it now you just need to type
fastboot reboot and enjoy your new sweet
treat it'll take a while to boot up the
first time but don't worry it's just
doing some work under the hood if it
does get stuck at the boot screen wipe
everything clean and using what you've
learned now try again and make sure you
follow the steps if you're interested in
learning more about the command-line I
highly recommend checking out the
command-line crash course by Zed Shaw
it's totally free and you're going to
feel a lot more prepared the next time
you're looking to flash stock Android or
a custom ROM as I mentioned at the top
of the video links to everything
mentioned are in the description below
everything from the links to the Google
factory page to directions and you can
also check out the article on the site
if you want to find the commands so that
you can copy and paste them thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
guys learned something let me know in
the comments how it goes for you and
what you think about Android 6.0
marshmallow thanks again for watching be
kind to one another and I'll catch you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
