one of the big knocks on the iphone 3g
when it was released was that it lacked
to turn-by-turn navigation option to
really take advantage of the built-in
gps you're limited to just using google
maps but with the release of OS 3.0 for
the iphone 3g and the iphone 3gs that
has been rectified so let me show you
one of the rec defers if that's a word
this is AT&amp;amp;T navigator for the iphone 3g
or 3gs which gives you full turn-by-turn
navigation with voice guidance so this
application is free to download from the
App Store but it is going to cost you
nine ninety-nine a month it is a little
bit expensive but if you're like me you
get lost trying to drive home having
your turn by turn navigation system
always in your pocket is a well worth
the price you know certainly would be
nice it was bundled but for me at least
999 is a very worthwhile price let me
show you what it looks like go ahead and
fire it up AT&amp;amp;T Navigator and it's
powered by TeleNav which is really the
same system that powers a lot of these
cell phone navigation systems like the
ones found on sprint I know uses it I
believe that powers verizon's navigator
t-mobile really anything with the GPS
odds are you're going to see something
from TeleNav now this is just one of the
first turn-by-turn options that's going
to be available as we saw a few months
ago TomTom is going to be releasing
their own turn-by-turn navigation option
i'm sure other companies will follow
suit ones that won't have a subscription
model like this but for right now this
is the best available and you get your
nice warning when you open it up don't
attempt to use this while driving we're
not driving so first let me talk about
some of the negatives about this and i
get into all the good thing because
really are a lot of good negatives
certainly the price and i also don't
like that you can't type in landscape
and the last really knock on this is
that you do need a data connection for
it to work so if you're lost out in the
middle of the booties and need to fire
this thing up and going to work for you
so your agreed with a very familiar
navigation option this is very intuitive
to navigate
drive to you can select a ton of
favorites that you want to put in their
recent places address business airport
intersection if you want to do an
address you can type it or call it which
is silly i'll call it does is just call
a number which you can just do using
your phone but if you want to type it
you can go ahead and type the house
number the street the city the address
it really is quite easy so let's go
ahead and go back you can do business
you can search for local businesses
airports value intersections and again
you can type it or call it so let's go
ahead and pick airport there's an
airport right by me for those who have
been watching my videos for a while you
know before I moved you knew very well
there is an airport buying because you
heard a plane fly by every four minutes
and let me tell you I pretty much lived
in the airport it sounded like I did so
we'll go ahead to Orange County Airport
you can see what the routing looks like
so you actually will say the street
names too so right now it's saying quail
ridge so it's a right turn on quail
ridge as you're driving up to it in that
very and the next thing I was going to
say is this also gives you real-time
traffic and it'll rear out for traffic
if you do have excessive congestion in a
way you're driving and get a little
symbol up here in the upper left-hand
corner and if you tap it it will rear
out you for the least traffic so that is
actually quite nice so let me show you
what your options are here when you're
in the actual gps favors pretty
straightforward navigation screen as i
mentioned no support for landscape
unfortunately you can get a summary of
where you're going to go so you can get
a route summary of traffic summary or
map summary the route summary gives you
a very simple route to go back in
traffic summary it'll check traffic and
they'll tell you how much crap if you
have based on color see right there it
says minimize all delays so it will rear
out you to minimize delays and map
summary pulls up a map very similar what
you find on google maps you can search
along the route for anything you're
looking for
you can and trip so let's go ahead and
and trap a notch go through and show you
the rest of the options and just know
this doesn't work actually does work
quite well so we just went through the
search let me show you the maps and
traffic option and it should look very
similar to what you're used to with
Google Maps you've got a 2d or 3d option
so we'll go ahead and change 3d get some
kind of cool navigation and you can
scroll along and just looks and like
it's in 3d and you hit the little gps
button down there it'll pull up where
you are nothing really that exciting so
let's go back to the home screen tools &amp;amp;
extras I'll show you what we have here
you can set your favorites you can
choose your preferences you can choose
whether you want to route it fastest
traffic optimized shortest prefer
streets prefer highway or if you're
walking if your pedestrian flows of you
that are in big city it's like it free
to New York and you need some pestering
guidance that is always helpful traffic
alerts on or off you can turn off the
audio options with street names or no
street names you really can customize
this and make it really nice and easy to
use so overall I've been very impressed
with the TeleNav system I used it on the
palm pre and really liked using it it
really is this very same experience now
for AT&amp;amp;T I can't tell you how happy I am
to finally have navigation on my iPhone
I said earlier I get lost really easily
and having this little bit of a safety
net is quite nice I would certainly
prefer if it wasn't 999 but for me to
have that safety net net convenience
it's worth it certainly i'll look at
other non subscription models when they
become available and see if maybe that
offers a better option so hope you
enjoyed for exclusive content be sure to

for lakers i'll put a link up in the
sidebar and i'll see you guys in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
