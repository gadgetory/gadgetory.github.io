to you by go daddy what's up everyone
and welcome back to their pursuit of
renters riffs the show where I take
anything from the world of technology
that's going on and we chat about it
this week I finally had a chance after
all these years to go to comic-con
I'm doing this for emphasis I've always
wanted to go I've always read about it
I've always watched Chandler's always
watch to leave trailers avoid read all
the comics and I finally got to go and
it was super exciting so you ever wanted
to go to comic-con one of your someone's
first experiences keep watching it so
first of all registering for comic-con
is crazy difficult we've registered for
a ton of trade shows that any star
difficulty whatsoever but getting in for
comic-con is like a whole other beast we
had a pre-register press like six months
in advance we had to send in letters on
letterhead and prove that we were press
it was a whole deal but we finally got
approved and all it was good at the
world so we go down to San Diego for
Comic Con we took the train down there
were just about a two-hour train ride
down from Orange County I don't know to
expect I was expecting like CES but just
with comics so first we get down there
poop the train this is get to a train
station there are people in costumes and
you see all the pictures of everybody in
cosplay and it is like that everywhere
you go people ranging of all body styles
and shapes to them men and women of just
in various stages of dress and undress
walking around just walking around San
Diego which is also very weird so we
finally got into comic-con and I
expected just giant hog after haul of
stuff turns out it's really just kind of
one major hall where all this stuff is
and it's called comic-con but all the
comic book stuff all accomplished men
ders in the storage are kind of like
shunned in the corner which was very
weird but they had just thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands of
comics of everyone you could think of
even named he's never heard of there was
a comic I saw of a guy who super here it
was he could pick up his limbs and throw
it that is not a joke it was a thing and
I saw it absolutely bizarre they've got
things that are in slabs and comic books
out everywhere people are just talking
about nerd things in fact we can to talk
about nerd thing if you listen while
you're there you would hear absolutely
crazy crazy stuff the weirdest thing I
heard one of the most nerdy things I
heard
there are people talking about the new
daredevil series on Netflix and no joke
this is the voice I'm not making this up
with you a nerd say ok this is the voice
that I heard you're not really hoping
that daredevil Curie's on Netflix to
true the first material and that
daredevil does get his powers from a
radioactive post that falls on his back
and gets rid of a die site I really hope
they do that right and that was just an
example of the stuff you hear it is
awesome there's not been a better time
in the world to be a geek than right now
I'm 34 years old I'm not that far
removed from the middle school high
school ages but now if you're a geek in
that age you are like the coolest and it
is awesome to see so comic-con has
worked from being just about the comics
I went with her editor-in-chief shot on
a who fun fact used to run a comic book
shop I used to go all the time in the
nine years when it was just about the
comics and now it's sort of more about
the movies and the paraphernalia I go
along you know with comics and a lot of
anime stuff there and a lot of other
things I didn't know what we was that
goes along with anime but sort of all
about the movie that's sort of
prevailing everywhere if you want to get
into all these panels you see they
showed a trailer for season 5 of The
Walking Dead you want to talk to the
folks that are in Avengers age of Ultron
you pretty much you have to camp out
like four days in advance them

more nerd talk and the funny thing also
about Comic Con day we were there which
is on Wednesday there was a ton of movie
news coming out because you've got that
many people in a small area of cell
phones don't really work so despite
being at Comic Con I got almost zero
movie news and zero comic news that was
going on Marvel announced a sequel to
guardians of the galaxy and I had no
idea so it's kind of ironically when
you're at comic-con you don't know
what's going on in the world of
comic-con
the people walk around in costumes again
are absolutely awesome we did a whole
gallery of comic-con I'll put a link to
it down below if you want to check out
all the ppl pictures people in costumes
people just walking around all the Lego
stuff that was there it was absolutely
awesome to see comic-con was not what I
expected which was not say that was a
bad thing I expected just huge sprawling
displays comics everywhere I expected to
see celebrities walking around expecting
the panels easy to get into and maybe
that was just my naivete but that's not
what it was it was packed in that one
hall I mean a shoulder to shoulder with
people and on one side it might have a
guy dressed up like dr. doom the other
side you've got like sexy Spider Girl
next to you we're just kind of cool to
see and we just was a lot of fun you
have a chance the opportunity go to
comic-con I totally recommend it make
the trip if you're not in California
it's a San Diego I think is one of the
biggest beautiful spots the entire
country so it's a cool place to go for a
vacation but go there and experience it
if you can't it is absolutely awesome to
behold and the pictures in the gallery
don't do the whole thing justice but if
you want to live a little bit of
vicariously check it out it was cool to
see the melding of tech and comics there
were so many companies that using oculus
to sort of give an immersive experience
to what they were trying to show and
this was really cool when I kind of my
inner nerd my inner like 14 year old
oldest reviews to sit and read comics
and you know in shame upstairs it's kind
of proud and came back at and just
certainly a meal not just fun to be
alive right now it's just really cool
