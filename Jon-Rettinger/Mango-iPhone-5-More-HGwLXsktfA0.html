TechnoBuffalo here today is May
twenty-fourth and we had a lot of
exciting action in the techno world on
Microsoft stole the show today with
their mango update mango is not just a
tasty flavor of sorbet or ice cream
anymore it is now the newest updates to
windows phone 7 Noah went in here and
did quite a number recapping everything
that's coming out talking about the
viability of the platform so if you are
interested in improved live tiles
multitasking messaging new ie9 and just
general windows phone 7 stuff be sure to
check this out i'm personally really
excited about the new windows phone 7
update if you guys have been following
me on Twitter and I've been having quite
a struggle trying to update my samsung
focus to the node 0 update it's been
definitely not an easy process and i'm
still trying to do it so hopefully the
mango update will go a bit easier we had
some news from joey sony announces PSP
remaster series for play on the ps3 our
newest TechnoBuffalo addition our
resident camera guy Mike Pearlman
answered a question that I was super
curious about optical versus digital
zoom what's the difference if you guys
are looking at buy a camera and you go
into best buy looking on amazon you know
you see 5 times optical zoom 10 times
digital whatever it might be this
explains sort of what that means a
really good read if you're at all
interested in photography or think you
might be interested in photography
audrianna rather had a post about the
dell XPS 15z it's their new ultra slim
super powerful don't call it an adamo
laptop I guess you could say macbook air
competitor sort of in that slim market
very reasonably priced and really
powerful it from the market for a laptop
and looks are important and you don't
want to sacrifice power this is going to
be a pretty decent one to look at so
check this out Emily put up a post in
our newest TechnoBuffalo define series
where you and I'm playing it you get it
define the word and sometimes you can
win some cool stuff so this time you get
a defined troll
guessing some of you that are watching
this video might have a better idea what
a troll is than others and what's
becoming a regular occurrence Sony
mutant Sony got hacked again this time
sony music japan got hacked no apparent
data was leaked so yeah there but man
sony bad news i went to the new redesign
apple store 2 point 0 and took some very
poorly shot footage if you don't want to
watch it that is here we add an iphone 5
potential leak the back cover possibly
leaked out of China it does show the
camera location on the opposite side so
if you want to know what the back of the
iphone 5 might look at definitely check
out this guy we had a new ass the
Buffalo series ism fancy new graphics
tablets killed the netbooks one of the
questions where you guys ask all kinds
of bidness from the world of technology

sweet touch screen eating nook Anna's on
