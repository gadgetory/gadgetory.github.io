speculation we finally have the LGG six
isn't a final production unit so we
can't do our full review but I have been
testing and using it for about 48 hours
and there's been a ton of questions in
the comments of our video and on the
article about the phone so I took the
six biggest questions because LG g6
seems like six things makes sense so I
hope you guys understand the phone and
what it can do and not do a little bit
better so the first big one is the
screen resolution it's 18 by 9 and I had
the same question in the video is why
isn't just called 2 to 1 so I asked 2 LG
what the heck and they said people are
used to that 9 number so 16 by 9 makes
sense so calling it 18 by 9 just made
sense to people but I like to do
division so for me it's 2 to 1 but
that's at least a reasoning behind it
but more importantly in the reasoning is
what that's going to give you at least
what LG claims it's gonna give you so
it's a really long screen or I guess
it's kind of wide if you should turn it
that way it's great for multitasking
which is sort of native now Android
nougat which indeed just has you almost
get two square blocks if you are
multitasking which is a really cool way
to see two things at once
you know watch a video or reply to a
text or an email and also obviously LG
did a lot of stuff in their own software
take advantage of the unique screen real
estate their camera app for example you
get a full care cell on the left hand
side at the top pending on hey you're
holding it's good enough to click a
button to see all of your photos you
take and you can see them right there
also they have a square camera app so
you can see what Instagram pictures
gonna look like before you take them
there's a lot of things that it can do
that maybe you couldn't do on
traditional 16 by 9 or 3 by q aspect
ratio so the question that I saw a lot
was about the curved screen it's not
curves like the s7 edge the screen
itself while flat is curved in the edges
are curved that's to make the phone a
little bit more durable so if it hits in
the corner you can sort of dissipate out
that impact point there's also a lot of
other durability things that went into
the phone it has pretty much all the
gorilla glasses so the front screen is
Gorilla Glass 3 over the lenses is a
gorilla glass 4 and then a curved piece
around the back for the glass 5 so
really all the the Gorilla Glass family
is is on board here as well and on gels
talked about about the structure of the
to make it more durable for drops oh not
that I'd suggest you drop your phone but
if you happen to drop it you should be
alright perhaps the biggest question was
about the batteries three 300,000,000
bowers if people were like what the heck
other flagships have bigger batteries
and I mentioned in our hands on video LG
spent a long time talking about the
battery they could have put a bigger
battery in but they left space to make
sure this thing is safe you could tell
that them probably every other
manufacturer out there is terrified that
what happened with the note seven and
wants to make sure they avoided that so
they tested this battery at normal heat
levels at hundred and thirty hundred
forty degrees they gave it room to swell
they just want to make sure it wasn't
gonna smoke explode or catch fire I
think you're gonna see a trend amongst
manufacturers sort of follow that route
so that's why the battery well big isn't
as big as perhaps it could have been or
maybe would have been if the note seven
didn't have its issues that said LG does
claim pretty good battery life and in my
two days of testing battery life has
actually been pretty solid but more I
use it more lacuna another odd question
was where's the power button on the
thing so the fingerprint reader on the
back can actually push it in and that's
also your power button you guys love
high quality audio so good news bad news
the DAC on the LG g6 not here for live
in u.s. instead LG opted for the two
wireless charging standards PMA and Qi
but DAC will be there another market so
we need your digital analog converter
you might want to look to import a
device but at least if you're wondering
and asking what's going on to DAC now
you know and les definitely not least
this was the comments that I saw a ton
of was and I could be eating Ebola boot
loops with the g6
I know LG's had issues with dating back
as far as the g4 with boot loop issues
they didn't spell it out and I asked
them about it and they wouldn't sort of
comment on it but I'm using the phone at
least might personally have any booth of
issues so don't worry about that
get another serial and you guys should
be should be alright so there's six
combined things to know about the LG g 6
anything else you guys want to know
about the phone let me know as you
continue to test and build up to a
review you want to make sure you use a
phone for a while to sort of talk about
it and
the phone can do and it does a lot and
I've been pretty impressed with it but
things can change after only two days so
let us know in the comments down below
what you guys want to see and we'll talk
about it and I'll comment to the day it
was from our g6 hands-on it was a very
thoughtful comment from daaru 0:02 who
says no bezel my ass are you on crack or
meth and the answer is neither happily
neither what I meant was besides the
business are very small you went from
like zero to a hundred super fast but
because it's a conference today and I
got it you know if you want to check him
out link to them down below probably
don't but if you do that's where it'll
be gonna be featured never come in
comments today it's obvious leave you
get it see you guys next
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
