to you by audible what's up everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here
welcome back to their episode of rumor
roundup the title you should know what
the shows about we take all the tech
rumors from the week and I picked but I
think in three to five best and most
important and I tell you what they are
of this week we're to talk about the LG
g3 Apple might be releasing some new
hardware next month we're going to talk
about some Galaxy Note 4 and a mystery
rumor this rumor roundup let's start
rounding them up so LG's upcoming
flagship the g3 is looking to take the
crown from HTC an apple for being the
most leaked device ever remember the HTC
One m8 we saw that thing is written
everywhere so LG reportedly held a
secret pre-event in Korea that detail
its ups coming LG g3 flagship and a lot
of information leaked out I won the
attendees probably just did like this
like snap a real quick picture of
someone the lg's presentation including
a look at the devices specs design and
more but it was in Korean but
fortunately we have someone that speak
Korean our own right Troy translated for
us as expected the LG g3 will sport here
are what it's going to have until we
hear rumors of a prime device coming two
months after it gets released a 5.5 inch
quad HD display so John you're saying
what's a ppi quad HD to you sir or madam
I say 538 PPS which are quite a lot of
pee pees looks essentially the same size
physically as HTC One m8 although that
has a 5-inch brain so according to the
documents the LG g3 is going to be
rocking android 4.4 out of the box a
three thousand million power battery
which is definitely going to need
bluetooth 4.0 which is really nice to
see any Android devices NFC LTE and LTE
a advance on the camera front it's gonna
have a dirty megapixel sensor with
optical image stabilization or just
voice Snapdragon 80 to three gigs ram 32
gigabytes of internal storage and yes I
said giggle but deal with it much the
emphasis here that was put on the screen
it appears LG compares resolutions of
its g3 to Samsung's Galaxy s5 which in
this reviewer's opinion was pretty
baller and probably won the best one
on the market the slides also mention
colors it's gonna come and now the
standard pallet of black white and gold
variants which we've seen already on the
ton of phones of course until best buyer
this is a blue version a few months
later but it's not all about the heart
which also got some new features LG sink
gonna have some pretty big improvements
to the camera g3's cameras are going to
include that crazy laser autofocus
sensor that we've been hearing about
recently a slide doesn't say what kind
of sensor it's going to be on the g3
although the rough translation
essentially talks about a feature for a
speedy anti-shake blur and focus so if
you just do this can take pictures the
slide compares the g3 autofocus to stand
it out of focus saying that new method
is better but why don't they say it's
worse I'd be funny though and if you
like to do this a lot the selfie mode is
going to be the final slide you can
apparently execute the mode by holding
up your palm facing the camera like
you're waving and then making a fist
like this well it's hard to tell exactly
how it's going to work but LG will tell
us at some point but get sort of the
gist of it you look like this but camera
and I'll take a picture which is gonna
look really silly thing like the LG
shape it up to be pretty baller and
looked in kind of more advanced tech
wise in the s5 HTC One not prime
versions of course it's probably why
you've been hearing so much about those
just mentioned prime versions of those
flagships coming very very soon this is
something I don't get a chance to say
very often new Apple hardware is coming
next month our friend mark Gurman who
sports a pretty awesome track record has
said that Apple will indeed announce new
hardware during WWDC 2004 Witek 2014
unfortunately don't know what kind of
hardware they're going to announce again
it seems way too early for a new iphone
which pretty much everyone's expecting
to hit in either September or possibly
August other rivers o have lended
themselves the apples working to launch
and bring a version of its Apple TV
product not a television set but the
little box completely possibly its own
app store we're also heard this is sort
of long in the tooth which is a weird
analogy you like here that Apple is
going to be out saying i watch I planned
soccer at iOS 8 health book make sense
soccer out the iwatch as well if it's
ready a 9to5 mac think it's more likely
that we'll see apple talk about the new
macbook air with retina display which be
pretty sweet what is not as exciting as
an iWatch but
with apple tickle you can get new
hardware's new hardware on the software
front Gurman said we can expect apple to
reveal OS ten point n maybe just call it
11 already which has been completely
redesigned and tweaks to Apple map
software features for the iPad and
presumably split-screen multitasking and
iOS 8 so lots of stuff there double w c
kicks off june second and we're gonna be
there well have a lot of stuff to tell
you about remember lacquered WWDC apple
showed off the new mac pro but didn't
release it until later on in the years
maybe it'll show the iWatch and put it
in a case and then perhaps later we will
see it our friends at gsmarena were
pasts i imagine they passed like from a
guy wearing like a trench coat was like
his collar all the way up like like left
a briefcase at the information on it
suppose they got information about
device called Muscat which has the very
sexy moniker of n 9 10 reveals some
potential information on the new phablet
a device reportedly offer a 5.7 inch
display with quad HD resolution so what
resolution is that 2560 x 1440 that is a
lot of pixels that's a pretty good deal
larger than display on the galaxy s5
which betters at 5.1 inches leaked also
provide some insight on the galaxy s5
Prime said to have a qHD display that
measures five point two inches galaxy s5
mini which has a 4.5 inches boy and a
720p resolution if with this information
gsmarena guessing that samsung may boost
the size of the galaxy note for up to
five point nine inches which is big
following your trends in which samsung
has been creasing display size x 2.2
inches every iteration of its new
smartphone pretty much you're gonna
carry around like just thing this big
it's probably to be stretching it a bit
too large for my taste and I love me
some phablets but with first-class
baller hardware you might not want to
compromise on size so big hardware big
bone so our next rumor is probably the
best one before we get there I want to
thank the good peeps at audible you know

now it's time for that rumor oh hey
there n8 prime remember that close-up
shot of the ma Prime that was pretty
cool what's the picture but this frickin
gif of the unannounced device is even
cooler if you're gonna yell at me for
saying 'no gif and not Jeff to you I say
patacho now nothing is left to
imagination at all in terms of design
such a huge leak we get another glimpse
a device's Lumia like protruding camera
along with some other tweaks compared to
the current m8 model it appears as
though the super phone handset is
definitely coming and look at it
spinning that's cool we can gather HTC
is tweaking the design slightly to make
it feel a bit more premium the
sleep/wake button for example is now on
the side of the Vice I just under the
volume rocker make it easier for users
to one press the handset like this the
rear plate meanwhile is supposedly some
mix of aluminum or aluminium and liquid
silicone okay which will supposedly be
waterproof similar to Samsung and Sony
devices which is kind of cool the sides
look a bit flatter too while the back
doesn't really look as rounded as the
current m8 on the device is the left
side opposite the sleep/wake button
penny how you're looking at it it
appears as though the not Optimus Prime
model has two trays possibly for two
sims are more likely one sim card and
one microsd expansion port over it's
likely bad this is just speculation our
part and my part looks as though the
front facing speakers have been tweaked
slightly which maybe account for the
devices waterproof design according to
previous reports ma Prime good sport
Snapdragon 805 processor 5.5 inch 2k
display 3 gigabytes of RAM you just
think I'm a it's pretty great but look
there are bigger things coming we should
see it very soon though it's a july to
august ish so if you're thinking about
getting that brand new just released HTC
One m8 yours probably wait for the
students be just released HTC One m8
prime so really there's no
good time to ever buy a phone ever just
never buy a phone you just get like one
of those old-school Nokia's play snake
on it and be good to go because it is
never a bad time so thank you guys for
