TechnoBuffalo here one of the great
things about the Apple I device is that
they sink seamlessly with your Mac with
one click you can get all of your
contacts your pictures photos in
podcasts put right on over to your
iPhone iPod Touch or iPad however there
are a lot of other great devices out
there Android in particular and getting
all that information over to your
Android device has caused a lot of
confusion for people so I want to show
you how to very easily with just a few
steps get all of your pictures contacts
podcasts and musics and everything right
on over to your Android device let's get
started we're gonna start with music
pictures and podcasts it's a very easy
process you can download a simple piece
of free software as from sailing comm
I'll put a link to this down below you
can choose to buy it or download the
free version if you does have to
purchase it for 22 dollars or 15 euros
it's going to sink just quicker and have
a little bit more functionality but
nothing that I've needed the free
version works great one of the nice
things about the sailing software is it
actually installs itself right up in
your menu bar so let's go ahead and
install let's say you've already
downloaded it say the download button
here I've already got installed on my
computer and then go ahead and plug in
your Android device in this case I'm
going to be doing all of this testing
with a HTC EVO 4G Oh it'll work with any
Android button simply plug it in and
select USB mode depending on what phone
you're using it's automatically prompt
you for how you want to connect it so
I'm gonna go ahead and connect mine
right now
I've didn't say USB mode you may want to
select it as a disk drive anyway that
will get it to mount on your computer so
I just plug it in and it's letting me
know hi can see that you mounted your
device and it's gonna pull up this
little menu here which is gonna look
pretty similar to iTunes you can sync
all of your music podcasts pictures and
photos and I should mention with music
it is only gonna sync you're a drm-free
music so you go ahead and hop into music
it opens up your sort of iTunes looking
library you can select all of your music
podcasts or two
music or playlist rather I'm depending
on what you like to do podcast much the
same go in selected or podcasts that you
want photos much the same one here's my
iPhoto library I pick whatever photos I
want them to think over and as I think
them it'll show me how much remember got
left here so I've got six point five
gigs on the Evo and it'll fill up this
bar much as it will in iTunes as you
sync it over and go ahead and hit sync
when you have something selected and it
syncs it over nice and easily this is a
very simple free way to get almost all
of your information on to your Android
device let's go ahead and say you just
did that sync you can choose the same
from iPhoto aperture wherever you might
be and music you can go ahead and select
back and some real sort of pulling a
summary of everything you choose
automatically sync when it's connected
so let's go ahead and say you just did a
syncing your value information there but
you don't have your contacts when you
plug it in doesn't ask you to sync your
contacts well that is very easy to do as
well if you're like me and your contacts
are stored in an address book there's a
very easy way to import those to your
Android device let me go and open up
address book and I will show you so I've
got address book open right here if you
go to the address book number left-hand
corner and you open up preferences are
you gonna want to go ahead and hit
accounts and if you want to synchronize
with Google and go ahead and hit
configure once you configure you're
going to have an option to select a
Google account now here is where in the
past I've created actually new Google
account so you can create user X's
contacts one of the weird things about
Google if you seek it with your main
gmail account different time you send
the email to someone it saves it as a
contact unless you want all those
contacts put onto your phone it's best
to create a fresh account so you can
create one whenever you want
make a Google account user X contacts at
gmail.com type in your password hit OK
and it's going to sync all that for you
in just a few minutes up with Google so
the next thing you're going to want to
do is actually pretty easy let's go
ahead and jump to the phone okay so now
you've got your music your podcasts your
pictures on your
oh um but you can't call anyone you
forgot their phone numbers you don't
have any contacts on here let me go and
show you how to get your contacts up
from your newly created Google accounts
right onto your phone this is gonna be a
pretty similar experience for any
Android device you have regardless of
whether it's skinned or not here the Evo
has HTC Sense on it but they were
running a Galaxy S device with TouchWiz
or Motorola devices motoblur it's gonna
be mostly the same process so go into
settings will go into accounts and sync
it might be something different I'll say
you probably account somewhere go ahead
and hit add account Google and this is
where you're going to input information
for your newly created contacts account
now if you create it's getting give you
an option to sync sync your contacts
sync your mail and sync your calendar
you want it to just sync your contacts
make sure it's the only way I've
selected and it'll pull in all of your
contacts are right over the air in just
a few minutes it's a pretty easy and
seamless process if you are a Google
user it'll be a very familiar experience
it's not gonna affect your other Gmail
accounts that you may have on your
Android device and I just hope you enjoy
this tutorial showing you how to get all
your important information from your
computer right on to your Android device
