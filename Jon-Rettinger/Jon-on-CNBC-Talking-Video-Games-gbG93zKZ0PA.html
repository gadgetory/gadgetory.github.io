positive territory here's a set that we
wonder if you knew did you know that
more than forty percent of video gamers
are female so when we went in search of
the next big thing in gaming we call the
top female gamer on the planet her game
picks and her trades to match our next
day four of our next big thing series
brings us to the world of gaming from 3d
to motion controllers the gaming
industry continues to grow it's even
more technologically advanced every
single day and it's way better than the
movie industry so what will be the next
big thing in gaming and who's going to
bring it to market joining us from the
front lines jon rettinger
editor-in-chief of the tech blog
technobuffalo calm and cg star slayer
thorne the world's top female multi
multi genre pro gamer and we are
thrilled to have you with a CTO very
excited all right so thanks to both of
you for being with us let me just start
with you Donna just in terms the overall
industry here I mean a lot of people
don't realize how big it is and how
quickly it's growing so when we asked
this question of what's the next big
thing how do you answer it is it is it
what's the next new game or the next new
technology or the next new platform what
used to be what's the next big game
going to be but these consoles are now
having such longer life spans the xbox
360 is going to be extended for another
five or six years same at the
PlayStation 3 so now it's going to be
how the games themselves are evolving
we're seeing a huge push towards motion
controls then Tendo reefs assured that
in through the age of sitting behind a
couch the controller are gone Sony's
launching the brand new wand look in
PlayStation Move and Microsoft's
launching their completely controller
list Microsoft Kinect and don't forget
about the just announced new ipod touch
yesterday Steve Jobs that the ipod touch
is now the number one selling mobile
gaming console on the market osting
nintendo dsi line and the sony PSP so
mobile gaming is really coming up and i
think that's where the future of gaming
is going to be headed well let's ask cg
b cg you you know you live this every
day is that is that the next big thing
mobile technology I mean what what's
your ideal platform
I totally agree my ideal platform is
xbox 360 but that's mostly because
that's coming from a competitive
standpoint that's what sister mosul
tournaments are on these days but mobile
gaming definitely is getting big I
personally have an iPad and I play all
my games on that everywhere I go wow you
play them all on the iPad so you
switched quickly oh yeah so let me ask
you see do this big question we had I
don't have you heard in when we were
coming into commercial we said may
surprise people forty percent of gamers
are women but apparently we still don't
compare well the places like Japan where
even stay at home moms are very big
gamers in the u.s. not so much so how
could the gaming industry in your
opinion appeal to more women well I
don't think it really has to do anything
different women these days are appeal to
the same games that guys are I
personally I play Street Fighter I play
guitar hero you know you're not going to
find these girls playing Barbie
adventure you're going to find them that
they're gonna be taking your butt at
halo at gears of war so I don't really
think that game Ian that she really has
to do anything to give more females into
it by directing certain games at them
specifically you know females like just
the same things that guys do and I guess
a lot of us would say that that's true
in a lot of ways so CG when you as a
gamer made you do it full time do you
can you tell us how much you make I mean
is it a lucrative business for you um
it's a little tough sometimes it depends
it fluctuates between summer and fall
depending how many tournaments there are
but I specialize in marketing and
promotions so I get most of my earnings
from working with companies doing gaming
related events more than I do at
tournament winnings John what do you
think about what cg said that women like
the same things as men like and she's
talking about street fighter and a lot
of games that maybe a lot of people
incorrectly think our mail games and
what was the thing a few years ago women
are only going to like Sims and all
these other kinds of things there
something game companies can learn from
that
absolutely just like the consoles are
evolving the gamers in cells are
developing can't tell you how many times
i've been playing halo and I hear in my
mouthpiece I'm getting killed by a woman
or a girl since we're really be gaming
is the gaming demographics are
broadening on the daily basis and those
sort of gender barriers are completely
coming crashing down you know like CG
said the gamers just by marketing the
games themselves are targeting women you
see game advertisements really in places
you didn't see them before it's really
sort of reaching out to brand new
demographic there's making the gaming
industry huge when halo 3 launch which
is arguably the flagship game of this
concept is console era it's sold 300
million dollars in the first week 170
million in the first day the gaming
industry is getting to be almost big as
the movie industry and as such the
demographics are really expanding with
it all right and quickly before we go
see GI know you mentioned Street Fighter
and guitar hero in your opinion what's
the next big game that's coming down the
pike whew I can't really narrow it down
to one specifically but I think a lot of
the games that are based around the
Kinect are going to be very popular
alright well thanks very much to both of
you John CG appreciate it will look for
Davin you both back thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
