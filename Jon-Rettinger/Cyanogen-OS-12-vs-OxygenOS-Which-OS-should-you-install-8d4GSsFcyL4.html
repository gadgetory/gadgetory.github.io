to you by domain.com what's going on
guys Americans hangin from TechnoBuffalo
and today's video is going to be all
about the oneplus one more specifically
about oxygen OS and cyanogen OS 12 one
of the best parts about the oneplus one
has been the software experience of Sanj
and mod 11s and a year later owners are
finding themselves with two new options
based on Google's lollipop update in
this video we'll take a look at how they
differ if at all and ultimately decide
which one we think is better oxygen OS
is of course one plus his own rom which
looks and feels just like stock Android
with a few minor tweaks cyanogen OS 12
on the other hand is the latest build of
santa gen similar to oxygen OS it looks
and feels just like stock Android both
the anagen OS 12 in oxygen OS feel quick
and fluid swiping through different
pages going in and out of the app drawer
checking notifications everything is
buttery smooth actually I haven't
noticed any drop frames which is
definitely a good sign and the fact that
both look and behave like the Google now
launcher is a huge plus from a UI and
performance standpoint they're both
pretty similar however when it comes to
apps and features there's a lot to
differs here the boot animations are
different for both sange and OS 12 and
oxygen OS wallpapers are different as
well with the oxygen OS featuring
oneplus wallpapers along with lollipops
own wallpapers while cyanogen features
some old KitKat live wallpapers along
with its own cm wallpapers pre-installed
apps are different to most of the Google
Apps you'll find on stock Android
devices like Nexus 6 or the Nexus 5 are
already on oxygen like hangouts YouTube
Gmail and Google camera whereas would
say engine o as 12 you'll find the same
Google Apps pre-installed but with the
exception of santa gen camera app which
is the exact same camera app from c
engine mod 11 s cyanogen OS 12 also
includes two new apps
cyanogen email and baton cyanogen email
is an email app alternative to Gmail
which is powered by boxer and has
exchange support multiple account
integration and you'll be able to choose
what actions to perform when you swipe
left or right on a message but on which
works like a hand off in iOS 8 allows
users to send any app in its current
state to another device giving users
with multiple devices the ability to
seamlessly switch devices the Settings
app is different to Santa gen has a
our theme applied within the Settings
app there's a lot more menus and options
to go through in Santa j'en for theming
and customization purposes the
notification drawer is also a bit
different to Sansa OS 12 has the weather
displayed on the upper right whereas in
oxygen OS there's a button to quickly
reorder the quick setting toggles
switching apps are almost identical as
well with minor UI changes the oxygen OS
features a circled X button to close all
the apps whilst the anagen
OS 12 features a card based a button to
dismiss all apps cyanogen in general is
known for its customization options and
in cyanogen OS 12 the theming engine got
better you'll be able to customize
mostly every part of the OS from the
status bar to the navigation buttons to
the setting toggles to changing the
battery icon it's all customizable
oxygen OS on the other hand is basically
just like stock Android with a few
customization options specifically for
the oneplus one one of the biggest
tweaks here is the ability to reorder
quick setting toggles in the
notification drawer with a simple tap of
a button something that would take many
more steps in Santa and OS 12 you can
enable or disable off screen gestures to
activate the camera flashlight or music
and you can also choose between software
and hardware keys which our feature is
also included in sanjohnno us 12 let me
stop the video real fast and thank our

one word in caps at domain comms check
out as the oneplus one user I think
having two different OSS to choose from
is awesome for the less tech-savvy users
who want a friendlier and simpler UI
experience oxygen OS is a great choice
you have the full stock Android
experience optimized for the one with
some great tweaks that don't get in the
way if you're big into customization
cyanogen OS 12 is the right OS for you
you have a bunch of customization
options on top of a lot of really cool
tweaks making this the best version of
Sandage and yet we haven't spent enough
time in Santa Jeannot s12 yet to know
how the battery holds up so we'll keep
an eye out on that moving forward we
made a video detailing how to install
oxygen OS which you can find in a link
below whilst the anagen OS 12 should be
over the year with a new okay one plus
feature soon if it hasn't already
anyways if you guys like this video make
