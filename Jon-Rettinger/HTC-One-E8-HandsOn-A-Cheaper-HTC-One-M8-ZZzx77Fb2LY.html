to you by Dollar Shave Club what's going
on guys a m√§rklin Sangin from
TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be taking
a quick look in hands-on at this
beautiful looking device the HTC one EA
and see how it compares to it's much
more premium brother the HTC One mhm the
HTC One EA is essentially the internals
of HTC One m8 in a plastic case with a
different camera but beyond that there's
actually quite a few smaller difference
between the two
the Singapore version we have here is
running a slightly overclocked Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 processor at 2.5
gigahertz though there's also a version
that's available running at 2.3
gigahertz like the m8 it still has the
same two gigabytes of RAM and microSD
slot expansion though the e8 only comes
with a 16 gigabyte internal storage the
One m8 obviously has a much more premium
feel with its exterior aluminum casing
while the e8 has a polycarbonate back it
still has the same two gigabytes of RAM
and microSD slot expansion though the e8
only comes with a 16 gigabyte internal
storage the One m8 obviously has a much
more premium feel with its exterior
aluminium casing while the e8 has a
polycarbonate back now the one EI
doesn't offer an IR blaster unlike the
m8 which is right inside its lock button
instead HTC often to put in the somewhat
premium looking brushed aluminum button
at the top of the device and personally
it looks great and it adds a nice touch
of the foam but it's still at the top of
the device which is a bit weird for our
taste now the camera on the HTC One EA
tis a 13 megapixel shooter with a single
LED flash while the MA has a dual lens
for ultra pixel camera would dual tone
flash the screen is still that gorgeous
5-inch 1080p display that you're used to
with m8 and I'm glad that the boom sound
speakers made it to this phone I've
always been a fan of the ones boom sound
speakers and that's one of the features
of wish every phone had front-facing
speakers now the HTC One EA comes in
three different flavors two of them
which are glossy comes in polar white
and electric crimson and the one we have
here is called misty gray and it has a
nice matte finish to it it reminds us a
lot of the Moto X a soft touch material
which we really love so let's take a
quick break from this video to thank our
friends at Dollar Shave Club
buying razors suck right you got to walk
to the store pick out a razor and then
shell out $20 for some ridiculous shave
tech you don't even need fortunately
there's a cup
that's doing away with all this
ridiculousness it's called Dollar Shave
Club and it couldn't be any simpler for
a few bucks a month Dollar Shave Club
ships amazing razors and other bathroom
stuff right to your door their blades
are just as good this is big shave
companies at a fraction of the price
they've also got dr. Carver's EZ shave
butter to make your shave even more
buttery smooth shave time shave money
join now at dollarshaveclub.com slash
TechnoBuffalo and again that's
dollarshaveclub.com slash TechnoBuffalo
one-word TechnoBuffalo now back to the
video software-wise is running android
4.4.2 kitkat with sense 6.0 on top of it
it runs just like the m8 and everything
feels buttery smooth it's got the same
launcher the same software features like
HTC's motion launch feature or swipe to
launch the blink feed or the home screen
and a camera software is the same to of
course without duo camera effects Zoey's
still present here which is great but it
still outputs the final image to a four
megapixel shot which is somewhat
disappointing but if you want to always
shoot in auto that 13 megapixel shooter
in the back won't disappoint i find it
actually better or on par with the
inmates for ultra pixel camera in
certain lighting conditions but
nonetheless they're both great cameras
and they're good enough to post pictures
on social media but as much as the e8 is
destined to live in a shadow of its
bigger brother the m8 it's a strong
phone in its own right right now HTC is
targeting markets like China Russia and
India with the e8 so there is no
indication of any wider international
launch by no means sinister review but
just quick hands-on and overview of the
HTC One EA but if you guys have any
questions or want to see any other
features in his phone let us know in the
comments down below and as always a mark
in saying it from TechnoBuffalo I'll see
you guys in the next video
thank you guys for watching if you like

the first ones to know when new videos

unboxing to do hands-on reviews cars and
everything in between the Nets do
consumer electronics we'd love to have
