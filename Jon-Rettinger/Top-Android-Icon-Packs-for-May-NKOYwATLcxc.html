segment from TechnoBuffalo and today
we're bringing you guys three icon packs
you should check out in a month of May
we've done two other videos in a past
covering other icon packs so if you guys
haven't seen those yet make sure to
check out the links below so the first
one on our list is the fix icon pack
which is going for a dollar and eight
cents the fixed icon pack features an
assortment of flat icons that feature
bright colors and a similar color
palette to Google's material design what
makes a unique though are the long
shadows throughout the icons giving them
a sense of death in total there's about
over 1500 icons to choose from various
icons for folders and Docs and it also
has 20 custom wallpapers to go along
with this icon pack now some apps from
Google such as Gmail have multiple color
options to choose from which i think is
a nice touch to personalize your own
setup and speaking of setups here is my
home screen it's fairly simple I don't
have too much on my home screen at the
moment just a few apps that I use on a
daily basis and if I ever want to check
Twitter or Facebook or play a game I can
always launch the app from my app drawer
fix is available in the Google Play
Store for $0.99 number 2 is a mix i Khan
pack which is going for $0.99 the mix
icon pack is kind of unique as it offers
some pretty cool flat and cartoony icons
that look great on high-resolution
displays mix has more than 2000 custom
icons you can use that all look really
beautiful there's over 30 cloud-based
wallpapers you can apply and you can
also request icons that haven't been
themed yet which is awesome since this
particular icon pack doesn't support
icon masking it does however include a
clock widget which matches the icons
theme with its long shadows and flat
colors if you're looking for a cool
clock widget that'll flow nicely with
this icon pack it comes with one so
that's really cool and again I just
wanted to show you guys my homescreen
and what it looks like with a mix I calm
pack so you guys could get an idea of
what it could look like on your Android
device if you're looking for a fun flat
yet colorful icon pack give mix a try
and let us know what you guys think
number three is the min icon pack now
this icon pack is probably my favorite
out of the three I'm not sure oh I
didn't stumble across this one sooner
but I'm glad I finally did I love a
simplistic yet modern homescreen and
this is what I usually try to aim for on
my Android devices the midnight
pack is designed to be small simplistic
and it can either work by itself or as a
complement to other icon packs the
midnight compact is free and offers over
1200 icons it also comes with 15
cloud-based wallpapers and they all look
really incredible including the one that
I'm using right now inside the app you
can also request icons that haven't been
themed yet although this icon pack does
have icon masking which in this case
overlays a white outline on top of the
icons that aren't themed to match the
look and feel of mints icons and again
here's what it looks like on my home
screen
I love the icons aren't huge and also
it's super minimalistic which is
something I'm looking for anyways let us
know in the comments down below which
ones are your favorite or if you guys
have a particular icon pack in mind that
you guys want us to check out we've in a
comment section down below and if you
guys like this video make sure to give
it a thumbs up and we will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
