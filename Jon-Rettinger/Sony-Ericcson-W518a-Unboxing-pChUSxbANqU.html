TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the sony ericsson w580i
i don't do many feature phone unboxings
generally it's smartphones this one's
actually by popular request it's a new
phone available for 18 t wireless it's
run you $49.99 after a $50 mail-in
rebate and a two-year contract and
what's unique about this phone is its
one-button access integration with
Facebook so I'll show you that during
the review but let's just go ahead and
get to the unboxing you've got a picture
of the phone on the front letting you
know that it's got music
GPS could take video email it's got a
camera telling you the same bit of info
on the side bottom is just the same some
legal stuff and some skew so let's see
what we got inside of that so here we've
got the device itself
I'll wrap the plastic this is a nice
presentation actually with the phone
just sitting right on top put it off to
the side it does feel nice and thin
though let's see what else we get in the
box pretty sparse here we get a battery
of course of what size 1200 milliamp
hours so it's not a giant battery but
it's not a feature phone it's not a
smartphone so it should last pretty long
in case you're wondering it's the BST 39
that sony ericsson puts out we get a
charger with some bizarre proprietary
thing going on there but it's a sony
phone and of course they love
proprietary formats keep going down the
box you've got this another layer to
lift up and you've got all of your user
documentation i assume there's a CD in
there some sort QuickStart guide an
actual user's guide you don't see that
very often in English and Spanish
looks like you have to print that out
and some other stuff down below then
most people probably won't look at so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
phone
took it out of the plastic it is
actually nice and thin zooming here
we'll do a real quick size comparison so
here is the sony ericsson w580i
and actually thinner as well here it is
next to the just-released Nokia surge as
well let's stack them on top and that's
all fine and good but what does this
look like in sides go ahead and open it
up and it's got a very interesting
keypad layout no full QWERTY keyboard
just a standard number pad and they're
all sort of inlaid but the main
attraction is actually that button right
there and that's why a lot of you were
emailing and asking about it so there's
one touch integration with Facebook you
can see you're right there Facebook at
your fingertips so actually very
curiously how this works and how
Facebook actually looks on such a small
screen but it's supposed to be pretty
neat you can check out all your friends
on Facebook you can follow 18t on
Facebook you can check out 18t I think
I've got a freedom of choice but I
actually am a fan of AT&amp;amp;T on Facebook
potentially ask a lot of questions and
they're pretty responsive there too so
if you've got concerns or comments you
can go in and generally getting it back
to you so let's see what else we got
take a look at the phone and run through
it so it's obviously a music player
you've got music controls on the front
you've got your play and stop and your
track back or track forward and there
does appear to be an external LED on the
front and there is a camera as well on
the right side of the device we've got a
volume rocker it looks like a lock key
what's similar what you'd see on an iPod
shuffle or an iPod does look like it's
got except Sony's proprietary memory
card format and there's that bizarre
charging port let's go ahead and take a
look at the specs and see what this
thing can do or can't do for that matter
alright so this guy has a 3.2 megapixel
camera a full HTML capable browser
obviously he's got a music player it can
support mp3 WMA AAC aac+ and e aac+
can handle subscription services it can
do all your messaging text messaging
even MMS it's got singular video which
is actually 18 key video but it's still
called CV and it's got the to listen to
music feature obviously on it as well so
let's go ahead and power this thing on
and see what it looks like alright so
we're gonna go ahead and pop the battery
so your SIM card goes right there and
your memory stick would go right in
there put it in the back it's just me a
plastic but it does have a sturdy feel
to it although it's a little bit of a
pain to get off it's not too bad got a
kind of snap in place all around it's
going to power this thing on let's peel
off the screen protector that's always
kind of satisfying to do you got the big
whooshing sound that was nice there we
go get the big AT&amp;amp;T logo insert sim card
we're going to pass by that I think the
battery is almost dead as well so I
would go ahead and use this for a little
while and per my usual and give you my
review and update on it I'm actually
very curious how this Facebook
integration is going to work if it's a
gimmick or if it's actually functional
