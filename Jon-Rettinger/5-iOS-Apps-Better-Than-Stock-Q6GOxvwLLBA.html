there are a ton of third-party
applications that go way beyond what I
put and downs you with out-of-the-box so
here are five apps that go far beyond
stock the first one is the most
important to me and that's email and
I've tried a ton of email apps never
liked Apple stock app but recently I've
been using outlook for iOS which was
awesome previously I've been using cloud
magic which is great for Android as well
but I recently found email by easily do
Inc
and it offers the UI of the mail app
which I really liked at Comstock on iOS
but just with a ton more features
unified inbox customization for swipes
customization for 3d touch my favorite
feature those you go to subscriptions
you can remove yourself from whatever
mailing list you are on there's a click
of an X which for someone like me who
subscribed to way more things than I
realized
reduce my spam email by like 50 percent
I switch phones all the time I'm jumping
between iOS and Android similarly every
week one thing I missed was the ability
to have all of my photos in one app
regardless with device I took them on
enter Google Photos which now no matter
what phone I snap pictures on they're
going to live on the device no more of
it to sync it through a third-party
cloud service and sync them back on my
phone they're all just there and if you
want to go Google added the ability to
have shared folders as well so you can
share pictures of your friends your
family your cat your dog with whoever
you want let's stick with Google and
jump to Google Calendar Apple stock
calendar app is fine it looks the same
using it for years it's functionally
pretty good I just prefer the UI of
Google Calendar
it syncs way better with the Google Apps
that I use and I love through the visual
representations they've got I like that
the pictures show up I've got a flight
to New York coming up tomorrow and it
shows a picture of New York City in
there just from the UI standpoint it
just looks better and if I have to pick
a calendar app which I get the ability
to do I'm going Google Calendar there a
ton of third-party keyboard apps for the
iPhone but my favorite one that I'm
using right now is actually by Microsoft
and it's called word flow so first you
can customize the keyboard is going to
look like that you can do on a lot of
other ones you can change whether it's
in light mode or dark mode gives the
ability to do swipe typing on it which
is really nice but the reason that I
like this the most is one-handed typing
Google's got it on their stock Google
keyboard if you don't have on iOS but
when it typing on an iPhone especially
if you got smaller hands is awesome
bit of a caveat though just using normal
typing with your thumbs kind of typos
for the kind that wants to rely on swipe
gestures or want to use one-handed then
look at word flow if you just bang out
text like you do normally with your
thumbs
then maybe avoid this one and last but
not least wonder list as replacement for
reminders this one came courtesy of
Brandon Russell who's sitting right
there you can't see him and visually
it's just more appealing than reminders
you get some of the same reminders
features you have here the ability to
share lists if you wanna have a grocery
list with your wife your girlfriend your
mom whatever you can go ahead and add
that right here but the way it looks is
awesome and also I love there's clients
for absolutely every operating system I
might use for mac for PC for Android no
matter where you go you can act as your
wonder list that's been a really nice
feature to have these are just five
Apple turns to stock on iOS you guys
like these will do more will give you
more options through place your stamps
will do one for Android if you guys want
as well up to your thoughts on it please
be kind and let us know in the comments
to give any other app suggestions for
things that could replace stock or maybe
you like something else in what we
recommended let us know I'm always
looking to try new apps and I hope you
guys enjoyed till next time
