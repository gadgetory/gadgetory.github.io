can't because I'm not shooting this with
a 3d camcorder but that's all right it
is it's a little janky 3d but it's 3d
glasses free what's up everybody I'm
Noah from TechnoBuffalo I'm at the LG
stand here at mobile world congress in
barcelona spain with LG optimus 3d it's
the world's first full 3d experience on
a mobile phone i'm reading this off the
press thing and the first ride dual
architecture a dual core dual channel
blue memory just announced officially
it's an android-based smartphone 4.3
inch display it's glasses-free 3d so
there's some parts of the phone that are
3d some aren't this is the 3d gallery
menu which again after you can't tell
but it's kind of this 3d effect rotating
in a circle there and then on the back
you have got a 3d stereoscope camera set
up it's to 5 megapixel cameras with a
flash it will record in 1080p I believe
believe it will record full 1080 people
it will record HD up to only 720p i
believe and then it plays back 1080p for
2d video 720p for 3d video and again
it's glasses free with them you can also
now this part is just normal android not
3 David you can also shoot the 3d or any
video 3d or 2d you can shoot it out via
HDMI it's also got DLNA for wireless
media sinking and then also they've
announced this partnership with YouTube
for getting your content directly onto
YouTube 3d so there you go but you can
see in the apps you've got 3d apps
through the gallery 3d guide 3d space
and then you've got your your regular
apps dual-core phone as I mentioned LD
LG makin all kinds of claims about
they're dual-channel dual memory all
that stuff enhancing the dual core
experience as well so this looks like
this asphalt adrenaline six in 3d and
you know I'm checking the phone out and
it reminds me actually something I saw
two years ago 23 years ago back at
macworld coming to go best of life it
makes iPod docks had a similar 3d it
would didn't have a camera obviously was
an ipod dock but it had a 2d to 3d
conversion ship and it was you know
glasses-free and it's kind of more like
you know more like just kind of a you
know you notice that sometimes you don't
sometimes sometimes it kind of bugs my
eyes a little other times it looks kind
of cool so it you know it'll really
depend on content being developed for it
and how much 3d takes off LG also
introduced the optimism pad a tablet a 9
inch tablet with 3d capabilities as well
we're going to check that out the
the device is here on the stand have
been kind of kind of hit or miss as far
as a being smooth but this one seems to
be running pretty well right now see if
my Mini Cooper
can race in 3d or not not a lot of
pretty going on here right now and I
thought maybe this didn't say that I was
wrong and the step light is not seem to
be pretty but the service performance is
nice all in all pretty good yeah this
day to do so pretty Mike on over there
in the corner the 3d effect
there we go yes so now it's more in 3d
again on camera watching this and over
you probably can't tell more of a 3d
effect it's kind of you know it's kind
of hit or miss I wear glasses so it
might be kind of not working so well
with my glasses but sometimes you know
it looks good other times it just makes
me feel kind of I don't know a little
queasy cuz if it's all blurry and then
obviously I can't play the game and film
and talk at the same time today no first
look at the LG optimus 3d again it's a
3d phone borrac capture and playback not
sure how I got there I wanted to go to
the camera
yeah and now it's slowing down a
crashing on me which means it's time to
go from Barcelona Spain Mobile World
Congress yeah bone is uh I don't know
what's going on there anyway i'm noah
for protect no Buffalo much much more
