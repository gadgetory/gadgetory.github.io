most hot tamales in your mouth
chubby bunny winter world's fattest dog
world's best boss and a hotly contested
title of world's thinnest laptop and the
folks at HP claim they have you covered
this is the ten point four millimeters
thin HP Spectre that's ten point four
millimeters all the way around it's not
taper there no tricks here it is
incredibly thin so concerns people
usually have little portables and I
certainly had was what about power and
what about I oh the caption this thing
up with a full six gen core i7 there's
no M here this is a full fledged i7
processor you can get in here eight gigs
around 20 56 gig SSD mean it can handle
anything you want to throw at it on the
io standpoint ultra thins you might be
used to maybe one port this has three
USB type-c ports one for charging two
for plugging in whatever you need to
plug in the way a laptop feels is
important to me as well and this one
feels premium it's got aluminum on the
top and freaking carbon fiber on the
back it's kind of like a sports car and
that continues when you open it up and
you've got what HP is calling a piston
hinge and that's fancy marketing talk
but that's gonna mean for you is you can
actually open the thing up with just one
finger something you don't see all that
often on laptops also gonna mean that
can be much throw here in the hinge it's
gonna stay pretty solid what you've got
on your lap or wherever you might be
digging into the keyboard here fully
backlit shortcuts for airplane mode
which has been surprisingly helpful for
some of the traveling I've been doing a
decent keyboard it's got a nice throw on
it sound out here is surprisingly good
tuned by the folks at Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen and
the speaker girls have been kind of
itched into a pattern this looks really
nice the screen here is coated in
Gorilla Glass a 13 inch 1080p screen
should be protected for whatever you're
gonna do with it but I've also really
liked the viewing angles on it bear in
mind though no touch screen on this guy
I've been tough on track pads in the
past this one actually works pretty well
for multi-touch so you can scroll
smoothly with it when you think about
ten point four millimeters bear in mind
MacBook Air is over 17 millimeters thin
so incredibly thin incredibly light and
you're getting full power of the Intel
Core sees of chips know em
here but that's all fine and good for
normal PC stuff like I've been using
this guy for for the past a week gaming
I'm gonna give that a test I'm gonna try
putting some latest games I'm here
anything else you guys want to see how
Spector performs let me know what a load
of premiere I'm here to see what
Handel's video editing and maybe some 3d
rendering I want to know what you guys
want to see the world thinnest laptop
tested and see what it can do let us
know in the comments down below the
video a thumbs up for always appreciate
it till next time genre enjoy
TechnoBuffalo say guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
