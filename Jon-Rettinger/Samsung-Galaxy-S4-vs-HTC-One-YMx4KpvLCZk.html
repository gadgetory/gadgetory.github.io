TechnoBuffalo here with a battle of two
of the cell phone Titans in one corner
we've got HTC's brand new HTC One in the
other we got the reigning champion the
galaxy s4 this is a battle for the ages
this is Ali Frazier this is Tyson
Holyfield this is the lakers vs awful
coaching let's put these two
head-to-head see what comes out on top
alright so there are obviously a ton of
category if you can talk about when you
put these two Titans head-to-head these
are arguably two of the best phones out
on the market right now I picked a few
that I thought were best representative
of the device and everyday usage so we
are going to talk about screen camera
performance skins navigation build
quality features battery and we are
going to declare a winner let's go ahead
and start out that thing you look at
every day that's a screen all right so
we're looking at a 4.7 inch green here
on the HTC One and a 5-inch screen on
the galaxy s4 they both have the same
resolution though at 1920 x 1080 which
gives them 1080p screens there's a bit
of a higher ppi because the smaller size
on the HTC one it's 469 on the one
versus 441 on the s4 so people can talk
a lot about pentile matrix how the
pixels are laid out of take a magnifying
glass to the screen or zoom up nice and
close 10 today though I'm just looking
at the screens with normal human eyes
and I'll honestly both these screens are
freaking gorgeous they both have awesome
viewing angles there readable in direct
sunlight games look absolutely beautiful
on them the colors totally pop photos
look pretty gorgeous on them as well
text looks awesome everything about
these screens absolutely beautiful the
s4 is got Gorilla Glass 3 on it the s4
also gives you a bit of a warmer screen
a little bit more saturated the one
though has a bit more accurate color so
it's going to come down to what you
prefer on both of those for me though I
could not pick a winner when it came to
screen both these guys were absolutely
awesome looking at on with just normal
people eyes the screens are absolutely
gorgeous on each I could not under good
conscience pick a winner this one is a
draw so next let's talk about camera
will turn these phones over on their
butts and there is a lot to talk about
with these two devices
so there's a 4 ultrapixel camera here on
the HTC One essentially it's four
megapixel sensor stacked on top of each
other it is a 13 megapixel sensor on the
galaxy s4 the s4 is way more software
options than the HTC one those are
important to you then definitely go with
the s4 you get things like best face you
get some awesome nature views you can
get best picture quality you can get
motion capture there's a ton of stuff
you can do with the galaxy s4 from a
software standpoint it has way more than
the HTC One the s4 also had better audio
quality when shooting video so if you do
a lot of video and audio fidelity is
important with that an external mic the
s4 is going to be the way to go however
the word mattered to me the HTC One
really shined I was quicker to focus it
was markedly better in low light had
quicker shutter speed and a more
accurate color representation we did
post showing head-to-head photo quality
what it looked like with the one and the
s4 and I really found myself enjoying
the one so when I did this ask the
question if I was going to go out and
shoot some pictures and I was going to
take one device with me to use a camera
which one would it be and nine times out
of ten I picked a one to go with me so
the caveat there though if you need the
software features that the s4 has the s4
is going to be a great option here
you're talking about two incredible
devices with great cameras on it but if
I want you want to take and serve every
instance and picture quality is most
important I'm picking up the HTC One so
that is the winner of the camera round
all right so let's go from camera to
performance and these guys are absolute
power houses so we've got a 1.9
gigahertz quad-core chip on the s4 I am
testing the US carrier version there's
an octa-core versions while it takes
advantage of two separate quad core
chips this tests are representative of
the one that's got one quad-core 1.9
gigahertz chip in it versus a 1.7
quad-core on the HTC One so we can run
quadrant scores on each definitely they
vary each time you test a quadrant score
is about 12,000 256 on the one and
11,000 349 on the s4 but different times
you tested it got it to be the mid 12 so
those are really don't tell you that
much they're both pretty awesome scores
from two very impressive phones so the
mortal here everything is extremely fast
I can open up applications /
same time you can see how that works but
things open quickly games load fast
there's no lag at all enough to worry
about opening up a ton of applications
on each home performance standpoint
these guys are both listerine fast and I
could not declare a winner one thing i
will say that was incredible to see is
the boot up time on the HTC one takes
advantage of some quick food stuff I'll
wear boots up in almost six seconds it
is absolutely incredible to see when it
comes to performance though there is no
clear winner here these are both really
really fast phones doesn't matter to me
if one opens one one-hundredth of a
second faster or not I want a phone
that's going to open things quickly is
gonna perform up to everything that I
throw at it and both these phones that
do that pretty awesomely alright so next
let's talk about skins and I guess you
can't really call them skins anymore
essentially they're totally redone
versions of Android just for the sake of
calling him something let's call them
skins we've got TouchWiz on the s4 and
we got sense 5 here on the HTC One which
one is better well they're both based
off with different versions of android
galaxy s4 has the latest version of 4.2
point2 with HTC one is currently based
off of four point one point to one of
the cool features of android 4.2 is the
photosphere option which for the life of
me I cannot find on the galaxy s4 so
keep that in mind so this one is really
really tough for me to pick when it
comes HTC Sense is the first version of
sense really get out of its own way it
doesn't sense you to be really resource
heavy this very well might still be but
you don't notice that when using the
phone I really enjoy the widgets HTC is
built in an email application is
incredibly awesome I usually I had a
download a third-party email application
something like k-9 mail I found myself
actually using the built-in one here and
cents so another thing HTC has been
touting is blinkfeed sort of a Flipboard
esque way of viewing information I
didn't find myself using it all that
much I would have liked to have the
option of turning it off instead I had
to move it a few screens over so if you
like that information sort of coming at
you directly blinkfeed is going to be a
great way to go and I really like the
way the settings is laid out on the HTC
One there's something about using it
that felt very intuitive and really
quick to me so touches on the other hand
brings a ton of new features airplay an
air view sort of are the two flagships
on the s4 there's cool things like s
translate there's a ton of camera
options built-in
so TouchWiz has the same bright bold
icons we've seen before now obviously
you can go through you can download
third-party launchers you can download
different applications but I want to
talk about these devices as they are as
they come out of the box so this one
really comes down to the personal
preference category TouchWiz brings a
ton of features that it really find
myself using all that often so I did
this test I want to figure out which one
I would pick up to use and that when i
pick up to use based on skins alone with
the HTC one but this one was really
really close I can certainly see why a
lot of people would prefer the s4 vs the
HTC One but for me simplicity that's why
I prefer to the winner is the HTC One
alright so next let's talk about
navigation how it is to move around the
phone how the buttons perform something
that was really important to me when
using the HTC One so I really liked the
clean easy to use a layout of the galaxy
s4 it takes advantage of the typical
standard Android option you've got one
physical button in the middle flanked by
a back and a home button I really
enjoyed the way that worked it made
sense if you want to get to multitasking
it made sense if you want the palapa
menu and go back it was very intuitive
and really familiar HTC One however took
a bit of a weird approach they put a
giant HTC logo in the middle of phone
we're home but traditionally is and they
flanked on the left and the right by a
back button the home button and I felt
very weird for me to have a home button
on the right-hand side of the phone and
it definitely took a lot of getting each
soon after using a device for now the
better part of a month I'm still not
used to it and that also means you have
to double tap the home button to get to
multitasking which I really didn't enjoy
when I came down to actually how to use
the phone this one definitely goes the
galaxy s4 I like the feel of a physical
button I like the fact that there are
three buttons on it and I kept trying to
push an HTC logo thinking it was gonna
do something that one absolutely goes to
the galaxy s4 alright so next you knew
it was coming let's talk about build
quality this one has been talked about
quite a bit when comparing the HTC one
vs the galaxy s4 so let's start with the
galaxy s4 it takes advantage of
Samsung's tried-and-true polycarbonate
plastic build the galaxy s4 brings a few
new things that's predecessor the s3
didn't you've got some metal ask accents
along the side they're still plastic but
they have to make the phone feel much
more secure in the hand and feel a
little bit premium quality speaking of
premium quality certainly there's no
doubt there are premium parts in the
galaxy s4
screen the processor 2 gigs of ram the
camera so despite having always premium
parts when you put them all together the
phone doesn't have that premium feel
that perhaps the HTC One a device like
the iphone 5 might so a few reasons for
that first this plastic back no way
about it is this a premium build quality
too now it certainly are trade-offs we
can talk about those a bit later but a
thin plastic bag doesn't scream premium
to me now I understand why Samsung did
it and certainly they've sold millions
of galaxy s3's and note 2 so there's no
reason to change what it works if it
ain't broke don't fix it but bear that
in mind if you want a device going to
feel really substantial on hand that's
got that sort of cold aluminium ask feel
galaxy s4 is not going to be the way to
go now let's not to say the phone feels
cheap in the hand because it's far from
that when you're comparing it to how the
phone feels build wise to device like
HTC One they are absolutely worlds apart
HTC one takes advantage of a unibody
design uses full aluminum I just I like
the way the phone feels like the when I
pick it up in the morning it's got that
cold metal feel to the back it feels
heavy and secure in the hand i feel like
i'm using a premium quality that's just
an intangible thing that then the HTC
One absolutely has in spades so it comes
to build quality this one is out of the
park no doubt winner HTC One so before
everybody gets too upset about the
cleaning the one the victor when it
comes to build quality let's talk about
features and the feature standpoint is
something where the galaxy s4 really
stands out first expandability being
able to remove that back pomp in a new
battery is great for some for me it's
not something I use all that often
generally I'll carry an external you
know large battery packet I can just
plug it in via cord but I get why people
would want then if you're the kind of
person that wants to carry an extra
battery that you can just pop in here
and the galaxy s4 is an awesome way to
go another thing it has HTC one does not
it's expandable storage microSD is a
must for root users if you want to bring
your pictures or videos with you is
something that's really handy to have
especially don't worry about storage you
can hot swap them in or out or keep
bringing new cards or just bigger cards
so really HTC One cannot compete with
that at all if you don't mind the
plastic back or if you're the kind of
person that really wants to have
removable storage removable battery and
the s4 is gonna be a great way to go an
HTC one that has some features as well
boom sound for me is absolutely
tremendous takes advantage the speakers
on the top and bottom that can't believe
this wasn't really done mainstream
before how the speakers face you and
they do an incredible job there's some
custom amplifiers in there takes
advantage of some beats technology but
the quality is better than anything I
have ever seen on a cell phone
the s4 brings a ton of other features
airview a lot of other camera stuff in
their boat it comes down to pure
features two features the galaxy s4 is
got the HTC One beaten spades as another
question that I got all the time is
battery which one is better this one I
can't clear a winner because the version
that we are testing here in the US is on
sprint was support for LTE and we don't
have LT where we're at I will say though
with the same testing on each at about
ten percent better battery life on the
s4 then did on the one but the one is
connected 18 teens LTE all the time so
I'm going to say that ten percent was
probably due to the LTE network though I
will say once i get 18 tlte a galaxy s4
to test i'll update this but right now i
cannot declare a winner for battery
alright so let's pick a winner here and
this one is quite tough it's like saying
what do you like better Mercedes your
BMW Lamborghini or Ferrari they are all
awesome but we have to declare winter
since this is a smartphone Smackdown in
for me the winner is the HTC One the big
question I asked myself I was going to
sign a new two year contract which phone
would I want and that one for me was the
HTC One and the big difference the
reason i picked it was the build quality
that one really stood out head over
heels over the galaxy s4 now that being
said if you need expandable storage you
need battery you're the kind of person
that wants us extra software features
that you can get in the camera galaxy s4
is going to be incredible phone I
haven't seen two phones this flight and
this competitive really ever before they
are six and one half dozen of another
they are both incredible choices that
you can't go wrong with either hope you
guys enjoyed I love to hear your
comments keep them civil keep them
lively what do you guys think please
give the video a thumbs up we'd most
definitely appreciate it I am drown
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo I'll see
you guys in the next video
