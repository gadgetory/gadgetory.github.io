to you by netflix welcome back to the
pursuit of renter's rants I'm your host
Jon renders to show where I usually get
my rant ease in a bunch about something
going on and were the technology this
week though I have heard your cries
people want to know what the best phones
of all time were I get him a task to
Buffalo I get him on the comments all
the time and I don't want to get him
anymore so I'm going to answer what my
top 10 smartphones or these phones of
all time are this week I'm gonna go
through numbers 10 through six and the
next week on Rhett enters rant so next
wednesday you are going to see the top
five and that will be 5 through number
one so without more my jibba jabba let's
get to the countdown so these are the
top 10 smartphones add an impact on me
and somehow or someway and phones i
really thought paved the way for all the
phones that we've got right now let's
start with number 10 this is the nokia
5130 98 99 ish and it started my love
affair with the industry it had
removable face plates of course I rocked
yellow Lakers cover the crazy thing was
though and needed a separate battery in
order for to have a vibrate mode which
used to be pretty standard back in the
day this thing was built like a tank
although that vibrating battery only
lasted a few hours but it was all I
needed to play some snake I love me some
snake black and white snake trying to
get that little guy and gets longer
great game number 9 the motorola dynatac
800 x better known as zack morris phone
I never had a chance to use one every
time I saw it I just wanted to go time
out and see what's later and Kelly er up
to I know I totally just dated myself
this thing was a huge I mean you could
have fit like 30 normal sized
smartphones nowadays in there all it did
was make phone calls at a huge antenna
when you think like old-school phones
that is exactly the phone you're gonna
think of number 8 company we haven't
heard from in quite a while to sanyo SCP
5300 this is the first camera phone in
the US and a hit with sprint pcs back in
2002 you think back cameras and phones
an hour what you expect you know they
shoot 10 a
p you can use them as a dedicated camera
you know they compete with point and
shoots and sometimes they can compete
with lower end DSLRs they become so
ubiquitous in our phones nowadays you
kind of take him for granted but I
remember when camera phones first came
out it was absolutely incredible i
remember seeing it in the store and I
just not being able to believe that you
could actually have a camera in the
phone I've ever tried to think of a way
to justify this phone to myself and the
way I did it was if I ever get in a car
accident it'd be really nice to be able
to take pictures of the license plate so
back then used to have to keep a
disposable camera something in your
glove box take you take pictures of
favorite accident so that's how I
justified it to myself that I needed a
camera phone and this guy super low
resolution i believe it was point 3
megapixels but it was still a freaking
camera on a phone and it was pretty
awesome number seven this is an old
favorite the palm treo 600 released in
2003 was really the it gadget from
2003-2004 until BlackBerry's overtook
them in popularity took three to four
days deployed to pick to charge one of
these guys and it was at least as far as
I'm concerned the first fully successful
merger of phone PDA and camera which
kind of made it the business tool of
choice plus i still love that keyboard
poor poor palm it ran palms OS which
they used until not that long ago when
his first released it was incredible it
was a full PDA to use a stylus on it you
can make phone calls it had a super bad
web browser but slide a web browser it's
pretty impressive technology for the day
the phone packed it into a pretty nice
size as well if you look around then you
still might see a few people rocking a
palm treo maybe its sequel to 650 but
you might still see him out in the wild
number six the last phone on this
countdown is the blackberry pearl this
is the phone i carried the day the
iphone came out in 2007 and I loved
everything about it fortunately once an
iPhone came out I stopped carrying the
blackberry pro but I love this guy took
a while to get used to that crazy
keyboard the other had 22 letters / once
he got used to would it was super fast
and blackberry even still had email
absolutely nailed the browser was okay
the music player is okay the fact you
could have kind of a full keyboard and
be able to text so fast on the phone
that was the size of you know most nokia
phones at the time was really cool
always have a soft spot in my heart for
blackberry know
really because of the blackberry pearl
let me stop the countdown for a minutes
too much excitement thank our friends
