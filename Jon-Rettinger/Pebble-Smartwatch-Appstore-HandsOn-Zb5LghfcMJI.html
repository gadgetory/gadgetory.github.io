TechnoBuffalo here when the kickstart
backed pebble smartwatch first launched
it was essentially just a notification
machine let you know when phone calls
are coming in emails sort of other
person notifications that your phone
showed you but the pebble smartwatch has
grown up it got a Big Brother in the
form of the pebble steel and now has
it's a very own App Store let's take a
first look and see how it performs the
pebble steel is officially shipping
today but functionally wise it's exactly
the same as the original pebble
smartwatch you just get a more sort of
upscale look to it so with the new OS
the developer access we can now finally
get access to all those delicious things
that the pebble smartwatch had all along
things like accelerometer and sort of
other meters I can turn it into almost a
fitness band so let's take a first look
at some of the stuff we can do so first
you're going to have a brand new pebble
app it's the pebble dev app which lets
you sort of get full control over your
phone it looks different now let me go
ahead and go into the main screen here
it looks like so you go ahead and hit
that button you can go access to my
pebble get watch faces or get apps let's
jump in to get apps that's actually the
big thing here so you got now sort of an
orange hue and it's divided into six
sections so you've got daily tools and
utilities notifications fitness and
games they all have different apps
inside of those so obviously the hope
here is that developers will make their
own pebble apps I'll show you just a
quick example of what they look like
let's go ahead and jump into daily for
example you can see what it looks like
those ahead opens up it's its own app
store and capsulated inside of this
application you can find what you like
whenever you find that you want to go
ahead and hit add and it's going to show
up on your watch assuming you have room
so go ahead and hit this will go to my
pebble and you now have what's called a
pebble Locker and it can store eight
apps here and if you have more than
eight app it's not a problem
it'll be right here down below if you
want to add them back to your device you
go and tap it you can load it on or just
delete it completely so only enough
memory to store a tap so what do apps
look like and what do apps do so let me
go ahead and show you I've got one right
here called pebble carts let me go ahead
and open that
here on the settings you can see what
the settings look like for an app so
it's gonna get open it up you can
control all content vacations here so
I've got for example I want to set on
night something's a screen look dark you
can have it be day and it'll be lighter
you can do weather different stock
options sports teams you can pick
driving times you can pick transit
sports teams battery RSS stocks and all
kinds of other options so let it select
it and just hit save so see it looks
like here I can scroll through so for
example there we've got watch battery
I've got the next Laker game coming up
here I can see some stocks I've got so
there's tests like I can see Apple
weather will show up here's well I just
sort of keep scrolling through and have
a ton of different options that'll show
up it looks really neat
you don't access me the same way you
would watch faces unfortunately so in
order to access these you got to go and
hit the menu button here so go and open
a batch drawer it takes advantage the
excel around where you can sort of
old-school asteroids game you get as
blast the asteroids and use a button so
that's sort of what games look like on
here it gives you a vibrate notification
when you lose all kinds of really cool
things here the UI though again is still
pretty similar but you access things a
little bit differently so if you go
ahead and go to you know watch races
ordinarily you go ahead and pick your
watch face and you can just scroll
through all of them but the watch face
is now are not the same as app so you
can't scroll through when you're on to
get a watch face like you could on an
app so I'll go ahead and go back so
here's a watch face I can scroll through
and see other want races but no way and
I go through this am I going to see any
of the apps like that card app for
example so a bit unfortunate there I
would have liked to have seen that
but you now get access to a ton more
watch faces and a whole bunch more on
the app front this is gonna be shipping
with the new pebble steel it's a ton
more functionality rich I want to give
you guys a quick overview of what it
looked like with the new app it looks
like and sort of the fun things you can
expect with pebble be able to check in
on Foursquare there's an ESPN home
screen all kinds of other sort of cool
stuff hopefully coming presumably we'll
see Facebook and other social media
integration here Twitter and such I'm
pretty excited it's a really nice
addition to the pebble smartwatch you
decide if you want the less expensive
the more expensive option they're really
getting at the same functionality just
different aesthetics on both it's a nice
addition to those folks that backed the
watch I really like that
sort of didn't make these features only
for the pebble steel they sort of
rewarded the folks that backed it
originally an initial supporters I sort
of give it all the awesome things that
the new OS has to offer so what you guys
think is it gonna be enough to make you
pick up a new pebble smartwatch or let
me look to pick up a pebble steel love
