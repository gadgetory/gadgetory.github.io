unboxing for you of the new super mario
brothers we I definitely know this is
just an unboxing in a video game but the
requests to do this have actually been
quite high so I'm going to try and
indulge you and also make it as
entertaining as possible so imma kitty
the 80s and that means I grew up playing
Nintendo and the old side-scrolling
Super Mario Brothers who really has a
soft spot for me in my heart I remember
playing just for hours and hours with
friends with my sister even with my mom
and dad playing Nintendo it was just a
great time and I really enjoyed it
certainly there's been a ton of other
Mario games the dudes had a lot of
professions since the side-scrolling
days he's been a doctor he's quit
baseball soccer but this sort of is out
harkening back to the old side-scrolling
original Mario Brothers game sort of in
a new 3d way it's a little bit of better
graphics but it's still sort of the the
two dimensional side-scrolling so Super
Mario Brothers we on the box you've seen
you can play up to four players but you
can't do it online they have to all be
in the same room you got Mario Luigi and
two generic toads on the back you've got
a lot of details about the games for
ready to eat for everyone let's go ahead
and dig in and we'll use the big ol
knife for this alright some of their
successful packaged cut without slicing
my finger it's a heavy box it feels to
be almost twice as heavy as most other
videogame boxes rip off the plastic I'm
actually very excited to play this I was
really looking forward to it coming out
so Super Mario Brothers we go ahead and
open it up and looks like that's why it
was so heavy it comes with just a
colossal book looks like Nintendo loves
to include massive amounts of books oh I
don't know tiger we're going to look at
that you can use this or play this
rather using the motion sensor on the
Wii mote or just turn it sideways and do
that and probably going to turn it
sideways here's a disc Mario Luigi and
your characters that you can play with
sort of just hanging out and that's it
guys all comes in a red box
