TechnoBuffalo here it's an unboxing of
the latest tablet in the Kindle family
this is the HDX all dolled up in its
7-inch form it's got a couple of big
brothers if you like the larger screen
tablets this brings a ton of new things
to the table including one of my
favorite and I'm looking forward to
testing out Mayday you get live help on
your tablet they can take remote control
and troubleshoot all your problems which
would be really nice my grandma does not
the calm me do you like where do I check
email let's go ahead take a first look
Fire HDX 7-inch it's veltz new box got a
new design and a new box to go with it
so we've got an emboss or look on what
the Kindle Fire HDX looks like on the
front giving you some highlights will
run through all that stuff in the
unboxing Dolby surround sound or sort of
surround sounds kind of neat so a lot of
features on here including Mayday which
lets you pull up live support help right
on the tablets and take control over it
pretty cool new features so let's slide
this guy out of the box
and here is now the familiar Kindle
looking package so we'll pull this tab
and open it up very eco-friendly
packaging I Amazon uses so take this out
of the box and boom there is the Kindle
HDX and I should say this guy is really
well priced going head-to-head against
the new Nexus 7 229 bucks and it is
incredibly small and it feels really
light pressure off the side for just a
real quick second seat else we're going
to have in the box
we're getting to know your Kindle I will
get to know you Kindle well love you and
kiss you a name you John seventh Kindle
I'll see what else we're gonna have in
here we've got they include this time a
little wall work a very small one with
the USB ports and a micro USB charging
sync cable and it looks like that is
going to be it nothing else in that box
push all this off to the side here is
the Kindle 7-inch HDX prices range you
know all the way up you can get it in
varying storage either a 16 32 or 64
with Verizon or LTE 4G LTE
it's a 7 inch display it's HD so it's
1920 by 1200 they 323 PPI sorry enkindle
OS 3.0 which is based on Android 4.2.2
try and power it on I rented rest
suspects while it's doing that we'll do
a real quick
hardware tour so kind of an interesting
design it's very angular so you got your
volume buttons are right on the left
side looking at on the back or the right
side were holding it with the screen
facing you know powered by on the
opposite side there are those two Dolby
speakers Amazon logo is shiny in the
back and it does sit pretty flush on the
tables it's not gonna rock one way or
another booted up a relatively quickly
we do have a front-facing camera which
is kinda nice there so you can do Skype
in HD let's go ahead and unlock this or
run to address the specs we've got this
guy all powered up on first blush the
screen is absolutely gorgeous let me
continue the specs as I mentioned it's a
7 inch 1920 by 1200 screen with a 323
PPI being powered by a 2.2 gigahertz
Snapdragon 800 CPU with you Adreno 330
GPU so this guy can handle pretty much
anything you want to throw at it it's
got 2 gigs of RAM it's got a 720p camera
which is kind of nice right on front
where you can do all of your video
chatting it's got bluetooth of course
Wi-Fi it's got dual ban which kind of
nice MMO + HT 40
it's got 11 hour battery life supposedly
put that through the test no NFC onboard
here unfortunately
I'm really curious put this guy through
its paces let's take a quick look here
at what the Kindle OS 3.0 looks like and
this becomes more of a tablet with
multiple uses than just an Amazon
machine so you can still view all of
your content right here through this
slider and it can pick a book and jump
right into it but if you slide up that's
where you're going to be able to view
all of your apps there's quite a few
here of course you get access to the
shop Amazon store they really want you
to go there let's get all of your Kindle
optimized stuff including just buying
regular things if you slide down and get
opposites to quick settings will jump
into settings take a look here what else
we're going to have let's go to device
you can see how much battery you've got
system update and the rest
that kind of business will go ahead and
go home go back down now you can see the
rest of your stuff they've got right
here it's broken up by category so you
can shop games apps books music videos
newsstand audiobooks web photos Doc's
and offers let's jump into a web I
searched the web browser looks like on
here it's that silk browser which is
really at least supposedly very nice so
we'll go ahead and jump into
TechnoBuffalo you can see what the
keyboard looks like here feels very nice
in a hand I should say it's the angle
back sits really nicely on your fingers
when addressing there I've got a techno
bubble thing that can spell it techno
and there's a B and then we should show
up TechnoBuffalo comm unless you can see
what the screen looks like here I'm very
curious to watch videos on it the screen
looks absolutely beautiful and certainly
looks that same when you are browsing
but you lose a lot of screen real estate
so you've got you know for us at least a
banner it's a static at the top and
you've got the address bar then you've
got the tabs there as well then at the
bottom get all the settings you're not
taking advantage that full 7-inch screen
but things do look really really nice
here obviously a quick look at what
that's going to look like
of course we'll put this guy through its
full pace to see how it performs and see
if it's worth your tablet buying buck
but at first glance 229 seems like a
pretty sweet feature and augmented with
that Mayday
so you can actually get life help is
very very neat anything you guys want to
see me sure to leave it in the comments
down below we love to check it out for
you and let you know sure give the video
