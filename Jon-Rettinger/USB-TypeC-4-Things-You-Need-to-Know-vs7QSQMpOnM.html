TechnoBuffalo here Apple and build their
new MacBook and with it is ushering in a
new technology which you're going to see
everywhere it's that single teeny tiny
port it's called USB see so I thought it
explained what USB see is in which need
to know about it with your Mac user or
not so I present to you friend oh four
things you need to know about USB see
let's start with number one first
it's USB actually it's part of USB 3.1
one a really cool benefits of USB 3.1
type C is that it offers enough juice to
power your laptop as well as really
anything else that was the case with USB
3.0 and some product like the Nova yoga
3 Pro which also charged via USB port
but the main difference here is that it
provides way more power so and only can
you plug in your computer to charge via
the same port there's also plenty of
juice left to charge other devices the
USB if' group and charged the standard
said that in August USB type-c is and I
quote robust enough for laptops and
tablets but slim enough for mobile
phones offers power with up to 100 watts
or 20 volts which is just plenty for a
notebook but also plenty benefits on the
data side - which brings me to point
number 2 USB 3.0 offers a pretty nice
data transfer bump over USB 2.0 and 3.1
type-c connectors does the same thing I
should expect a defense for speeds
between USB type-c devices up to 10
gigabits per second up from five
gigabits per second offered on USB 3.0
although I will say on the new MacBooks
Apple is actually with software
downgraded that to about 5 megabits per
second for right now but the theoretical
max of 10 megabits per second is almost
on par with the first standard
Thunderbolt it's also backwards
compatible which is why apples selling
you dongles I to connect older USB to
3.0 devices to your notebook and as
Apple told us the data transfer rate is
high enough that you can't attach HDMI
VGA and DisplayPort adapters to that
single USB type-c port number 3 it's
reversible you can just plug it in any
way you like which is way help we have
to look to predict Oh back part with the
color I got to make sure I put that on
the bottom no more about that silly
business you just put it in any which
way you want
that's your freak flag fly before it's
going to be freaking everywhere
just on Macs the USB if' has more than
757 partners according to their website
and they list them all big names things
like Acer Dell Samsung company called
goggle Asus Motorola and way way more so
expect this new standard to come to
laptops phones tablets annals that needs
a plug in recent years so it's the first
wave of just a totally new standard
I like the standard it's pretty it's
small ocean nets used on girls to use it
but it is here so what you gotta know
it's fast you carry a lot of power it's
reversible and it's going to be
absolutely everywhere so anyway thank
you guys for watching to watch give you
a short video to tell you what you need
to know about that importance you're
gonna hear about it if you follow stuff
in the tech world give a thumbs up for
new i/o until next time I am NOT render
from TechnoBuffalo if you like
TechnoBuffalo videos and I hope you do
because we love making them hit the big
subscribe button right here and you get
the latest as they come out
so yeah this video we stopped the video
just real fast to thank our friends good
peeps at Lenovo so you guys thought yoga
was just about cat Crowe and dog poses
you my friends are terribly mistaken we
will tell you bout the yoga tablet 2 pro
so things got a built-in projector it
actually can put up to a 50 inch image
on any wall or screen essentially just
mobilizing your home theater its rocking
a 13.3 inch 2560 by 1440 pixel display
front-facing stereo Dolby surround sound
speaker and powered by Intel's latest
atom processors this thing is actually
perfect for work and play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
