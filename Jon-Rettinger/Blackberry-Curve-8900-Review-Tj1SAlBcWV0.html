you for you of the blackberry curve 8900
for t-mobile right now this will run you
one $49.99 after rebate and a two-year
contract definitely check
t-mobile's website because prices on
phones really can vary quite a bit so
I've made really no secret that I'm a
big blackberry fan and the curve 8900
picks up where the previous curve left
off it does have a lot of cues from
other BlackBerry devices and I'll show
you those in just a minute if those have
a full QWERTY keyboard on front a 3.2
megapixel on the back and it is quad
band edge there is no 3G on this device
but it does have Wi-Fi and GPS both are
welcome additions so first let's start
with the keyboard the keyboard is your
very typical curve keyboard and I'll
zoom in a little bit so you guys can see
exactly what it looks like see my big
mug right there it's a very nice easy to
use keyboard with a very decent amount
of tactile feedback it's feels just like
the old curved keyboard but even a
little clicky err that makes sense so
when you type if you really do know that
you're hitting them number you're
hitting a letter really not wandering
left what you're hitting you really have
a sense of what exactly that is and the
keys are spaced apart so there's not
that much overlapping the keys are small
and will take some getting used to
once you do you should be typing away
with really little difficulty this is a
different keyboard than the keyboard
that's found on the bold those don't
have any spaces between them these kind
of have the chip like feel that the last
curve has and I'm a big fan of it I love
the keyboards on blackberry so this
takes some cues from the BlackBerry Bold
and uses the new operating system all
the graphics have been updated it's got
the new HTML capable browser which is
quite nice and I'll talk about all that
in just a minute once we zoom in there
as you guys can see the operating system
overall the operating system was very
fast it was snappy it was quick it's
very typical blackberry solid and it
just works one of the things I really
like about the BlackBerry operating
system is that it really doesn't crash
or freeze at often and whenever it does
is infrequent as that might be so if we
plug the battery and putting it back in
because it's
have a removable battery fix it the
problem and really never comes back I
think the operating system is very solid
and with this of course you get
blackberries bring out the
industry-leading push email service so
that is very nice it has a really nice
built quality to it as well it's got
this metal backing really makes it feel
solid in the hand the last curve at
least to me he felt a little bit cheap
and this feels very very solid and
secure and it has a nice yeah nice build
quality to it this has some rubber on
the side and the edges to make you you
hold the you don't feel like you're
gonna drop it which is nice although if
you do drop it really can end up in a
world of trouble because I've seen these
fall if you fall just in the right place
like most phones you're gonna end up
with a crack screen or even worse a
broken device these things are not meant
any phone really is not meant to be
dropped so I definitely recommend
investing in a case does have a built-in
mp3 player and video player which aren't
the best but they are good for a
blackberry and fun take advantage either
of those you can use a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack so things I do like about
this device build quality blackberries
finally updated browser although it's
still need not to get a browser
experience like you get on the
blackberry storm not gonna get
experience I could get on the iPhone or
the g1 but if you are a blackberry
loyalist you are gonna get probably one
of the best BlackBerry browsers that is
out second only to the storm so one of
the nice seeing that blackberry in RIT
in particular did with the device is
they took some more cues from the storm
yeah the two buttons on top here the
very top of the device the one on my
left side here lets you walk to the
button so you push that it'll lock it
and if you hold down the button on the
other side it'll put it to standby both
handy shortcuts I ain't going to use
black bears used to always have to map
the lock button to the side function
that's always what that was for me but
now I can use that for something else
camera or any other function that I like
I also do like the trackball in the
middle I think it really is a nice way
to navigate and I'm happy the BlackBerry
switched from the scroll wheel to
trackball so some of the negatives about
the device this actually has some of the
weaker signal strengths that I've seen
on any of the phones that
as soon as you get know I detest quite a
bit I don't know if it's the radio in
here the fact that as a metal back is
blocking it from transmitting but my
edge signal has not been very strong
this may vary by location to location
but compared this with other t-mobile
phone the particularly t-mobile 3G
phones my 3G signal is much higher
ability than my edge so I'm really only
down to one bar anywhere I go and really
anywhere I've been I've very rarely seen
this go all the way up to full bars and
I know that I do have full edge service
around where I'm at so the reception
here is not always the best although
once you do a reception call quality was
very good that really wasn't any white
noise on my hand or the callers other
end something to keep in mind Wi-Fi
works great gps worked as advertised on
most BlackBerry devices you can use it
on Google Maps or any other mapping
service that's compatible with
blackberry it's not locked down which is
which is quite nice so if I have to rake
this phone on a one to ten scale I give
it a very solid six-and-a-half and it's
losing out on points just because lack
of 3G lack of a really a full rich HTML
browser experience I really think that
it doesn't get a much higher score like
I've given to two other devices but if
you like blackberry and you don't need
3G and you just want something for great
email on a decent web browsing to make
good calls this is a very very solid
option and I can certainly recommend it
if you fall into that demographic anyway
this is John wrench or three view for
