Lakers khamir with a review of my demo
units t-mobile g1 powered by Google's
Android operating system amazing the
phone for about three days now and I'll
get into my experiences in a minute
t-mobile sent me the device to review
although I'm definitely not the first
one to review this device has already
had a lot of user information already in
it including phone numbers backgrounds
all kinds of stuff overall I've been
very happy with the phone I have to send
it back to t-mobile in a few days and
I'm a little bit disappointed I have
enjoyed using it call quality first off
is dependent on where you are with
t-mobile's network where I am in
Southern California the network is very
strong so I found reception to be very
adequate user on the other end reported
no interference no tinny noise so call
quality was definitely an overall 5
stars
build quality is certainly very nice the
phone is solid it's got a decent amount
of heft certainly weighs more than an
iPhone for example but it's not too
heavy and it sits nice in your hand as
you guys saw my hardware overview it
does have a little bit of a curve right
there so when you're talking actually
the caller on the other end did say it
was seemed quite loud volume on the
handsets end is quite loud as well I
particularly enjoyed it found it no
different than any other phone which is
nice t-mobile's 3g service is a little
bit spotty but when I did have access to
it it wasn't bad it was nice and quick
and I'd say about on par with a tMT's 3g
service even though t-mobile currently
is only supporting UMTS not the full
HSDPA which is just technical talk for
faster um she has this a little bit
slower HSDPA is a little bit quicker
both are technically third generation or
3G networks so let me go ahead and give
you guys some impressions of the phone
the browser I found to be a very nice
alternative to the Mobile Safari it's
not as good it's not as eloquent it's
not as fluid but it is nice I want to
start off this hardware review I'm sorry
this phone review by give you guys a
demonstration of the operating system
and particularly the browser itself so
I'm gonna go ahead and move this down
here I'm gonna show you guys just a
browser
right now so here's the phone hit the
end button and you hit the menu button
to a market it's no SIM card in there
right now
and here we are here is the phone so I'm
gonna go ahead and open up John for
Lakers comm and I'm gonna compare it
actually with the iPhone so you guys can
see the speed difference on each and the
memory has been cleared on both of these
give me one moment here go to browser
menu go to URL the type you have to
actually there is not an accelerometer
in the device you have to actually open
it up to type I'm going to type in John
for Lakers comm her head delete what was
there before
alright www.shawnacoronado.com thing on
the iPhone here get my bookmarks okay so
I will hit the John for Lakers on my
bookmarks and I'll hit the okay but at
the same time area we'll see what
happens and this is both over Wi-Fi the
same Wi-Fi network so there shouldn't be
any difference in speed alright and
let's see
and we're off on both of them alright
looks like they're both the same point
little status bar right there it
actually looks like the g1 is done
whereas the iPhone is still loading the
web page and it's done so just a few
seconds difference here you can see on
the iPhone I'm sure you're familiar with
mobile if you're familiar with Mobile
Safari you actually have the full page
already rendered and already scaled here
at John four leggers calm however on the
g1 you do a decent amount of scrolling
to see everything especially when the
phone is arranged like this when you
slide the keyboard out though you go to
portrait mode you get a little more
screen real estate and you can't pan
around with your finger and this panning
is very fluid and you can't double tap
what you can do is zoom just like normal
she tries a reloading the page here let
that finish up again you tap the screen
you get a plus and minus right there and
you can zoom out is it mad a little
further he's been just a little bit
further yet keep going and there we go
now you've got the full page although
the text is a little bit unreadable the
scrolling is very fluid it's actually
the most fluid I've seen on a non Apple
iPhone so I'll show you guys again very
nice and fluid so I did a walk through
the emulator of the hardware and the
software the device so nothing
revolutionary here you haven't seen but
I will relay that this touch screen does
feel very nice flick up go see rest your
programs and go back down go to the left
or right and do a google search you can
keep going in at more programs anywhere
you want and you can move icons on the
screen any way you choose which is very
nice so on I think everybody's talking
about is the Android Marketplace I'm
gonna go ahead and show that to you guys
right now let me go ahead and open that
up here alright there it is market see a
little alien icon go ahead open it up
and it looks very similar to Apple's App
Store I'm using the iPhone a lot as a
reference point because that's the
device a lot of people are familiar with
so you can scroll across and see some of
the most popular apps search by
applications it breaks it down by topic
these are all free right now
entertainment finance lifestyle
multimedia and go back go to games not
many games available but there are
enough right now and more should become
available shortly
pac-man solitaire kind of scroll through
these are all nice free games and they
all work very well with the phone the
operating system we could search it by
by popularity or just by DS so that's
one of things everybody's talking about
with the phone let go back to the home
screen open this device up again
and then the other things everybody's
talking about is Amazon mp3 and this is
similar to mobile iTunes or any other
downloadable service lets you download
mp3 files wirelessly
in this particular way DRM free from the
Amazon mp3 store go back to home screen
and I'll move the camera back up so I
can see you guys I have to say I have
been very happy with the phone build
quality like I said does feel nice
there's a little bit of a creaking
though on the device and that's from the
difference between a keyboard and the
bottom of the phone you can see there's
a limit of a gap right there you
actually see through it so there's a bit
of a creaking but the sliding mechanism
does feel very solid it does not feel
like flimsy really feels and has a nice
heft to it and really typing is very
good the keyboard I found to be very
usable it's a five row keyboard there is
a little bit of a hump here and people
were worried that it might be hard to
type over it I'm happy to report that
it's not an issue at all actually feels
more comfortable your hand actually
rests on that hump so a couple other
things to note about the device before
doing on it go ahead and scroll this
down and you get a full list of your new
messages emails tech messages everything
shows up right there you can scroll it
right back up that's kind of neat you
get alerts at the top that show you what
it is that popped up and it gets showed
before you can scroll left or right and
right up gives you a full list of icons
and all that stuff can be rearranged
scrolling on it is very fluid you can
scroll through your contacts you can we
scroll through anything very similar
again to the iPhone so guys I don't want
to keep this too long so I'm gonna get
cut off but I do want to tell you that I
am very happy with the g1 and
considering it's a really a first
generation product the first time
Android has been launched yeah I think
they did a nice job and they waited long
enough to bring it to market so I had a
complete product and it's only gonna get
better
it is over-the-air from where upgradable
so I love bugs people find they will be
fixed and will be upgraded and new
features will be cubby coming I think
that Google was smart to rely on a
manufacturer like HTC to build a device
someone with a proven reputation for
hardware manufacturing so guys overall
at five stars I'm gonna have to give the
t-mobile g1 a nice four and a half stars
if you're with t-mobile it really is the
only phones yet if you want a smartphone
with 3G capability
science that t-mobile finally has a
killer phone keep up with the rest of
the carriers hi guys John rent injure
John for Lakers calm okay very quick an
apology apologetically little rushed
review of the t-mobile g1 they don't
give me the phone for very long so I had
to give you my impressions right quick
