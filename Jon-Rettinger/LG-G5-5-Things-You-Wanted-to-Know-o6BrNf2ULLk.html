gherkin TechnoBuffalo here it's been a
few weeks since LG took the wraps off
their all-new modular
g5 and since we did our hands-on at
Mobile World Congress we've had a ton of
questions about the phone about the
modules about how it works about the UI
so I figured instead of just doing a top
5 things to know here actually top 5
questions that we've gotten from you
guys I put out a call for questions on
Twitter and I also took comments from
our hands on video this is a
pre-production unit so I'm not
comfortable using it for our full review
but we do get it painted in of course
we'll have our full review so let's jump
right in first question comes from David
Carrasco who act is it easy to switch
modules the modules are called friends
that's what LG's WM and there are
several them to be available at launch
probably the most popular though is this
guy the camera module so to switch
modules is actually pretty easy there's
a button that lives on left-hand side of
the phone go ahead and give it a little
bit of a press with your nail you can
slide the bottom part out what used to
be just a chin on the phone now here you
go to pull out the module it's a camera
module actually in addition to having
camera controls will expand the battery
we'll talk about that a little bit once
you have the battery attached in your
module which goes in the slides right in
and that's it turn the phone back on
they are not hot swappable you got to
turn the phone off
you pull the battery it'll just turn the
phone off hit the power button on the
back you get to go overall it's about a
20 second process switch modules not too
bad next one is a question I got from a
ton of people it comes from Ethan bean
who asks how does a battery stay in the
phone replacing modules like with the
camera module or the audio module so
like I said it's pretty simple when you
go ahead and pop out a module the
battery is attached to the module with
two connectors I'm gonna go ahead and
pull it you really got to feel like
you're going to break it almost but if
you just give it a big pull it pops
right to the connectors right there and
that's really it's all of this to it it
just stays on to the module via two
connectors one on each side pop back in
and you're good to go it's not going to
fall off next question comes from Cubs
who asks at Jon for Lakers the camera
module will actually make images better
if yes how much is it worth buying and
also battery of course so it's not going
to anything hardware wise to make the
pictures better it's going to be up to
you if you can make it better so when
you hold the camera module I might be
able to get pictures a little bit more
stable but it does have o is built-in
you've got an actual shutter button a
button that's going to toggle between
picture and video and then a little
roller if you want
zoom in that's all it's going to do is
just make you feel a little more
comfortable in the hand it's also gonna
expand the battery from 2800 to 4000
million power so bear that in mind but
we take pictures using the same two
sensors that are built into the back and
that's right there are two sensors here
you've got a normal 16 megapixel sensor
with an f1 point aperture and I think
probably the coolest thing though is the
8 megapixel wide-angle sensor which
takes huge wide angle pictures in our
office you can almost see from wall to
wall and that's got an F 2.4 aperture
and of course all the stuff LG same as
for like the laser autofocus is also
here next one comes from Joseph Rivera
who wants to ask build quality how much
better in the hand is a field in g4 it
felt really cheap like a Lego and a
dirty baseball glove again
pre-production unit I am NOT a fan of
how this phone feels in the hand at all
I was worried about how the modules are
gonna feel those feel really stable but
you compare it to the other competitions
competing against does not feel as priam
as I think the phone should be and as
pretty massive phone actually is next
one comes from play everyday who says I
don't know why but no afterwards a
turn-off for me now something I want to
talk about the UI built into the phone
don't have an app drawer no no app to
work which for me is a absolute deal
breaker but you can't install of course
a third-party launching it doesn't give
you the App Store I confirmed it was
through Google now on here without any
issue at all so pick your poison so what
you guys think about the g5 are the
friends all that friendly would you use
them is it more of a cool idea that
maybe you would just forget that you
have the option to I want hear your
thoughts on it more of a galaxy s7 or
galaxy s7 edge fan maybe the Nexus is
your device of choice or maybe you're
not a phone guy or gal let us know why
leave in the comments down below and of
course we get a review unit in it'll do
a ton more coverage on the g5 the next
time Jon render from TechnoBuffalo wow I
didn't think that through</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
