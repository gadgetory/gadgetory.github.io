to you by full sail university sony
announces playstation now EA finally
admits SimCity can go offline Nintendo's
crazy good 3ds numbers we played dogsled
saga and this week's new releases let's
get out of controller hello and welcome
to out of controller the weekly
technobuffalo show that covers all your
gaming news reviews demos and new
releases in an easy to digest capsule
form I'm your host Ashley sceva it's
always a big week in gaming so let's hit
the news even though CES isn't
traditionally a games convention that
didn't stop Sony from announcing
PlayStation now last week a streaming
service that will allow gamers to play
playstation games across a variety of
devices back in 2012 sony purchased game
streaming company Gaikai for 380 million
bucks so I guess now we know why they
felt it was so important to acquire
their infrastructure Sony smartphones
tablets ps3 ps4 Vita and even specific
models of bravia tvs will be compatible
with the service which will launch this
summer no official word yet on pricing
or whether the service will go with a
subscription or per game rental model
but we'll let you know as soon as Sony
makes that information official EA ate a
little crow for lunch this week after
announcing yesterday the most recent
installment in the SimCity franchise
would finally get an offline mode which
is funny because I remember when EA told
us in offline mode was impossible in
SimCity before the game launched last
year huh offline mode will launch in the
game's 10th update offering players the
option of playing offline and saving and
rolling back their cities without the
influence of outside forces of course
it's been nine months since SimCity's
kind of disastrous launch so I'm not
sure how much this update will entice
turned off players to return to or even
try out the game Nintendo had some great
news for their handheld division this
week after announcing sales figures for
both the Nintendo 3ds and its software
across the Nintendo 3ds lineup which
includes the 3ds the 3ds XL and the two
TS / 11 and a half
million units have been sold in the US
alone and almost 15 million units have
been sold in Japan software wasn't left
out in the cold either with more than 16
million digital and physical sales in
2013 alone that is forty-five percent
more than what nintendo sold in 2012 so
it's not a stretch to say that 3d s is
performing way better than a lot of
people originally guessed it would when
the device was first announced in 2010
let's play as a feature on our gaming
channel where a member of our writing
staff plays a game and talks about it
over the footage this week Joey is
playing dogsled saga it's currently in
beta but we got a sneak peek of gameplay
it's a two-man development team and a
Kickstarter game that's still in
progress but Joey seemed like you had a
really fun time playing it so check it
out I got to interrupt the show really
quick with a shout out to our friend and
sponsor Full Sail University you know
when you think up an app idea and then
wish you have the skills to make it

mobile development bachelor's degree

of your own home score with full sales
mobile development program you learn
both sides of app development for iOS
and Android creating your app with
advanced programming languages and then
launching and managing the business of
your app once it's complete if you don't
have to gear to code and test full sales
project launch box program offer
students a macbook pro preloaded with
industry software plus iOS and Android
devices if you're ready to make that
killer app and you're interested in
