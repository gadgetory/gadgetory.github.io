to you by crashplan welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup is the show
where we take all the juicy tech morsels
from the week and condenses into one
juicy rumor hamburger for you to enjoy
up this week we're to talk about HTC
allegedly stopping development on
several new smartphone models Apple's
new ITV apple to eat whatever you want
to call it as make it a rumor roundup
come back Tegra 4 is leakin with a 74
core GPU and HTC m7 is another 1080p
phone coming from the folks out of HTC
this is roundup let's go and get started
alright so let's start the rumor roundup
with HTC last should they release
literally a boat ton of phones you could
have fit them all in a giant boat well
they said no we're gonna slow a roll a
little bit released less phones next
year that appears to be true HTC has
allegedly stopped development on several
new smartphone models I was originally
planning to launch next year in 2013
according to new report that came out
last Wednesday smartphone maker still
hopes that his shipments will increase
by 10 to 15 ish percent but that's lower
than twenty or thirty percent growth the
firm was planning on to the first
quarter of next year we don't know which
models HTC is suspended although we
already do know as not going to move
forward the development of a 5-inch
Windows Phone 8 phablets through the
screen resolution limitations on windows
phone platforms which sucks I would have
loved at HTC Titan three love Windows
Phone a giant huge screen would have
been pretty sweet and it's possible the
HTC will continue to instead focus on
Android headsets over windows phone
power devices since they seem to have a
much more popular following oh that's
purely just technobuffalo speculation
Apple is allegedly testing a 46 to 55
inch ITV's when I'm calling it but it's
not gonna launch next year we learned on
December twelfth Apple was in the early
stages of testing designs for its own
television set according to its CEO Tim
Cook now those sources from apple
supplier Han higher speaking to focus
Taiwan claiming that app was already
testing a set the screen sizes between
46 and 55 inches news outlets suggesting
that boating to get its panels from
sharp but it's unlike kids are gonna
settle on a supplier before the end of
2012 in other words reports correct
rocket see an apple TV until 2014 if at
all it's really also saying is Apple's
doing due diligence on whether or not
the girlies television set of course you
do that with every single product they
ever come out with I think the big deal
holding apple back from a TV is getting
deals with the content provider TV is
great just gonna show regular television
content no real need for it they got to
find a way I get a subscription service
or sort of an all a carte menu for TV in
the TV network so I still like to see it
no idea what pricing is gonna be but I
think for most people don't want to get
that size up or 55 interest 65 teams to
be the the new hottest of course you got
samsung 75-inch you know gold-plated
monstrosity hopefully Apple would come
up with bigger sets you know if at all
guys care about apple TV is it just sort
of a dead rumor at this point I love to
hear what you guys have to say so we're
obviously big fans of nvidia and their
Tegra processors around here in Tegra 3
is pretty darn fast but it looks like
out with the old in with the new Tegra
4i started to leak out with a 74 core
GPU a recent leak is suggesting that the
company is working on a Tegra 4
processor which is called Wayne all the
processors have had comic book names so
Wayne from to Bruce so a slide the leak
that showed a 4+1 quad-core Eagle CPU
that suggests it's gonna be powered by
arms cortex a15 architecture which the
verb notes was also codenamed Eagle the
new processor allegedly is going to pack
a 72 core GPU which is frickin
incredible and it's gonna offer six
times the graphics performance of Tegra
3 6 freaking times I can't even imagine
what games are gonna look like on Tegra
4 they looked pretty awesome on Tegra 3
so you could have much more detail in
the water in the background I characters
be able to do more things AI should get
smarter for games other figures
supposedly include support for 4k video
playback that's coming mainstream soon
display resolutions up to a super-sharp
2560 by 1600 pixels and support for USB
3.0 are we sure when we're going to hear
more about Tegra 4 when devices are
gonna hit the market but we do open
videos
talk about it during the CES press
conference which of course will be
attending so are you jealous of your
friend droid DNA but one a little
smaller screen one of the phones HTC
supposedly going to be making is the m7
rocking a 4.7 inch screen and that
gorgeous 1080p display the phone is
currently coating the m7 it's barely
gonna ship with a 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core Qualcomm produced processor
likely to Snapdragon pro two gigabytes
of ram 32 gigs of storage LTE and 42
megabits per second hsdpa support 30
megapixel camera 2-megapixel
front-facing camera for video chat beats
audio 2,300 mil half hour battery and
Android jelly bean those specs sound
pretty freaking awesome to us and hope
this rumor actually come to fruition in
the form of a new smaller 1080p handset
from HTC we're hopeful we'll see
something during CES 2013 or at the very
least Mobile World Congress in February
but of course we'll be there for it so
