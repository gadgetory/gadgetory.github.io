to you by lynda.com hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley is together any question you
might have from the wide world of
technology every Tuesday we put up a
call for questions on TechnoBuffalo comm
and you can leave your question in the
post comments otherwise send them to me
anytime on Twitter at TechnoBuffalo or
at Ashley ask Ewa just use the hashtag
ask the bee so I can see it usually I
answer between three and five questions
every episode so let's get going
at a cool dude 19 asks I want to get
into reviewing phones how do I get one
of the big phone giants to send me a
phone to review well cool dude 19 whom
I'm assuming is the 19th coolest person
on earth it shouldn't be too hard you
know seriously a couple of big things
number one get a website start reviewing
start writing review anything if you
have a phone at home review it review
any gadget that you get and then be
consistent that's another thing another
idea is go to events go to different
technology events they may be like say
HTC throws a public event you can go to
that you can talk to people there be
legitimate like be honest be legitimate
and the other thing is is you can't get
any of them to send you a phone to
review if you don't ask so do your
homework meet people be consistent and
be a good writer those are that's my
advice to you that's what I think you
should do
also in case you're really wanting to
get into it we have advice for aspiring
tech reviewers here on TechnoBuffalo so
you can actually check that out if
that's something you want to get into at
ored Rhys one two three asks what was
your fave and what game do you want to
play this year there's a couple of
things last year I really loved BioShock
Infinite that was my game of the year on
out of controller but I also loved games
like The Last of Us and a couple of
other Super Mario 3d World I was totally
strewth and still m to a very large
extent as for this year I'm really
excited about a few games but I would
say Mario Kart 8 I'm really still
excited for Octodad dadliest catch for
ps4 watchdogs is gonna be amazing
destiny there's so many great games
coming this year so those are the ones
that come to mind though when I think
about what I'm excited about
at Avalos Vincent asks why doesn't Sony
make custom controllers like Microsoft
do you think we will finally see some
with the ps4 I think that this is kind
of a this is an interesting question
because we don't really see a lot of
custom controllers for ps4 or ps3 I
should say and we do see all of these
really cool like titanfall controllers
and things like that for Xbox I have a
feeling that if Sony were to do
something like this it would be with an
exclusive IP so something they are not
gonna see on any other console so if
there's anything out there that you're
hoping for in terms of an exclusive cool
custom controller I have a couple of
options one you can have somebody make
one for you is there's a lot of people
who are DIY errs on the internet and
they do some really incredible work and
the other thing that I would recommend
you do is just you know look for the
exclusives and that might be something
Sony might do in the future but I don't
have any inroads at Sony and I'm not
friends with Kaz Hirai so I can't say
for sure I'm gonna take one second to
thank our friends and sponsors at

project geek who says hey Ashley
since Samsung makes all kinds of
electronics do you think we'll see a
console soon I have never been asked
this question I actually think it's
really interesting and something that
nobody's ever brought up before yeah
they do make all kinds of electronics
they do a home you know home automation
they've got all the refrigerator's in
the washer dryers and then they have
televisions and they have phones and
tablets and laptops and everything under
the Sun you could possibly imagine
the the console space is something
really difficult to get into I mean even
the Xbox when it originally launched had
a little bit of a struggle kind of
getting that ground and really Halo was
the thing that sort of made the Xbox
like a must-buy in a lot of people's
eyes so I don't know that Samsung it
would be a step that they would be
willing to get into but honestly you
never really know because Nintendo
started off completely not making
consoles and then got into them in the
80s because they kind of ran out of
options
for the other stuff that they were doing
so and now in 2015 they're gonna get
into health so who knows you just never
can tell I would say never write off
Samsung you never know what they're
gonna do but generally speaking I
personally don't think we will see that
happen anytime soon
