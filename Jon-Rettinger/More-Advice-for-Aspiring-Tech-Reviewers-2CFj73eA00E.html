some advice for aspiring tech reviews I
started the series a few months back
where I just give some advice to the
aspiring tech reviewers and the aspiring
new youtubers of the world I consider
myself to be really lucky and really
fortunate to achieve even just a little
bit of success on YouTube in the online
community and I'd like to share what
I've learned to help you guys achieve
the same success and hopefully more than
I have so I'm going to be rehashing some
of the old things I've talked about and
bring up some new ideas hope you guys
find this helpful the first bit of
advice that I have and I always come
back to this I think it's the most
important is stick with it and nothing's
gonna happen overnight you need to
upload 10 movies in four days you're
gonna all of a sudden have 10,000
subscribers it just doesn't happen
stick with it you're gonna have to go
through some rough times when you're
stuck for three or four months with only
a few subscribers and a few video views
it happens happen to me it's happened to
other guys that are way bigger than I am
even in the comedy field directors field
not just science technology it happens
you just have to stick with a head of
confidence in yourself the most
important thing other than that the
conference is to enjoy what you're doing
if you're enjoying talking about
technology you know then for it won't
matter how many people are watching your
videos or how many subscribers you have
they'll make the videos because you're
enjoying it and it's a passion that you
have and that's really what kept me
going during the dry times I love this I
could talk about technology I mean this
is I've been talking about tech since I
was a kid and the fact that I now get to
share that with you guys I mean it
really is a dream come true for me so
I'm fortunate to have subscribers that I
do but even if I didn't it really
wouldn't matter I'd still be making
these videos and I still made the videos
when I didn't have any subscribers or
didn't have any views so that's
something else to keep in mind just love
what you're doing enjoy it if you stop
enjoying it you know it's time to think
of something else to do the next thing
is the haters it's very easy to sit
behind a computer anonymously when
there's no one no one knows who you are
and just see your handle and criticize
what you're doing
people that don't make videos they don't
relate to hardest who they sit in front
of a camera put yourself out there you
know you're opening yourself up to
criticism for how you talk how you look
what you're saying what's behind you
what camera you're using just a myriad
of ways you're opening yourself up but
it takes I think it takes some courage
to put yourself out there and make a
video so be confident in yourself and
don't let those haters get you down the
ones that put little jabs you know here
and there it's going to happen
make use the block button make use the
spam button and just delete them and try
and move on and don't let it get you
down I know it's easier to say than to
do
if there have been times and I what the
haters really get me now and I've
considered you know quitting and
dropping out and doing something else
here but then I realized again how much
I love what I'm doing and one or two
people that might disagree with me is it
gonna change it you're always gonna find
dissenting opinions no matter what you
do in life but there's technology
reviews or doctor or lawyer business
whatever you decide people aren't always
gonna agree with what you do and what
you say I guess it's a good life lesson
it's just to dub a little thicker skin
and just move on so the next thing I
want to talk about is video length
that's sort of a new thing that I'm
talking about what you're trying to grow
an audience you may have a hard time
keeping a captive viewer for period of
longer than five or six minutes say if
not established people don't know your
content until there's gonna keep
fast-forwarding or they're going to
close your window for those that are
just starting out I recommend shorter
videos maybe three or four minutes
really is a sweet spot get your point
say what it is if you're unboxing make
it a short and sweet unboxing oh you can
really keep people's attention how I'm
kind of coming back wanting from wanting
more as you grow your audience and you
people trust you and they know that what
you're gonna be saying next add some
value then increase the length of your
videos next thing guys is a lot of
people think that the more videos you
upload the bigger audience you're going
to get in some extent that's true but
some people are uploading ten videos in
one day or two days it's not the bulk of
the videos that you guys
it's quality spend the time with your
videos making sure that what you're
saying is worthwhile and what you're
showing is worthwhile and show you some
proper to editing as well if you don't
have editing software that's okay
most Windows computers come with Windows
Movie Maker which take more than suffice
if you have a Mac that of course comes
with some version of iMovie no matter
what year is whether iMovie HD Oh 809
whatever it is you have some version
that you can add it with so learn those
tools there a lot of freeware tools out
there too for video editing do some
research and find one that's best for
you to learn if technology reviewing is
what you guys enjoy then you're gonna
want to know how to use the tools to
trade something that I think is very
important so guys the next thing that I
want to talk about kind of one of the
final things that I'd say in conclusion
is stick with it be happy with what
you're doing
enjoy what you're doing have confidence
what you guys are saying I'm out there
watching all your guys videos I can't
respond to everybody's email but I am
checking them out and I think you guys
are doing a fantastic job there are a
lot of really really really good
reviewers out there that the world
hasn't met yet and I think that you guys
are are those there are ton of people
out there that are way more talent than
I do for technology reviewing and you
stick with it you have no doubt you guys
will be a success hope you found this
helpful and you guys have other comments
or other tips that you have for the tech
reviewers I'm sure to leave them down
below I think it's nice that we can
share with each other a little bit make
up make a community out of this so I
hope you enjoyed it first lucid content
