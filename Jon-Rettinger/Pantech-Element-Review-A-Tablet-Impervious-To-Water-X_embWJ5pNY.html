technobuffalo here at a full review for
you of the pantech element this is one
of the new tablets that was announced by
AT&amp;amp;T at CES 2012 and is now ready to be
bought by your tablet loving hands
there's a lot of competition in this
8-inch tablet range so let's go ahead
and dig in and see if the elements is
worth your tablet vayan dollar alright
so let me run through the specs of the
element to refresh your memory first the
price is 299 the two-year contract
there's also a deal going on you can get
this with the Pantech Burst a 4G LTE
smartphone for 249 dollars to get both
them on a two-year contract this guy is
running Android 3.2 presumably will see
ice cream sandwich on it on the future
but right now it is rock and honeycomb
from dimension standpoint it's eight
point three six inches by six point 12
inches by point 42 inches on the
thinness were thickness I'd depending on
who you ask well with not your glass
half empty or half full kind of person
and it weighs sixteen point five seven
ounces what you are looking at this slab
has an eight inch screen that's always
measured diagonally with a resolution of
1024 x 768 and that is a TFT display and
we'll talk about that display a little
bit more as we go on battery it is a
sealed 6,400 milliamp hour unit it's
going to get you 12 hours of usage or 25
days on standby time it's being powered
by a Qualcomm built 1.5 gigahertz
processor and if you like to follow all
the processors and your nerd like me
it's the apq8064 man internal storage
it's got 16 gigs expandable with microsd
on the back of this guy boom we've got a
5 megapixel camera that lives right
there that can shoot 720p video and
you've got a front-facing haha 2
megapixel camera right there for
front-facing stuff it's scott support
for AT&amp;amp;T is expanding LTE network and
Bluetooth 2.1 and it is named the
element because it is actually
waterproof this guy and it's not water
resistant pantech is saying it is
waterproof so stick around for a few
minutes later into this review when
things get a little more fun all right
so let's talk about be design it looks
like a tablet it's got a really nice
feel to it the black plastic back in the
way that's habit fault in the hand
remind me a lot of the HTC touch pad
it's extremely light tablet at sixteen
point five ounces so you hardly even
know that you're holding it I do like
the eight-inch form factor as well
generally I've been preferential to
larger screen size tablets but this one
really felt handy a nice especially well
you know reading or browsing out of the
web we'll talk about that a bit more
later I do like the integrated speaker
here on the side it was quite loud
cameras again we'll talk about that kind
of stuff because this is a waterproof
tablet there's all kinds of sort of
nuances here to be aware of so the power
button here is almost a recessed we've
got the sort of plastic ring around zip
you gotta really push in all the ports
here on the bottom where micro USB live
hdmi out you can see them all right
there and the SD card and sim card slot
are all under this door so a lot of
doors to do everything here 3.5
millimeter headset jack also wondered
that door so if you live somewhere where
it rains a lot or you like to browse the
web wider in the pool or in the shower
happy I might want to take a look at the
element alright so let's talk briefly
about some of the pantech tweaks and
I've actually liked what pendek is done
with android they really led Android the
Android in this case they've let
honeycomb be honeycomb with a few tweaks
so you notice some stuff out really the
buttons here are a little bit different
they look they don't look like standard
Android buttons the icons here look a
little bit different as well the
settings in the camera button a little
bit different some of the stuff that
they've done that I like if you go ahead
and jump on into the camera and you will
because I'm controlling it some things
down here that can jump right into
settings are quite nice so we'll go
ahead and go back home nothing else
overly exciting here the apps
our pretty standard apps pantech has
included a few things here that ATT's
included as well so you've got a sketch
pad you got a pc suite and you got some
AT&amp;amp;T specific stuff but for the most
part this is pretty stock honeycomb I'll
show you what the widgets are that's
generally where you see some
differentiation not so pretty standard
honeycomb which I like I don't like
doodling up everything some other
changes here you know some small stuff
as far as how notifications look and are
handled every time I use a honeycomb tab
but not after using ice cream sandwich I
keep trying to swipe stuff off to close
it but to no avail alright so this is a
tablet you're looking at the screen a
lot you can spend a lot of time looking
at this eight inch 1024 x 768 TFT
display and unfortunately it's not going
to be an overly enjoyable experience
this is not a good screen I've tested a
lot of tablets ranging in different
prices this is probably one of the worst
screens that I have tested so let me go
ahead and show you and sort of going to
be difficult to translate from camera
things here are washed out text and
because it's decent resolution it does
look crisp but the screen itself the
colors don't look vibrant the blacks
don't look very black it's just not an
enjoyable experience not to use now that
might be due to the fact that it's
waterproof so you gotta have a special
type of glass on here it's got to be
sealed all the way around the screen was
actually so bad that I thought it might
actually be a resistive touchscreen and
I had to sort of test it with something
that wasn't my finger to make sure that
it wasn't so if we go ahead and look at
galleries chloro scroll over here and
I'll show you what you know some
pictures look like so here are some
sample pictures so these are sample
pictures from pantex these are the best
representations that they can show and
cute dog really washed out the greens
hardly look green the black on the dog
just it just doesn't look nice and
watching video it's about what you'd
expect that same experience here's some
sample video so the best of the best is
the best it's supposed to look like just
does not look nice and it doesn't look
nice and the relative of other tablets
so it's certainly washable you can watch
a movie on it you can browse the web but
knowing that it exists
in the world of AMOLED screens this one
just doesn't quite cut it unfortunately
all right so let's talk about speed it's
got a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor this has been a pretty zippy
tablet actually screen complaints aside
it's been really quick I didn't have to
do any memory management it works well
you know browsing was very smooth
pinch-to-zoom worked very well LTE which
just sort of just launched in Southern
California so it's a bit spotty when it
was working worked very well but
everything about the the tablet from a
speed standpoint it was quite pleasant
so it was definitely a fast and capable
tablet battery so you're going to have a
giant battery 6400 milliamp hours and I
was definitely able to get that 12 hours
of use I use this guy well over a
weekend so probably more than that 12
hours and I let it just play video and
it lasted as advertised so you know
that's positive generally there is a bit
of fibbing when it comes to battery life
but not so with pantech alright so let's
get to the fun stuff this is a
waterproof tablet and because it's a
waterproof tablet it's got to be
waterproof and I wouldn't be doing
justice to you my audience if we didn't
test how waterproof it was so let's go
for a walk so let's say you're watching
one of your favorite tech reviewers and
you're strolling into your kitchen
seeing what's going on in the world of
technology and you know what you're
thirsty you want something to drink
you've had a long day you parched your
little dry in the throat you want to go
ahead and have a glass of water let's
say refreshing I fooled you didn't I
thought I was going to spill some water
on it nope so I'm just using the tablet
and uh oh sink full of water is it still
playing the video look at that it is
indeed still playing the video while
completely submerged in water and it is
indeed submerged pretty deep actually in
water in the video still playing the
tablet hasn't blown up still going let's
see if I can use it while it's there so
let's see if I can go ahead and tap the
screen
going to go back look like it wants to
work do I can browse the web what's
under there nope so you can't do
anything with it but it will still work
if you leave it so if you're watching a
video or something waltz underwater it's
still going to function let see if I
take it out of the water if it works if
it didn't just break it alright so let's
pull a tablet out and you can see that
it was submerged in water and peers to
be working see if I can tap the screen
screen they're gonna work with wet
fingers I'm going to dry off my hands
will come back in just a sec all right
so the tablet survived the screen wasn't
working on it was wet i had a dry it off
and hit the power button I didn't have
turned off i just had to lock it and
then unlock it and we're back working
again so this guy was submerged
underwater and you know still working so
you can see where we were left off in
the video and everything is still sort
of going buffering but tablet works it
is a waterproof tablet i give pantech
credit i definitely thought that I was
going to have a broken tablet on my
hands but pantech element is indeed
waterproof and see it's still got water
on it let's go ahead and finish up the
review alright so we saw a lot of stuff
with the pantech element it is indeed a
waterproof tablet you can do whatever
you need to do while you are under water
if you like if you're in a radiant if
you happen to drop your tablet in a
puddle or you drop it in the toilet it's
going to keep working I left you drop in
a toilet you might want to rub it down
with some Clorox you're still going to
be able to use it for the price point of
299 there's a lot of tablets in that
competition and that's to 99 with a
two-year contract so granted you're
getting LTE connectivity but this would
not be the tablet I would want tethered
to me for the next two years the screen
is really the big reason for that it's
just not enjoyable to use in a world of
galaxy tabs and iPads this would not be
the one that I would choose for my
tablet buying dollar however if I was an
outdoorsman I want to take the
snowboarding and I somewhere where i
needed that waterproof a bit of edge
then the element would be something I
would
consider otherwise your best best to
pass especially now when ice cream
sandwich is readily becoming available
it's tough to recommend a tablet that's
not going to come with it right away so
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo
hope you enjoyed my full review of the
pantech element and i'll see you guys in
the next video bye bye
