paying attention to what oneplus is up
to that's probably pretty good because
we're taking a look at the 1 plus X 1
plus X is 1 plus is sort of budget but
also fashion-conscious entry into the
market this thing is coming in at a cool
$250 which is really really impressive
when you consider the kind of quality
that they put into the construction on
this thing it's gonna come in two models
if first one is the onyx model that one
is the one that comes in at 250 USD
these devices are all glass all shiny
all finger printing all the time they
look gorgeous and they feel really good
in the hand - it's got quite a bit of
theft theft not theft did that be weird
considering we were at a press event the
ceramic model yes I said ceramic is a
little bit heavier because ceramic is a
slightly heavier material a ceramic back
is the the only differentiator between
the Onyx and ceramic models the ceramic
back actually took them a really long
time to perfect in fact the yield rate
for the ceramic backs was only 20% that
means that one out of every five of
those ceramic backs are all that made it
off the production line which is pretty
cool there's only going to be 10,000 of
them made and they're gonna be going for
370 euros it's gonna be kind of tough to
get your hands on one of these getting
past the beautiful exterior to the
inside for a moment the oneplus X is
running the Snapdragon 801 with three
gigs of ram which is pretty nice for a
$250 device that screen up front is a
1080p AMOLED display and it's gorgeous
the blacks are strong it's I mean it's
an AMOLED panel the color is great it
looks like a fantastic screen and again
for a $250 device what more can you ask
for you've got some storage onboard of
course but it is finally expandable via
microSD which is a new addition to the
oneplus line pretty excited about that
as well
you're not going to notice the
fingerprint scanner you're not going to
notice a lot of the other bells and
whistles but there are some other bells
and whistles here you've got dual Sims
if that's important to you and of course
you've got that very very oneplus alert
slider along the left side of the device
of course there's also a camera around
the back it's a 13 megapixel 2.2
aperture
amaura an 8 megapixel front facing of
course you've got that phase detection
on a focus on the back as well the
camera app is also you know the oneplus
camera app which has been in general
pretty good couple other notable things
that it's lacking are USBC they actually
were unable to fit the larger port into
the slimmer form factor of the device
and yeah NOAA NFC this time around
either it's a really interesting device
I'm curious to see if a $250.00 device
is really all it takes these days to
kind of meet the expectations and the
needs of what you need from the little
robot who sits in your pocket I'm
excited to get some hands-on time with
this for real give it a good old daily
driver test that old chestnut and see if
this thing kind of stands up to the rest
of the devices on the market despite its
incredibly low price point let me know
if there's anything you guys want to
make sure that I cover in the review of
the oneplus X in the comments and as
always thank you guys for watching be
kind to one another
and I'll catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
