injure and I wanted to call attention to
the fact that we live in an absolutely
magical time a time of wizardry and a
time of magical superpowers that are
given to us by the tiny computers in our
pockets does you look at a lot of
YouTube comment threads you looked at a
lot of Twitter feeds that are filled
with negativity there's a lot of
positive things that are happening a lot
of cool things that your phones can do
and in a fit of insomnia at about 3:30
in the morning a few weeks ago I put out
a tweet saying what part of technology
is most wonderful magic to you and the
responses that I got really personal and
awesome so thought I would kind of share
some of those stories share some of my
own antidotes about hacking technology
has been magical to me and maybe just
maybe create a positive video on YouTube
with positive comments ranging in size
from small units nor divisional level to
large-scale systems for IBM theater
level if we were around 50 years ago 60
years ago ask your grandparents or
great-grandparents all of this tech
would have seen like a science fiction
dream and now we've got it in our
pockets if you look at this giant stack
of code that's the stack of code that
got man to the moon now we've got that
power times I'm just gonna say 200
million sitting in your pocket for under
300 bucks it is incredible what phones
and technology in general can do I was
out to dinner for example for my
brother-in-law's 40th birthday and his
wife's sisters on the other side of the
world were able to FaceTime her and see
her and see her children at the dinner
table that is a personal connection with
technology whether you use FaceTime or
duo whatsapp or Skype whatever app you
use the fact that you can see people
wherever they are in the world is
absolutely incredible to me and it
wasn't that long ago when cell phones
first started existing you have certain
plans where you could call your region
and then you had a certain amount of
minutes for outside of your region now
you can call anyone anywhere in the
world it was incredible technology has
opened up communication with the world
and I personally am incredibly thankful
for that so if you wanted to play a song
couple years ago you had a
go buy a CD you had to try to download
it maybe go a tape or a record the fact
that you can use your voice and call up
any song you can think of within
presumably like 10 seconds is a freaking
miracle something with movies you could
say play a movie and it is going to show
up you don't have to go rent a movie you
not to go to a blockbuster or a
Hollywood Video or pay for it you could
sling it to your TV using only your
voice that and that really does kind of
seem like a little bit of like magic
take your phone the fact you have access
to all the information in the world that
alone would be incredible but the fact
that your phone can unlock securely
using just your face is an extra layer
of Awesomeness on top of the already
like awesome layer cake of of Technology
all of you guys are pixel users but if
you tried nitesite you can go and see
nothing with your eyes you can take a
picture and you can see detail in that
shot that technology is awesome you have
real-time translation using your voice
in translating your voice you can hold
your phone over a different language you
can see the words in your own home
language driverless technology is also a
crazy thing I got to go to weigh Mo's
campus and drive in one of their fully
autonomous cars they it's kind of bummer
they won't let me film it but this car
legit drove itself that a person
touching the steering wheel they put a
destination and the car went and if
there's ever been a time where I felt
like I was living in the future it was
sitting in the backseat of a car that
was moving and computing itself and
seeing what the car could see through a
computer screen was absolutely awesome I
think the point that I wanted to make
here is not just YouTube comments and
not just online comments but to
appreciate the time that we live in you
might be Android you might be iOS it
doesn't matter
you've got a browser on your phone
through that browser you can access the
world's information you can know facts
at a moment's notice you can answer
trivia questions at a moment's notice
you can know who the Lakers all-time
leading scorer was by just using your
voice you can find out how to donate to
fire relief you could pay with your
phone all of these things can happen
so quickly and I sort of it hit me at
3:00 in the morning at that sleep that
we live in a really wonderful time and a
lot of videos on tech and focus on
positive and negative mind included
because we no need to review stuff but
just to sit back and appreciate the
magic technology I thought it was a cool
opportunity to do it especially with the
holidays so if there's some aspect of
technology that you think is magic let
us know in the comments let's try to
make like a happy comment thread on
YouTube that would be like my Christmas
gift in my holiday miracle if we could
have a happy threat people helping each
other people sharing stories without
sort of the negativity usually
associated with YouTube comments so kind
of a unreligious silly video but
something that I wanted to share I'm
feeling really lucky to be alive this
time and I thought maybe you guys might
need it a little bit of luck maybe help
you feel better if you're feeling down
hope you guys enjoyed until next time
I'm John render</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
