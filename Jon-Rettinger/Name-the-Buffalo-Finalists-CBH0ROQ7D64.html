TechnoBuffalo here we had a ton of
entries for the name the Buffalo contest
all in all we probably had upwards of
twelve thousand different names to come
through put up by about thirteen hundred
different users so thank you guys for
all your submissions I had a blast
actually going through a meeting them
all and I did read through every one
I've godless in front of a year with the
five finalists so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take those five
finalists and we put them up on
technobuffalo calm under our daily pole
section and I'm let you guys vote on
which name you like the best I'll give
it up for four days and you guys can
just pick out who you want to win so
today is the eighth I'll leave it up
there til eleven fifty-nine p.m. on the
twelfth and that should give enough time
people to think about it I you can only
vote one time and only the top through
you're going to get prizes so what are
you guys going to win well everybody the
top three is going to win a brand new
HTC fuze which is courteously donated by
the good folks at AT&amp;amp;T and the first
place in addition to winning the HTC
fuze is also going to get a bright view
multi-format internet extremer this lets
you stream really any content that you
want from your home computer to your
your television also has a built-in
torrent client and a ton of cool stuff
that it does hopefully you will enjoy it
for places four and five you're not
going to win anything but thank you for
entering we had a lot of names that were
duplicates so I went through and I found
the first submission of the name
fortunately our contenders have some
what's a sort by date of comments so I'm
going to go ahead and read the names the
user's name and the date that was put up
so people know there were just a ton of
double triple quadruple or whatever
comes after that posting so entry number
one I've got a list in front of me that
I'm reading here we've got by the
randoms who put it up on you love them
30 at 5 24 p.m. same is binary the
Buffalo I thought had a cool ring to it
you know binary sort of a little digital
little geeky but might not always get it
but it was thought it was fun but it
sort
fit I like the sort of BB name binary
buffalo or binary the Buffalo kind of
dug it along that same lines we also had
my pod tech at eleven-thirty also at a
456 sort of similar bios the buffalo and
again some not everybody is going to get
but I thought it was sort of fit well I
can see myself saying you know bios to
buffalo and that's sort of you know
branding him so I think bios who worked
really well the next one was submitted
by Andy 333 this name was the only time
this one showed up Shia LaBeouf hello I
like the actor shia labeouf from
Transformers and the awful Indiana Jones
movie thought that was funny the Shia
LaBeouf Oh thought it was pretty cool
play on words and actually pretty
creative the next one was by user a Tony
Marlo on 1130 at 1052 and was heard
surge I kind of like that sort of for
the group of Buffalo soon hear myself
saying you don't heard surge it said
that saying something the buffalo herds
are just kind of a really cool name
we're using a sort of phrase join the
herd for everybody to join for
technobuffalo i thought that it works
really well and the last finalist was
this is this one came a lot too I'm just
like some of the other ones was from
user TJ 5096 and the name is buffalo
wing it's kind of a tent like it I love
buffalo wings I went to school in
Rochester New York which is right near
Buffalo so I went to the place actually
serve the first buffalo wing I thought
it made sense you know this is this is
buffalo wing I thought we could do some
cool things with the logo and sorta
maybe put some wings on them and just
make it look sort of mean those are the
five finalists they are heard surge
binary bios shia labeouf alow and a
buffalo wing so to everybody who posted
the same name that i read if i didn't
announce your username because you
weren't the first one to post it anyway
