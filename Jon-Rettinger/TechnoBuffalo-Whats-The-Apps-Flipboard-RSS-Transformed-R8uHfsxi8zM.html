brought to you by hostgator well hello
there what's up guys John Q here from
technobuffalo and welcome to what's the
apps a simple little app review show
here in TechnoBuffalo n rev3 where we
check out some mobile applications and
today we're going to be taking a look at
an application for the ipad called
Flipboard usually I try to find
applications and not too many people
know about because goodness knows we do
not we do not need another review for
cut the rope or doodle jump although
they are both wonderful games but
there's one iPad application that I've
been dying to review ever since I got my
iPad about two months ago and this free
yes free application I be talking about
is called Flipboard Flipboard takes RSS
to a whole nother level seriously okay I
barely say something is revolutionary
and mean it but man Flipboard totally
revolutionizes how you consume RSS
content no longer do we have that
traditional list experience like we had
before with the magazine like format of
Flipboard the RSS viewing experience its
interactive intuitive and beautiful on
top of the absolutely stunningly simple
and smooth user experience of Flipboard
I got to point out another thing as a
person who's into design I really gotta
give Flipboard credit for their seamless
grid system and their beautiful use of
typography bold condensed titles with
serif fonts makes following and reading
text naturally simple unless of course
you hate serif fonts and then then
whatever man you know your face hate
serif fonts mmm when you first open
Flipboard you'll see a few feeds
available such as lifestyle tech and
Flickr you can even check out their
featured content adding and removing
feeds is also very intuitive to iOS hold
and wait for the exes to appear and bam
no more food porn ugh dang it no worries
though adding new feeds is as easy as
pie I wonder if they have any pie
pictures on food porn PS for those of
you who have never been food porn has
nothing nothing to do with the dirty
dirty this is a big big gallery filled
with the wonderfully scrumptious food
pictures for fatties like
myself yeah so yummy mmm anyways let's
check out a feed shall we like I said
I'm a design guy so I've subscribed to
quite a few design sites the arrangement
of the articles varies from page to page
but as you can see there's always a
sense of balance just flip through and
find something you like and oh I would
love to see 85 cool Angry Bird
merchandise a--'s thank you very much
but what's the point of checking out
something cool without being able to
tell the whole world about it Flipboard
has made sharing super easy and you can
do it over email or Twitter speaking of
Twitter yes Flipboard natively
integrates your Twitter and Facebook
accounts not to mention it also pretty
faiz your friends tweets and wall posts
a downside to flip board is that it
doesn't necessarily work for all sites
most sites with the solid RSS feed will
render okay however some sites have
limited RSS feeds and might require you
to visit the full page before we go
lashing out and complaining Oh Flipboard
sucks it doesn't render this site
properly we have to remember the
Flipboard is an RSS reader and it can
only show what the site's RSS allows it
to show and I know it can be hard to
remember that sometimes especially with
image-based feeds like Flickr or food
porn I am such a fatty another downside
is a Flipboard is only available on the
iPad no iphone web or desktop support on
the plus side I didn't receive a tweet
from the footboard folk while back
saying that they will be working on both
so we'll just have to wait and see like
I needed to say this Flipboard this free
ultimate RSS beautifying application 5
out of 5 like to take some time right
