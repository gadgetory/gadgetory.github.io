ready for it you ready for the man clap
camera two man clap
Andrew use the surface pro for it did
you like it I use a service book yeah
try it
editing from this thing no GPU it was
beast and I loved it but Andrew I have
news for you
in fact I have TV news for you it looks
like the surface pro 5 is coming soon
and coming soon March according to digit
times which admittedly sketchy on the
reliability they are claiming they've
got the inside track on the surface pro
5 remember this guy the for launch in
October of 2015 which makes it like
ancient by computer standards standards
and we thought that in October 2016 we'd
see the surface pro 5 but we didn't we
tell the surface studio and we saw the
redone read performance based surface
book Nelda service pro fans we're sad
face but I think it can make you a
little bit happy so these times is
claiming that Microsoft has given the
thumbs up go ahead start making stuff to
the kind of transformer villain named
company Pegatron sears that we know but
surface pro 5 released what we think we
know we have a 4k display the stylus is
going to attach magnetically like this
version did in previous versions but
it's also going to charge wirelessly
directly from the surface pro 4 so
that's also awesome service pro 5 is
also expected to ship with of course
cabbie Lake of Microsoft recently showed
off Windows 10 running on ARM based
system so rumors floating around that
maybe the non pro version so surface 5
we're running off a Qualcomm Snapdragon
635 which give a good battery life but
probably thumbs down at the performance
standpoint but also should should cost
less on expect excuse to come in with a
gigs a ram standard and tobi up to 32
gigs of ram crammed into this tiny
little tablet thing don't just take my
word digit times were in fact in
microsoft's building 88 which i don't
they have 87 other ones they are showing
what looks to be a surface pro
silhouette with 2017 and they've got two
of them
so it looks like probably and it makes
sense pro non-pro versions I am excited
we're going to see this in March
probably around when the Windows 10
creators update is going to hit make
sense to launch those simultaneously
that's my likes energy together come
March so not that far off I'm excited
that surface pro 5 I've loved the
surface pro line for drop to 3 I think
just three is when they really started
to get it right so hopefully they get it
right or this time around because
excited about the surface profile you've
been waiting for computer did you jump
to something else did you buy a surface
book let me know down below what you
guys are excited about and if you leave
a good comment we're going to be pinning
it to the top like comments everybody
can see you and be like wow that
gentleman or lady is awesome
we'll be pinning a new one every day or
so so leave something witty anyway hope
you guys enjoy extreme certifications
turned on until next time I am John
Rhett injure this has been another TV
news just a lot see you guys the next
video armed flail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
