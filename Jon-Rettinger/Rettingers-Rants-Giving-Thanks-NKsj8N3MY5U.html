to you by AMD what's up everyone welcome
back to their pursuit of renter's rants
in his Thanksgiving week and I'm gonna
stop being crabby and old and generally
complaining to talk a little bit about
Lyme thankful for this year I love
Thanksgiving it's a time of year when
you can complain about everything for
364 days and for one day pretend that
you are thankful I've got a lot of stuff
in my life that I'm very very thankful
for and I want to share it with you and
family or friends whoever might know me
as watching this video go and get
started I promise I'll be back
complaining and angry next week but this
week especially with Thanksgiving here
the United States I just want to say the
things i'm thankful for in my life I've
got the real privilege to be thankful
for quite a bit probably much more than
I ever deserved or thought I would ever
have if I could go back you know maybe
10 years and tell you know 23 year old
John would he be doing in a decade later
I would have laughed at myself never in
a million years would I would have ever
imagined I get the opportunity to live
my dream talk about technology for a
living to employ technology for living
even to started a company that's focused
just on consumer electronics is really a
dream come true even a bad day at work
is a good day i love what i do and i
love even more i'm able to give other
people the chance to live their dreams
as well you know people that can write
for us that video and edit force that
are on camera for us you know that's all
possible because everyone's hard work
I'm eternally thankful for the audience
the folks who have supported me through
the really really really bad webcam my
one-bedroom apartment amid all the
videos with my bed in the background but
I moved up and got a little bit of a
home office and I still had really bad
camera and audio you know to now when
we've got an office here and a little
more professional setup just thank you
for sticking with me whether you're a
new subscriber a follower an old one I
can unequivocally say that I wouldn't be
here I wouldn't diaper tune in live my
dream or the opportunity to do what I do
if it wasn't for you ten years ago I was
running a marketing firm for software
development company and I hated my job
he did it hated it I have a little bit
of problem the authority and I hated
working for people i considered to be
dummies I didn't like making other
people money it just it just it didn't I
just felt like I wasn't being utilized
and I was just I had nowhere else to go
when I was hoping to getting a minor car
I just didn't enjoy coming to work every
day was I would dread it every single
morning and now the chance to talk about
Tecton to work with people that I really
like is just an incredible blessing and
that's all because of you guys so thank
you on a more personal level I've got a
lot of things we thankful for family
this year I have the real privilege of
now being a father I've got a just a
nine week old son on Sunday Nathan who
I'm so incredibly proud of and who's
sleeping seven and a half eight hours a
night which means my wife and I are
surprisingly well rested for having a
newborn he's just a good baby and a good
boy and I hope that he grows up to try
and be a helper that make this world a
better place and just be the best no
Nathan he can and not don't be a taker
in this world you and those few that's
or give back that's my wish for him I'm
immensely thankful for my family I'm
very fortunate to have with my parents
still here and one full set of
grandparents are grand mother on another
side I feel very fortunate to be able to
have them know my son and I know my wife
I'm extremely fortunate for my wife I
married so far out of my league it is
not even funny she's incredible when the
best parts about being a father seeing
my wife be a mother that's a whole other
side of her and I was able to fall in
love with that all over again I'm just
I'm very fortunate grateful this time of
year and i thought i'd share with you
guys instead of getting focused on you
know and angry about what's better xbox
or playstation or you know apple or
android focus on what's important at
least for one day in your life I think
of something that you're thankful for
whether it's its family whether it's
health whatever it might be think of
something that you're thankful for them
again I'm also thankful for fortunately
having very good health thanks for
having food and a roof over my head and
all sort of try to remember those that
aren't as fortunate as I am and try and
help you know however I can try and
write the world just a little bit of a
better place let me take a minute to
thank our friends and sponsors at AMD
AMD powers the world's best pc graphics
since the driving graphics experience
behind the new microsoft and sony
console so that means you can leverage
the same power that these systems have
and that same awesome technology can be
yours Andy delivers the CPU horsepower
to easily tackled a data usage no matter
what you do
Andy power systems can take whatever you
throw at it let's say you want to play
late a steam game or try and hold back
John Q Zerg rush or just need to take
notes and hammer through some office
documents Andy systems can tackle
whatever you throw at them without
breaking a sweat and they do all that
while sipping battery this is probably
one of the coolest things about AMD
powered laptops and tablets it'll just
this power consumption based on what
you're doing and be able to last you
through at least marathon gaming session
and a three hour boring lecture my guys
that was sort of my sentimental renters
rants for the week wasn't so ranting by
thought it was apropos given the season
hope you guys enjoyed it again I'll be
back man pissy about something
technology next week I just wanted to
share that said Matthew guys I hope you
guys have a wonderful Thanksgiving a
happy holiday and I will talk to you
guys next video bye whats up guys its
