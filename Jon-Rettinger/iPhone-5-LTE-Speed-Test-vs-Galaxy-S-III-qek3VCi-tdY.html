technobuffalo here we've had the iphone
5 in the office for a little while now
when the first things I did was speed
tests I want to know how fast the thing
was and then I just curious how it
compared to the galaxy s3 on AT&amp;amp;T LTE
speed so I thought why not show it on
camera AT&amp;amp;T version here AT&amp;amp;T version
here on the Galaxy S screen we've got
four bars of LTE same amount of bars on
the iphone 5 so let's go ahead put these
two head-to-head see which one's faster
so I'll run a full head to head of
everything here including speed of
processor applications and core things
in the OS bright now this is just a
speed test of LT in Southern California
obviously your speeds could change
depends on where you are time of day all
that kind of stuff so totally subjective
but I was curious to test both at the
same time so open speed test here and
let me show you that everything else is
closed all we've got open is the speed
test app and every 10 apps there so
speed test is open its open speed test
here as well it's going to find our
closest server and let's begin the test
a Wi-Fi is turned off on both least well
so it's straight LT and let's see which
one am I taking bets see which one's
faster look pretty close to even iphone
5 decently faster almost a whole megabit
per second faster so we got 5.5 down at
a pretty whopping almost 6 up so this
finished quicker on the iphone 5 I give
18t credit there upload speeds are
pretty fast so 4.72 and 5.26 so a little
bit faster on the download on the iphone
5 so go and restart the test and run
them one more time and see if we get
similar results
so we're getting now about four to five
ish on the galaxy s3 and about the same
on the iphone 5 a little bit under and
we got just exactly five so the moral
being they appear to be just about as
fast i will say that i ran these tests
outside on both phones the iphone 5 was
a bit quicker by not by much looks like
the LTE radios in each are very
comparable so if you have a 4g LTE
galaxy s3 awana how fast your iphone 5
might be and maybe one of your friends
has a galaxy s3 it's going to be a great
test not all LD is created equal some of
the older LTE phones they're down speeds
were much much much slower something to
keep in mind and you guys stay tuned to
TechnoBuffalo we're doing a ton of
comparisons will put all these phones
head-to-head full walkthroughs and first
impressions of iOS 6 in the iphone 5
anything else you guys want to see leave
your comments down below jon rettinger
projectile Buffalo I'll see the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
