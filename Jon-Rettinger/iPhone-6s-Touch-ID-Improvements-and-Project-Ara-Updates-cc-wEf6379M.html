to you by full sail university what's
going on guys the marking sanger from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's Friday the
13th episode of rumor roundup we're
going to talk about the rumored new and
improved touch ID for the next iPhone
project ara and new reports about the
galaxy s6 this is rumor roundup let's
get started let's talk about the iphones
first we really don't have a clue on
what Apple is planning for its next
iPhone if history repeats itself which
it often does then apple won't tweak the
industrial design of the iphone 6 and 6
plus too much it will of course offer
some new hardware features that improve
the experience for us consumers 1 kg I
analysts known for reporting on Apple
supply chain says he found evidence that
Apple is working to add a new and
improved touch ID sensor into next
year's iPhones the new touch ID sensor
will apparently offer a better and safer
Apple pay user experience by reducing
reading errors the analysts also added
that rumors of a full touchscreen touch
ID won't be happening anytime soon but
Apple has filed patents for integration
between touch ID and touch panels so we
could possibly see a touch ID screen in
the near future now I haven't gotten
Apple pay to work properly so if the
next iPhone has a much better touch ID
then count me in up next is Google's
project ara new report claims Google's
heading to Mobile World Congress next
month would project ara we could
possibly catch an early glimpse and
quick demo of the device and up to 50
different swappable modules from a
variety of manufacturers hopefully we'll
get a look at the custom version of
nvidia's tegra k1 processor designed for
the project ara once project ara finally
launches you'll essentially be able to
design your own phone swapping out
different components like cameras and
battery based on your own personal
preference unfortunately Google hasn't
revealed pricing and when it will come
out but hopefully we'll learn more about
google's plan next month assuming the
company will make an appearance at
Mobile World Congress 2015 let me stop
the video for just a quick second and
thank our friends over at full sail now
as you know virtually every industry
relies on software technology and Full
Sail University which offers bachelor's
degree programs that address the need
for skilled tech professionals through
curriculum that blends code and theory
with real-world experience the mobile
development bachelor's degree program
offered on campus and online teaches
students how to develop apps and
utilities through courses that cover
both iOS and ang
development if you want to learn more
about full sales web and Technology
programs visit Full Sail edu slash
technobuffalo and last but not least
this wouldn't be we round up if we
didn't talk about the galaxy s6 now this
has to be a record right the galaxy s6
isn't exactly a secret but Samsung's
done a decent job of mostly keeping the
upcoming phone under wraps until now a
new antutu benchmark spotted by a
chinese site my drivers may reveal a
full of suspects for the flagship device
including blazing fast speed for his new
processor based on today's leak the
galaxy s6 should come equipped with a
5.1 inch qhd display Samsung's own
Exynos 7420 processor a 20 megapixel
camera in the back a 5 megapixel camera
in the front 3 gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of storage and run android 5.0
point2 out of the box now phonearena did
note that the model number listed by the
benchmark could possibly be the rumour
galaxy s6 edge but the curb display
isn't mentioned anywhere in my drivers
report either way we're expecting
similar specs for both devices so it
shouldn't be much of a difference
similar to the galaxy note 4 n note edge
Sam sings expected in vail the galaxy s6
and s6 edge next month in an event set
for march first and we'll be covering
the entire thing live so make sure to go
