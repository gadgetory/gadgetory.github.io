technobuffalo here we're taking a look
at the just-announced h
dear I no longer this is straight HP and
this thing is tiny I've got an HP
replica has been going some questions
we're looking at a two point six inch
screen this thing is really there's much
smaller person you'd expect what's the
resolution of the screen 3 24 just using
a next generation snapdragon processor
at 800 megahertz is there anything
particular about the device that you
think people need to know where be aware
of short of what was what was shown
today so it's about three and a half
ounces
and it's got a very expensive cameras
got a full keyboard and a great touch
feel action on the keyboard metal
accents very feel in the hand very
well-balanced
most experienced what is the resolution
of the camera as far as what it can
output the nail put each DVD or can
rather capture HD video this one will
sure about the 33 dos feels very very
snappy take a look at some of the other
browsing experience here and this is one
of those fans I think people need to to
get in there and to see the size it's
roughly the thickness of a deck of cards
it's a smaller than to pretty lady
alright so let's do a quick size
comparison here here it is next to my
phone for you can see this capital a
minuscule this thing is predicting each
other
so let's stick with the keyboard keys
are gonna have to an input text one of
the complaints that i had about previous
generation i guess pre devices was the
keyboard had a bit of a rail along the
side you can type on this keyboard
here's to be missing that's nificant
rail it looks definitely smaller you're
gonna probably pick CS typing experience
but it is usable let's go ahead and take
a look the browser here and see what's
mystic want to look like so first let's
actually take a look at some performance
here it does seem pretty zippy
especially for the 800 megahertz
processor oftentimes the processor speed
gets wrapped up in actual device
performance and it's
hardware is integrated with the soft say
we've got the the web is quite open this
up and take a look let's go ahead enter
URL still no on-screen keyboard here we
go try dipping technosoft elusively
disappears I can say that LM typing you
really have to make sure my fingers
aren't getting the right not to do it
would to hand in lunch or how it works
so this feels very much like a standard
free experience on typing a good reviews
degree or used it pixie is going to be
very familiar for you let's go into this
looks like it's going to be a bit
dependent on the
the web browser here at least a good
chance to see a little bit version here
I just pretty quick we're not seeing
much of the checkerboard pattern the
bottom as we saw with the previous HP
and pummel devices scrolling is very
similar
so this is a demonstration of the Veer
certainly we want to get one in hand for
review I'll be able to check it out and
give you some pool oppressions if you're
curious if you guys have to think about
a device this small this thing is movie
Minister not gonna lie see Walt Mossberg
totally made my day
