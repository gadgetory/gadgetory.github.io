to you by hostgator oh it's a leak but
is the leak true do we really know what
the nexus prime is going to be before it
comes out is rim about to be acquired by
a cell phone carrier and is the Sun
finally going to rise again on Finland
I'll let you parse that what that one
might mean it's techno buffalos rumor
roundup hello and what is going on
everybody I'm Noah Kravitz
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo calm
and this is your rumor roundup for the
week ending today friday october seven
2011 this week's episode of rumor
roundup is brought to you by hostgator
before we get started just want to
acknowledge some sad news in the world
of technology this week the legendary
Steven jobs has passed away the
co-founder and former CEO of Apple
Computer finally succumbed to his battle
with a rare form of pancreatic cancer
this week it was announced on Wednesday
and to steve's family everybody who knew
him at Apple and the tech world at large
from all of us here technobuffalo our
thoughts are with you Steve will miss
you and I think it can be said whether
you're an apple fanboy or can't stand
the sight of a white pair of earbuds
Steve Jobs did probably as much as
anybody to change and shape the way that
our world uses and interacts with
personal technology so Steve thank you
for everything you brought to us now
then on to the rumors first up speaking
of Apple we all know the iphone 4s came
out this week but that was so this week
it's all about next week ctia in San
Diego the big cell phone industry show
John will be there I think a couple
other the Buffalo going to be down there
too in san diego bring you all the news
and leading up to the show the big
rumors are all around samsung's unpacked
event to be held on october eleventh and
we're all speculating that they will use
the event to unveil the nexus prime or
Galaxy Nexus or whatever it's going to
be called looks like it might be called
the galaxy the nexus prime rather we've
been talking about this phone for a
while now it looks like it will be
verizon's answer to the galaxy s2 lineup
because verizon wireless did not pick up
a galaxy s2 variant unlike their other
big three competitors in the u.s.
instead looks like they're getting the
nexus prime a bunch of tech specs leaked
this week and they seem pretty they seem
pretty realistic so we may have an idea
of what prime will be all about now the
biggest news is that it's going to run
the newest version of Android Ice Cream
Sandwich also known as android 4.0 we
think the other news we're going to have
a giant curved glass display 4.65 inches
of full 720p HD resolution 1280 by 720 a
TI OMAP a 9 dual-core processor clocked
at 1.2 gigahertz 0 to 1 point 2
gigahertz course a gig of ram 32 gigs of
internal storage also and to me this is
you know more the most exciting specs
frankly 9 millimeters thin a scant 9
millimeter stand when you've got a phone
with a giant screen like the prime is
said to have like the Sprint variant of
the galaxy s2 has the epic touch 4g you
really want to have a super thin profile
9 millimeters best thing as it gets
sounds pretty awesome to me makes the
phone a lot easier to hold and use and
also to carry around in your pocket if
you carry yourself on in your pocket
like I do we'll also see two cameras on
the phone 5 megapixel camera on back
with flash and 1080p video capture and a
1.3 megapixel camera up front and either
LTE or hspa+ depending on the carrier
note this launches on verizon is a
verizon exclusive in the US which the
rumors are pointing to imagine we'll see
LTE technology so October 11 Samsung's
unpacking something we think it's the
nexus prime now we think we know what
the specs are going to be all about
whatever it is John will be there
firsthand to bring it to you speaking of
phone rumors and leaks
the cell phone carrier orange of France
recently document leaked out of the
orange camp pointing towards what might
be the first nokia built Windows Phone
device to hit the market as being called
the Sun we're all expecting Nokia to
unveil their first window phone devices
at nokia world later this month in
london our own emily price will be on
hand in London so I stay tuned for
whatever Nokia's got up their sleeves
and we all know it's gonna be windows
phone stuff busy busy month iphone ctia
nokia world has just in it never stops
kids it never stops anyway this this
document that leaked out of orange
france points to a phone called the sun
from nokia running Windows Phone 7.5
mango now of course any good technique
has specs and the specs on this leak
make the Sun look pretty bright make the
Sun look pretty hot get it son right now

is not about phones this rumor and this
rumor isn't about the android app
compatibility that was leaked on
TechnoBuffalo earlier this week as well
go to the site and check that one out
there's a little plug seriously they're
interesting stories but no no this is a
business rumor and the rumor is that
Vodafone might be interested in
acquiring rim that would be really
interesting vodafone of course is the
giant uk-based cell carrier that also
has corporatized to verizon in the US
and the rumors are that vodafone might
be interested in acquiring the
waterloo-based canadian smart phone
company the one time masters i was
trying to work out something in my head
masters of your size doesn't make sense
rim blackberry the guys make the bold
which frankly is a pretty great phone if
you want to get stuff done i used a bold
the newest bold for a week straight and
I spent a lot less time browsing the web
and watching videos and a lot more time
sending emails and messaging in that
kind of anyway rim to be purchased by
Vodafone will be interesting i don't
know if i buy it would certainly be
interesting so stay tuned blackberry com
