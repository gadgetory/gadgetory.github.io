brought to you by full sail university
what's going on everyone John renders
from TechnoBuffalo here we got a ton of
foam that just came out a lot of tech
still yet to come out and a lot of take
rumored to hit in the very near future
so I thought it was the perfect time for
ask the Buffalo I got a ton of questions
people shot to me at twitter so let's
jump right in in our first question
coming from Luke Lynch who asks at John
for lakers you think the HTC m10 will be
the lifesaver this company needs when I
read that I just thought about like the
lifesaver candy I don't think one phone
is going to save HD see what did you see
me say something is going to start
changing the perception of the company
and hopefully the mg cm10 is going to be
that I also thought it was going to be
the m9 but it looks like they've learned
from their mistakes next question comes
from a heart Keith at John for lakers
why did you pick the Buffalo Navy name
the channel when i started youtube
channel it was at john for lakers which
was just my old am screen name from high
school which goes to show i had no idea
that's gonna turn into anything i'm just
using that channel to comment on other
videos which why my twitter handle is
still at john for lakers i I don't know
why the Buffalo came from and all
honesty I just wants it available URL
when I picked the name of the company
technobuffalo and that worked I want the
tech throw in the title head up buff it
was easy to spell and kind of easy to
brand up I want to branch off to another
topic next one comes from my friend at
super staff who asks at John for lakers
s7 rest of an edge which be your choice
and why I'm an edge man I like the way I
just want exact way it looks and
first-generation little bigger screen a
little bigger battery two biggest
reasons i would go the s7 edge next one
comes from d kids who asked at john for
lakers would expect to see in the way of
new macbooks and max this year from
apple hopefully something it seems like
Apple hasn't touched their laptops in
years the start the unexpected new
macbook pro is obviously a skylake
processor but time for design change
same design has been around it's about
2012 there's been crazy rumors floating
around at Apple's gonna do a surface
competitor with a detachable keyboard
and a touch screen I wouldn't put much
merit in that I would say a little bit
thinner us bc i'm probably removable
some of the older legacy ports and
that'll probably be all we're going to
get hopefully we'll see it though
sometime in march next question comes
from adam slack the guitars for the
struts you should should definitely
check out I
asks what are your thoughts on the s7 or
what Apple can do next realistically a
good question s7 keep pretty solid phone
we got a review coming up very soon on
it so stay tuned Adam for all that stuff
will link it here when it's live when
Apple can do next thinking in terms of
new product line something different
seems like they are stagnating with your
product lines they're innovating but not
doing any revolutionary like they used
to do I thought the next product is
maybe it's dedicated TV set maybe it's a
TV service I'm hoping though the next
iphone 7 can be something big a new
killer feature we've never seen before
but at this point I'm not holding my
breath anymore new camera angle our next
question comes from our da fare card who
asks at John for lakers what is the one
thing you hope Apple events of the ipad
air three that i hope they call the ipad
are three not not an ipad pro that's my
my one hope better screen to be nice s
question comes from asshole who asked at
john for lakers what are your thoughts
on the rumors of removable of the app
droid android n-no i hope that is just a
dirty awful gossipy tabloid rumor don't
do it google please don't do it please
next question comes from my friend Mario
Charles who asked that John for lakers
you think OEM tree released phones every
two years or to limit incremental
upgrades and focus more on software no
make it that's what's going to drive
profits for them to these phones every
year that are barely different than they
have every right to do it well you don't
have to do those buy a new phone over
here though it's hard for a consumer
perspective to be like hey did you get
my brand new shiny phone it's only gonna
be new for like another 10 months they
just feel like a jerk store but
companies can do it they're going to do
their for-profit businesses and that and
to drop off its for them I think you
guys for watching hope you enjoyed I
loved answered questions and get a
chance talk to you guys i also like
doing this a lot evidently until next
time I'm John right Jeffrey
technobuffalo see guys next video and
the last question comes from me about 10
years ago John what can I do to further
my career and I would say to younger
John with less gray hair no children the
John that could go see movies at ten
thirty at night the John that could
sleep till two in the afternoon to you
out
say further your education you can check
out some of the courses at full sail
university for example maybe you want to
try app development no you're not the
best coder they do offer an
undergraduate degree you should probably
check out or maybe John you want to make
a social network or maybe want to learn
how to code your own website the future
that you might make called TechnoBuffalo
you should probably learn about it and
how to code desktop apps for full sails
undergraduate degrees because they they
have that too and maybe you just want to
get out of your horrible marketing job
that you're in hoping and getting a
small car accident every day well silk
can help you to younger John go check
out Full Sail dot edu slash
technobuffalo I don't TechnoBuffalo
means but it's gonna be something
something one day and maybe I'll help
create</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
