catch outlast the game in the Walker you
try so I mean this has been just a first
few minutes of playing at last the game
is definitely a little bit on this
frightening side unlike the scale of
like Mario to like super scary as is
definitely would probably be close to
the benchmark a super scary um I
wouldn't necessarily like my wife would
not enjoy this she would probably have
bad dream for a while I could probably
see who I actually made a scream on III
