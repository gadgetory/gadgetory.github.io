TechnoBuffalo here news of the apple
tablet has been coming very fast in
recent days and it's been some updates
and new rumors from very reputable
sources since the last video thought I'd
give you an update on the tablet while
you can expect when it's cozily revealed
to the masses later on this month well
the first big rumor that we heard is
that the tablet was going to have a 7.1
inch of course capacitive touchscreen
but now actually the Wall Street Journal
is reporting that there's been reports
of a 10.1 or 11.1 in touch during so
it's obviously noticeably bigger than
what we initially thought a wall street
journal is also reporting that Apple has
two prototypes that they've been
limiting it down to may have two
different materials what those materials
are no one's saying but I would wager a
guess it's probably a aluminum or
plastic version or possibly either a
matte or glossy screen so whether we'll
see two versions actually at launch
rather not those two versions were just
brought to Steve Jobs or Apple
executives to pick which one they like
has yet to be seen wall street journal
is also reporting that apple's event is
going to be on the 27th of the month and
not the 26 jun they want to space it out
and not from CES gunner enough attention
and these big keynotes it found familiar
with apple's where they generally do
some grandstanding of all their products
where the iphone is first announced was
at a keynote and they really make it a
brick spectacle on a media spectacle so
i would definitely expect into this
month that we will finally see the famed
apple tablet and again Wall Street
Journal is saying they'll probably just
be shown for a supposed March release
some interesting things about tablet and
news are coming out I'd expect this to
be a device that does a few things very
well oh and the iphone is first launched
it didn't have some core features that
most phones had didn't have cut copy and
paste it didn't have the best email
capabilities but it did a few things
really well it was a great ipod first
touch screen ipod that was available
anted web browsing better than any other
mobile device out there a tablet phone
anything short of a computer i really
was a breakthrough device and people me
included were able to sort of
pass some of the omission flaws because
the iphone did a few things so well and
expect that sort of same business mantra
to carry over to the tablet which
opposes going to be called again the
isolator possibly even the I guide I
think we're going to see a tablet that
is used for sort of new media I think
it's going to be very heavy on books and
we're going to see a book reader in
itunes I think we're also going to see
it very heavy on the magazine side
certainly magazine subscriptions could
use a sort of a jolt in the leg sort of
boost magazines subq overall since
things have gone online physical prince
has been on a decline I think that this
new i slate or matte tablet whatever
they call it could be the bike sort of
brings magazines back imagine sort of
sitting on the couch flipping through
your magazine pages could be quite nice
and while you're sitting there same
device check your email you got an email
coming in or you can go right to your
favorite website using what I assume
would be a very good browser the one
information we don't have about whether
or not it's going to be a modified
version of OS 10 or a modified version
of the iphone operating system which is
in its own right a modified version of
OS 10 unexpected probably going to see a
full functioning operating system
there's also been some talk about sort
of mobile broadband a 3g service that
does come to fruition certainly 18-2 and
makes sense especially in the u.s. given
their relationship with AT&amp;amp;T here with
the iphone it's also been talking to
possibly verizon i would assume that
Apple wants to keep production costs
down and putting a GSM which is
technology to eighteen t use is the one
that sort use a sim card into the tablet
would make more sense because it'd be a
little bit more global gsm of the
technology used really around the world
so if you're in the UK you could pop in
an o2 sim card or some card they use to
make it work they're not to make another
cdma technology or cdma tablet like they
would need if they were to use it for
verizon service or sprint even in the
u.s. also last week big report is
pricing initial rumors came in the thing
is going to be around 700 bucks but
again reports are coming in this is
going to be about a thousand dollar
device so very expensive proposition
foes you
are looking to get in to the tablet
world from a business standpoint I
expect it to be probably as thin as an
iphone certainly you can sort right in
the bag and hopefully don't crack that
big old 10 or 11 inch screen I think
they'll definitely be a spell device
it's not me it'll look nice whether you
like a blur don't like Apple they have
some really good design chops I think
we're going to see a really good looking
device may not have any physical buttons
who knows as far as keyboard input
really nothing new has come up since the
last video it's been talk of obviously a
haptic feedback virtual keyboard or even
a keyboard that's sort of morphed to
your typing so buttons will actually
rise up out of the screen to give you a
little feel of little nubbins as you're
typing but again this is all of just
speculation there's been so much rumors
and things coming out there's very
little doubt that we're going to see a
tablet really the only thing left to be
seen as what tell what's going to do

few weeks away and we will get all our
