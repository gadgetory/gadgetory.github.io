Apple has always made premium phones
they've kind of had a reputation is
making kind of elitist phone because
always expensive and people tend to sort
of flaunt how much money they spent on
phones the legacy of oneplus started
with the oneplus one it was three
hundred bucks when that phone first
launched and you were getting at the
time was like a flagship device with
features that you couldn't even get on
devices that cost two and even three
times as much and it started sort of
that one plus a vision of flagship
features at a budget price we're gonna
put the newcomer in the flagship market
the oneplus 7 pro up against the
stalwart the guy who has been here for a
while the iPhone 10 are and it's a
battle of different approaches it's a
budget manufacturer making a premium
phone and a premium manufacturer making
their version of a budget phone it's a
one plus seven pro against the iPhone
ten are and like always we're gonna pick
a winner the one plus seven Pro starts
about six hundred and seventy bucks the
version we're testing is a juiced up
geeked up version for about seven
hundred fifty bucks which coincidentally
is exactly the same price as the iPhone
ten are so I've got on record in videos
in the past saying that amongst
everything in a smartphone the screen is
amongst the most important to me it's
what you're looking at I don't care
about the specs inside if the experience
of actually looking at the phone is bad
so I'm not gonna enjoy using the phone
and the story of oneplus has not been a
story of amazing screen especially it's
been decent enough 1080p panels until we
got to the 7 Pro everything about the
oneplus screen is good if you've used a
current gen Samsung phone you know what
I mean when I talk about good screens
and I've said for years and years that
Samsung makes the best display is going
the screen at one plus seven Pro comes
really close to that level
of quality its AMOLED so obviously the
blacks are super black the colors are
really vibrant it gets bright enough to
be able to see it in direct sunlight
it's got good sort of off angle
visibility and we got a 90 Hertz screen
it's hard to describe or even show you
over YouTube what that translates to but
things look really smooth then you take
your phone you kind of scroll along you
might notice jitters what you're not
gonna see on the oneplus 7 aren't any of
those jitters or the best thing I can
equate it to is if you've ever seen a
soap opera like you're home from school
sick one day and you happen to turn on
channel 4 and things look kind of
artificially smooth
that's what things look like on the 1
plus 7 Pro they look really good on this
screen and that's been an area where
oneplus has been behind in the past but
they didn't just step up their game with
the 1 plus 7 Pro they stepped it up and
then they jumped over it and then they
jumped over that and they probably went
to Samsung supply chain to get a screen
that looks amongst the best in the
business and on the Apple side of things
been talking about flagship phones the
screens on the 10s the 10s Mac's are
baller
awesome screens screens on the 10 are
good screens so we're talking about a
720p LCD screen and it's a good 720p LCD
screen even go as far as saying it's one
of the best LCD screens you can get on a
phone but even the best amateur when
standing up against the pro can't
compete the screen on the oneplus 7 pro
doesn't just beat the screen on the 10r
it kind of stands over it good layers
down like menacingly so before we keep
going hope you guys have been enjoying
the videos if you want to get notified
when new ones are coming at you hit the
subscribe button and of course that
little bell and I want to give a big
thank you to this video sponsor LastPass
so the way LastPass works you just got
to remember one presumably super secure
password for your LastPass account and
then everything is going to be stored
inside of that so there's a lot of cool
things to like about LastPass my
favorite is the auto generation of
passwords I could create like a crazy
long hexadecimal password that I
never remember myself that is secure and
that password is gonna automatically
Auto populate on my computer on my phone
I'll be stored across all those devices
in case I want to look it up there are
tears also for premium and Families it
gives you sort of more stuff like
one-to-one sharing and emergency access
it's really not a lot of money for peace
of mind and I don't mind supporting
developers that are making apps are
really useful to me and LastPass is
definitely one of those that I use every
single day in fact we have a company
LastPass account restore all the
passwords for the things that we use
here to make our videos it's nice to
have everybody have their own access if
you want to learn more about LastPass
link to them down below and again big
THANK YOU to LastPass for sponsoring
this video I don't carry a camera around
with me anymore my phone is generally
what I'm using for it every picture
taking scenario that I want and it boils
down to this we've reached kind of peak
smartphone camera where everything is
some version of really good if you want
the best camera out of these two phones
but I would still go with the iPhone 10
are it's single sensor is going to give
you incredible pictures it surprisingly
versatile Apple software does an amazing
job but not that far behind it is the
main shooter on the oneplus 7 pro and
the difference is not huge but what you
get with the 7 pro it's diversity so
you're getting that ultra wide-angle
which has been surprisingly useful
you're getting a three times optical
zoom which again don't use it all the
time nice to have now there might be a
big difference in the quality of the
sensors between that main shooter sort
of the other secondary and tertiary
lenses there but it's nice to have that
flexibility I don't use a white ink all
the time it's nice to have it when it's
there I'm not always looking to zoom in
like crazy nice to have it when it's
there
having that versatility on the rear is
really nice and if both these films
around the table I'm gonna go with one
that's gonna give me more options I'll
probably pick up the oneplus 7 pro for
the rear shooters the front camera
though is a big story with the oneplus 7
pro because it's motor
and I can't say how that motorized
camera is going to age over time or
years other than hopefully it's been
tested I don't know how it's going to do
in drop test if it gets hit or you drop
it while the camera is out it comes out
pretty quickly it looks really cool now
and it's certainly a conversation
starter the quality of the sensor though
in actual pictures takes are fine for
selfies they're not great but they're
not great on the iPhone 10 are either
but you are getting face ID with the 10
are there so front facing cameras I
don't really care I like the pop up
camera cuz it's new and different but
we're gonna keep the phone for a couple
years I'd be skeptical how well that's
going to aged so on the video front they
both do 4k 60 but you play the video
back it's going to look better every
single time on the iPhone but to credit
to the 1 plus 7 Pro and Android Lisa can
change the video settings directly from
the camera app so taking into account
all of that the the rear sensors the
front-facing camera if I had to pick one
of these to use just for cameras I'm
gonna pick up a p1 plus 7 Pro the video
is good enough the picture quality on
the main sensor is good enough but the
versatility of those extra sensors
really matter to me
so there's obviously a lot of other
features that make a phone unique like a
person not just where they look it's
what's inside that counts
and both these phones have a lot of sort
of unique intangible features the kind
of results in a tug of war one going one
way one going the other I love in screen
finger / readers they still seem like
magic to me whether they're optical in
the case of the 1 + 7 or ultrasonic like
you've got on Samsung's this is a really
fast in screen finger / reader in fact
I'd say it's even faster than what
Samsung's got on the current gen and
Galaxy S 10 I love it but on the flip
side as much as I love it
the ease of use of having face ID is
something that I would prefer to have I
don't think about having unlocked my
phone or where I got to put my finger
phone just unlocks by looking at it
that's awesome
I love face ID it works perfectly for me
or is perfectly in almost every
situation that is a huge selling point
and I think a reason alone to want to
pick up the iPhone 10 are this tug of
war continues the 1 + 7 pros got a
beastly four thousand milliamp hour
battery the iPhone 10 ours got wireless
charging the seven pros got insanely
fast warp charging the iPhone 10 ours
got ip68 water resistance rating I can't
say which feature set is going to be
important to you there are times when I
have a few minutes to charge and that
really quick charging is amazing to have
but there's also times that I'm sitting
at my desk and I want to put my phone on
a wireless charger I wish the phone's
offered everything neither does this is
a category we have to sort of figure out
which feature set is most unique to you
but both of these phones bring a really
nice and surprisingly diverse sort of
set of functions and features to their
platforms so out of all of those things
the one feature that probably surprised
me most about the oneplus 7 pro was the
aesthetics and the build quality and not
take away from what Apple's doing with
the 10r but iPhones generally always
feel good
Apple adheres to incredibly high
standards for the look feel and
aesthetics their phone and the iPhone 10
are certainly no it's
that sort of history is not necessarily
true with what we've seen from oneplus
in the past but the oneplus 7 pro looks
and feels premium from the top down but
all those aesthetics aside for a lot of
people decisions gonna come down to what
it usually comes down to two cross
shopping phones iOS or Android and if
you know that answer already and you
already know who the winner is going to
be for you this is a cheapest way to get
into a brand new iPhone and get into iOS
so for a lot of people that's a reason
enough to go for the iPhone 10 R if you
don't have any OS allegiances and you're
not sure which way you want to go you
are getting an incredible value and
feature set with the oneplus 7 pro
you're getting incredible software
you're getting really solid camera
you're getting a beautiful screen fast
charging and that list keeps going on
and on so for my money and we always
pick a winner in these verses if I was
going to plunk down 750 bucks for one of
these two phones I'm wondering the
oneplus 7 pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
