from TechnoBuffalo here with some iphone
colors you may have never seen before
we've got a red one a blue one and a
white one in the middle all three of
them have one thing in common they
started their lives as black iPhones
let's go ahead and take a look and see
how so about six months ago I unbox
these three phones which were color
converted courtesy of the folks at I
fixed direct they take your black iPhone
or your white iPhone now you can buy and
it will color convert it to a ton of
different colors including some clear
ones so I've been using them for quite a
while in fact this red one I use as my
daily phone for about four and a half
months before I switched over to
blackberry so I had a lot of experience
using it I got to know its quirks and
it's not quark just like any device that
you sort of hold every day all right so
these color conversions can be done for
just about two hundred dollars if you've
got a black iPhone you've always wanted
a white one but you didn't want to go
and now spends pay the upgrade cost to a
white iPhone or you didn't want to pay
the outright costs for a new iPhone you
can color convert it if you'd like and
if you want some colors that no one else
is gonna have the folks that I fix
direct can do that for you so let's
start with the one that I use the most
the red guy in every way it is a red
iPhone you notice so here at the home
button is a bit of a different color the
folks I fix direct and their new park
shipments actually the colors will match
here I actually liked the darker color
it's sort of stood out a little bit more
to me
and looked almost like a blood red so I
was a personal preference I decided to
keep it folks I fixed direct offered to
swap it out for me for another one but I
kind of dug it so your the phone it is
on I can see it's running iOS 5 a beta
version this is the phone that I use all
the time and everything worked the
sensor at the top works when you hold
the phone up to your head it turns off
the speaker button work to no problem
only issue I had was oftentimes I wanted
to push the home button and I really
give it a good push to make sure it
works sometimes double tapping gave me
issues but for the most part the phone
worked wonderfully the folks I've fixed
direct he really did a beautiful job
build Claudia felt outstanding these
parts felt like they came from Apple
they
not come from Apple they felt like they
came out of Cupertino slabs on looked
absolutely beautiful I got a ton of
stairs and I was out and about people
wanted to know if that was a project red
phone or not I just that as an
aftermarket color conversion but if you
want to get a lot of stares and
questions you're out in public the red
iPhone is definitely gonna do it for you
and I can absolutely recommend the folks
I fix direct with a thumbs up I've
worked with a couple other aftermarket
manufacturers that do color conversions
and know folks stood by their product or
ought to repair it as much as the folks
I fix directed so you definitely get a
product that they will stand behind red
iPhone and definitely recommend lucky
spend that much time on the white iPhone
for all intents and purposes it looks
just like a white iPhone they can pick
up at any AT&amp;amp;T Verizon or Apple store
I've got some guards in there which is
why there's that color change I don't
get the death grip from my hands it
worked it worked well it's a white
iPhone pretty much for all intents and
purposes the color conversion you could
even tell that it was color converted at
all if you hold it next to a real white
iPhone you look identical so if you've
got a black one you want to make it
white if you want to have I almost made
a bad joke there but I'm not going to do
it you can go ahead and get that done
same price $200 and everything works
wonderfully as well just like the red
one the sensor speaker phones everything
no issues at all let's talk about the
blue one this is definitely I think
probably the coolest looking phone got
turned that shiny metallic blue all the
way along the back the color conversion
job was done absolutely awesomely and
this one got a ton of attention when I
was out and about and sometimes more
than then I would like so the case here
is shiny the buttons a bit matte again
the folks at I fixed direct offered to
match their for me but I liked the way
it worked there were a bit of an issues
with these sensors not working in some
lack of reception here with the blue the
folks I fix direct the phone back fixed
it out without any problems and
everything seems to be working
beautifully right now something that's
sort of keep in mind so if you want to
get your phone color converted or if
your iPhone has been broken and you want
someone to fix it or your iPad the folks
I fix direct will do that for you links
down below they did a pretty good job
with these color converted phones it was
a lot of fun to walk around with a
multi-coloured iPhones when they were
walking
when apples are where the multicolored
iPhone so if you are an attention whore
like me you might want to consider
looking at one of these or if your phone
is broken or you broke the screen and
you want to have to get a fix anyway you
might want to just color convert it it's
kind of fun too
and we guys leave your questions down
below I am John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
