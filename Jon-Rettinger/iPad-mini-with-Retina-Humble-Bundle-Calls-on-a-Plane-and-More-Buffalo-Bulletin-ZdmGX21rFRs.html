goes on sale the xperia z1s a humble
bundle store bioshock infinite dlc and
in-flight calling it's Buffalo bulletin
time hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story i mentioned on the
show check the description for links or
click on the graphics for every story if
you have annotations available and
toggle on i'm ashley sceva here your top
stories apple's anticipated iPad Mini
with Retina went on sale this morning at
midnight pacific time with rumors
swirling about such a quiet launch
indicating possible supply shortages for
the device this holiday season it seems
like LTE models aren't quite ready to
ship yet since US carriers don't have
the cellular iPad minis in stock but
we've got one here in the office and
we've already got an unboxing up so be
sure to check it out if you're
interested in the newest iPad we've
already seen pictures and information on
the sony xperia z1f which is japan's
low-cost smaller screen version of the
flagship z1 but yesterday it looks like
Sony may have accidentally outed the
international version of that mid-range
device after an Xperia z1s popped up on
their website Xperia blog managed to
snag a screencap of the site before Sony
erased it completely from memory but for
now it looks like the z1s isn't quite
ready for prime time over in gaming
Humble Bundle continues to expand and
today they announced the humble store
instead of a regular pay what you will
bundle like we've seen the humble store
features daily sales on a ton of really
good games and ten percent of every
transaction goes to charity in its first
day of operation the humble store has
gems like orcs must die too don't starve
rogue legacy and guild wars 2 of course
because I'm obsessed with Double Fine
the second psychonaut shows up I'll buy
it again my red sign helps me work on
the road if you're BioShock Infinite fan
their first round of story-driven DLC is
available today but it's not quite the
time sink some folks we're hoping for
episode 1 of burial at sea clocks in at
around two hours in a normal
through and three hours or so if you're
really checking every nook and cranny
irrational games says its aim was
quality over quantity but at the end of
the day there should still be enough
content to justify burial at seas
fifteen dollar price tag for gamers
lastly our wild card storage week might
actually be bad news for Flyers
everywhere we all rejoice when the FAA
recommended relaxing gadget use
restrictions below 10,000 feet but now
gogo is hoping they can make in-flight
texting and calling a thing yes calling
basically the plan is to allow you to
make calls via their app and in-flight
Wi-Fi network but we all know that this
is a terrible plan that can only end in
some loudmouth call are getting shanked
with a sharpened spork that's the
Buffalo bulletin for today if you
enjoyed the show a thumbs up will be
super awesome of you and if you want
