technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
the office for mac 2011 that may play
this just to let you know that the new
office for mac is indeed available this
guy is the home and business edition
it's going to set you back just about
one hundred eighty dollars Lisa did for
me from amazon and this is going to give
you out look where this less-expensive
student version will not so you're going
to have Word PowerPoint Excel and now
outlook I've been looking for a very
robust email client wasn't that big a
fan of entourage edge of tried mail app
at right Thunder bird so I'm hoping that
outlook may actually be the answer to my
mail problems huh which sounds kind of
funny to say but I'm hoping that it's
really going to sort of solve the issue
I'll give you a furtive first look at
what the new office suite looks like so
that all the applications and show you
guys well then I think it's worth the
upgrade from the older version which was
2008 so I hope you guys are going to
pick this up or not but figured I just
go ahead and use all sappy here and open
it up as you can see what sort of comes
in it and before I do that you can take
a look at differences between the home
and student versions and what you're
going to get so both versions are going
to get you word powerpoint excel
difference here is going to be outlook
and technical support you're going to
get three months or 90 days with home
and students and you're going to get a
year with the 2011 version you also get
access to sort of all their web apps now
so you can access Word PowerPoint Excel
or set stuff sort of online as well as
access to remote desktop for mac to and
messenger for mac age if you guys use
msn messenger let's go ahead and just
break this classic here I assume it's
just going to be a disc start are you
guys excited about this I've never been
the biggest fan of the iwork suite of
applications just as far as
cross-platform compatibility of running
through a lot of problems I think having
sort of office suites as a necessary
evil for a Mac user go ahead and pull us
out here and it's just a disc that's
about it pulls off the side make sure I
don't flashing serial numbers here but
pretty much however you want to get is
just a disc and that's about it office
for mac and we guys want to know what
you want to think about officer
where you can get it not get it are you
waiting to see my thoughts and opinions
on it which will be coming very soon i'm
jon rettinger TechnoBuffalo see the next
