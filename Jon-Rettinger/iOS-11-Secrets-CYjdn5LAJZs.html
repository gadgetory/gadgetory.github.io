want to thank car packs from anchor the
latest cases for keeping your Apple
devices safe scratch free and and not
cracked so if you're an Apple user by
now you've probably had a chance to take
a look at i/o s11 maybe got it on your
shiny new iPhone 8 or A+ or perhaps
you're holding out for the home button
list iPhone 10 as you guys start to
learn how to use iOS love and a lot of
things are very familiar but ton of
things have changed and they've added a
lot of tricks inside of iOS 11 you might
not know about so to help you learn how
to supercharge your Apple device here
are 11 tips for iOS love it
alright so number one you can move
multiple icons at once this one's pretty
useful if you want to rearrange home
screens you want to move multiple apps
that having to go back and forth with
your finger and it's pretty easy to do
so long press and put it in to wiggle
mode tap one icon and then while you're
still holding downs tap another one and
it's gonna loop them together you can
move icons wherever you want to go the
next step might be one you didn't even
know about especially if you restored
your phone or iOS device from a previous
backup auto-brightness is gone in
display settings it's on by default but
if you want to turn it off
Apple surprisingly hit it says what
you've got to do if you want to turn
that off you got to go to general get
accessibility display accommodation and
you'll see the toggle is on by default
you want to turn that off that's where
you can do it so I was Elevens got some
bugs in it you might want to do a soft
reset and it's pretty easy to do on
older iOS devices but he's got an iPhone
8 8 plus or an iPhone 10 there's a few
more steps to do so here's what you have
to do you hit the volume button up real
fast the volume down real fast and then
immediately press the power button
you'll see the Apple logo pop up and
your phone will be back to normal in
just a few seconds so the next one you
might find is surprisingly useful there
are some new features built into the
camera the first one it can now read QR
codes it's probably should have done a
while ago no longer need a third-party
apps put a QR code when you're in your
camera app and automatically recognize
that read it and take the appropriate
action there's also some good things you
can do with live photos it's pretty easy
so just go to your gallery take any
picture you've got it's got a live photo
in it
to wipe up you see you can pick a loop
bounce long-exposure
kind of makes it effects a little bit
neater you can customize them for
whatever you want to have to get
scanning documents can be useful and I
used to have to use a third party app to
do it scanner plus was my go-to but no
more it has now built into the Notes app
on iOS 11 go ahead open that up hit the
plus button in a document right from
there so this next one is pretty useful
we find yourself on group text and
someone never stops messaging no matter
what you can turn off the words just for
certain threads if you want if you do it
in a few different ways so in the main
messages app you can just swipe to the
left and you could hit hide alerts or if
you're in the thread a pregnant corner
at the eye and hide alerts there as well
the next control center obviously got a
gigantic overhaul in iOS 11 but you can
customize what's going to show up there
and Apple give you a ton of options for
what you want to do so if you want to do
that go to settings control center turn
off toggles turn on toggles to your
heart's content and as a bonus if you go
into control center by swiping up from
the bottom and you do a 3d touch press
on any of those icons deletes a lot of
them you can customize it flashlight for
example you can change the intensity of
the light you find a lot of other
settings if you do that for the other
icons so I've been really impressed that
apples done with storage and a big
reason that I'm using whele storage and
before they've got a new file format for
photos teeth we're a gif they did away
with JPEGs and if you want to bring back
JPEGs you can do it but there is a bit
of a caveat here got an iPhone 8 or a
plus or even an iPhone 10 if you turn
this off you're not gonna be able to do
4k is 60 frames per second or 1080p at
240 frames per second so be warned but
here's how you can do it go to settings
camera formats and just flip the switch
over to most compatible and you are jpg
to heart's content and you should know
that if we turn that off because Google
photos wasn't backing up Apple's new
formats you can turn it back on again
now because Google photos now supports
Apple's new a gif format so if you're
keeping track this is number 9 alpha
made it really
need to share Wi-Fi passwords what that
means if you're connected to Wi-Fi
networking somebody comes to your house
your office they don't have the password
you forgot it I just don't want to tell
them what it is you can share it with
them pretty easily caveat though they
have to be in your contacts if the
person that is in your contacts brings
your phone close to yours a little
message will pop up on your screen if
you want to share their password just
automatically connect their phone to
network but having them to know that
your password is is 1 2 3 4 change your
password and the number 10 about someone
handed keyboard action so if you're in
any app that requires the keyboard
either hit the emoji icon next to the
space bar or if you got a couple
keyboards in it or look like a globe
hold that down you can swipe left to
right to get the keyboard left or right
oriented so depending if your left or
right handed it makes typing wait user
last but not least you can scream record
now when I was 11 maybe I heard about it
maybe you're looking at your control
center wondering where the heck it is so
you got to go back to a previous tip you
got to add it to control center so again
go to settings control center flip that
switch then we swipe up you'll get a new
icon that looks like two circles push it
you can record your screen and no video
you're gonna get a red bar at the top
letting you know that it's recording but
you can do it now that it's surprisingly
useful so I want to thank card packs
from anchor for making this video
possible you're probably thinking anchor
makes batteries they got a new line of
cases out into the car packs name that
are pretty awesome so first they'll work
with wireless charging that was a big
concern of mine they will protect your
device as well so you've got really nice
easy cutouts to access a profile
switcher the buttons are protected you
got cutouts on the bottom for your
speakers and your lightning port you got
some carbon fiber trims the phone will
be safe it's really durable and if you
pretend to drop your phone when you want
to keep your investment safe look no
farther then gara packs from anchored if
you want to check one out we'll link to
it down in my pants location which is a
gross way of saying down below so there
are some tricks to supercharge your iOS
11 device this list we compiled it was
like 30 plus long there's a ton of stuff
we could have picked but if there's one
that we've left out do you think it's
surprisingly useful leave in the
comments and share it other people can
use it and get their iPhones or iPads
running a
bit more smoothly hope you guys enjoyed
the video thumbs up we appreciate it
till next time I'm John Ranger
