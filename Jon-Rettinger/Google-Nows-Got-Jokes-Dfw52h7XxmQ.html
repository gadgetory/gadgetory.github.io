from TechnoBuffalo we all know digital
assistants are good for things like
checking the weather sports scores
making appointments but they're also a
lighter side they got a bit of
personality last week we did a video on
jokes and songs here you can tell I
thought we'd follow that one up with
what Google now has in store so we show
you some fun things going out can do and
I apologize in advance for probably
setting off all of your phones but if
using Android on the upside you can
follow along yourself ok Google what is
the Fox a hottie hottie hottie home so
that's oh it's cool but that is with
foxes
this one's broke my favorite Google's
got an accent ok Google beam me up
Scottie I can't do it Cap'n I do not
have the power should you not have the
power I just gotta do it
I then suppose a break of the tongue
twisters ok Google how much wood could a
woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
chuck wood a woodchuck could chuck as
much wood as a woodchuck would chuck if
a woodchuck could chuck wood which is a
lot of chucking wood chuck you let's get
a little melancholy for a minute ok
Google what is the loneliest number the
loneliest number is one it's true
there's a little more visual but ok
Google do a barrel roll
did a barrel roll you know a little
hungry making videos kind of worked up
an appetite
okay Google make me a sandwich what make
it yourself that's not funny
and last and probably not least okay
Google
who are you searching for oneself can
take a lifetime but a good place to
start is classic rock classic rock he's
a good place to start we could all try
and find ourselves

have to do again anything else you guys
