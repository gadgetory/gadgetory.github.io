you guys a walk through this time around
of my dual screen monitor set up and
show you guys how to do it and explain
to you what some of the cool features
are pretty simple one thing to notice
I'm obviously using a MacBook Pro to do
this with the DVI port you can do
exactly the same thing with a macbook
that has a mini DVI port so do this all
you need is a mini DVI to DVI adapter I
think it's something like 20 bucks from
the Apple store so pretty inexpensive
and do this with a macbook also one
other thing guys if you want to check
out some other cool reviews one of the
guys who frequently posts on my my main
page his name is echo fish that's II
CKO fi SH he's in my subscriptions has
some great videos also he's just
starting up and needs your support and
he's great with answering questions too
if I don't know something and ask him a
post over there and seen the two of us
one of us should be able to get your
questions answered anyway anyway guys
enjoy any questions let me know
thanks for watching and thank you guys
for subscribing bye guys let's get
started
hopefully you can see the screens here I
can't really zoom in anymore with my
camera and get them both in the picture
but let me do with what we got first
thing I've got the Mac plugged into the
monitor with standard deviation which is
on the right side the MacBook Pro right
here no adapter anything necessary I
just plugged it in plugged in the back
of the monitor and one cool thing the
monitor came with a whole bunch of
drivers for Windows this and that I just
plugged it in with the Mac and it
recognized it immediately which is very
cool so once you get your monitor
plugged in you have a couple different
options if you go down to system
preferences and click on displays pulls
up whole bunch of different options now
if you look here I've got a main option
here with display or any even color on
the other monitor it pulls up resolution
so it actually knows already that you
have two monitors and pulls up settings
for each on on separate screens
just very cool so resolutions for one
color for one and color for the other
that's independent so on display you can
set the resolution for your monitor this
one here is 1680 by 1050 it
automatically recognizes that and then
you click on arrangement and here's
where you can select which monitor you
want to be a primary you have to picture
if you can drag them anywhere you want
to make it the way you want it to look
and this little white bar across the top
is this main toolbar wherever you drag
that is your main monitor so you can
move it either way and you also have an
option to to mirror the images as well
so have the same thing shown on both so
that's how you get your dual monitors
working and now I have a setup pretty
much as one giant monitor if you look I
can move that over and it's being
treated now is just one big monitor
which is very nice great for things like
you know browsing the web or doing some
programming and opening up iTunes for
example you know I can have iTunes open
and playing right here open and playing
well I am you know doing something else
and still be able to see the whole
window which is really nice but I've
recently discovered the world of world
of torrents and such so I've been using
parallel a little bit more kinda want to
take a chance damaging or getting a
virus on the Mac which I know it's next
impossible to do but I didn't want to
risk it so this setup is actually very
cool for parallels something I want to
show you so I'll open up parallels and
this will only work with virtualization
software it won't you just will to do
this with with boot camp so let me turn
it on for you and show you guys
something I think is pretty cool
you're second to load still strangest
thing Windows XP on the Mac but you know
if it works by the way if anybody's in
the market for a monitor I picked up the
22 inch HP w2 207 it's a glossy
widescreen monitor and it's awesome I
really like it
I've got two USB ports which are really
handy so something if you guys are in
the market alright so now I've got
parallel up and running if I move
parallels over to my secondary window
right here and I make it full screen by
hitting alt enter rotate now I've got
windows full screen here and my OS 10
full screen so I can use them both at
the same time and have two full screens
which is really cool man it's like
having two separate computers running at
once even though this is full screen I
can still use that window if I need I
can still drag stuff over if necessary
but it makes life life easier for for
doing anything you need to do in in
Windows whether it's torrents or
Microsoft Office or anything you're
doing it's just very handy maybe this
has been a kind of a real quick overview
of the dual monitor setup on the Mac and
honestly guys I set this whole thing up
took three minutes and most of that was
plugging it in to the outlet Macintosh
and Apple in particular makes it really
easy to do you know what I was shocked
with my PC it took forever to get things
set up so my guys that's a dual monitor
like I said kind of conclusion you can
set it up to be two separate two
separate monitors you know if you use
independently which is kind of what I
have now have a treat as one big monitor
if you like or have it be mirrored and
show the same image now also now with
let me close parallels here for you guys
I know some people one might want to use
your computer and clamshell mode and
still
still use the monitor so that's
something I will show you guys here let
me just quit out of parallel shutdown at
all and with two monitors you can also
use a clamshell mode meeting keep your
laptop closed and use your external
display as your primary only monitor
something that you can you can do and do
it very easily I am going to show you
how to do that right now all you do take
your computer close it
turn it on like normal close it up it's
gonna go to sleep
I can normally would alright so the
computer is essentially asleep now which
means to turn the monitor off monitors
going to sleep as you can see so to wake
it up actually you can just push a
button any button on the keyboard give
it a second will wake up
no calibrate the monitor and there you
go now I've got my computer working
clamshell mode with the only one monitor
nice immunity so there's another another
option for you guys with the computer
closed it doesn't get any hotter than it
did with an open like normal so say is a
pretty similar temperature of about 140
degrees Fahrenheit I don't know what
that is for Celsius for you European
folk and Canadian but it stays the same
temperature I know guys it's just a real
quick overview of the monitors dual
monitor system give any questions feel
