TechnoBuffalo here it seems like
everything is getting smart nowadays
there's even a smart toaster on the
market one of the things you've probably
been using for years I've ever really
thought that much about was doorbell you
push it it makes noise in your house and
you either answer it at your home or you
look to the people and you don't want to
answer it and you go about your business
the folks are ringing that we're trying
to change how you perceive doorbells and
they are the first with a smart doorbell
if you guys don't know here
TechnoBuffalo we were actually robbed
about three years ago so I'm broken to
our office and completely cleaned us out
so the security has been a really big
thing for us so when I first heard about
ring at CES actually last year I was
kind of excited about it so the concept
is really simple and very elegant it's a
video doorbell that I'll notify you
anywhere in the world no matter where
you are if someone's at your door and
beyond that it'll record in the cloud
and you can also have a conversation
with them so if someone's there maybe
getting out of shower you could tell
them exactly what you want tell them to
wait time to bake the package or
whatever it might be but beyond that
it's also almost security camera outside
of your house if you guys don't know a
lot of robbery to their home or office
the perpetrator actually ring the
doorbell first to see if somebody comes
to the door in this case you would
actually know who was there so our
office now is locked down like Fort Knox
and the ring is our first line of
protection outside before anybody even
has a chance to get inside of our office
and I'm a selling one actually at my
house as well the ring cost about 200
bucks and available in four colors to
match our kind of decoration you've got
at your home or office couple cool
things about it its dual powered so that
means you keep them just wired in
directly to the wires on your existing
doorbell which is really easy to do it
comes with all the included accessories
including for piyah Terry screws
even as caulking to fill holes they make
everything really simple or a fifty two
hundred million power battery built in
you just charged and is rated for a year
so even if you don't want to deal with
plugging in wires put this thing up and
charge it almost every year one of the
concerns I had with the two is I'm
spending $20 for a doorbell I want to
make sure it's not gonna get stolen the
company actually backs it so if it does
get someone comes a lifetime warranty
they will replace it for you the screws
out to remove it our toy proprietary and
first I don't understand why but then
on me why a robber someone's not gonna
have that crazy little screwdriver to
actually get that thing off the wall so
I really like that you can send
notifications kind of a ton of different
ways either do by motion or ring you can
control the motion in the app you can
determine how far you want the motion to
go out to make sure you know the patient
anywhere or just you only want to get
notified never so it actually pushes a
physical doorbell it'll ring right
through to your iOS or Android device
choose to accept it or decline it and
you can see who's there you even change
the angle of the camera or how wide it's
gonna go to fisheye so you can pretty
much see everything so that was a lot of
me talking about doorbell the best thing
I can do is actually show you how it
works let me show you how that ring
doorbell works
hello do you have my package thanks like
I'm legit so the app is free and
available for iOS and Android setup is
really simple from having nothing to
complete said I've been working to that
four minute process really simple so you
can see how your different devices if
you have one at home or the office you
can set a recent activity see who's been
missed calls or accepted calls let me go
ahead and just select one I'll show what
that looks like you go back in time and
you can see who was there
I'm demonstrating this on Android the
iOS app though is almost identical so
you go ahead at the upper left hand
corner you can see your device's where
you're located you can see your plan if
you want to sign up for cloud storage or
not I'm gonna go ahead and select my
devices at the office and he ever got
recent activity device settings motion
settings users or link to chimes I like
you could have multiple devices signed
in as well as along with another
password so you know if you your wife
your girlfriend coworker someone can
always be there to receive this and
again it'll work anywhere in the world
the you are as long as you have internet
connection if you jump into motion
settings this is where I things get
really cool so you can see your zones
and range and determine how far or
shallow you want it to notify you we've
got our set pretty shallow cuz we've to
the hallway a lot of people walked by
but if you're at a house and you want to
know whenever anybody comes close it
will let you know I mean I really like
this isn't something that I ever thought
of this isn't something I ever thought
that I would need but now that I've got
at the office it's really changed how we
do things here we get packages delivered
all the time
I like pina what's always knowing
something's getting delivered if we're
not here fallouts lunch or maybe
something comes on the weekend in my
home my office there are obviously
things that I want to keep safe both
people and things and the ring at least
for me is that first step it's more of a
deterrent anybody's gonna come in they
know before they get to that door they
are on camera I can talk to them if I
sees anybody walk in front Akai tell
them to get away or if someone's leaving
a package here and I you know can't get
the door dance rack they just tell them
hey you know I'm in the bathroom I might
be using my phone well I'm sitting down
leave the package and I'll come and get
it later
the price isn't exorbitant like 200
bucks I've really been enjoying using it
and also makes me feel better and sleep
better at night you know
extra head of security and what do you
guys think something you would use not
usually want to hear your thoughts on it
things are getting smart what's the next
thing you want to see smart and up
leaving the comments down below the next
time the John Ranger see you guys next
video go bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
