Galaxy s8 in the galaxy si plus review
has been tough this is actually about
the fifteenth take I've done I wasn't
quite sure what to say I went back and
forth on saying they have the weight of
the company on its shoulders since the
note 7s Fiasco is it more than just a
marketing hype of a floating whale but
it boils down to this the Galaxy s8 at
least on paper and in your hand looks to
be an incredible phone but how was in a
real world usage I didn't just test this
phone in the office and take pictures of
things I set up I took this phone out in
the real world and use it the way I use
a phone to the park with my kids to Home
Depot to buy stuff I need it for my new
home and throughout the courses review
I'm gonna answer the question that
hopefully you guys have on your minds is
it worth your money should you buy it
and did I end up picking one up I'm John
written drew from TechnoBuffalo this is
our review of the galaxy s 8 and the
galaxy s 8
so let me get some of the details out of
the way I use this phone for ten days
and I use both the s8 and the s8 plus
they go through the review I'm gonna
just say s8
the only differences between these two
phones aside for about a hundred bucks
and price is little bigger screen size
an extra 500 milliamps on the back all
phones nowadays kind of look the same
they're different variants of the
rectangle so had a chance to first pick
up a Galaxy s8 it struck me for its
design and that's a hard thing to do
nowadays the big story with the SI
discrete that's what Samsung's touting
the marketing machine came up the
terminal finita display and if you can
familiar with Samsung displays in the
past you probably know it's gonna look
really good and a holy crap is this
display look incredible and if it seems
like I am overly excited about it it's
because I am legitimately overly excited
about this play this is what I use all
the time what you use all the time how
you interact with your phone it's gotta
be good and man does it look really good
even mundane things like checking emails
and sending SMS look awesome and are
kind of fun to do because things look so
crisp that's even with the resolution
scaled down to a little bit better than
1080 versus a qHD that's capable of just
for comparison purposes it's got 36%
more screen real estate than we saw on
the galaxy s7 and the galaxy s 8 plus 6
point 3 inch screen size almost the
exact same footprint as the iPhone 7
plus so you are getting a ton of screen
real estate you're also getting some new
design cues you've got rounded corners
you've got now the edge display that's
on the standard models but it's a much
less subtle I just what we've got on the
galaxy s7
the mbola tech Samsung's had in the past
is here they've added mobile HDR which
looks nice I didn't test that much
mobile HTR I did watch them netflix
content looks marginally better but the
story for me and how the screen is
better than previous generations is in
direct sunlight that has been the
Achilles heel of almost every smartphone
and I'm a dad I take my phone out take
pictures of my kids at the parks and I
want to be able to see what the screens
gonna look like so I can get that
perfect shot if you take the brightness
and push it all up 200% you're gonna get
all 1000 nits of brightness coming out
of this thing now if you can feel the
phone getting super warm when you're
pushing that much brightness you can
actually see the display in direct
sunlight which is really rare and also
really refreshing to see the other stuff
you'd expect from the screens looked
good certainly do games and video look
absolutely beautiful they do have the
curved display here so holding it kind
of be tricky often times I was launching
the edge panel so they're trying to hold
the sides and for playing games your
right hand is certainly gonna cover the
single downwards facing speakers so you
got to figure out how to hold your hand
properly to get real audio to come out
when playing game is your even watching
video and while the screen is beautiful
perhaps the most surprising thing about
the Galaxy s8 is Samsung finally laid
the smackdown on carriers and there's
not a tramp stamp to be found on any of
these I'm looking at you
Verizon in your check mark you like to
put over home buttons and speaking of
home buttons you are not gonna find a
physical one here on the galaxy s 8
because of all that screen real estate
Samsung made the home button in the
screen itself
it's kind of like a force touch 3d touch
type thing it's a touch panel all the
way across the bottom you can push it
all the way and get a bit of haptic
feedback and you can go home
it also means for playing a full screen
game or watching a full screen video you
can sort of push hard on that screen
you'll be able to go home instead of
just tapping on screen buttons come up
and then hit the home button again
perhaps the biggest downside of the
phone is removing that physical home
button meant and I meant moving the
fingerprint reader to the back of the
phone and oh what a horrible choice for
an otherwise really awesome phone they
put it oddly
directly next to the camera sensor and
because you don't have any humps anymore
on this camera sensor when you're using
the phone looking at the screen your
finger doesn't really know where to go
to hit that
your print reader which means your
camera sensor is going to fingerprints
all over it I wish you would have put
that somewhere else and I kind of think
Samsung knew then they give you a ton of
other ways to unlock your phone
things like iris scanner for the note 7
are here and it works well especially
works well in dark environments it works
through sunglasses but if you in direct
sunlight it's not gonna work so well for
you
Samsung brought back something that used
to be on old Android devices and tried
to improve it with facial recognition it
works a little bit slow for my tastes
and it can be fooled with some pictures
so it's not the most secure buy found
another way to unlock your phone it's
there so in typical reviews after I talk
about the screen I'll jump into build
and it's kind of hard to do that the SI
it because the screen pretty much is the
build and I will say this the phone
feels really nice in the hand despite it
being so thin I don't feel like I'm
going to drop it and also for someone
who's been using an iPhone 7 plus in the
past I really appreciate how thin the
phone is in my pants I don't have bone
bulge in my jeans I didn't do any drop
tests on it but it is coated front and
back with Gorilla Glass 5 so presumably
be able to survive those drops and
everybody will come in my 10 days of
testing haven't noticed any scratches
but man is it a smudge machine I've got
the black version and my fingerprints
are everywhere it's not like I just ate
like McDonald's fries and picked up the
phone I washed my hands like a normal
Clemen being and it still looks kind of
gross in the back the aspect ratio is
also changed with the screen getting
bigger in fact the galaxy si+ fits into
almost exactly the same footprint as an
iPhone 7 plus so that means your
experience at the phone is a little bit
different it's tall and thin it's more
Giselle and less like Jack Black you're
gonna be able to see a lot more content
on the screen but it also means you're
gonna have to really stretch your thumb
to get to the top to put the
notification tray the Samsung lets you
do things like you use a fingerprint
reader to swipe down to bring that down
but again it's hard to reach the
fingerprint reader with the Galaxy S a
plus and it's hard to find it on either
phones the virtual assistant world is
pretty saturated right now but Samsung
thought there was room for one more so
enter Bixby the only Ricky interaction
you're gonna have a Bixby probably at
launch you can accidentally press the
dedicated Bigsby button when you're
trying to push volume down and if you do
push that you're gonna get hello Bixby
which is gonna look very similar to
Google now of information at rating
birds victory visions also here kind of
gives you an augmented reality
information on books wine or products I
tried to test it out at Home Depot
excited by a showerhead and it did not
work or very well for me but the big
selling point of Bixby is that you can
control anything you can with your
finger with your voice that also is not
working as of launch date so
Bixby's kind of half-baked right now so
Samsung software's a tough one to talk
about
I've been let's just say less than kind
in the past about samsung GUI and I
think a lot of you guys have been less
than kind and as soon as you bought a
Galaxy S whatever the first thing he did
was down a little launcher ever since I
think the galaxy s6 Samsung has been
getting way better in fact I'm gonna go
on record of saying this I love what
Samsung did with their Android software
you can quote me on it and take it to
the bank use it for five or six days and
I think you're gonna agree with me it
took a lot of really nice things from
stock Android and added a ton of other
features on top of it that get out of
their way they're not layer on layer on
layer stuff you have to relearn how to
use your operating system they're nice
improvements you get the things you like
from the pixel on check to swipe up to
get your app drawer you also get a lot
of other improvements as well you can
swipe down for example to also get your
app drawer you've got an improved
notification tray we've got a tweaked
and redefined setting I really like
being able to swipe my hand over the
screen to take screenshots you've got
edge panels if it's ton of information
to swipe away what Samsung's done in the
software is surprisingly make it more
elegant without making it more
cumbersome and as critical as I've been
in years past I think I gotta give
credit where credit is due in a preview
like me you're not sold on VIX Piett
Google assistant also is shipping with
the Galaxy S II and perhaps the best
software feature and for me I think a
reason to consider the Galaxy s8 a
really most modern Samsung phones is
Samsung pay so it works like Apple pay
or Android pay can use NFC payments but
also will put out a magnetic field for
anywhere you would swipe a card you can
hold your phone right next to it and it
works really well then you could pretty
much do Samsung pay anywhere credit card
is
when the essay was announced it said it
was gonna be the same camera sensor as a
note 7 in the a7 I was a little bit
disappointed to the new phone and I
wanted something new just because new
turns out that was a bit unfounded
because the camera in the s8 is still
really good the 12 megapixel sensor with
some software improvements over last gen
and the shots look awesome things do
look a little bit overexposed so they
can be tweaking settings but I still
like the brightness of it and I wanted
to test the camera like I legitimately
use a phone every day so took my kid out
to the park I was able to get pictures
of him running which is really hard to
do for fast motion and normal noontime
sunlight pictures with absolute
incredible low-light also looks really
good the video quality also looks
awesome you can set all the way up to
take 4k video you get if you don't have
a micro SD card a 10-minute cap on 4k
but here you go here's a video of my son
going down a slide in 4k just as a fun
sized story he was terrified to go down
that slide like four days ago and he
just got super brave and and went down
so while the rear camera didn't get much
the way of improvements the front-facing
cameras did it's 8 megapixel and it now
has autofocus which is something I guess
we moved down a further facing camera so
we want to take your selfies it works
really well and also new the cameras I
guess everybody is taking cues from
snapchat you've got filters built right
in the camera boils down to this
Samsung's throwing around a ton of
marketing talk about the cameras things
like multi frame image processing
pictures look really good look great in
almost any situation in fact when
compared to things like the pixel or the
iPhone 7 plus this stands on its own if
it's not the best phone camera out there
it's certainly in the running and
deserves to be in that conversation the
estate's got a 3,000 million power
battery si plus has a 3500 and in my
battery test I was mostly using the S
Plus and I was able to get through a
full day of testing and my usage might
vary from yours but I wirelessly charge
it overnight 100% when I wake up around
7:30 in the morning I am taking a lot of
pictures like ultimate dad it didn't
land number of pictures I'm watching a
ton of YouTube videos thinking about
hour and a half two hours of phone calls
playing some games when I probably
should be working and by end of the day
without changing any set
my brightness set to about 75% usually
I'm about 10 to 15% battery life left
but those figures are only if you don't
have any power saving modes on Samsung
offers two different ones there's a
midden to max and turning on the make
and turn about 20% of battery life until
like 8 to 10 hours so you can really get
through 2 or 3 days if you need just
beware those settings are there usually
my phone reviews have a performance
category but that's almost a moot point
now with modern phone so fast
that's performance but I've got some
intangibles I had the most fun putting
together notes for this part of the
review because there's a lot here let's
start with the big one IP 68 same
waterproof ich miss we saw on the s7 the
note 7 you could take it in the shower
with you if you're inclined to do so for
reasons I'm not gonna talk about
headphone jack it's here and it's gonna
be shipping with $99 equivalent AKG
headphones which I guess to my untrained
ear sound like any other hear buds that
come bundled with phones but it's there
you can plug your headphones with it and
have to just use bluetooth if you
couldn't tell I really liked the galaxy
s 8 and I asked the questions the
beginning what did i do did I buy one
and I did I caved I really like the
Galaxy S a I ordered a galaxy s 8 plus
in black in fact maybe the only knock I
have on the phone as I have from price
and a really poor place from the
fingerprint reader is the colors I wish
the u.s. got the gold and the blue like
we had with the last gen phones but alas
they ain't here I wasn't a fan of the
silver of the grey so I went fingerprint
smudgy black the phone looks really
sleek I've had it into my own phone now
for about three days I don't think I'm
looking back I like the way the phone
performs I like the way it feels and the
best endorsement that I can give for a
phone is to actually buy one myself my
own money behind it use it as my daily
driver and the galaxy s 8 plus it's
gonna be the phones in my pocket for the
foreseeable future but that's just my
opinion
what do you guys think about the Galaxy
s8 in the si+ is it the phone you've
been waiting for you disappointed let me
know your reasons down below in the
comments looks legitimate have a
discussion about the technology that's
in is the latest from Samsung
I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you
like the cinematography credit goes to
Nate Andrew takes no credit for this one
please give the video a thumbs up we
certainly appreciate it until next time
I'm John render from techno bow
