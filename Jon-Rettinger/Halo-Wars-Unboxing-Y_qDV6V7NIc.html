unboxing for you of halo watch the Xbox
360
I am fully awarded this is just a video
game box and not that exciting so this
is not John reckoned you're the tech
reviewer hoping this this is just John
Ranger dude who really liked demo this
game is excited to play it so I'm just a
fan of the game I thought it'd be fun to
unbox you know maybe maybe now I'll try
and make it interesting for you guys if
you have any interest in the game check
it out if you don't I won't be offended
so let's go ahead and bust this thing
open
first throws you guys don't know Halo
Wars Penev is a take on the Halo games
for the Xbox except this one one is an R
was it called RTS realtime strategy it's
like the old StarCraft II game or the
original Warcraft game before world of
when you gotta control armies and send
em in different directions and their
powers and stuff take control the Halo
universe so the year is 25 31 20 years
prior to the events of halo combat
Evolved that's the first Halo for the
original Xbox and the Covenant have
found something on the planet harvest
the UNSC ship spirit of fire time to
investigate whatever the enemy is up to
what the crew finds could only be the
thing that stands between humanity and
certain annihilation by the Covenant so
that's probably overly dramatic just a
fun game the demo was really awesome so
I'm pretty excited to check this out so
let's go ahead and open it up I am first
time I've ever pre-ordered a game I did
it from Best Buy and I gave me a code
for some sort of fancy warthog which is
a car in the game some logo on it I
obviously have to open it yet so don't
know what it does but I will let you
know so plastic on it is clear and just
can open it up they pack these things
like CD is to take a you know rocket
science to open them up I really want to
make sure people aren't going on the
store opening these things up and
stealing them do not sell before three
three oh nine that's today
although Europe
chili and some other countries got this
earlier so we got inside I think that
says top accessory is really
high-quality car Mart there's a book
it's a book tells you about the game and
how to do some what-have-you with it
here's a disc it's just it is halo wars
is nothing on the back anyway I don't
wanna make this that long cuz I don't
have that much time to play it and I
really want to get it going so just a
real quick unboxing of Halo Wars for the
Xbox 360 hope you guys enjoy it I will
see you in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
