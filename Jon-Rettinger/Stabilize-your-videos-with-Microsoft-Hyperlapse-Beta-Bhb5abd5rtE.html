to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a Martin sang it from TechnoBuffalo
and today we'll be taking a look at
Microsoft's latest mobile app hyperlapse
not to be confused with instagrams very
own hyperlapse for iOS Microsoft's new
app is currently available for Android
and beta for select devices including
the note 4 the Nexus 6 LG g3 and Moto X
just to name a few it's also available
for select Windows Phone devices like
the Lumia 1520 eight thirty nine thirty
and six thirty Microsoft first announced
its hyperlapse video technology a couple
of weeks before Instagram launched
hyperlapse for iOS last year Microsoft's
Tech essentially helps smooth out videos
and also process videos for time-lapse
what Microsoft is doing with hyperlapse
is using software algorithms to
stabilize the footage and identify
common points from frame to frame
instead of using gyroscope or
accelerometer data from a phone which is
what instagrams hyperlapse does let's go
ahead and check out what Microsoft
solution has to offer the mobile version
of hyperlapse is slightly less
sophisticated than Microsoft's desktop
app called hyperlapse Pro but the
interface is pretty straightforward
launching the app you're greeted with
two options to choose from record a new
video or import an existing video
tapping the record button from the main
menu were then greeted with three
buttons record flash and a button to
switch to the front-facing camera to
create a selfie lapse we recorded a few
different videos using our Galaxy Note 4
and came out somewhat disappointed by
the final product keyword somewhat the
footage wasn't as stable as we expected
it to be and I could definitely see some
jello effects showing up when we
exported Eclipse at 4 X 8 X + 1 X
however speeding it up to 16 X or 32 X
the footage became more stable and more
easier to watch now we didn't stop there
we were curious whether it was a slower
speeds that we're causing the jello
effect or if it was the app we recorded
regular 1080p footage using a no force
camera and here's what we saw as you can
see the 1080p footage shot directly onto
our note 4 is much smoother compared to
Microsoft hyperlapse app whether we shot
directly using the app or exported same
speed the note 4 stock video was
definitely smoother when we switch to
the front-facing camera we noticed the
same issue at lower speeds a bit bumpy
with the same jello effect we saw using
the rear-facing camera however we got
better results at higher speeds from 8x
all the way up to 32x
the video real fast and thank our
friends over at domain.com it's the
place to go when the next great idea
hits you so one-stop shopping for all
your domain names and web hosting email
needs don't may want to hook our fans up
with a pretty cool offer save 20% on
domain names and web hosting if you use
the coupon code TechnoBuffalo it's all
one word in caps at domain comms check
out alas if you want to smoother video
on Android Microsoft hyperlapse doesn't
do the best job of stabilizing at
regular speeds however if you're looking
to achieve smoother time lapses we found
that Microsoft hyperlapse app does a
pretty good job the app is still in beta
so we could see improvements in a future
which means what you're seeing now might
not be indicative of the final product
if you guys want to join the beta
program we'll have a link below for you
guys to join as well as a link to our
article to see which devices are
currently supported before we end this
video we thought we'd do a quick
comparison between instagrams hyperlapse
vs. Microsoft hyperlapse just to see
which platform offers better
stabilization after shooting a few
videos we think that instagrams
hyperlapse is much more stable compared
to Microsoft's even at lower speeds like
6x Instagram solution is much smoother
again Microsoft hyperlapse is still in
its beta form so we could see
improvements in the future but as it
stands it still needs a lot of work
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
