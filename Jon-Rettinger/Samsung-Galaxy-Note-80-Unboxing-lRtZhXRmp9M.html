TechnoBuffalo today we're checking out
the Galaxy Note 8.0 from Samsung quick
look at the box you can see we've got
the Wi-Fi 16 gig model go around the
back eight inch display 5 megapixel
camera you can see it's got the smart
control with the IR blaster a quad-core
processor clocked at 1.6 gigahertz 2
gigs of RAM and that's expandable
storage and 4600 milliamp hour battery
let's get in to the device itself now
here you can see the main home screen
and the back that's an 8 inch display
like I just said and you've got a 1280
by 800 pixel resolution so we'll take
off that plastic it's not very
attractive you see it looks like an
oversized Galaxy Note and in the same
spot you've got the s-pen with the
device as well go around the back
there's the 5 megapixel camera you can
see it's telling us to put the micro SD
card right there and the S Pen goes
right back into that slot on the bottom
micro USB charging and the speaker's up
top you've got your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack let's go through the box
itself pretty simple we've got the Quick
Start Guide got the power cable and the
wall wart there let's get the device
booted and I'll show you a quick look at
it alright now for the sake of time here
I know a lot of people like to see how
long it takes for the device to boot so
I'll do that for you
see the buttons here glow just like on
the other one will say English yes turn
on Wi-Fi let's skip this from now let's
skip all this so you can see the home
screen will say no for now not now
location who it belongs to but wha
Dropbox you have freed 50 gigs for two
years I'm gonna skip that for now and
finish alright so pretty basic here
we've seen this before its TouchWiz
running on top of jellybean though I
believe it's 4.1.2 jelly bean and again
we have 16 gigs of storage here's the
note application let's take out the
s-pen real quick so that was kind of
slow with the quad core processor huh
everyone so great for note-taking that's
the idea of the note obviously here
these notifications again so you can see
it's giving us tutorials we don't care
now quick access to your controls up top
which I really like reading mode reading
modes been able the screen now optimizes
so that should make sure that the
brightness doesn't go nuts on you and
that your battery's not crazy but then
there's also a power saving mode right
there Bluetooth sync multi window what I
thought was really weird though is
Samsung said they're not including NFC
on here which is silly because I feel
like it would be a great way for you to
interact with say you own a galaxy s3 or
Galaxy Note 2 or note even and sort of
tap and go transfer files it you know it
seems like that would be perfect here's
a quick look at the applications that
come pre-installed flip boards they're
smarter note mode rather and that should
use the IR blaster and there it is
that's on the right side here so you
would control the TV like this
as opposed to like this since the IR
blasters there what else do we have here
you've got a screen saver that's just
going to go over demos a node HD is
though so another note taking
application see my idea what a great day
that's cool I'll talk about pop-ups huh
well I guess it's more of a text taking
note application there this is silly huh
pop-ups everywhere should turn them off
what else do we have all share play
that's for DLNA I support music player
Samsung's own software here let's see
there's any videos we can check out
here's a demo of a helicopter you can
get an idea for the screen here and the
speakers
we could pop it out just like with other
notes and leave the movie I'll turn down
the audio and leave the movie playing
while you do all their stuff so if you
want to you know go surf the web you can
do that chrome pre-installed anyway
quick look here everybody this is the
Galaxy Note 8.0 from Samsung let us know
if you have any questions will we bring
you a full review in the coming days
this is Todd Hazleton with TechnoBuffalo
