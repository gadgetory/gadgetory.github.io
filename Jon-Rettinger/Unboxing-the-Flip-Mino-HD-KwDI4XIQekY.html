John for Lakers calm here with a very
cool unboxing extra hand motions for
emphasis the good folks at flip video
are kind enough to send over a flip Mino
HD for me to review and check out really
excited to see the camera you guys know
I have a flip minnow and I love it so
I'm hoping the HD is gonna be even
better and they let me record in HD so
let's get to the unboxing it's not any
more of me talking cuz I really want to
see what this thing looks like let's
move this down sent from CafePress
go ahead and open this bad boy up just
some tape stab myself doing it and while
I'm doing this I'll put a link up to
flip video in the description bar so you
guys can check them out in case you're
interested in a flip minnow or flipping
into yourself picks out packing flip
video some a little bit of PR
information nothing terribly exciting
there let's get to the good stuff so
flip video I think this is the record 60
minutes yep flip Mino HD it's only way
you know it's the HD got a picture on
the front looks just like the old flip
minnow there's on the side in the back
it's got shoot and share in HD a white
one nothing else there nothing else
there let's go ahead and open this bad
boy up right so it's sealed right up
here designed by you it says you can
actually customize the design of your
Flip HD which is pretty cool
upload videos direct to YouTube AOL
video and the rest of that it's open
this thing up okay forget the scissors
alright open it up on top really nice
almost like a leatherette feeling
killing box this is flip Mino HD right
on the front opens up top look at that
John four Lakers branded pretty cool
here Armen actually was kind of do
design on this for me it's gonna go
ahead and move the camera up here and
show you guys it's really cool got the
John four Lakers logo with a kind of
neon cityscape right there on the front
it says Flip HD with the same screen and
the patented flip USB connector which I
love so let me do a real quick size
comparison for you compared to the flip
Mino pull its back down here so here's a
new HD here's the minnow and they look
to be exactly the same size exactly the
same dimensions everything everything is
the same except this one's got a TV out
on it actually this one has a TV out on
the to someone difference is up this
shoots in HD and let me shoot some video
and sixteen by nine so I'm getting rid
of this box it's on the outside of me

box flip Mino Quick Start Guide very
cool actually operating this couldn't be
any easier really just hit record and
you're pretty much good to go
