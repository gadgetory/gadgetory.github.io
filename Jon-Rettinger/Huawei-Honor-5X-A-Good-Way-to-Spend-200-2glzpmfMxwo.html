nowadays it feels as though we're moving
into a new era for smartphone we've
gotten to this point of diminishing
returns where we're seeing specs get
better and better but we're not really
seeing the results in terms of day to
day performance this really led us into
office to question how good can a budget
phone really be and can you use it as a
daily driver and as an example we wanted
to see if we could use the quali honor
which is a $200 off contract phone as
our daily driver what's up guys Ron
prettier from TechnoBuffalo and to keep
this experience as honest and as true as
possible I didn't even check the specs
of the phone before using it I just
wanted my experience to speak for itself
so first off with the display on the
Huawei honor we have a 5-inch 1080p
display and it's really good there's not
much else to say the only flaw here is
something that bursts pointed out to me
which was that there's a black border
around the screen now we've seen this on
other Huawei phone than we've now seen
on the next bit Robin it's not the end
of the world and I didn't even notice it
until he mentioned it but then after he
mentioned it I kept seeing it it was
like one of those things it does have a
little bit of a picture-in-picture
effect it's not quite as immersive as
something like an s6 edge+
but it definitely gets the job done it's
also worth noting that with iPhones your
flagship display resolution is still
1080p so this is definitely on par with
that moving on to the camera not much to
note here other than the cameras are
awesome 13 megapixel on the back five
megapixel on the front here's how they
look one of my only gripes and this is a
follow a specific gripe is their skin
not really that big of a fan of it it
has a lot of cool features in terms of
knuckle swiping screen splitting shaking
the phone to rearrange your icons
repurposing the fingerprint reader which
was one of my favorite features to bring
down the notification bar and such but
none of it is really worth it to me in
terms of what they've done with the
design I do not like it at all that
being said for more in-depth look at the
skin check out burst mate 8 review
linked above one of the big things
you're missing here is Android
marshmallow instead you're running
lollipop so you're not getting security
permissions now on tap now that's just
temporary because we will most likely
see the update come but it's just
something to bear in mind now sure as
software updates come through and
software packages get bigger you are
going to see the phone bog down of
course this is true with all phones but
because this phone is running low
respects you're probably going to see a
blog down earlier than you might a
bigger flagship like a 6p or a mate 8
but
overall the phone is fantastic for the
price point that it comes in at so can
you use this phone as a daily driver if
you were the power user my answer is
absolutely it got to the point where I
had to go to burst before checking the
specs obviously and ask him what is this
phone missing where are they cutting the
corners because I couldn't really find
it I didn't have any lag the phone was
very fast very quick very powerful got
everything I needed done and it looks
great all the while doing it build
quality is fantastic let me know what
you guys think in the comments below I'm
very curious to hear your opinions do
you like the honor do not like it are
there any other budget funds you guys
are interested in leave us a thumbs up
