it from TechnoBuffalo and today we're
gonna be showing you some tips and
tricks for the Galaxy s6 and s6 edge now
before we get started if you guys
haven't seen our full review on both
devices make sure to check out that link
below so number one is quick camera
launch now I love taking pictures and on
the galaxy s6 and s6 edge there's a new
feature that I'll allow you to launch
the camera instantly by pressing the
home button twice now this feature
should be on by default when you get
your phone but in case it wasn't you can
enable this feature by going to the
settings menu inside the camera app and
then turning on quick launch so whether
your phone's locked or turned on
pressing the home button twice will
launch the camera in about 0.7 seconds
flat so I applaud you Samsung Bravo
number two is the ability to customize
the quick settings the Samsung lighten
up TouchWiz quite a lot on the Galaxy s6
and s6 edge 40% to be exact and that
means users like you and I aren't
overloaded with options and bloatware
out of the box however you can still
easily tweak quick settings to your
liking first pull down a notification
shade and tap the small Settings icon in
the top right corner next tap the small
edit icon and you can easily add in
options to toggle Wi-Fi airplane mode
mobile hotspot data usage and more
customizing the quick setting isn't a
new feature at all but for users who are
looking to get more out of their new s6
this is a neat way to display your most
access setting tacos number three is to
use pro camera mode even before the
galaxy s6 and s6 edge was announced
Samsung teases about its camera and how
he promises great vision and unique view
Samsung wasn't lying about it the camera
on the galaxy s6 and s6 edge is just
amazing while the camera defaults to are
really easy to use auto mode you can
take your mobile photography game to a
whole different level by switching a pro
mode to enable this feature you can tap
mode and choose Pro now when you're
inside Pro mode you'll be able to tweak
the ISO the white balance the focus and
exposure all with different slider bars
now this can help you take clearer
better pictures when you have a bit more
time to line up your shot number four
are the motions and gestures now this is
completely up to you some motion and
gesture actions can be pretty handy at
times again Samsung lighten up TouchWiz
this time around so a couple aren't
always on by default so if you head into
settings and
go into motion and gestures you can
enable a few options you can allow the
phone to automatically answer a call
when you put the phones here ear
another option buzzes the phone when you
miss a call or notifications when you
pick up your phone now probably the
coolest feature here is the ability to
take screenshots by just swiping your
palm across the screen which Samsung has
included several times before in
previous versions of TouchWiz number
five is to adjust the screen color the
galaxy s6 and s6 edge have a really
gorgeous q HD Super AMOLED display
that's vibrant and sharp what's awesome
about the software on these devices is
the ability to change the screen mode so
if you head over to settings and then go
to display you'll find an option to
change the screen mode from adaptive
display to AMOLED cinema and we'll let
photo and basic AMOLED photo essentially
adds a bit of a warmer orange tint to
the screen while AMOLED cinema has a
much colder look basic essentially
replicates an LCD panel where colors
look a bit dull and faded it is a bit
more robust than basic screen
brightening and darkening but this gives
a little more artistic freedom if you
want to display to adjust the color of
the screen on its own by guessing the
content you're looking at you can just
leave adaptive display mode on but it's
not always supported by third-party apps
so number six is people edge now this
one is an s6 edge exclusive one of the
most awesome features on the galaxy s6
edge is the actual edge which you can
use to quickly access your favorite
contacts if you swipe in from the right
side of the display the People edge menu
will automatically pop up you can set
this up if you head over to the settings
go to edge screen and go to People edge
and here you can add up to five
different contacts and once these are
set up you'll be able to swipe in from
the lock screen and home screen and
contact your favorite people right away
