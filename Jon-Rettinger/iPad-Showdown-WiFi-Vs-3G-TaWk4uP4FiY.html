technobuffalo here and i want to give
you a hit a comparison of the two ipad
models available we've got the Wi-Fi +
3g model here on the left and the Wi-Fi
only model here on the right as you
decide which ipad models for you
especially the international crowd where
these are just becoming available you
may want to see how these to stack up to
the side which one fits you best so
we're going to cover ton differences
here including what pricing of course
we're going to cover settings browser
speed and video fidelity sort of the
things that are important everybody so
from a pricing standpoint there's about
a hundred and thirty dollar premium for
the Wi-Fi + 3g model or just the 3g
models i'll probably call it plus
there's additional data charge give you
thirty dollars per month for truvia
limited or fifteen dollars per month for
250 megabytes of data which you can keep
adding internet 50 megabyte increments
if you're interested so let's jump right
into settings because there are some
cell differences here with the settings
now they're both running the same
firmware and same build number but there
are still some differences between the
two the first thing that many systems
here will notice that the 3g model has
an airplane mode whereas the Wi-Fi only
model does not once riff strange
omission as well i love being able to
see my battery percentage in the upper
right-hand corner and on the Wi-Fi model
i could control that right through the
main menu with the battery percentage
indicator right there however that is
not on the 3g model it's a no it's a
little nitpicky but it does seem very
weird if i want to access those settings
actually jump into usage which is a men
you've not seen on the Wi-Fi model and
that i can go ahead and check my battery
percentage and while we're in here on
the usage I should show you that this
shows a sent and received data that you
use just over 3g does not keep track of
Wi-Fi in case you were wondering we have
a cellular data up in here something not
found on the Wi-Fi model you can turn
your data on or off you can turn that
around on or off you can add minutes or
GAD international data if you'd like and
you can configure your APN or your SIM
PIN if you so choose similar settings
that you get with most standard
smartphones so go ahead and jump at here
and i should say that even if you have
so you
data on if you are connected to a Wi-Fi
network will automatically default to
Wi-Fi so you can leave the 3g on not
worried about using the 3g and getting
you know less fast connection in your
house you've got Wi-Fi automatically be
defaulted to Wi-Fi and sneaking of 3G
let's talk about how that affects
battery life battery iPads are fantastic
I flew on a six-hour flight I watched a
movie to TV shows and write a book about
an hour and a half and i still had about
sixty-five percent of my battery left on
the Wi-Fi model so i tried my best to
drain both of these with the 3g on and i
found it took about 11 hours to drain
the battery on the Wi-Fi model and with
the 3g turned on it took about nine and
a half to drain on the 3g should
probably looking about an hour and a
half difference which coincides pretty
closely to what Apple said of about an
hour difference so in case you're
wondering that's the big the big battery
jump let's go ahead and compare these
two of browser speeds so to do this I'm
going to go ahead and clear the cache we
get a very fresh settings and clear
everything out of here so go ahead and
jump into safari well clear cache will
clear the cookies I want to do this on
camera so you guys can see that these
are sort of fresh tests and then will
refresh the page as you can see it what
it would look like refreshing a page is
it on regular basis so will clear
history clear cache here alright so both
are cleared and they are both running on
right now at least on the same Wi-Fi
network and let's see it to just be
difference between the two I wouldn't
expected there would be some server
running exactly the same chipset the a41
gigahertz system on us so some on a chip
but just for fun let's check and see if
there's a speed difference and that to
show you what sort of speeds we're
looking at I'll run a very quick speed X
test it's a free app and a free download
from the App Store it's pretty accurate
speeds can vary really minute to minute
but we'll see how quickly internet we're
looking at here Oh it'll be important
when we compare the Wi-Fi to the 3g
speeds so we are just about done and
we've got a speed of 5.58 Iran is a few
minutes ago it was up to seven so a
little bit faster than average not
much but as you can see what speed were
looking at so we'll go ahead and jump it
to Safari on each and we will load up
technobuffalo and go ahead and try and
hit both these same time it can be a bit
more difficult and then you might expect
actually we'll pull down the bookmarks
many of me maybe a bit easier and again
we've got a fresh catch and everything's
been cleared so this is via first time
viewing all right and they are both off
and I expect these to finish at exactly
the same time it looks like they are
very very close looks like actually the
3g model finished just a bit earlier not
really the handle is what could just be
a few seconds difference in texas i run
through independently they've almost
always finished at exactly the same time
so nothing that exciting there nothing
that unexpected there as well now let's
do some 3g testing you can see I've got
five bars of 3g so I'm going to jump
back into settings and I'm going to turn
Wi-Fi off here so we'll go ahead and
kick Wi-Fi off so now I'll be just using
the 3g network and i'll go through again
and we will clear get cookies and we
will clear the cache and we'll do the
same thing here come to safari clearer
and clearer alright so we've been
completely cleared will jump back here
you jump back TechnoBuffalo will do a
refresh and we'll see what the speed
differences are now again we have five
bars of 3g here on the left and a
relatively quick Wi-Fi on the rights
there should be a pretty noticeable
difference let's go ahead and see how
that translates to real-world usage and
see if we do get a difference so again
we'll pull down the bookmark menus and
we'll jump back into technical Buffalo
so I started this one about a second
later for Speed comparisons so then keep
that in mind and we're still loading
here there it goes like it's finally
moving the page along Wi-Fi looks like
it's just about done the 3g is still
sort of pushing its way through there
are a lot of graphics on here so finally
see the page refresh
now these low times are gonna be faster
or slower rather than you'd see on a
website you design regular basis we
already have the catch and things save
me we're going to do another refresh to
the site to see if the speed difference
looks like when you have you know pigs
that you visit on a regular basis so
this is still loading up here all rights
now we're going to refresh this now that
when you have things sort of cached and
queued up I'll see if there's any
service fee difference I expect that
there would be so we'll go ahead and
launch TechnoBuffalo one more time on
each get it right there get right there
and we are off and see if it's any
faster well the Wi-Fi is first to show
the contents not surprisingly it looks
like the 3g is actually moving much
faster than it did last time which is
definitely nice now it's already done on
the Wi-Fi the 3g is loading doesn't seem
to be that much quicker but a little bit
and it's still going so you can
definitely notice that there is clear
these three difference between Wi-Fi and
3g if you view a web page in a pinch the
3g will work but certainly not going to
replace your Wi-Fi connection from the
house let's go ahead and jump out of
this you can see that there's a
noticeable speed difference so let's
check the video fidelity as well and
we'll check pretty much the most popular
way to view video on both devices
youtube so i'll jump into the youtube
players on each and again 3g is on the
left Wi-Fi is on the right so we'll go
ahead and view most viewed videos on
each you can see it populates much
quicker on the Wi-Fi model
and here is the content now on 3g and
will view the most popular video of the
day which is actually a very funny
series the unknowing orange Kevin
watched it's probably worth a watch all
right let's go ahead and play these you
can see it starts to play right away on
the Wi-Fi model fidelity looks really
good you can go ahead and pinch it up or
full screen so it looks nice as clear
you can see it and also loads very
quickly it takes a decent amount of time
to cue up even just a sec you two of
content over 3g and looks like we've
dropped down to about three bars of 3g
which is probably pretty fair to what
you would get in your area and after
this we'll do a speed test of the 3g so
you can see how quickly or not quickly
so you can see it's fidelity looks like
it's definitely degraded here on 3g it's
certainly watchable however it's not
unwatchable but there is a long time for
it to queue up so you saw it's about a
two-minute clip in right now you can see
the bar going we're almost done so if
you can definitely watch youtube videos
and actually i was surprised at how
quickly this loaded especially
considering how slowly it loaded some
webpages just kind of interesting to
note let's go ahead and jump out of this
and let's do the speed test now over 3g
to see if what this big difference
actually is so we'll run it again here
on the Wi-Fi model will start it there
I'm start here we can see what the big
differences and expect this one
certainly be much slower that one seems
to be running along very quickly I won't
make you guys sit here and watch this
whole thing go through all to sort of
cut back when it's done so after about
four minutes or test is complete here
let's compare this bead so on 3g we're
looking at point 4 6 megabits per second
and on Wi-Fi it looks like we got a
faster test and last time we pulled down
nine point one five megabits per second
so we're looking at speeds of probably
anywhere from ten to right now 18 times
faster which is very very noticeable
however I found a few times I've been
able to use the 3g while I'm out and
about is a nice feature to have
essential for you is going to come down
to personal preference shakes out to be
about a dollar a day four trillion limit
in the finite if you watch a video
you've access to netflix over 3g now
back to us to ebc over 3g CBS com so you
can watch a lot of video content which
can add up very quickly however if you
got to watch that content you have to
wait a little while for it to queue up
to play so really which one you're
interested in again it's going to come
down to which one you prefer so let's go
and talk about some of the physical
differences between the two because are
just a few noticeable tweaks the first
thing you may have been able to tell is
this black bar across the top we've got
a full Luminum circling the screen
however on the 3g model you've got a
little bit of two tone job going on here
to make sure the 3g radio can get out
and get a good signal so that creates
that little black bar that you saw
across the top we also have a micro sim
tray which is on the left hand side of
the device and see that right there and
of course the Wi-Fi mountain does not
have that micro sim so again externally
those are the only differences I like
having the option of the 3g I like the
fact that it's contract free if I know
I'm not can use it for a month I can
just cancel it not have to pay or if I'm
going out for a day or two and I want to
just have some bad I go ahead and just
add it when if you make a bike plan and
not have to worry I can use you know
whatever I need to do my work on the
road so what does hundred thirty bucks
plus data plan again it's going to be up
to you speed wise you're almost
identical when you're on Wi-Fi on 3g
certainly in those differences but Wi-Fi
to Wi-Fi it's very very very close and
we guys hope you enjoyed the sort of
head-to-head comparison of the ipad
