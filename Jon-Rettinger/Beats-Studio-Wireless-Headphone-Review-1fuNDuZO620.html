to you by domain.com what's up everyone
john wrench from TechnoBuffalo at the
for review for you of the Beats Studio
wireless the beats brand has become
about as polarizing as Apple themselves
chances are you're either in love with
it or hate it camp I'm kinda in the
Middle East I came in kind of in the
middle so first the syringe and seven
dollar headphones are not for the faint
of wallet that is again three hundred
and seventy nine bucks it look exactly
like the new studios that beats also has
out available in a ton different color
some bright some not yet titanium
because I didn't want some of like the
look at me colors alright so let's jump
right in and talk about the design hey
they look like Ed phones it's about what
you'd expect here the headband is really
very durable one of the knocks that
people have about beads is durability
this headband though seems to be really
really durable it's got a really nice
cushion on tops knocking leap really
pressure on your head at all like most
headphones out there if you got a big
noggin can go ahead and adjust it
accordingly also it's very comfortable
on the ears there's a lot of cushion a
lot of padding so you said very nicely
right over your ears again everybody's
gonna be different but at least for me
with I think just normal ear sizes I had
no issue wearing these for long periods
of time also I occasionally wear glasses
when I'm working no issue wearing these
with glasses either controller can be
done just like the other wireless
headphones if you sign up these solo
twos on the left hand side bill telling
things there they look totally hidden
really flush I would that be logo it
serves as a button that's going to do
your play music or stock music or launch
i-tunes of a music player you're using
volume up and down it's me right on top
of there as well think of this like what
you'd have if you had inline remote
control you can all do it wirelessly
with the button right on the left ear
cup also since these are wireless you
might want to take a phone call or two
there is a built-in mic it is not great
people could definitely hear I was on a
Bluetooth headphones something I haven't
very long time but bring the gym and a
pitch and you want to tell your
reciprocal others you'll be home in a
minute they'll definitely get the job
done the feature I was most intrigued to
try out these was noise cancelling and I
happy to say that it does work when
listening to music but it's not super
great it does have a mode that's good
for commuters or if you're on an
airplane or something that lets you turn
on a more active noise-cancelling but
you can't look at any music while you're
doing it now let's think of these like a
really expensive set of earplugs when
just using normal noise cancelling
saying you just have them on your ears
and you're able to play music through
them it works you can still hear
everything around you just hear less of
what's around you I'm gonna put them on
my head I couldn't hear myself typing
and a normal keyboard noise anything
louder that that you could hear so use
that as your basis we stopped real fast
and thank our peeps at domain.com it's a
place to go when the next great idea
hits you like in the middle of the night
so one-stop shopping for all your domain
name and web hosting email needs bank
comm wants to hook you up with a pretty
sick offer save 20% on domain names and
web hosting when use coupon code
TechnoBuffalo it's all one word and caps
at domain comms check out you think
domains think domain.com a wireless
range is our bluetooth was about 30 feet
that's what beats advertises and I got
just about that they also claimed about
12 hours of battery life and that again
which is about as advertised
I do plug these in every night I keep
them on at the office they're plugged in
pretty much when I get in from like 7:30
8:00 until 5:00 5:30 I just plug them in
at night I usually have got about two
bars or two dots of battery life left
from the LEDs that show up on the right
ear cup so I could have gone for another
probably half a day but plug them every
night no issue at all
you can plug a cable in and use these
and get about 20 hours of battery life
ah
the annoying thing though is you're
going to need a battery to even use it
with the cable plugged in I do not like
that about these headphones other
headphones become just normal wired
headphones when you plug in a cable but
not so with these wudu you pull out set
cable it's also turn the headphones off
so I guess that's a nice feature alright
let's talk about audio since you know
these are headphones I do want to give a
caveat here I had to return my first
pair because they would not keep a
connection which was really annoying
it's not a great start to review but a
bad eat it could happen at any
product out there but thought I just let
you know what happened audio is
obviously totally subjective so the
quality sounded really great without
overpowering bass which is a nice thing
to have from a beats headphones the bass
is pretty controlled here so if looking
for really heavy basement wanna look for
the previous-generation studios these
are going to sound very very very
different audio was very good but it
wasn't quite as good even customizable
something like the pair at Zeke's to
Al's able to hear everything I wanted I
didn't get getting that overpowering
basic bass used to be known for
listening to other genres of music other
than just you know rap or hip-hop if you
music that's really beat heavy some like
dubstep I could rock my keniji
I'm a Michael Bolton without really
having to worry about being overpowered
by the ukulele uh-oh do is just good
it's not as great has kind of things
that are out there but it was pretty
decent it's gonna come with a hard
carrying case which is gonna be nice you
don't get a hard carrying case with the
solo 2 was sort of a soft mesh I get two
cables inside you're gonna get a red one
which has all of your inline controls
and also super screams look at me and
bright red and you get a black straight
cable which is just straight audio the
moral here is that I like these
headphones they are far from great and
they are far from inexpensive in the
pantheon of headphones and there are a
lot these are probably square in the
middle while the price though is
squarely at the front for this kind of
dough though I think you're going to
probably want to look elsewhere
thank you guys for watching hope you
enjoyed I'm really getting into the
headphone kind of review with any other
headset you want to see us review be
sure to let us know I guess he's just
like an average person would how do they
work for me however my usage hatas music
sound a day YouTube videos down house
battery life why this is important to me
so I want to make sure you got a chance
to check these out but again for the
money there are a lot of other options
out there they're going to do about the
same for less scratch please give the
video a thumbs up I was appreciating of
