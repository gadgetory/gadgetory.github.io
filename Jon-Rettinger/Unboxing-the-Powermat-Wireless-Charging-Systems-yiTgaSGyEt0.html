unboxing for you of the power mat
wireless charging system this is
obviously a wireless charging setup that
lets you power up the majority of your
devices let's go ahead and dig in and
see what's included in the Box B mat
itself as you guys will probably see in
a few minutes
plugs into a wall and the devices that
you want to charge have their own little
cradles that you just placed right on
top of the mat the mats themselves have
got an office mat and they've got a
portable mat both good way to run $99
and you could buy the separate cradles
which are generally I think about 29 to
32 39 bucks guys so I have not seen one
of these in person so I'm kind of
curious how they work and if wireless
charging
even functions properly so I'm very
curious to sort of dig in here and see
what we got and of course stay tuned to
the channel and TechnoBuffalo comm for
the follow up videos looks like we got a
lot of goodies here push all the packing
off the side and see what we got so we
have the power mat wireless charging
station this is the home and office mat
it's like it opens up check it out and
that is what it looks look like and all
of course I'll show you guys what looks
like live on camera you can put three
devices on it at once also included
you've got the power mat portable mat
looks like this one folds up it probably
does very similar I think this has a
trifold so probably you can just take it
and carry it with you and if you look
around these devices like right here on
the iPhone for example you see it's got
a little bit of a sleeve on and that's
what you need to charge them with
unfortunately you can't just put the
iPhone right on top of it and have a
charge and we've got the iPod and iPhone
dock if you put that right on top of the
charger you can put your iPhone in it
and we'll just dock it and charge it and
then here's that sleek about telling
about for the iPhone 3G I'm very curious
to see what both these look like and how
they function
so let's open them up and let's say
let's start with the wireless charging
home and office Matt a postbox off to
the side and I'll pull things out one by
one
and show you what they look like and I
give the full review I'll tell you how
how useful everything is and if you're
interested in learning more about the
power Matt I'll put a link to them up in
the sidebar and if you're reading this
on TechnoBuffalo look down below so
let's slide this out looks like a mini
skateboard upon first blush so we'll
take it out it's very thin actually um
little plastic EB can see three circles
which I'm assuming is where you want to
put you to your devices you can see that
on the camera it says one two and three
USB the must be where the power goes and
I think there are some volume buttons as
well I must make a noise when you charge
it let's see what else would come in
your box thank you for purchasing power
mat okay it's a little bit about it home
and office mat and power cube universal
receiver interesting so this is this
would be the power cable so that plugs
in and it's got the wall outlet port
right there and then this is the power
mat wireless charging charge hundreds of
portable devices let's see what comes in
here
just dig in they pack these things it's
nice and tight let's slide this out we
can see exactly what comes in here
you've got adapters for Apple Nintendo
DSi Nintendo DS Lite LG a microUSB which
charges most HTC devices Sony PSP and
Samsung so that's quite a nice looks
like what you do is you plug one end
I'll just show you instead of talking
about it since that's the beauty of
video so you've got all these different
tips right here take out one of these
cubes pull this out so it's got the
microUSB tip attached to it you can swap
the tips pretty easily you plug it in so
I've got the Sprint HTC Hero here and I
would just put this piece right on the
charging pad so you necessarily don't
have to buy the external things for your
iPhone or iPod Touch driver does
actually include something in the box if
you want it to be maybe a little bit
more more elegant you can buy the
editions but they're by no means
required the power met folks look like
they include that in the box so that was
quite nice so this here is the office
mat push all the stuff off to the side
plugs right in again this looks like a
little bit of a skateboard and device it
just will sit right on top of it or that
little okay so move it along now we've
got the portable mat to take a look at I
assume it's gonna look very similar but
of course you can tell you can charge
three devices and giving a little bit
overview on what it is looks like this
would be a nice solution if you're in a
place with minimal outlets and you only
have one and you'll want to sort of plug
everything in plus I imagine it looks
pretty cool but I'm gonna save my
opinions for the full review simple fast
clean and energy-saving no spagetti of
wires and charge through devices with
one plug
so this is the portable one like I said
and I've got the office charger here
next to me so you can compare what they
look like in case you're curious and
would like to buy one of these I don't
know what they look like okay so this
looks quite different
definitely has a plasticky feel to it
like it folds down pretty small and it's
the same concept
you've got the three cycle of charging
connectors right there move it up to the
camera so you can see and if you compare
it to the office one certainly not as
elegant looking but definitely more
portable it's like it's gonna depend on
your needs and the utility of these and
whether or not it's so useful and we got
the same array of ports a USB port and
there's quite nice as well and I believe
that's found on the office one so if you
have something that doesn't for example
have a charging port that you can put on
top you can charge something via USB and
I assume you can use that USB port well
you have three things charging as well
so looks like it'll help form a cabling
stand point and dig it in looks like we
got some different things here I assume
this is a carrying case for the portable
charger which it is there's the power
adapter and summer reading material this
is not zipper it looks like it's just
magnetized and then we've got the same
tips that we just saw earlier for
charging all your license so guys I'm
gonna use this for a little while use
both these and let you know what I think
about the power mat I've got I've never
used any sort of wireless charging
options the only time I've ever really
come across it was for the palm
touchstone so I think this should be a
relatively simple experience I'll show
you in the review what what these two
look like the iPhone and iPod docks and
the sleeves that they go in as well take
a receiver and another version of the
receiver so this is just another way to
charge your Apple products they've got
these for a ton of other devices
