from TechnoBuffalo
today I want to show you a difference
between the galaxy s4 and the galaxy s4
active normally John would do this but
he's in Hawaii so you get me can see the
two devices are fairly similar in shape
and size the galaxy s4 active is
slightly thicker though not much so and
the screens are the same size you've got
a 5-inch 1080p on both 1920 by 1080
though on the right we've got an LCD
it's a TFT LCD display on the left of
course you've got the HD super amoled
from Samsung you can see the colors are
slightly different this seems to be sort
of the colors pop a bit more on the s4
than they do on the active although I
still find this super clear and and
really beautiful look at any case let's
move around the device you've got the
volume controls on the left in the same
spot on the bottom you've got the same
microUSB port location though there's a
hatch on the s4 active that's to keep
the water and dust out you've got the
power button in the same spot though
this has sort of a little edging on it
and the top the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and notice the active also has the
IR blaster right there so we'll go to
the active you can see it's got this
nice finish it actually kind of little
reflective I love the blue color and
we'll pop this off because I want to
show you in the back still get this is
actually an 8 megapixel camera I should
say versus the 13 megapixel on the
galaxy s4 here only fit off fingerprints
or wild on it so 13 megapixel on this 8
megapixel on the active see we still
have a micro Micro SIM card slot as well
as micro SD card slot it comes with 16
gigs onboard so I added my own 64 there
then the battery here and if you look at
the under shell you can see that it's
got this plastic border sort of running
around and that's to keep the water and
dust out and when you put it back on you
really want to make sure that you click
everything into place because if you
don't you can hear all the snaps because
if you don't the water can actually get
through so real quick I'll show you some
of the features
you've got the same sort of touch
interface you can see that if I hadn't
the hover above the screen it's got all
of these same settings options that the
s4 has so you've got smart scroll smart
pause air view I won't go over all of
them you're probably very familiar with
them now Android 4.2.2
that's jellybean and I'll bring up the
camera interface just so you can see it
because there's one difference okay
we've got the camera up and you'll see
that there's still the same different
various settings though in this one and
you might have just seen it there's an
aqua mode now see you'll be able to
touch the screen underwater unable to
touch and that's correct
I've actually used this in the water
already the screen doesn't work right
now so you need to use the volume key as
the camera or record button which is
right down here so we'll head that means
the camera key it reminds us again to
make sure that the cover is closed USB
cover because I could ruin the phone and
then in this case you can use you can
see I'm taking pictures hitting the
volume button right there and then when
we're done we can get out of autumn or
get out of camera mode
sorry the aqua mode into anything else
will go back into auto so that this
screen works again completely so for
example I want to show you what that
happens when you don't get water now
double check your USB port will make
sure that everything's closed up here
and good thing I did check that because
it might not be all right so we've got
everything closed up you'll want to do
that too otherwise you're gonna get what
and we'll drop it in just pop on the
screen so you can see there you go we've
got the phone sort of sitting in water
here and for demo purposes I'll just
show you well clean up my table later
where you can pour water all over the
device and it'll work perfectly fine
just shake it off and you're good to go
again again when it's underwater it
doesn't work propria and that goes for
in the rain too actually was using this
in the rain the other day and it just
doesn't work the screen won't work
properly so you still need to wipe it
off in order to get your functionality
back anyway that's a quick look
comparing the two devices I've got some
water on the s4
that's okay got the active on the left
galaxy s4 both on AT&amp;amp;T both won $99.99
and available now this is Todd Hazleton
