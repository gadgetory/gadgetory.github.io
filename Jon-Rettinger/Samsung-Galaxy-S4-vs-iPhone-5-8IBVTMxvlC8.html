technobuffalo here today we've got a
phone battle royale in one corner we've
got Apple's iPhone 5 in the other we got
samsung galaxy s4 let's smash these two
suckers head-to-head see who comes out
on top alright so before we get into all
the battles and fighting let me give you
a few disclaimers guess the iPhone 5 has
announced last September which in cell
phone years makes it a grandfather but
it did just come out on tmobile in this
decision a lot of folks are faced when
they come to get a new phone do they
want the current generation iphone order
they want the latest samsung galaxy
device so of course once the iphone 5s
comes out we will update this review and
do a complete comparison comparing both
those devices but least for now this is
the latest Apple handset against the
latest Samsung handset let's go ahead
and smash so did my reviews the first
thing usually talk about his reception
both these guys had almost identical
reception pointing the same bar that I
know it's kind of just algorithmic
gibberish for what shows up on the
screen reception is solid for both I got
soul LTE on each on this review is done
using both AT&amp;amp;T models so iphone and
galaxy s4 i'm not going to get too into
the operating system stuffin so we've
covered that ad nauseam i'll talk a
little bit about some of the S features
and some custom stuff that Apple's got
with the iOS but not much operating
systems things if you want to see
pacifico I stuff go back and check the
reviews for each of these phones so
number i do these verses videos i try
and pick the category is most important
to me and the categories i think might
be most important to you but obviously
there are tons of other things we could
discuss and this would be a 17 hour
video so i picked aforethought most
important there were some that don't
fall on that you can sort of fill them
in yourself so before we're going to
talk about our number one screams these
are all touchscreen phones and you got
to be able to see them so that is lion
item number one number two we can talk
about camera both these phones bows
pretty impressive cameras we're gonna
talk a bit about those suckers next
we're going to talk about building the
build of each and what that gives or
subtract speech phone then they just
talk about some intangibles cuz there
are a lot of intangible things about
each of these devices and we are going
to declare a winner and none of that
it's a tie the choice is up to yours cop
out answers one of these phones will win
let's start with the screen so it's a
bit of a refresher course the iPhone 5
has a 4
screw the resolution of 11 36 x 640
giving it a 326 ppi it's Samsung
counterpart has a one inch bigger screen
if you could do math you'll know that is
a 5-inch screen with a resolution of
1920 x 1080 giving it a 441 PPI so since
apple debut the retina screen used to be
the screen to beat when you did a
comparison you knew you're talking about
screens Apple had this one in the bag
not so the case anymore the screen
resolution just stayed the same and
Samsung and other Android competitors
had a lot of time to catch up so being
phone ones you're gonna use an outdoor
sometimes in my experience the iphone 5
was much better in direct sun and i
should say i don't use auto brightness
on my phones i keep them both at about
eighty percent in direct sunlight i
could almost always see what was on the
iphone 5 not always a case with the
galaxy s4 so ding that sub category goes
to the iphone but the samsung has got a
lot of screen niceties tucked away
inside of it so the s4 had better
viewing angles you could view it from
the side much better of course having a
bigger screen and bigger resolution you
could see much more content for instance
we go to TechnoBuffalo calm we could see
a whole separate article extra that we
couldn't see on the iphone 5 so we're
talking about playing games or watching
video the honest answer is I couldn't
really tell that much of a difference
between the two obviously the screen
size was different but both of them
looked awesome so that you know it's
going to be a tie but if you have to
pick a winner when it comes out to
screen I will take better viewing angle
I will take larger size any day that one
goes to the samsung galaxy s4 so next
let's talk some camera action we've got
a 8 megapixel shooter living here on the
iphone 5 we've got a 13 megapixel
shooter living here on the galaxy s4 our
own Brendan Russell did a ton of camera
comparisons comparing how things looked
in low-light highlight or just normal
bridgend sunlight comparing these two
phones they were very impressive for me
if I was going to take pick a phone that
I want to go shoot regular pictures with
I would still pick the iphone 5 which is
really a testament considering how old
it is and the end in cell phone world
september's makes de dinosaur over the
camera is really impressive that goes to
show that megapixels aren't everything
now having said that the galaxy s4
offers a ton more features in the
built-in camera app there's a huge
amount of things you can do from best
face to action shots on a lot of other
cool things they packed underneath the
hood here now the iphone can do a lot of
those we got to do separate apps and for
me that gets a little bit on the
annoying side so this one really gonna
come down to what you want if you want
you to pure shooter or if you want the
features so it comes out to camera it
surrounds a tie all rights next let's
talk about building before everybody out
there start screaming but the plastic
build makes it do so many more things
calm down I'm gonna get to that bill
call it on the iphone has been
outstanding since the very first iphone
came out you've got a single piece of
aluminium that it's carved out of and
the phone just feels incredible it isn't
held up that well over the past eight
ish months it's got some dings around
the outside i don't use a case on it
those that could very well be my fault
but the phone feels outstanding Apple
nailed the design of the iphone fire
this is the best looking iphone they've
ever had it feels incredibly light we
almost forget to there's a battery
inside of it every inch every millimeter
every centimeter every nanometer this
phone you could tell detention to detail
was paid to it and it really shows the
build quality is absolutely outstanding
now when it comes to build quality of
the galaxy s4 we talked about this ad
nauseum but it bears repeating once more
it's plastic something you might not
mind it some of you might actually like
it but for me it doesn't scream high
quality least in the build quality side
i know i do like the addition samsung's
made from the s3 to the s4 they've got
these sort of fake metal accents on the
side they've squared off the outside of
its when you hold it it feels much more
secure in the hands but when it comes
out to build we picked these both these
phones up and you hold them in your
hands the iphone 5 feels head and
shoulders better than the galaxy s4 so
this round goes to the iphone alright so
next let's talk about intangibles
because there are a lot of intangibles
about both these phones let's start with
the galaxy s4 it's got a lot of stuff in
it that the iphone just doesn't have
things like NFC things like expandable
storage things like a removable battery
if that's important to you all the crazy
s features that are packed into it I
just got a ton of awesome things that
the iphone just doesn't have now for me
the iphone also has some intangible
features as well it's got the app store
which for me is always going to be the
ace up apples
we've the App Store is incredible apps
are designed just for these devices they
only have to support a few screen sizes
in the app experience if you compare the
same app on iOS and Android almost
always a better experience on iOS also
Apple of course has the iCloud which I
know there's a lot of cloud solutions
for both and cross platforms and some
just meant for Android but the big thing
for me is the iCloud backups fact I can
restore a phone exactly the way it was
with relative ease and I you can do some
things like that what Android you could
route and there are different backup
solutions that will back up texts and
contacts and other things as far as a
seamless backup experience the iphone
really has that one nailed but when it
comes down pick a new device tangible
wise i'm going for NFC I'm going for
expandable storage this round definitely
goes to the galaxy s4 we talked about
scream talked about cameras we talked
about build quality and some intangibles
who is the winner of this epic phone
smackdown it is Samsung's latest the
galaxy s4 now if you're signed between
these two phones and you think Apple
might be the way to go your best bet is
gonna be to wait the iPhone 5s is
clearly lurking just around the corner
perhaps only a few weeks away at
worldwide developers conference in San
Francisco but if you're new and you just
want to pick up a new phone right now I
don't really care which iphone is out
your best bet is going to be the galaxy
s4 of course once apple and leashes the
5s will update this video and show you
what that has we may have some new
competition but this decision a lot of
people make when i go to a store iphone
5 galaxy s4 for my money I pick up the
Samsung so what do you guys think you
agree disagree i'd love to hear your
thoughts leave your comments down below
and please give the video a thumbs up
and try to keep them comments civil hope
you enjoyed I am John Reggie from
