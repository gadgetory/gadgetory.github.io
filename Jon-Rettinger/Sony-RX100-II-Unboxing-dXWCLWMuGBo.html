TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing of one
of the latest sony cybershot cameras
this is the rx100 m2 it is one of the
more advanced point-and-shoot on the
market let's go ahead unbox it and take
a first line so the box is pretty simple
just made a card boards got some specs
on it and some logos and all that kind
of business but that's not why you're
here just in cardboard boxes you want to
see what's inside and so do i in all
honesty so this camera in case you
didn't to know has a twenty point two
megapixel sensor it's the Exmoor CMOS
sensor it's a pretty decent sized Lea
supposedly sensor with F 1.8 carl zeiss
varios own arty lens with 3.6 times zoom
and it's living right in this pouch boom
here it is difference between the mark
ii versus the first one is edition of
this hot shoe so you can have ten
different accessories they've got things
like microphones and secondary flashes
and all kinds of other goodness here ISO
up to twelve thousand eight hundred you
can shooting JPEG or raw sky nice push
off the side for just a quick second see
else we're going to have inside of the
Box got a battery charger for charging
batteries hello just using a battery
charger this looks like a USB wall work
charger that's interesting it's much
charge directly to the wall up now it's
got a battery but you can charge
directly from the wall anyway so now to
deal with an external battery charger
worry about losing it and then we also
have strap for strapping things and then
that just mentioned USB cable which
probably have a couple years in your
house but if you don't it is micro USB
it looks like that's about it in the Box
you got this little bag which looks like
it's got more carrying loops with it
let's put all that stuff off the side
take a look here at the camera so a few
interesting things about this camera
aside from its tilt Abul three inch
display has got on here so you take high
pictures or little pictures depending on
your angle it's got Wi-Fi and NFC so you
can send pictures record to your phone
or you can use your phone and secondary
viewfinder which is kind of a neat thing
so the camera on one of the knocks I've
been reading on it is that it's not very
grippy it's sort of very very metal
nigga definitely see that being the case
in fact that was so much the case that
Sony sells an external grip that doesn't
do anything except for make it easier to
hold so they're gonna pick up this
camera you might want to make sure use
the straps they don't throw this all
over the place I picked up this camera
to use to take pictures of my newborn
baby so I'm very excited to try it and
hopefully it worked well I can put in my
pocket not to worry about trying to
manually focus with the SLR though if
you want to mainly focus you can
definitely do that you've got a control
ring here in the topic control of
various functions including like I just
mentioned focus a ton of manual options
I'll live here as well there's a flash
that pops out at least it will once the
cameras all powered and put it on that
you can tilt back and forth depending on
how you want your flash to kick out a
little bit of a grip here for your thumb
shoots Full 1080p movies which is quite
nice you couple that with the microphone
ik attached right here and you could be
pretty good so what are we going to have
port wise we've got HDMI out you've got
sort of Sony's multi port
Sony love is proprietary ports and I can
get my fingernail under there we could
see what it looked like
come here bort ah
there's what it looks like it looks like
a microUSB connector it's probably
recharging other peripherals can plugged
into there as well so it might actually
not be proprietary I might have just
given Sony a bad rap other than that
nothing else for the living here this is
where your SD card slots going to go or
memory stick depending on what you want
to do and there's a real NFC logo I got
a spot to secure the tripod on and the
rest of that goodness of course I will
use the camera lots of baby pictures
coming up to my future let you guys know
what I think please the comments down
