technobuffalo here and today tuesday may
18th the surprise of no one Apple
refreshed their macbook line these new
models actually been scooped a few days
ago by a Vietnamese site so we pretty
much knew what to expect the price point
stays the same at 999 you're getting a
bit more updated specs and hardware
let's go ahead and run through it so
you're now getting a 2.4 gigahertz
core2duo chip you're getting in videos
geforce 320m for graphics you're now
getting a 10-hour integrated battery
which is up from seven to three hour
improvements things are stayed the same
you have sort of two gigabytes of RAM
standard 2050 gigabyte hard drive to
standard and again the price stays the
same at 999 now if you look at those
specs respect they sound very familiar
actually to the 1199 macbook pro the
only different spec wise is the macbook
pro comes with four gigs of ram whereas
a macbook comes standard with two now if
you want to upgrade your our new refresh
macbook before gigs of ram is going to
cost you a hundred bucks which means
spec for spec in the same math book in
the macbook pro if you want to go
plastic it's going to save you actually
a hundred bucks however if you want the
probably more premium looking aluminum
unibody hundred bucks more is going to
get you the same machine in a different
shell so what do you guys think about
these new macbook updates certainly
nothing revolutionary we don't have any
core i3 at five or of course i7 chips
but we do have a refreshed core 2 duo
with got better graphics and the rest of
stuff stays to say it was very quiet
updates or me nokia associated with it I
think that you're now getting certainly
better more value for your modern dollar
the older macbook was refreshed many
months ago and the specs was just not on
par with its windows counterparts now
we'll still not spects perspect really
the same as the windows counterparts as
Apple's usually aren't you're now
getting sort of a bit more bang for your
buck so have you guys been waiting for
this update are excited about it or you
already got out and bought one
supposedly they're trickling out in
stores already so if you have an apple
store near you go ahead and pick it up
or they are already available for order
from Apple
come anywhere in the world anyway guys
from jon rettinger come technobuffalo
and i'll see the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
