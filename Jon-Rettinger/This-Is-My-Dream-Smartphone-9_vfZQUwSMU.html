smartphones it is so incredibly cool to
have all the knowledge world has ever
accumulated in something so small that
could fit in the palm of your hand and
oftentimes reviewers we tend to nitpick
devices and I've reviewed thousands of
phones I believe at this point but I
have never had a phone that's been
absolutely perfect something's always
been wrong or something I personally
would have always liked changed so that
would be kind of fun to see what would
my dream phone look like not only what
would the specs be what would the
software be but also physically what
would this phone look like
so I chance to team up with I think one
of the best graphic designers in the
industry he does a lot of renders for
our site we'll link to him right here at
sea concept creators from Twitter
definitely check him out is some amazing
work it's actually bring my dream phone
to life and as I go through the spec
sheet you'll start to see the phone take
shape and again this is my dream phone
so I got to pick anything I wanted from
software and hardware let's make it a
vice it's a franken device that I know
probably will never exist but damn it
would be awesome if it would so this is
my dream screen is a huge deal for me
it's the way you interact with your
phone it's your portal to that world so
you got to have the best screen in the
business and I'm starting with the
screen from the galaxy s 9 the 5.8 inch
OLED panel looks absolutely incredible
it's the best in the industry and that
is where I wanted to start with my dream
phone so beautiful screen is one thing
but making sure your phone was going to
be safe is another face idea from Apple
will be here and I've actually
pleasantly surprised with how well it's
worked on the iPhone 10 maybe not even
think about a lock screen anywhere I
like that ease of yuuka-san that don't
even worry about a type of proach
because I like redundancy for sometimes
face Eddie doesn't work I do like to
have an in screen fingerprint reader I'm
a dream phone don't forget so I check it
out what I want camera also is a huge
deal you want to make sure your camera
is gonna be the best of the business so
that's where I started we're gonna have
the camera from the pixel to with the
variable aperture and second zoom camera
from the s9 plus so I Frank and signed
up those two cameras answer
also I think speakers kinda suck in
general especially where they're not
facing right at you so of course dual
stereo front-facing speakers when you're
holding the phone in case you want to
plug in the pair headphones of course
headphone jack will be there wouldn't
take the DAC from the best that will be
from LG other sort of smartphone stuff
you'd expect of course will be here
expandable storage ip68
wireless charging fast charging and I'm
shocked how often people ask if phones
I'm reviewing have an IR blaster so for
you ir blasters in here and also I'm
gonna bring back something that phones
have lost the past few years removable
battery so you know why not if your
battery dies just carry an extra one
that's gonna be here as well and making
sure this phone can stay juice should be
no surprise if you want a fast charge
you can do it via USB see my favorite
feature aside from face ID on any Apple
product has been that profile picture on
the left hand side it turns it from ring
to vibrate it's really handy we don't
see it on any other phone save for one
plus so that will definitely be here and
because it's my dream phone I'm going
unnecessarily heavy on the RAM eight
gigabytes of RAM will be onboard and to
make sure that a key good bytes
hums smoothly I'm gonna use the best
processor on the market we're gonna take
the a 11 Bionic chip that Apple's got in
the iPhone 10 and the iPhone 8 here's
where things get even a little crazier
how about some stock Android P so if
you're keeping track at home apples
processor Google's OS but I'm not done
cherry picking from from either I'm
gonna cross my fingers and pray to the
smartphone gobs and iMessage for Android
is going to be existing and because my
dream phone I'm going to will it into
existence so because I've got face ID
got a place to put it so the knotch is
there but it can be used like a second
screen if you want and also you can turn
it off of the Assaf for that was for the
compromise run for a smaller notch when
we have currently on the iPhone 10
hoping technology will advance by time
the stream phone could see conceivably
come out so smaller knotch
but it is it is there
I really wanted to make the back of this
phone and glass because it's removable
if you look sort of below the metal
that's where that panel slides off to
have removable battery it couldn't
really be glass so it's a soft touch
plastic but I'm telling you from
somebody who's never touched it but it
was imagined it it's gonna feel really
premium obviously price would be a big
deal here I don't know it's my dream
phone let's say it comes in at a
thousand bucks that seems to be the high
end of what people will tolerate the
thousand dollars that is my dream phone
that's what I want the best from iOS the
best from Android the best screens the
best speakers crammed in what I think is
a beautiful looking package be sure hit
