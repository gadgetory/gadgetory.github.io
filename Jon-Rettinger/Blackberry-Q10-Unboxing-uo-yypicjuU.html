TechnoBuffalo it's an unboxing of this
guy BlackBerry's latest the q10 it
seated the big brother or little brother
this guy at the z10 I am really excited
take a look at this guy it's been a long
time coming it's coming to every major
carrier if you loved old-school black
range the keyboard but want that awesome
touchscreen Ness this might be for him
to take a look at let's go ahead and
open it up we've got the box for the
blackberry q10 the QWERTY keyboard pack
in blackberry 10 rock and smartphone
from the company formerly known as rim
box is much smaller than its z10 brother
doesn't have the flash of the z10 box
but perhaps the phone will make up for
that so nothing really fancy going on
around here also gonna be coming to all
major US carriers I believe we have the
AT&amp;amp;T version although I'm not entirely
sure we will take a look when we finally
opened this up which I'm very excited to
do go ahead and cut all that business
we've got some business here and now we
should be able to lift off the lid in a
very strict easy manner boom there is
the blackberry q10 looks like we've got
the unlocked version which should work
for AT&amp;amp;T LTE network so there is that
guy pushed off the side for just a
minute
obviously you couldn't tell how the
black version but also it comes in a
white see what else we are going to have
inside of Z box I should say Q box now
because it's not the z10 we've got a
lightning bolt in here which I'm
guessing has just the wall warts it does
nothing overly exciting there inside of
this we've got stuff letting you know
you got Snapdragon chips and safety
warnings and all that kind of business
that we're not gonna read we've got some
headphones with different size earbuds
and gels which is great we've got a
charging cord and the battery but you're
gonna need no holster so close you
holster lovin folks you have to look
elsewhere pull the battery out of the
plastic take a look at the size this is
actually the biggest battery that RIM
has on their current generation of
phones it's actually bigger than what's
found in the z10 and it is
2,100 milliamp hours very small and x12
keeping track at home let's take a look
at the phone and let's run through all
the specs this guy and of course will
power it on and do all that kind of
business
so the big deal here is this QWERTY
keyboard it doesn't have the same shape
as the out generation keyboards the
BlackBerry Bold 9900 which kind of had
that curved smiley look to it this one
is more phone there is a more horizontal
look to it so we'll see how that typing
works blackbirds end incredible job with
their fret locations and the keyboard
feeling I believe the keyboard is
actually a little bit larger without
9900 the key size actually changes as
you go through from the outside all the
way different this one has unified sort
of larger keys so interesting there the
screen that you are looking at here is a
square screen it's 3.1 inches it's 720
screen so it's very easy to remember 720
by 720 or even I could say 720 by 720
depending on which way you want to go
Super AMOLED screen it's powered by
blackberry 10.1 actually so it's got
some new features you can type text for
example if you want to text and you can
open up that or call if you want to call
it's powered by the same processor we've
gotten a Z tache spec aside from the
screen and keyboard it'sit's almost
identical it's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon s4 chip so it's pretty
powerful to gigs rm6 even to the
internal storage but that's not enough
for you you've got a micro SD card in
here as well that can go up to 64 camera
we've got an 8 megapixel shooter right
there and a 2 megapixel job right there
on the front 802 11 a B G and n it's 2.4
gigahertz inside gigahertz dual band
Bluetooth 4.0 21 million hundred million
power battery NFC is onboard here the
height it is a 119 point six millimeters
so that's that are four point seven one
inches sixty six point eight millimeters
on the width on the depth 10.35 and it
weighs 139 and garam let's take a look
at the back of the phone it's got sort
of a weaved glass they're calling it
feel really soft touch feels great the
white version is a bit different doesn't
have that same sort of feel to it if you
get that so bear that might have had to
change it so it wouldn't die when you
pull it in and out of yo jeans
so on the left hand side of the phone
we've got charging port and I believe
that
HDMI out and of course for sinking in
the rest of business nothing really on
the bottom except for a Mike on the
right-hand side volume up and down and
you've got a mute button in the middle
and your power and lock buttons on the
top another mic and a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack
let's pull off the back and see what
we're gonna have living inside Sepoy get
this sucker off what just lights off
alright so that's easy that is where
your SIM cards gonna live that's where
your microSD cards going to dwell and
then of course you've got your NFC radio
there as well so it's popping the
battery powered on take a real quick
look at the user interface right so
we've got the q10 all booted up and
ready to be used so this is BlackBerry
10 through and through here again as a
quick refresher on what it does or
doesn't does so go ahead and hit an
application for example if you want to
close it you can swipe up right away
though there's not that much of room
here to swipe up they got a prima start
swiping from the bottom side of the
keyboard now you connect to the
BlackBerry hub if you slide up and do a
little peek to the side you can see
what's every time anything set up there
yet $1.00 just want to close an
application he does hit that X it looks
like you can show six applications at a
time that are up and running of course
you can swipe through all of your apps
that are here it looks like Twitter and
Facebook LinkedIn and Foursquare come
out of the box and of course you can
side load a ton more Instagram really
probably being the highlight there we
get access to BlackBerry's app world as
well which has now been refreshed redone
and are ready to rock pulling down you
do so access to notifications and all
kinds of other stuff so we use this guy
for a week or so and see what I think
and we'll compare of course to the
outgoing model or the it's brother
rather the z10 you don't get that soft
keyboard you can swipe up when you get
this full physical action going on here
which I'm kind of excited to use I was a
huge blackberry fan pre iPhone days I
switched from blackberry pearl to the
original iPhone I used several others
before that so I'm excited to try this
again and see what it feels like to type
on an actual keyboard so anything you
guys want to see please leave your
comments down below into the video a
thumbs up we will most definitely
appreciate it I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you guys in
the next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
