TechnoBuffalo here unboxing one of the
smallest new members of the Gear family
this is the gear fit it does Fitness
notifications and it looks kind of cool
while doing its go ahead open it up take
a first look so here is the Box to the
Samsung gear fit in its fake wood hue uh
very similar what we see for the Galaxy
s5 and the galaxy s4 before nothing else
all really exciting on the box we got
some specs back here but we are going to
run through all that let's go ahead and
open this sucker up
boom there is the gear fit and it joins
the gear and the gear neo go ahead and
take this sucker off it's more of a
fitness man that does all kinds of cool
stuff push it off to the side for a real
quick second and see what else we're
going to have inside of the box we are
going to have this thing wall wart and
charging cord looks like it's just a
micro USB so nice that's that's included
also going to have a weird adapter I
assume that is to charge it must plug in
somewhere on the bottom and then we got
some books and that kind of stuff that's
not why you're here
here is the actual gear fit looks pretty
nice so I give you a tour of the device
and that kind of stuff but you know the
black screens knock me out exciting so
I'm gonna go ahead turn this sucker on
pair it to the phone and I'll run
through all the specs alright so we
turned it on and paired it to the galaxy
s5 and we had an update coming to it
before we could use it so that's
happening as we speak
alright so we got the Bluetooth updates
all done and now our gear fit is ready
to help us and get fit so the screen
you're looking at here is really
responsive
it's a 1.48 screen resolution of 432 by
128 I have an OLED screen 4 gigabytes of
flash storage are onboard obviously
don't have any spot to expand that as a
dual core CPU with 512 megabytes of RAM
inside a heart rate monitor and all
kinds of other sensors are here to help
you with pedometer and those sensors are
where you are going to charge it show
you guys that in just a minute the gear
fits advise not really like any other
and it goes on your wrists not unlike
any other it's got these sort of raised
points that match up
hols and you put them on your wrist that
way so makes it a one-size-fit-all so go
ahead and try and put this on a
one-handed and we'll see how that plays
out
so take the metal part that's where
those little grooves are it's a little
harder than it looks and find a spot
that works push it in and we are good to
go all right so this is on if you go
ahead and scroll through you can see
different options notifications and
media controlling settings so we're all
notifications are gonna show up emails
calls and such media control so you can
control the media on your phone
including the volume go ahead and go
back settings so it shows your battery
life for clock wallpaper you can change
the wallpaper and swipe through to find
when you like let's find a fun one how
about blue TechnoBuffalo blue we'll go
that one so gear fit wallpapers change
they're pretty easy we'll continue to
scroll through display all of your
display settings brightness wrist-worn
on with each your right wrist or your
left wrist so we'll go ahead and change
that and it's got accelerometer built
into and it'll know when you're moving
it up so you lift it up it'll turn on if
you wanted to and rotate the screen if
you want it to home sized icons font
size and just your wakeup you can see
what that is will do a clock or the last
screen I like the clock on it I will go
ahead and go back yet again double press
so double tap it'll control what you
wanted to do I've got it Steph
notifications but you can do anything
from sort of fitness stuff to not doing
anything and continuing our scroll
profile you got privacy lock on it and
then just some info so go ahead and go
all the way back and now it's blue and
that's what it's gonna look like on your
wrist so I'm going to show you some of
the cool things that it can do let's go
ahead and check out the exercise stuff
here so heart rate is one of the big
ones here so here's how it works we'll
go ahead and select start and position
the gear fit on my wrist and that's
where it is with the check button it's
measuring my heart rate the caring I am
still alive hopefully I still am we can
use it as sort of like a lie-detector
test you never said yet you guys just
asked me questions
do I really have bias do I not have bias
and you can see it I guess it's working
I guess that's my heart it is I told you
gear fit measuring I would go ahead and
do it again and
after measuring all right so tiny you
can see that sucker working right there
I also serve as a pedometer and sort of
other kind of cool things I think this
is probably one of the most exciting of
the year line you get notifications and
such that you get from the original year
or the new gear or the gear neo but you
also get to a smaller sort of less dorky
looking thing on your wrist you also get
some customizations and most importantly
CI notifications are right there
I will say though right now it's only
working with a few Samsung devices
galaxy s5 really being among them don't
over think opens up to other Android
devices or any Android devices at all so
definitely get it if you think that
you're gonna use a Galaxy s5 with it so
what'd you guys think about the gear fit
would you use it would you not use it do
you like the way it looks is it too
silly for you I want to hear all of your
thoughts of course anything you want to
see covered leave it in the comments
