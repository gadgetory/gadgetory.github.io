lakers comm i've been lucky enough to
have the blackberry storm kicking around
for a few days now and the first thing I
thought when I heard about the device
was how's it gonna stack up to the
iPhone so I want to do a head-to-head
comparison with you guys of the
blackberry storm versus the iPhone I'm
gonna show you scrolling I'm gonna show
you internet browsing I'm gonna show you
everything so let's go ahead and get
started
move the camera down here so here you've
got an iPhone 3G running on 18 T's 3G
network with full bars and here we've
got the blackberry storm on Verizon's
EVDO network with full bars so it should
be a very fair comparison so the first
interesting thing about the storm and
you really can't talk about the device
without mentioning its touchscreen so
essentially has to touch mechanisms you
can just touch the device once lightly
and you can see that it highlights it
kind of cool and you can also push in
actually push it's a whole screen in and
that feels almost identical to the
trackpad on the new MacBooks and the new
MacBook Pros something to keep in mind
if you can't get your hands on the storm
go into an Apple Store push down the
keyboard that's exactly what the storm
screen feels like so we'll go back we'll
go back and go home here the iPhone in
the other hand when you touch it it's a
simple touch no pushing mechanism
branding and it's very clean scrolling
so the best way to show scrolling I
think is probably just to go to contacts
let's go ahead and go to contacts here
as you can see you can scroll very
quickly flick scroll so as you let go it
still keeps going and then slows down
very fluid and very smooth let's go
ahead and look at scrolling on contacts
again on the blackberry storm very
smooth scrolling as well but it only
Scrolls as far as your finger goes so
eat as soon as you take your finger off
the screen the scrolling stops some
people may enjoy that some may not I
prefer the iPhones way of flick
scrolling so you should get flick your
screen across it this is definitely a
little bit different and it's taking
some getting used to but it's not bad
and while your Phoenix finger is on it
and you are doing the scrolling it is
very very very
so that is nice really is gonna depend
on your personal preference so another
thing people have been looking forward
to about the device is the browser the
browser is the big deal so let's go
ahead and show you that right away and
dive right into it
BlackBerry's not been known for their
outstanding browsers although they did
get better with the BlackBerry Bold for
AT&amp;amp;T the blackberry storm is supposed to
take it one step further so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you guys that right now
I'm gonna go ahead and load it up John
for Lakers calm on both devices
alright so John for Lakers calm is cued
up and ready to go and again it got 3G
coverage on both phones now it's down to
two bars on AT&amp;amp;T and full bars on a
video but ett advertises their network
as the fastest 3G one available so we'll
be the judge of that
I'll hit these here right at the same
time make sure it's a fair test
and we're off looks like the storm is
loading in a little bit quicker
although the iPhone may catch up well
there's already text on the storm
actually the storm is already done
actually loaded up much quicker than
than the iPhone the iPhone is still
loading I'll let it finish up here so
scrolling while you're on the Internet
is very similar to scrolling for
instance when you're in contacts it's a
very fluid scroll but it's only scrolls
as far as your finger prints is the
iPhone do the flick scrolling and will
scroll as far as you flick it um for the
iPhone for zooming you can pinch in and
pinch out and you can also double tap
while there is not a pinch in and pinch
out zoom functionality the storm does
have the double tap resume consumed
right it and you also have zoom plus and
zoom minus here so you can zoom in
further using those or zoom out using
the soft keys that show up on the screen
overall internet browsing on the storm
is a very enjoyable experience and
really comes close to
matching the iPhones browsing it doesn't
quite come come up to it the iPhone
still has a superior browser as far as
look and feel and navigation but the
storms is again excellent excellent
excellent so if you're on Verizon and
you don't want to switch and browsing is
important to you really the blackberry
storm is a great way to go so the next
thing people want to see I think aside
from the browser the keyboards how do
you type on this thing it's got the
weird button screen let's go ahead and
show how that works and I'm gonna
compare it to the iPhone I'll tell you
guys which one I prefer more so the
keyboard on the iPhone you guys are all
familiar with let me go ahead and show
you both all right so I've got a new
text message here up on each screen and
you're probably familiar with the
iPhones keyboard it only stays in
portrait mode here oh sorry only sees in
landscape mode does not go to portrait
for regular typing so it's not that bad
to type on I've been using an iPhone for
about a year and a half now and I've
gotten very quick at it oh there was a
learning curve so I'm gonna go ahead and
type something here and see how it goes
I'm just gonna use I shall use my
thumb's like normal I'll type hi my name
is John for Lakers okay see how fast I
am John for Lakers so I was relatively
close hi my enemy is John for Lakers
missing an a in there but still pretty
close and pretty accurate now the
blackberry storm actually has two
keyboards it's got this blackberry pearl
shirt type s keyboard when the phone is
in portrait and it goes to a full
landscape keyboard when it's in
landscape so I'm go ahead and try both
for you so again type hi my name is John
for Lakers and see how it goes
and again it's not such a fair
comparisons I've been using the iPhone
for a while now and I've only had this
for a few days all right
hi my name is John for Lakers actually
what's pretty quick and pretty accurate
with be sure type keyboard let's go
ahead and try that in the landscape mode
so I'll turn it rotated sideways you see
it changes right there and you put your
finger over a key actually grill glows
blue which is a kind of a cool effect so
go ahead and try tapping on this one and
I'll give you guys my preference in a
minute after I show you hi my name is
John for Lakers all right so I got hi my
name is gin for liquored so not quite so
accurate I actually prefer typing on the
blackberry storm when it's in shirt type
the keys are a lot easier to type on
when you're on the iPhone in your typing
you have your finger over a key it
actually highlights above at what you're
typing so you can see what key are
typing even when your thumb is over it
the storm it glows blue but you can't
instantly see where that glow is coming
from so it's much easier to type for me
in the shirt type keyboard when you have
a little more screen real estate to work
with although as you saw typing in the
shirt type is actually pretty quick and
relatively easy
I had a blackberry pearl before hands so
getting used to this is a very nice
adjustment let me go ahead and move this
up and talk about the devices a little
bit more so what should you get an
iPhone or a blackberry storm and we'll
go ahead and assume maybe price isn't an
issue because they both come in at just
about the same price of $1.99 for the a
gigabyte iPhone the blackberry storm if
you're on Verizon and you don't want to
switch the blackberry storm is a
fantastic way to go absolutely fantastic
way to go if you're running teen teen
you don't want to switch obviously the
iPhones music way to go those are really
cut and dry situations what if your
contract is up and you're on Sprint your
contract up and you're on AT&amp;amp;T or
Verizon and you give a choice with what
phone you want
you want to go with well here's my
recommendation email on the blackberry
is fantastic email on the iPhone not so
fantastic I have mentioned it in plenty
of videos and I'm not happy with the
email service
so if email and messaging is paramount
to you and browsing experience is
secondary go with the blackberry you
won't be disappointed if browsing is
most important to you an email is sort
of a secondary thing then go for the
iPhone the browsing experience really
can't be beat
you know storage isn't really an issue
either way the storm comes with an 8
gigabyte SD card but you can micro sd
cred rather but you can update to 16
gigs so you can really get the same
amount of storage both ways they both
have media players and photo viewers you
can flick through I'm not gonna show you
guys all that right now but just know
that all those features are there the
blackberry storm
I said I'll show you in a minute does
feature an app store but it's not quite
as robust as Apple's let me go ahead and
show you guys that now actually so let
me move that down so the wit will get
bigger I assume as device becomes more
popular was just released today to the
public so we'll hit the BlackBerry menu
and full up pull up the full menu here
you can scroll through up and down
you've got an applications window right
there and that launches rims new version
of their app store you can see just a
few things in here right now visual
voicemail Verizon Navigator Yahoo
Messenger Google Talk Windows Live and
right now it's all free and just for
comparison purposes I'll launch the App
Store here oh I'm sure most you guys
have seen it a little bit slow so it's
gonna pull up some top 25 applications
but even option to purchase here with
the iPhone you're stuck with in Apple's
walled garden so to speak with Ram
you're still in a little bit of walled
garden but you've got more flexibility
for third-party apps you'd be able to
put blackberry applications that aren't
in the App Store on here which is nice
you get a little a little more device
custom ability so guys can I recommend
one device or the other to be honest I
really can't they're both excellent in
their own right and they both bring
something different to the table so
probably just confused you a little bit
more
I recommend going to the Verizon store
and playing with a blackberry storm but
be patient with it there is a definite
steep learning curve to getting used to
the device and getting used to the
clicky screen a little bit odd and be
sure to go to AT&amp;amp;T and get a chance to
look at the iPhone or your Apple Store
so guys John Rhett enger' from John four
