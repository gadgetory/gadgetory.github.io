notification Johnna following me I found
out like a few days before Father's Day
and I knew that this was something I
wanted to do to give back to my own
family especially my dad so over my
years on YouTube we've done giveaways
but we've never done anything like this
so I am outside of Best Buy here in
Costa Mesa we teamed up with the folks
at Hisense to do not just a giveaway but
also a shopping spree with an actual
person so I'd like you to meet Steven
come on in so we did a contest on
Instagram where you can enter to win
$1000 Best Buy shopping spree a really
awesome high sense TV and again a big
THANK YOU to Hisense response to this
giveaway so we're gonna go ahead into
Best Buy
we got Steven here we're gonna put him
on the clock and see what he can find
from Best Buy in 90 seconds let's do it
I love entertaining and I love having my
my friends are my family over all the
time so and with the summer times the
summer coming up I knew I wanted to have
my house hooked up definitely my
thermostats high up on my list just
something about just being Ben and being
able to just adjust the temperature
really speaks to me here we're kind of a
house divided but now I'm leaning more
towards a Google home cuz it just works
with like my legacy programs like Google
photos my calendar just everything just
syncs up and it works so the pricing of
TVs has gone like the opposite of
smartphones
they've gone way down but the quality
has gone way up so this is a high sense
h8 series this is actually h8f so things
you'll hear it's a 4k set it's using
high senses you LED technology it's got
a P Q algorithm uses a little bit of
magic to boost color and contrast gently
to make the picture look good and then
since this Android TV you had access to
things like Google assistant so you can
just talk to the TV look at software
updates make sure it's gonna be
supported for years to come
it's a pretty cool OS and you get all
the apps you need
I'm gonna plug in another box hood it's
got full array local dimming it's got
support for Dolby vision HDR the card
game it's super super wide and was
importantly it looks bright 700 nits of
brighten has put the sucker up on a wall
it's going to look good really thin
bezels and you can't beat it
for the price for a 50 inch it's $400 if
you want to step up to the 55 inch it's
gonna be 500 bucks so again half the
price of a flagship smartphone you are
getting a really good-looking TV there
pretty much everything for you so the
reason we are here is about to start
you've got 90 seconds and a thousand
dollar budget to get whatever you want
and Best Buy I am setting the clock for
you your marks get set go
often
yeah okay thanks
could use Dyson fan huh missing choice
by 10 4 3 2 right down
pretty well all right Stephen get a
pretty good job Thanks run through best
friend I think you got a I think your
eyes are a little bigger than the budget
a little bit so thousand dollars to
cover I should tell you that we're gonna
cover taxes okay so we're gonna go on
just the cost of products
sounds good time so we went with the
50-inch TV yep all right so it's 400
bucks Kent 600 bucks left out of what's
here okay
I've got all the prices in front of me
so what's your priority smart home smart
okay yeah I was looking to getting like
a Google Home Hub all right home hub is
99 bucks actually on sale cool and then
let's see summertime so I'm keep the
house pretty cool but also control for
my phone I'm gonna go with the Nest
Learning Thermostat I use the nests at
home love the nest two hundred and forty
nine bucks okay at 250 bucks left 50
bucks left let's go with you she lights
104 bucks left
losing what are you thinking 104 bucks
look uh wait man headphones are out
headphones are out iPhones are out yeah
and then the Dyson you got to figure
things out there that's 400 bucks I mean
that's cool that is literally yeah my
family go with the outdoor camera all
right so the outdoor cam is 169 bucks so
I'll add that for a total of 1,000 and
65 of the 65 bucks we will cover the
extra Oh see you shake home 100% on so
you can take home I read that you want
appreciated graduations thank you so
much what got me into technology was
really just being around my grandfather
growing up he was always a tinkerer in
like his home always mess with like
audio stuff and just having a
fascination of it and I kind of
gravitated towards us so that kind of is
still bad in me growing up I would do
sports I was in soccer and I would see a
lot of the kids and their parents there
but my parents were always at work and
for the longest time I kind of low is
like how I presented them for that but
looking back on it I realized that
they're out there
working hard to provide a better life
for me and now that I'm going up I want
to do it from that I can to pay them
back and do what I can to provide so
thousand dollars down at Best Buy
