TechnoBuffalo here at the full review
for you of the HTC first the very first
phone to ship with Facebook home right
out of the box this phone packs a lot of
punch for a $99 price let's go ahead
give it a full review see if it's worth
your phone buying buck let's go ahead
and get started as part of our pledge to
Rawdon so we always disclose how long we
use the phone before our review was
filmed or written so use this guy for a
little over four and a half days um so
one point that I want to drive home
throughout the course this review is
this is a $99 phone so to compare it
spec wise with flagships the HTC One or
the galaxy s4 aren't quite fair so look
at this from the mindset of just under
$100 phone um so let me go ahead and run
through the specs very quickly and then
we'll talk about the phone itself just
to refresh you in case you forgot what
the HTC first is pakad so it's got a 4.3
inch 720p so that's 1280 by 720 with a
ppi of 342 again that's a 720p screen
Android 4.1 at launch boots fingers
crossed 4.2 will be coming powering it
is a 1.4 Gertz qualcomm dual-core chip
that is the 8 9 3 0 0 mm if you're
keeping track at home
Giga RAM 16 gigs of storage there is
non-removable here so you're stuck with
16 you're gonna have a 5 megapixel
shooter lives are right there on the
back LED flash the front camera has a
1.6 Meg's because shooter it's got 802
11 a B G and n Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 a
2000 milliamp hour battery it does have
NFC 3.5 millimeter headset jack and
charges to weigh every other phone
charges nowaday via microUSB alright so
we went to the specs let's talk a little
bit more about this guy so this is the
first phone to ship right out the box
with facebook home now you can download
Facebook home on other devices and get a
Facebook home experience but this was
sort of the reference phone for how it
was going to work Facebook has claimed
that they are going to update this on a
monthly basis so this might change as
the phone gets new features so we broke
up this review essentially two parts
there's a whole separate review
Facebook home so you want to take a look
at that hit the link down below or if
you want to hit it they'll put an
annotation right above it as well
alright so let's talk about how this guy
first and foremost works as a bone and
it works pretty well so we tested it
with AT&amp;amp;T s 4G LTE network and it
oftentimes backfilled to HSPA+ and
worked great we didn't have any dropped
calls it used to be something that I was
you know would make a point um it's
coming more and more come out all the
phones we test no drop called issues at
all antenna was relatively strong we
held it next to the HTC One were able to
test how many bars of LTE or HSPA+ we
had that was almost the same across the
board so no issue there at all with the
antenna strength the speaker though kind
of stinks it's certainly not the best
I've listened to a phone call your
newsing speaker phone's gonna sound a
little bit tinny music and games don't
sound very good on it as well so as I
mentioned Facebook home was done in a
full review so if you wanted to get a
walkthrough of how it works how it
integrates hit the link down below the
moral though that it makes doing
anything non Facebook related a giant
pain I will say though the UI is
absolutely beautiful
Facebook engineers did a really nice job
with how they made Facebook home look
but again if you wanted something that's
not Facebook centric it takes a few
extra steps so we gave Facebook home a 5
out of 10 but there's much more than
facebook home to the HTC first which is
why we broke that up into two separate
reviews so build quality here is now
typical HTC which is about Spiricom
phones I can give a phone
it's absolutely outstanding I really
like the way the phone feels here in my
hand it almost feels like a spiritual
successor to the HTC One S you know
although certainly it's not the soft
touch back feels great although
certainly if you've got a little bit
sweat on your hands you are going to see
it it feels a little softer to the touch
than it did on say the Droid DNA
Facebook and learns from phone to phone
this is a really nice job the build
quality outstanding volume buttons are
easy to press and the phone feel really
sell it in your hands which not
something I could say for pretty much
every $99 phone out there the phone is
also pretty zippy too it's being powered
by a dual-core chip which has plenty of
power but when I was playing games or
watching videos doing normal phone stuff
no issues with slowdown at all I know
you guys are gonna want to know the
quadrant score on this was 5048 which
put it close to on par score wise with
the HTC One X in case you're keeping
track at home it's again pretty decent
score it's not the most technical way to
evaluate a phone but is a score that we
use for every Android phone we test and
again bear in mind this is not a
flagship phone this phone that does have
a pretty awesome secret pure
unadulterated Android mean it's all with
just a few taps actually pretty easy so
if you want to get some pure Android
experience tap descri
drag your icon and go on up to apps
depending with app screen Orion if
you're in this one with your shortcuts
or if you want to scroll on over to the
left you will see it Facebook home
settings you can also access it via the
menu button and you can turn off
Facebook home we'll go ahead and turn
that sucker right off and we have now
pure unadulterated Android so let's
select the launcher we'll use that just
once now we've got unaltered Android 4.1
store the phone for me gets really
really interesting for 99 bucks you get
a nexus s experience not quite full neck
cycle it's not running for point two it
won't get updates as quickly as a
traditional Nexus device but it does
have LTE which the Nexus 4 does not so
that's important to you this might be a
pretty solid choice to consider the
camera quality here was pretty average
something great certainly not gonna be
Ansel Adams with the camera here but
average low-light performance pictures
looks fine if you want upload them to
Facebook or put them on Instagram
cameras gonna serve you just fine um so
you get pure Android as you would on any
other Android phone but you can also
have chat heads that can run on you know
in your native Android experience or
inside any application you could turn
that off too if you want but chat ads
with my favorite features of Facebook
coments I like to be able to merge the
two worlds so this phone really does
offer something interesting there were
times when I liked having facebook home
on about the waiting for my wife I can
scroll through pictures now if I want to
really use the phone to do anything else
like the fact they could turn it right
off very easily so I think Facebook HTC
did a really nice job with that actually
so I'd have liked the phone to have had
a moveable storage and removable battery
for me the moveable battery isn't that
big a deal I carry external battery
chargers but I know for some of you that
is definitely a deal-breaker locking
into 16 gigs of storage again would have
liked to have had the option to pop in
an SD card so that is definitely not
here so if you need a phone that's gonna
have removable battery or gonna have
extra move about storage know that going
in so know that if you need them you
know eight batteries carry with you it's
not the phone to choose but if you can
live with the limitations you're gonna
have a great option a phone choices here
battery life in that mm lamp our battery
is actually pretty good Oh a typical
phone usage which for me
takes the phone off the charge around 7
o'clock about an hour and a half to two
hours of phone calls usually connect it
to Wi-Fi
either at home or the office some
text-messaging some social meeting media
stuff some picture uploading browsing
some videos and some light games I was
able to get home and put it on the
charger around 11 o'clock to midnight
with well over 40% of battery life so
this was a very strong performer the
phone's getting a lot of negative press
I don't think it's justified if this
phone was sold spec wise as a pure
Android experience with no facebook home
on it I think people would be all over
it and the fact you can have the option
turn that on or off now this one should
be really one you should look at I
really enjoyed using it and I think
Facebook home and a Facebook delivers
monthly updates this could be a pretty
nice option to have so the final score
this phone gets a very solid 7.5 it
brings a lot to the table I like the
fact that I had Facebook home I like the
fact that I could turn it off if I had
no option to turn Facebook home off this
would have been a very different score
I'm betting this phone set out to do to
bring Facebook right to your home screen
it definitely succeeded with that but
that experience might not be for
everybody so HTC really has a nice
surprise giving you that unadulterated
Android experience so love to hear guys
