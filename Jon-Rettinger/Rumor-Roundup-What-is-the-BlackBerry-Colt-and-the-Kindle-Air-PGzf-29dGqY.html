to you by Squarespace what is a cult
that CEO LT the horse not see you LT the
thing that people ascribe to when
they're kind of in trouble or as a cult
have to do with the future of blackberry
why is Amazon buying up domain names
like Kindle air are the first Google Ice
Cream Sandwich phones coming out on
october and if so is it to combat the
release of iphone 5 so you couldn't get
through even the opening without an
iphone 5 rumor mentioned why because the
show is about rumors it's rumor roundup
from TechnoBuffalo hey what is going on
everybody and welcome to the roundup my
name is Noah Kravitz on the
editor-at-large for Tecna Buffalo and
this is rumor roundup for the week
ending today Friday August 12 2011 this
week's episode of techno Buffalo rumor
roundup is brought to you by our friends
at Squarespace meantime rumors this week
that Blackberry research in motion
blackberry hard at work on their first
qnx based smartphone code named colt now
if you've been following the mobile
folding world you know this has not been
a good year for blackberry everybody
from me to that other guy TechnoBuffalo
have been talking a lot about how
blackberry is in big trouble the whole
co-ceo model under scrutiny etc etc the
one bright spot has been their
next-generation operating system qnx
which is now available on the blackberry
playbook tablet even though that tablet
had a few problems of its own the
operating system actually pretty good to
use pretty cool and a lot of people
would love to see that on a blackberry
smartphone well rumors from earlier this
week say that the first qnx based
smartphone the colt is well into
production or at least in the research
and development phase and blackberry
wants to push her into production sooner
than later but they're having problems
with it first of all they can only get
the system running supposedly on a
single core processor based hardware and
not a dual core phone and as you know if
you follow the mobile phone space dual
core phones are all the rage blackberry
really needs a high-end flagship phone
to capture some new mind share as well
as keep the blackberry faithful loyal to
the brand second problem which is an
even bigger deal is apparently they're
having a lot of problems getting qnx to
play right with blackberry enterprise
server and blackberry messaging service
which are two I mean really that's
BlackBerry's bread and butter right
there because they can't get it working
with bes or BBM all kinds of problems so
stay tuned for that again it's good to
see black we're kind of ramping up
production of the smartphone they know
they have to do something something to
stay in the game and keep competing with
the legs of iphone android and you know
possibly windows phone 7 and paw i keep
saying palm webos HP if they can get
their act together as well the QNX big
part of it they got to get BBM and BES
working speaking of the smartphone wars
and those two phones i mentioned that
everybody is trying to catch up with or
just stay in the game with at this point
Google and Apple Android and iOS
threatening to turn the global
smartphone market into a two-horse race
before we start laughing before you
start calling me a fanboy look at some
of the recent numbers I'm just talking
numbers I'm just time to tuck in
momentum a lot of the world not yet on
smartphones but the way things are going
you know the majority of the world could
be on either an android-based smartphone
or an iOS smartphone and speaking of
that war this fall it heats up again
with the likely introduction of apples
next-generation iphone the iphone 5
whatever it's going to be called and the
next breed of android-based devices
running Google's Ice Cream Sandwich
build of android well some rumors this
week that Google is working with
partners to push up the release of the
first Ice Cream Sandwich devices to this
October why to compete with iphone
iphone 5 which everybody is expecting
now to be introduced and released in the
early October time frame Ice Cream
Sandwich was previewed talked about
teased at Google i/o a few months ago
Apple has not officially talked about
the next iPhone but I OS 5 has already
been announced currently out in beta
phone will be coming out in the fall
everybody's
specting new hardware to go with it and
so it would make sense that Google would
want to roll out the first ice cream
sandwiches devices to keep people either
loyal to the Android platform or even to
head them off from buying an iphone 5 if
they can get those devices to market
before Apple gets their new iPhones to
market either way looks like you'll see
some new iPhones some new google based
android phones some ice cream sandwiches
some horses i guess blackberry some
mango from Windows Phone who knows what
else on store shelves in time for you to
pick one up and put it under your
Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush or
wherever it is you put your presence

and last but certainly not least amazon
has been buying up domain names
according to reports this week and who
is domain registry information amazon
has purchased the domains kindle eircom
kindle social network calm and kindle
social networking com why well that's
why we're here right to make rumors out
of domain names could amazon be prepping
something called the kindle air and even
thinner lighter just begging to be sued
by apple's lawyers version of the kindle
honestly probably not I mean Kindles
already thin it's already light and
launching a product called Kindle air
would really
begging Apple to file a lawsuit
especially based on the way apples been
you know treating the court system and
their competitors lately that being said
amazon also just launched their Kindle
Cloud Reader service so they've got a
whole cloud thing air thing going on I
don't know I guess there could be a
kindle air that's based on all sorts of
cloud services we've been speculating
for months about an Amazon tablet coming
that's not just an e-reader but actually
an android-based tablet that will
probably linked into all of those cloud
services media services including
Amazon's music locker and their
streaming video services and all that
kind of stuff so who knows but Kindle
air kindle social network kindle social
networking apparently all registered
recently to amazon remains to be seen
maybe they're just trying to outdo Apple
at Apple's own game registering domains
doing kind of controlled leaked things
to create a big buzz it certainly worked
for apple Apple's backed it up with
products that people want to buy then
again Amazon's been doing well selling
kindle selling everything else under the
sun for that matter so mayor there you
know maybe they're trying to get into
the hole consumer electronics hardware
game tablets that is not just a--
readers by following a viral marketing
strategy if you will that's work for
apple remains to be seen stay tuned all
right that'll do it for this week's
edition of the roundup again thanks to
