a lot of things that have changed since
the last generation the biggest one
obviously is the addition of an OLED
strip dubbed the touch bar this is going
to change interact based on what app you
are using if you're placing the function
keys that have been on Apple laptop
since well the beginning of Apple
laptops the function keys are still
there that is not always present if you
want to access them hit a button on the
touch bar and they will pop up a few
things know about the touch bar though
there's no haptic feedback in there and
I can get any sort of sound when you
touch it so like all MacBook Pros before
it these do not come cheap
we've got the entry-level 15-inch model
here also available in 13-inch with the
touch bar and the lesser one in the
13-inch size without the touch bar the
15-inch is going to start at 20 399
which again what we have then get you a
2.6 gigahertz quad-core i7 can go as
high as a 2.9 gigahertz quad-core i7
this is a 6 gen chip so skylake no Cabul
8 here
Ram is going to be set at 16 gigs and
we've got the Radeon Pro 450 with 2 gigs
of memory we can up that to the 460 with
4 gigs of ram so depending on which size
MacBook Pro you get the speedy RAM is
going to change the 15 we have here is
21 33 megahertz in its ddr3 the SSD
speed should be pretty fast to go all
the way up to 2 terabytes and it's
pcie-based I've got a new color here as
well we don't have it but there is a new
color we've got silver but Space Gray is
also available before you do any
unboxing the first thing you're going to
need is an unnecessary knife and a
slight fear you might chop off your
finger once you get over that you take
off the plastic remove the top and there
is your brand new MacBook Pro push it
off to the side for a quick sec you'll
see what else is underneath you're going
to be greeted by a booklet which is
going to have some instructions and also
two white Apple stickers
so sitting right below that is Apple's
new power brick it's 87 watts you don't
have any sort of cabling attached to it
anymore you just have a port for the
USBC cable which is included as well but
not includes any sort of extension but
nice thing Apple did continue to include
you can go ahead and pull off the prongs
you can add an extension cable there or
if you're traveling abroad you can
another tip opening up your MacBook Pro
notice that it's going to boot up that's
a new thing here with generation of
MacBook Pros you're also not going to
have the familiar ding that we used to
have also not here is the glowing Apple
logo found on the back so if you want
the glowy logo you need the last gen
taking the MacBook Pro out of the box
you notice it's still a pretty big
laptop 15-inch is not for the small
laptop fans but it is much lighter
it's a half pound lighter than the last
gen as your computer boots up you're
good notice it's going to ask you to set
up touch ID which is sitting to the
right of the touch bar it's a 2nd gen
sensor so it's pretty fast and it's
covered in sapphire glass that should be
pretty durable as well it's also a
physical button you can actually push it
and you can do everything you can do a
touch ID on your iPhone you can unlock
your computer and you can also use Apple
pay an icing here with touch ID if you
share your computer with someone when
they put their finger on that sensor
it'll log them into their profile so
Apple talked a lot about the display on
the new MacBook Pros resolution is the
same same 15 4 inch diagonal LED backlit
display IPS technology
the resolution is 28 80 by 1800 with 220
pixels per inch with support for
millions of colors but the big story
here is the brightness in 67 percent
brighter it's 500 nits and now supports
a cinema p3 standard so you can get a
wider color gamut
well test that down we do our full
review there's better anti-reflective
coating on here as well which is
immediately noticeable so if use your
computer outside for example you're
going to really appreciate that in a lot
of ways new MacBook Pro looks like a
grown up blown-up
MacBook and that's true with the
keyboard as well using the second gen
butterfly keys that we seen in the
MacBook and the keys for the most part
feel very similar to that but there's a
little more key throw a lot of people
seem oddly up in arms the keyboard is
loud didn't seem any louder to me than
any other laptop keyboard that I've used
the backlights important to you each key
now has its own individual LEDs so you
won't get any of that bleed we used to
have a blast chance and after you get
over the fact your computers got an OLE
edge strip you're going to notice that
just ginormous force touch trackpad and
one of the concerns I had with that was
how is gonna handle palm rejection
because there's no way to use that
keyboard with those new butterfly
switches without resting your palms on
the keyboard and initial tests it work
but again we do a full review we'll put
those two paces a little bit more so
keeping with the theme of kind of
looking like a Big Mac beau he got the
same integrated hinge there's no more
plastic on the back like you saw on the
last gen MacBook Pros and the vents are
now hidden inside of the hinge and on
the 15-inch there also on the sides so
let's talk about ports for lack of ports
that are found on the new MacBook Pros a
15 inch is going to have four USB see
type-c ports that are also Thunderbolt
three so Thunderball is going to give
you support up to 40 gigabits per second
it's got USB 3.1 gen2 which give you
speeds up to 10 gigabits per second
until USB C becomes ubiquitous you're
going to need a lot of dongles but you
can do a lot with those ports if you
have the adapters for them so USB C you
can support native DisplayPort
Thunderbolt 3 you can do VGA HDMI and
Thunderbolt 2 output you can do a lot of
stuff with those ports you can power
multiple 5k displays they can do quite a
bit but again dongles on dongles on
dongles the battery's been shrunk down
the MacBook Pro is well but apples claim
you get 10 hours of wireless web but I
am definitely going to test that much
like the MacBook we no longer have
MagSafe to charge this laptop up if you
miss it again you're going to look for
last gen I'm not gonna mind MagSafe
being gone always seems a little flimsy
and popped out too quickly for me but
I'm gonna miss having that LED indicator
let me know which charging but I guess
when you plug in you still get to the
audio tones let you know something's
happening that's our first impressions
of the new MacBook Pro I'm excited to
test it to use it zero performs anything
particular you guys want to test let me
know the comments I'll be reading
through those to see what we want to
focus on give the video a thumbs up we
appreciate it until next time I'm John
