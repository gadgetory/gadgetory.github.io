TechnoBuffalo here every few months I'd
like to show you how I set up my tablet
set up my phone so I figured switching
to a new tablet I would show you what's
on my Android I'm a simple man with
simple tablet needs I figured I'd show
you what I've got what apps I have maybe
you guys can show me what apps you have
and things I might be missing widget
wise or customization wise so we're
using the Nexus 9 it's endowed with the
latest version of a lot of pop what I
usually keep on my tablet of things that
I want to look at in the morning usually
when I do most of my tablet stuff either
when I wake up or at night so my
calendar is most important to me I like
to see news be able to scroll through
what's happening the world this is just
a Google widget pulls in from a ton of
different news sources as well as the
weather across the top and usually down
below here I've got what our traffic was
the day before and then the next day and
that kind of stuff that I removed it for
this particular video on the next really
don't keep much here I used to just have
a giant mail widget there but I kind of
stopped using it I just now open up the
app and I just have two rows of icons
throughout let me show you the apps that
I've got what I've got installed here so
the first thing I want to show you is
the YouTube creator studio if you are
youtuber you make videos this is an
incredible app to use the first thing is
if you ever get stuck on that 3:03 you
want to see what your view count is this
is a great way to do it actually I'll
show you it's close to real-time stats
that you can on your videos so where's
the regular video might show on the 32
thousand views I'm going to show you
what it actually is at 39,000 makes life
way easier and as the video starts
earning it'll start showing the dollar
amounts here it takes a few days to
update though this video got uploaded
yesterday you can respond to comments
delete comments and such I keep all my
secondary social media and a folder I've
got my Linkedin my Instagram which is
John Rhett injure my snapchat they don't
know how to use its also John Rhett
injure Dropcam I watched my son in the
morning Stevie's up if I gotta wake him
up we've got a drop cam installed in his
room and again I use this mostly in the
morning at night so that's been really
helpful for me calendar and this is
something Keeler from Android that
switches profiling ringing it not
ringing it is totally non useful to me I
just haven't moved it out of the way yet
so it's still there the Twitter app
Facebook app I don't use that all that
off the usual I just used a website and
this this is my favorite app that I
think on my entire
have what it's called cloud magic I'll
close it so mighty nose and show up if
you're looking for a good email client
this is just hands-down the best
I don't have the paid version you can
buy it but it looks good you can set up
with any email account you can check it
from the web - if you wanted to the paid
version as soon as you log in all your
accounts will show up there it just
worked out really really well for me I
used to like the old native email app
but since they tied it in with Gmail now
I sort of shied away from it this has
been a really good option of course you
got Chrome YouTube and then Google Play
oh and the next screen I got Skype
storage I've moved all of my photos and
stuff syncing away from Dropbox actually
over to onedrive which is worked out
really well so that's how I get all my
photos from iOS to talk nicely to my
Android devices and by first I haven't
tried onedrive you should you get a lot
of free storage for it now SugarSync is
what I use to sync all of my files from
my desktop computer work to the one at
home it just syncs automatically it's
really nice I've an s thermostat at home
I've got a problem with the music play
it more than I should
camera and photo just a stock Google
options other stuff in here that maybe
you don't know analytics widget if you
want to sort of check your analytics on
your website it's a nice tool with Chase
Bank clock
there's cloud medic that I talked about
I do a lot on Google Docs so I've got
those options here as well who will
finance for managing my portfolio G
Analytics offers real time management of
your site you want to see what your
traffic is in real time
pretty Suites a little widget and
application to use Google Finance again
for managing portfolio Hulu all vs.
stuff that's kind of familiar sling
player to use my sling player at home
VLC lets me open up potential files I
might open that might not be supported
by the native player SugarSync again and
then Yahoo weather like I said a pretty
simple man pretty simple tablet needs
and this just works very very well for
me I also love Google now so I use that
all the time sort of go through and see
my sports scores see what stocks are
doing you know see whether all that kind
of stuff this is really handy to have
and that's it for me I don't have that
much on my tablet I like to keep things
simple I don't like to overwhelm myself
with apps I don't play that many games
on the tablet
either it's a Productivity and the video
consumption too
for me so that's my tablet that's what I
got if you think I'm missing anything or
want to show me yours I would love to
see it again if I showed you mine maybe
you'll show me yours anyway guys these
video a thumbs up for a tablet that ups
love to know again what you guys have
leave in the comments down below until
next time I'm John Ritter from
TechnoBuffalo talk to you guys next
video we stopped the video just real
fast to thank our friends good peeps at
Lenovo if you guys thought yoga was just
about cat Crowe and dog poses you my
friend are terribly mistaken let me tell
you about the yoga tablet 2 pro so this
thing's got a built-in projector it
actually can put up to a 50 inch image
on any wall or screen essentially just
mobilizing your home theater it's
rocking a 13.3 inch 2560 by 1440 pixel
display a front-facing stereo Dolby
surround sound speaker and powered by
Intel's latest atom processors this
thing is actually perfect for work and
play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
