technobuffalo here if you love the HTC
One but it's too big perhaps your tiny
little hands I've got your answer this
is the HTC one mini takes everything
about its big brother and shrinks it
down to a more compact size let's open
it up and take a look alright so here is
the box for the HTC one mini looking
very nondescript only way you know
what's in it is right there HTC One me
go ahead and open the sucker up it's
available now from AT&amp;amp;T I'll go ahead
and pull all the stuff off to the side
and there is our friend we took a look
at this guy in international variants
but have not yet seen it I'll dolled up
for us carrier so push it off the side
for just a quick second sim removal tool
for removing your SIM card is a micro
sim that lives inside of this phone
we're also going to get HTC stickers for
show and your high-tech computer love
we've got some safety and regulatory
guides doesn't appear to have any
headphones in the box just a syncing and
charging cable and a wall work but yay
stickers which all that off the side for
just a quick second and here is the
phone and it's 4.3 inch screen glory
peel all that stuff off and will power
it on versus the regular HTC One it's a
4.7 inch grade and so my keen math
skills tell me that there is a point 4
inch difference on both of those phones
it is a 720p display so that's 1280 by
720 if you can do your quick math in
your head that is a 342 PPI powered by
Android 4.2 points to jellybean with
Sense 5 on top of it a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 processor so the still
should be plenty of speed here a 1 gig
of ram 16 gigs of storage but no room
for expandable storage also you can't
take this battery out is an eighteen
hundred million power battery camera on
the back is the same camera that we
really loved on HTC One the for ultra
pixel camera on the front we've a 1.6
megapixel shooter as opposed to the two
megapixel found on the regular HTC One
802 11 ABG and n we don't have AC like
we did on the regular HTC One either
again 1800 milliamp hour battery and NFC
support right out of the box but
everything else your looks sense
five an HTC one ish I really really like
sense 5 is probably my favorite skin and
I've used I'm so definitely try and give
it a shot after you having it will go
into apps and see it we've got here
we'll pull this down will change the
grid size we can see more Appy goodness
and all the ATT stuff looks to be in one
singular folder so you can see all those
things at ATT bungled on there you can
choose to look at or not other than that
though there's not much else here
Facebook and Twitter come pre-installed
and other than that it's pretty much
what we know from the HTC One you do
have boomsound speakers that sound
pretty baller navigation you only have
two buttons for the HTC is not a button
got a back and a home button on the left
hand side that's where your SIM card is
going to live and use it some removal
tool to pull that sucker out on the
right hand side volume rocker up and
down on the top power and lock button
3.5 millimeter headset jack on the
bottom charging and syncing and a noise
cancelling mic we got that unibody
aluminum build with a plastic on the
side that we've really known to love
with the HTC One it has more of an
iphone design to it it's for that tall
or narrower screen versus sort of the
larger overall screen of the HTC One X
if they look like side by side you know
big brother little brother this is a
really nice phone and probably one's
going to serve you well if the duration
of your contract if you're looking to
decide between these two check out what
their current pricing is going to be
they change every day you may want to
look and consider the upgrade to the
full size HTC one is my favorite phone
of the past year and the office you guys
