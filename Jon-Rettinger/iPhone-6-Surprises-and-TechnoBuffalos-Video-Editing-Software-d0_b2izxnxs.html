brought to you by Linda calm what's up
everyone welcome back to the episode of
ask the Buffaloes to show where you can
ask me any question you've got for the
technology and sometimes outside of it
we talked about phones tablets why it
burns when you pee and everything in
between up this week though it's all
technology we talked about the iphone 6
crazy iphone leaks in general we talk
about phone battery editing software and
much more assess the buffalo bring on
the questions first question comes from
twitter at robin their high edge sorry i
just massacred your name asks at john
for lakers what rumored feature are you
most excited about all on the upcoming
iphone 6 I have long said I wish we had
a bigger screen please give me a bigger
screen so it looks like that one's going
to be granted I do hope the 5.5 inch
iphone rumors true because that would be
super sweet aside from the larger screen
size here things I am excited about
hopefully having first one NFC about
freaking time and the second one which
I've heard much rumors about but I'm
still having two fingers crossed my
toast cross and things you can't even
see crossed for wireless charging I love
wireless charging on your Apple uses the
Qi standard creates Apple wire charge
ever they want to do to create their own
standard and charge ridiculous amount of
licensing fee i love wireless charging
bring it to us those are features i'm
most excited about things like lte-a iOS
aid the rest of the stuff i mean is nice
but a biggish cranning is gonna really
really do a lot of good for the folks
out there also serve you look at an
iphone than any other android device and
the iphone looks looks like a baby
compared to it i don't think apple likes
looking like a baby next question comes
from a friend Omar Correa who asks at
John for lakers do you think we'll ever
be surprised at an iphone launch again
with so many leaks happening these days
I think the days of us not knowing
what's going to happen or is there gonna
have some phone what's phones gonna be
are so far gone it's a little bit sad
makes you a little whimsical think about
the good old days but you can prepare in
advance Apple usually has one or two
tricks up their sleeves that we don't
know so that's kind of always fun but
really the big stuff and we put
much know exactly the phones can look
like it's been leaked for the past like
four months i think that's always going
to be the case when you have thousands
and thousands and thousands of workers
now I mean that thousands and thousand
thousands of underpaid workers that are
sort of maybe looking make an extra buck
or two that are dealing with your
prototype devices they're just going to
happen they're going to leak out more
people want information we're going to
try to provide information so we are
part of the problem I personally have
been told many times I am part of the
problem I guess we can be part of the
solution if you don't talk about it but
it's so much fun to talk about so am i
I'm sorry and going away anytime soon
the next question comes from at arch tap
us at john for lakers what software does
your team use to edit videos hashtag ask
the be so i could answer the question
but i don't do much the video editing
anymore so i thought it would be best to
go to the source mr. bhram parita what
software to use to edit videos on
alright guys I'm Ron so for editing i
personally use last gen mac pro super
speck tout great machine for software
wise we use the adobe creative suite so
i personally use adobe premiere I use
Adobe After Effects use Adobe SpeedGrade
for color grading and sometimes use
adobe audition that's more for audio
stuff if we need to fix something we
usually get a really good audio out of
camera mark does a lot of his own
editing and he pretty much used the same
process the difference is for him he
doesn't actually use Adobe SpeedGrade he
uses a color rishta colors 22 which is
part of the magic boat looks package and
that's kind of how he does it in inside
premiere I'm back next question comes
from at 19 Justin 35 who maybe can't
figure out how old he is hey John what's
the latest flagship mid-range smartphone
with the best long battery life hashtag
ask to be that one is super easy the
oneplus one has stupid long battery life
if you want a phone is going to last you
the full day or go through two days that
is the phone to get they did a
ridiculous job with that device I would
assume that what's Android L comes out
that the other phones that have long
battery life as well but for right now
that's the once again also for that
price tag it's kind of hard to beat take
a quick second think our friends at
lynda.com which always makes me laugh
I've got an aunt linda and she can
barely check email so it makes me kind
of chuckle that there's a website called
Linda not related not a funny story but
I still thought

super engaging really easy to follow

for seven days for free go to Linda calm
/ TechnoBuffalo that's ly and da calm so
that's technobuffalo so you don't have
to worry can do it anytime you want and
I'm gonna care if you're not wearing
pants next question comes from a buddy
Josh hey John is it more simple nowadays
to switch phones as often as you do just
depend on the carrier or is it easy just
popping out the SIM card and popping it
in the next phone so if its ATT or
tmobile and easy just pop in the sim
card and my numbers at least there but
switching from android to android device
is still not a seamless process at all
officer got it is automated as I can as
far as how to set things up I got a
checklist I go through and do everything
for each account I still find it
annoying that Google imports all your
contacts oh you gotta sort of add my
main email address and quickly go into
account settings and have it not sync
contacts but I've got it down it works
pretty well I've got all my photos now
synced up the dropbox i can pull those
down all my contacts have a separate
gmail kind of crazed just for my
contacts i sync those over and it made a
pretty sort of seamless transition so it
takes me from switching to a new android
phone probably about 25 to 30 minutes
get it up and working at all the email
accounts and everything sort of going as
I would need a brand new phone to work
the longest process I was just
downloading all the new apps again thank
