the apple store take a look at the new
magic mouse let me tell you this thing
is quite sweet material is the same
shiny plastic that's found on the back
of the iphone or the top of the macbooks
it's a very shiny glossy plastic it
actually does click when you put your
hand on it it's very low profile just so
you know in the back of it sort of got
this aluminum with these two bumpers and
then your on/off switch scrolling seems
to be very smooth actually I'm using it
right now on one of the new iMacs and
scrolling up and down does work very
easily the two-finger scrolling works
there is not however buttons on the side
so you can't activate expose which is
kind of annoying i use that all the time
it does feel nice but since it's so low
profile your wrist has to kind of sit up
on it to use it so it's not the most
ergonomic thing in the world but it
definitely works and is really
functional using the flick scrolling
definitely works as well go back and
forth and there is actually plenty of
room on the mouse to go back and forth I
don't have the largest hand in the world
but I can very easily fit almost four
fingers on top of it so if you take your
hand and look at the back you can figure
that's probably as big as the mouse is
it seems to just work very well and
looks really slick I think this is sort
of the almost the height of apples
designing with this magic mouse so it
will be available they're saying
sometimes the first in November they'll
have it available for pickup you can get
it right now if you get one of the new
iMacs but definitely something to keep a
lookout I'll be doing a full inbox again
