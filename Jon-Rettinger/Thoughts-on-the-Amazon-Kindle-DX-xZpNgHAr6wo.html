week amazon announced the kindle DX
which is the spiritual updates to the
kindle two which was released earlier
this year now the both be sold side by
side the kindle DX won't be available
until sometime later in the summer
amazon hasn't pinned down a solid
release date yet so some of the specs
and highlights of the kindle DX and it's
got a 9.7 inch e-ink screen as opposed
to the six inch screen found on the
current kindle 2 DX also has native PDF
support and it's got a built-in
accelerometer similar to what you found
not find out a lot of phones so when you
turn the device you can see what's there
in landscape now a little bit torn on
the kindle DX means i should say that
it's going to run you a whopping 489
when it's released that is a huge huge
huge price tag especially over the
already high kindle to price tag of
three hundred fifty nine dollars so now
after taxes you're going to be looking
at probably over five hundred bucks for
a very large screen ereader is it that
important to you now I've gone on the
record is being a big fan of the kindle
to which i own and i was able to get
over the significantly high price point
because i feel like i can make that
money back being a heavy reader by
paying a lesser cost for books mostly
releases are 999 and a lower costs for
magazines heck potentially newspapers as
well however that a little bit of leeway
is really just shot with now a
five-hundred-dollar price point the
ology making that money back on the
books is very slim and if you do it will
be over a long period of time i'm not
sure that i can get over five hundred
dollar price point barrier entry to
there is just so significant so huge and
there are many competitors Peggy pedders
on the market that offers smaller
screens but more features sony has a
touchscreen ebook reader and there are a
few other ones on the market and some
are even coming out
potential color eating technology so I'm
a little bit torrent also having just
bought a kindle too I'm not just not
that long ago I feel a bit slighted I'm
sure a lot of kindle two owners a few
lab it's slide it as well you know we
don't have native PDF support now for
the kindle to like the amazon kindle DX
will have a native PDF support a really
big deal if you're a business
professional or student and you have to
use the device something other than just
reading books if you want to email
yourself a PDF with the curb kindle to
you have to wait for gets converted pay
a fee and then it scales it's really not
that accurate it's not graphically
appropriate things you just look at a
whack there's a lot of panning and
scrolling the kindle DX of data support
is supposed to really remedy that i'm
wondering why they couldn't add PDF
support natively on the kindle to via
firmware update there aren't that many
other features that the DX has over the
kindle with the exception of a little
bit bigger storage space largest screen
and accelerometer PDF support but all
that aside i just can't see spending
five hundred dollars from ebook reader
not in this economy doesn't have
expandable stored it's not touch screen
it's not color essentially looks like a
kindle too but gigantic with the
keyboard shrunk a little bit you know
overall it was still disappointed with
the announcement i was expecting you
know perhaps a lower price point or some
sort of subsidy they are going to be
offering discounts for some sort of
newspapers but nothing really official
has been announced on that yet so I'm
not that excited about the kindle DX i'm
a big fan at the kindle too but i would
have liked to seen amazon lower the
price point of the kindle two and hit
that kindle DX at the current choose
price point of 359 really would have
been a sweet spot and probably would
have been enough for me to hit pre-order
on the computer but i just can't be
conscious by five hundred dollars for an
e-book reader it's completely asinine to
mean you know maybe I'm off-base maybe
you think there's a market for if your
student and you want to use it through
place your text books or potentially
about your textbooks you know that's one
thing but there aren't that many
textbooks that are available in digital
format right now and by time or are
avail y student the price will have
dropped
what amazon is doing is just priming the
market for a competitor so i'm going to
come in offering a larger ebook reader
at a lower price maybe it won't have
their sinking whispernet system perhaps
not to plug it into your computer but
I'd be more than willing to download
books on my computer sync it up on a
larger screen for is typically lower
cost would you is having this amazon
whispernet going to download books
wirelessly worth the cost for you I
don't know for me 359 was still a high
price to pay but I was okay with it you
know so what do you guys think this is
just a little bit of a rant on the
kindle DX i think it's a great product
internally there's a market for I don't
think the market is that big I think
Amazon is greatly overestimating it so
that being said what do you guys think
are you gonna get a kindle DX you have
any interest in the kindle DX do you
have any interest in a kindle to even
what would you figured if you liked to
seen added you know what my review of
the kindle to i said i would have liked
to see the touch screen with like doing
better navigation what about you've seen
better used to real estate space which
they seem to have rectified on the DX
you know but what are you guys saying
you know we leave your comments down
below i'm very curious to see i'll
definitely read them all for exclusive
concepts be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter com / John for lakers i'll see
you guys at next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
