technobuffalo we're about check out the
HP Envy x2 it's windows 8-powered it has
a detachable keyboard what david conrad
product manager take over alright so
great thing about the envy x2 is we
really designed to be a true hybrid pc
and do everything that windows they can
do and so we started out with a thin and
sleek notebook it's 3.1 pounds it looks
like a notebook looks like a nice sleek
modern all aluminum chassis we have the
ports you'd expect from a notebook
whether it's USB on both sides full-size
HDMI horse audio got a full-size SD card
slot as well another USB port oh sorry
when you open it up you got a nice
display go back here you've got a great
Windows display somebody's been doing
stuff with this one but that's okay um
you got a nice Windows display you get a
full-size keyboard the display itself is
11.6 inches it's an IPS display so it's
viewable from multiple angles it's 400
it so it's really bright both sides
keyboard full-size trackpad that's also
gesture enabled so I can swipe through
all my different apps just my touchpad
if I want and then very easily
manipulate things my image man
where of course I can manipulate things
with my fingers is fully touch enabled
so you've got a great notebook whenever
you want to be a new poem but then you
also got if I could do this one handed a
great tablet and you want it to be a
tablet so when it when it's in tablet
mode you've got a nice thin it's about
eight and a half millimeters then tablet
that is sleek and modern you've got
cameras on the front and rear so you've
got an 8 megapixel camera with a flash
and rear and go to 2 megapixel flash
with a on the front you've even got
expansion so we've got an audio jack
here obviously for headphones we've got
beats audio here for the speakers and
then as far as storage goes we're going
to ship it with 64 gigabytes of storage
but if you want to expand that we've got
a little SD micro SD card slot right
here so we didn't want leave people out
because they want to expand the storage
as well right on the tablet makes it
really easy for them to do that so so
it's a tablet when you want it to be a
tablet and then when you want it to come
back together we've actually got magnets
in the in the tablet function itself and
it makes it really easy to align and
then really easy to click on to it and
then when it's clicked on it's solid
apart then what you go is a nice thick
book again nice so its Envy x2 it's a
notebook that doubles as a tablet don't
say later this year and the processor
inside just clover to really get it
right okay it hasn't been out
it is running the full version with us
thank you very much alright thanks point
haha that's it guys this is Tanya Tucker

Envy x2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
