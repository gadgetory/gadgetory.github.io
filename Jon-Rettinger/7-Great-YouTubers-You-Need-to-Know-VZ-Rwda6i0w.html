lakers calm here so just about my year
and a half on youtube but had a chance
to really get a nice summation of a
technology reviewing community on
YouTube and they're a group of people
out there who make fantastic videos
oftentimes they're much better than the
videos I make even and that aren't
gaining attention that they deserve so I
want to draw your attention to seven of
these reviewers that are fantastic that
I think you guys need to know and you
subscribe to I personally subscribe to
them and I really think that they're
just fantastic and put out quality
content I'm gonna try and do this pretty
regularly as I get to know some new
reviewers out there please don't send me
emails with your channel I'm gonna try
and find you guys on my own like any
other youtuber would so let's go ahead
and get started here its first seven and
i'll put a link to all these from the
sidebar and i'll make some annotations
for you guys as well I've note so I
don't forget forget anyone the first guy
want to talk about is echo fish you may
know him as Armand here's a guy that I
actually do a lot of work with on John
for lakers calm and to my youtube videos
he's just a fantastic guy he does a lot
of apple focus videos app reviews he
does fantastic unboxings he just
recently unboxed in xbox 360 I think his
app reviews are probably some of the
best on YouTube and it's really just a
good guy and makes fantastic content I
think one of those people that you
definitely need to check out he's
British she might have a hard time
understanding is funny accent but you'll
get used to so be sure to check out echo
fish the next guy that I want to talk
about is another european guy this is
andre attunes he's based out of Italy he
mostly makes apple based content and a
guy just fantastic he's got a really
good insight to what he's talking about
it does it with an international Flair
which is nice for someone in America to
see you know get the European
perspective on a lot of products and
really just his content is is great and
if you like apple stuff he's a guy you
had to subscribe to so be sure to check
out Andre attunes the next guy is
actually one of the younger reviewers on
YouTube same as Colin and he goes by the
youtube name crashes geek it's really
just an apple fanatic that just makes
great videos you can see his passion
kind of come out in his videos you can
get a little
burant but really you can appreciate
what is he saying and it might be young
that doesn't mean doesn't have good
things to say I really can have nice
insights and nice content and really is
as passion again for the product really
comes through should be sure to check
out crashes geek next guy is another guy
based in the u.s. his name is dr. Joker
is his YouTube handle and he primarily
makes apple focus videos as well and he
goes really in-depth into them he does
tutorials reviews really everything
Apple focused and just as a fantastic
job I've actually learned a lot from
watching his videos and a lot of stuff
I've learned I've shared with you guys
so if you want to take out the middleman
be sure to check out dr. Joker really
just does a fantastic job the next
youtuber is actually a group of people
and these are the guys that do the mac
tips podcast it's a conglomerate of I
believe four or five younger guys and
they're just trying to get themselves
known and get a little bit off the
ground hopefully this will help they buy
their name mac tips podcast give out
McIntosh chips and Apple tips in general
a lot of them are very insightful and
really are tips and tricks I didn't know
so definitely be sure and check the bama
out and they also do a podcast well
which is you know fantastic and I
believe it's a weekly show and you can
pick it up for my tunes so be sure to
check out the guys at mac tips podcasts
the next guy is probably one of the
nicest people you will ever meet in your
entire life a heartfelt just outstanding
person who makes great videos most of
our Apple focus some of them are not
just if you want to get to know just a
really good person with a good heart
sure to check out a hairy at I Harrison
30 guy just fantastic his videos are
superb you'll get to know his family and
his videos his kids his wife even as
dogs it really opens up and shares in a
way that not many people do and it's a
really courageous thing that he does so
be sure to check out I Harrison 30 the
guy is absolutely fantastic the next guy
is based out of the u.s. named
soldierknowsbest I believe he's a former
soldier who primarily again makes apple
focus videos but again you can see this
guy's
passionate love for what he's talking
about and really is fantastic he's
knowledgeable he's friendly he answers
all your questions really just puts out
great videos you know should be sure to
check him out soldierknowsbest you know
