from technobuffalo late last year I
filmed a video which I believe was the
first of its kind where it was the state
of our site I shared with you what her
page views were what we've done right
and wrong I sort of pulled back the veil
I didn't just give you my word for it
actually showed you what our Google
Analytics were and about six months pass
since the last video and a lot of things
have change we made a lot of changes due
to feedback that I've had since that
last video so let me share some good
news first on the website TechnoBuffalo
calm we hit a page view record in March
with just about 14.2 million pageviews
and I was getting ready to film one of
these videos and it looked like in April
we would actually hit another record and
we did hit another record in April
wasn't by much but we still beat our
number from March if you're keeping
track our previous high was twelve point
eight million that we did I believe last
October November time frame so really
was a big big jump for us too many pages
is a big step especially for a small
independent site that is really
difficult for us to do and I'm sharing
these numbers with you for a few reasons
first I think it's important to give
full disclosure to our audience and also
we're relatively new in the tech space
starting TechnoBuffalo the end of 2009
and we're gaming market sure we don't
have the mindshare quite yet so fully
videos like this will actually show what
our audience and traffic actually is and
beyond that not taking our word for it
actually showing you our Google
Analytics trust but verify it's a dirty
secret out there that a lot of sites to
advertisers lie about their traffic so I
figured here's all the information use
it absorb it what they want do anything
about it that that's up to you but at
least no here's what technobuffalo is
about and here's what we're doing and
here's what we're building around 3.2 is
still our highest that we hit last
November and what a unique is versus a
page of unique is a natural human being
and of course one person can click one
two three four five pages that accounts
for for the page views so over 3 million
people are coming to the site which is
an incredible staggering number always
remember sitting in my one-bedroom
apartment with filming in the background
with my bed in the back envisioning what
TechnoBuffalo be and never ever did I
imagine that hundreds of thousands of
people let alone millions of people
would ever come to watch the videos and
to
the website I I never imagined that what
happened Serani had some traffic numbers
our last full month I'm filming this in
May so I was april / sixty-three percent
of everything came to a site where new
visitors that is a really healthy number
folks coming in hoping get that number
up to 70 which is really staggering for
really any site but let alone hours
other things have changed as well we're
looking to hire looking to bring
somebody else on camera I'll talk about
why in a little bit we're growing I'll
make sure you can keep delivering all
the content that we can we're exploring
also new sub sites whether or not those
are going to happen is still to be
determined and what they're going to
cover it still to be determined favorite
idea the things you'd want to see I'll
be sure to let us know we're publishing
upwards of 30 40 articles per day sub
sites will allow those stories to not
get lost in a blog roll but sort of live
on site that's dedicates a particular
topic so when I film this last video we
had ads inside of our gallery every
fourth image there would be 300 by 250
AD and I heard feedback you guys didn't
like that and I took it very seriously
now we moved that add all the way to the
end of the gallery and we've kept it
that way off about the past four months
we're always trying to improve our ad
situation it's kind of a necessary evil
ads really pay for everything here but I
like you wanna make sure they don't
impact the experience on the mobile side
we still have rogue ads that will come
through occasionally redirect you to a
nap so or something that shouldn't
happen I appreciate everybody letting me
know when that occurs cuz I can talk to
our ad guys and make sure we squash
those immediately our looking at a 10
different things and 10 different
options for ads in the near future we're
looking at things like perhaps
eliminating in text ads and perhaps
adding in image ads and adil show up to
the bottom of the image maybe one every
four or five I know some of the folks
the company are against those some of
the folks are for those looking at where
these considering as a way to serve
improve our ad experience moving forward
on the video side on the YouTube channel
so of course that's youtube.com slash
technobuffalo we're very quickly
approaching a million subscribers which
is in my mind the staggering number
certainly there are others that have
many many more and their audiences are
well deserved but a million is a huge
number for anybody that knows me
personally knows I never really took the
size of the audience and I really
thought that that was a huge number i
had a hundred thousand i thought you
two hundred thousand would be better we
get 200,000 I thought 300 would be
better and serve all the way up but a
million something I can reflect on and
just say wow I still can't fathom that
many people care we have to say about
technology i'm a consumer just like you
i love gadgets fact that people actually
care and tune in and watch it is
amazingly staggering and humbling to me
I live and breathe technology it's one
of the only things I'm good at it's my
passion and I have the privilege that
you guys have given me to do it for a
career and I thank you I don't know what
we're going to do four million
subscribers I want to do something a way
to get back to the audience what it's
going to be is still to be determined
maybe it won't be at a million maybe
we'll do it a month or two later but I
do want to do something to give back as
i mentioned earlier when the reasons
we're looking to bring on a new on
camera person so we can reduce the
number of sponsored videos those videos
where you say this video TechnoBuffalo
is brought to you by whomever those are
obviously important again for revenue
and keeping everybody behind me and
those that aren't here you'd employed in
salary checks coming in but ought to
make sure that the content we're putting
out is still going to be there and the
ads are up to take away from that
ideally like us to be at a very minimum
50 50 so 50 sponsored and fifty not
we're getting to that point very quickly
and one more person will push us way
over that edge our probably putting out
around sixty percent of the video
content that we could you know Mark is
putting out everything that he can and
from my standpoint I'm also spending
time running the business I'm dealing
with contracts I'm dealing with sort of
HR stuff taxes all the things that
running a business and tail so I'd have
that as much time as I would like sit in
front of the camera and sort of talk
about the tech that I love so hopefully
somebody new will be able to help us
with that so we've hit a lot of
milestones but not everything's been
perfect our ad situation is still far
from ideal and far from where i want it
to be I've opened at the traffic numbers
grow I can remove ads from our sidebar
at least one of the ads can come out
click the experience better our mobile
experience still need to be improved are
working on creating official
TechnoBuffalo mobile apps you can enjoy
our content from any device no matter
where you are a lot of dishes coming in
things that we want to work on a thing
you want to see from us let us know
things you think we're not doing right
let
snow I want to reiterate a few things
about Tecna Buffalo make us unique first
and something that I hope every site
does every youtuber does if you watch a
video from something it doesn't do this
assam do in the comments disclose how
long you test the device before you
reviewed it if you'd only reviewed it
for a day only had it for day disclose
it use it for five days disclose it's
really important threatens to know how
long use the device my experiences with
the device 24 hours versus five days
later are usually very very dif we will
always continue to do that we will never
ever do a sponsor of you when i say
sponsored video it's not that they're
paying us say nice things about the
product we will never ever do that any
video that sponsored is always disclosed
first of all that is very very important
to me and we will never accept a
sponsored review anything that we say
that has a review on it as always our
opinion and no money ever change hands
and it was always conspiracy theories
and all that kinda stuff going on in the
comments only do I give you my word it's
also illegal to do that it's not just
from us always look for disclosure so
you know whether or not videos are
sponsored or not but anything that comes
out of my mouth opinion wise about a
product is always mine whether it's a
sponsor behind it we're not otherwise
you lose the integrity of the site you
lose your audience and the audience to
me is the most important thing that I
have and my integrity something that
holds extremely high and something I
would never sacrifice for a check we've
also launched and relaunched more
youtube channels my personal blog inside
John's mind came back where i showed
behind-the-scenes stuff going on here in
the office some home life links that
will be down below we also launched
technobuffalo movies we're putting up
movie trailers and sort of movie news as
it happens again that link will also
began below I don't know what we're
gonna do with either of them we just
want to sort of grow and have sort of a
wider breadth topic and talking about
movie something that I love and doesn't
always make sense to have that on the
main youtube channel so that's who we
are that's what we've done right it's
what we've done wrong we are far from
perfect there's a lot of room for
improvement but I do promise you we are
always trying we will stumble but we
will always get back up thanks to your
help as long as you are there reading as
long as you are there watching we will
work to get better and will always
strive to be better than we are today
and we try to be better than we can be
tomorrow and the next day thank you guys
for your support
thank you for watching TechnoBuffalo and
reading the site until next time we'll
be back with more gadgets i'm jon
