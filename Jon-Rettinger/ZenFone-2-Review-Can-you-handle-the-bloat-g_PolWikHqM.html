smartphones I'm willing to bet that Asus
isn't the first brand that comes to your
mind they're looking to change that with
a high-end device at an affordable price
I'm our percent over TechnoBuffalo and
let's see if we can find some nirvana
with the zenfone 2 as usual just want to
take a quick second to let you know that
I reviewed the zenfone 2 over a period
of eight nice long days Oasis clearly
takes a ton of pride in the build
quality of the zenfone 2 and with good
reason this thing is a delight to hold
in the hand it feels strong it's got
like a bit of heft and the curved back
really kind of makes it just like
nestled right into your hand not only
that but the curve on the back isn't so
severe that it can't be comfortably used
when it's laying flat which is a really
nice pleasant surprise despite the back
actually being plastic it actually has
no flex at all whatsoever it doesn't
push in even a little bit and it feels
really kind of wonderful and grippy
thanks to this sort of weird brushed
aluminum finish that they're actually
very proud of as well
now asus isn't the first oh em to put
the volume rocker on the back but it
works really really nicely here it frees
up the size of the device to taper off
for a nice thinner edge and it really
feels like the kind of phone that
because of that heft that like Iron Man
would use and I'm not just saying that
because of the bright red back that I
happened to have here you remember the
like original Droid that they like og
droid the very first one on Verizon
remember how badass that one felt you
would slide it up you had that sweet
keyboard it felt like it had heft it
felt like a tank felt like it had
punched to it that's kind of how this
feels that's here it feels like a really
strong sturdy device it feels like
everything on the inside is packed
tightly together and I like that those
backs are changeable and that's also
where you're gonna get access to the
dual micro SIM slots and the micro SD
slot is gonna be right underneath that
back and you can also see the battery
but that 3000 milliamp power pack is not
removable around the front you're gonna
find your hardware and app buttons down
at the bottom and your wide-angle front
facing camera which is really really
cool we'll get that
the camera area down here on the bottom
the other thing I wanted to know is this
is something that they seemed very proud
of and that I kind of like a lot there's
this kind of radial design on the chin
down here and it kind of makes a little
scratchy noise when you touch it's kind
of ridged it's a really nice looking
feeling device I feel really happy when
I hold it it's a nice phone it does have
dual SIM slots so if that's something
that you need that's there for you but
it does not have anything in terms of
biometrics so if you're looking for
something with a fingerprint scanner
you're gonna need to keep looking but it
does have NFC my only major complaint
with the build quality / hardware is
something in this interferes with the
Wi-Fi connectivity it had a really hard
time staying connected to the networks
that my Nexus 6 had no problem staying
in range of all right so let's talk
about the brains of the operation
there are two models of the zenfone 2
the 200 dollar model sports an Intel
Atom quad-core Z 35 60 clocked at 1.8
gigahertz in fact like I said it's a
quad-core processor and that one comes
with two gigs of RAM this is the $300
model that we tested and this one is
running the Atom quad-core z3580 clocked
at 2.3 gigahertz at 4 gigs of ram that's
right
for 4 gigs of ram this model has 64 gigs
of on-board storage for that same price
point and if you notice there is a micro
SD card under that backplate so you can
expand that up to 128 gigs if you know
me well enough you know that I'm not a
spec fiend I'm not the guy who's gonna
just write a phone off because it gets
lower in - to benchmark points we're at
the point in tech we're just having that
highest clocked processor is really just
part of the equation the Intel silicon
that's in this thing is a very strong
contender it certainly doesn't score as
high on those benchmarks as the modern
flagships do in fact it lands somewhere
around last year's flagships on the
benchmarks but in practical everyday use
I didn't experience a single jerk I
didn't experience a single stutter I
didn't experience a single slowdown
I'm sure the four gigs of ram doesn't
hurt at all but the only major hiccup
that I encountered was a random reboot
that I got after the device got to think
a little bit
hotter than I think it would have liked
overall performance was great so through
multitasking video watching downloads
emails photos never had a problem
tackling anything that I threw at it the
screen is a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS LCD
display and it's great it's not the best
thing that I've ever seen but it's super
smooth the pixels are indistinguishable
and it's got great strong color
reproduction but let's say you don't
like the color reproduction the best
part about the screen is actually a bit
of the software they give you an app
they call it splendid to make the screen
look exactly the way that you want it to
look I like my screens to lean a little
bit cooler than the warmer side at the
end of the spectrum so I really like to
have that option and I also like my
colors just a little bit oversaturated
not not crazy high not too too much but
the app lets me tweak it to exactly
where I want it if I want to it's got
some presets but I can I can just switch
the slider up and say hey I want it
cooler the only thing I wish the app had
that it doesn't is a contrast slider but
that's kind of being picky at this point
I mean they even give you color bars so
that you can help tweak it to your
heart's content
like I said it's not the best screen
that I've ever seen but it's no slouch
and it's really about as good as you can
expect to get at this price point and
that's not bad the rear facing camera is
a 13 megapixel shooter and the front
facing is a 5 megapixel wide-angle lens
that's important to note the optics are
really really impressive here and
they've got a plethora of software
features that are actually kind of
helpful in the camera app I've got some
really really great shots in all kinds
of lighting scenarios the low light mode
in fact even does a great decent job of
lighting up an otherwise murky photo the
HDR was a little bit too bit aggressive
for my taste and a lot of the camp your
features in here are definitely a little
bit much for example the beautification
mode which you get on the front-facing
camera it's on by default and it's just
it's way too much if it smooths your
skin makes everything feel like
Photoshop right out of the gate but the
wide-angle lens is delightful it just
you can fit so much stuff you get used
to holding your phone out here
you don't need to do that with this
phone and it reminds me a lot of the
front-facing camera on the s6 which is a
great front-facing camera
overall I'm really really happy with the
quality of the photos that I'm getting
from the zenfone 2 despite some over
processing at times whether you're in
HDR or beautification or not
at first the 3000 milliamp hour battery
was actually really impressive I was
getting like two and a half hours to two
and a quarter hours of screen on time
during a full day of moderate usage but
it did slip really really hard on one
day in particular I tested this on 18
T's 4G network so while I was driving
around California navigating in the car
doing a lot of internet browsing posting
a lot of photos to Instagram the better
your life just tanked you know it was
just ahead one of those heavy phone days
and I took a look at the battery stats
and I thought maybe I was just using it
a little bit too much but I actually did
find that underneath there wasn't the
screen it was Android OS it was going
haywire
this is running Android 5.0 so there are
probably a handful of leaks that are
still in there that haven't been taken
care of I'm a little disappointed to see
that but that does lead me into the
software well there are some really
great ideas and implementations here
Asus needs to take a deep breath and
take a step back everything here is
skinned there's an outrageous amount of
bloatware on this device though I do
commend Asus for breaking out most of
their apps into their own entries into
the Play Store which is nice as that
makes for much quicker updates it's just
that there's way too much on here man
for the average user there's way too
many icons that really wind up just
being useless and the skins of apps that
are already included in stock Android
don't add anything to the user
experience the note-taking app for
example it's ridiculous I have no idea
why they would spend any amount of time
making a note-taking app that allows you
to type as if you're using graffiti on a
Palm Pilot I just I genuinely have no
idea it doesn't make any sense to me
it's painful to use and at least me
wondering if that time wouldn't have
been better spent polishing details
elsewhere then of course there's the
Asus exclusive social network is Zen
circle which I'm not even going to touch
of course Asus has made sure that none
of these apps can be disabled either so
if you're not interested in
there's no way to get rid of them at
least they did have the decency to have
the ability to hide apps in their native
launcher which I guess this is about as
good as I can ask for speaking of that
launcher I really like to try and use
devices as I would use them if I owned
them so usually I immediately install
nova launcher and get things looking and
behaving the way that i like them and
then i go from there
but for reviews like this one where the
launcher really kind of does have a feel
in and of itself I do think it's worth
giving that launcher a fair shake
because not everyone who gets a device
goes straight to Nova Launcher so while
the Asus launcher is definitely not my
cup of tea it is definitely one of the
least offensive launchers on an android
scheme that i've seen in a while the
icons and folders they're a little bit
big for my taste and some of the UI
elements definitely come across as gaudy
but it's a perfectly serviceable
launcher with its own set of handy
features like smart grouping and even
the ability to modify the grid size
which is nice now all that said there is
some seriously convenient stuff in here
and I've actually really gotten used to
a lot of these helpful little features
here are just a few of them that I've
been using a ton double tap to wake on
the screen great you can draw a C for a
camera or an S for hangouts actually you
can assign any shortcut you want to the
letters that you can write on the screen
which is really really helpful and then
there's the handful of apps where Asus
is attention to detail really comes
through and you wind up with something
that you don't expect to have on your
phone but they really kind of go above
and beyond for example the flashlight on
this thing is absurdly useful like you
don't expect to get something this
useful on this kind of a device but it
gives you a normal flashlight with the
quick settings in your notification pane
it gives you a flash interval setting so
you can go all the way up to a strobe
flash and the coolest part is there's an
actually an SOS button so if you find
yourself you're camping whatever it is
you find yourself stuck on the side of
the road you can hit the SOS button and
it'll flash SOS in Morse code and that's
just the kind of little bit of attention
to detail that I think
makes me feel like aces can make
something really and truly great if they
really just kind of take a step back and
exercise a little bit more restraint
than they have look this is a great
phone it's a great great phone and I
think Asus is onto something here they
really do seem to care about what
they're creating if I had to give them
some feedback I just say dial back the
amount of customization you're dumping
on Android you don't need to add apps
unless the apps really add something to
the experience these modifications that
you're doing the Android really either
need to improve on an experience or
offer one that just isn't available in
stock Android for example the Asus
calendar doesn't offer anything that
Google Calendar doesn't offer stop
worrying about making all of Android
look like you made it and start focusing
on improving it and maybe the zenfone 3
will be able to tango with the big boys
next year
all that said I can still very much
recommend the zenfone 2 to anyone
looking for a value device in the same
vein as the oneplus 2 but who doesn't
want to give up something like NFC if
you don't mind a less than stock Android
experience the zenfone 2 is a great
phone to consider especially given the
price point but what do you guys think
is the zenfone seriously something that
you would consider buying giving what
you know now let us know in the comments
and hey be nice to each other down there
just because you're on the internet
doesn't mean that you can act like a
jerk we all love tech here so fanboys
are not we can't wait for the future
collectively okay so be nice all right
you know the drill guys like subscribe
all that fun stuff thank you for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
