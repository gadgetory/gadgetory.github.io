to you by domain.com the past eight
years we've seen crazy advancements in
smartphones we've seen multi-touch
on-screen keyboards full HD screens and
now we're seeing the next evolution of
the smartphone this is Sony the latest
Xperia z5 premium rocking a ridiculous
4k screen I'm Jon render from
TechnoBuffalo let's take a look at all
dem pixels go ahead and take the lid off
the sky we're gonna haul to the unboxing
because Moseley just about that
ridiculous screen and here it is 5.5
inches 4k with a ridiculous 801 PPI real
fast push it off to the side so you're
gonna have in the box we got a book
we got headphones we got a power adapter
and a micro USB cable great here is the
phone let's pull this top off oh
satisfying and whooshing noises the
power button lives on the right hand
side this have a built-in fingerprint
sensor let's go ahead turn this on and
see what that 4k screen looks like
so aside from that insane screen this is
a really nicely SPECT phone from the
camera to the battery and the build
quality feels like typical sony was
sliced to say feels really nice in the
hand but the big story I think the only
thing to really focus on here is for
Kay's that this many K's on a screen so
look it's a video and see it looks like
because looking at techsan websites
don't make you're gonna get sort of the
full experience the Sony's got a few
videos sort of put in here by default so
let's look together at what 4k looks
like on a phone I figured the only way
to show this at least as close to
possible it's to upload this video in 4k
so if you have a 4k monitor or something
higher resolution hit the settings on
YouTube and click that all the way up so
you can these experiences as close to
true as you can without 4k on a giant
6575 whatever size inch screen looks
awesome but singing I'm coming
five-and-a-half inches is weird and
looks incredible
the screen here seems to be pretty
bright it almost looks like 3d
stereoscopic kind of 3d about the
glasses because things look so high
resolution but you had a picture of I
think the Greek islands maybe at the
city of iya and you can just see
everything now of course you got with
your content that's filmed in 4k looking
at normal 1080p content you don't see
what that looks like gonna do the review
but hot damn this looked really really
nice and whether or not it's it's a
gimmick or something that's actually
gonna be useful
I don't know how 4k is gonna affect
battery life I don't know but just the
geeking me to see something new is
really cool screen aside for quicks a
quick tour around the rest of the phone
again you've got that fingerprint
sensing power button on the right below
that you've got a volume rocker up and
down and you do have a dedicated camera
button which is super nice to have on
the left hand side it's where your SIM
and removable store is gonna be to
support microSD cards your point five
millimeter headset jack on the top
you've got a little lanyard spot if you
want to hang something on there and then
a micro USB for charging does we have a
lot of stuff to look at for the review I
really want to try this it's based on
5.1.1 maybe we'll see marshmallow at
some point but the real story is just
the screen that's probably working focus
on mostly in the video if you guys want
to see focus on anything else let us
know of course we'll cover how the
fingerprint sensor works and the
speakers and the rest of that stuff but
it's all about that screen anyway love
to know what you guys think leave the
comments down below let us know what you
want us to cover as well I'm just gonna
stare longingly and lovingly at all of
those caves until next time I'm John
render from TechnoBuffalo see you guys
next video yo what are you doing I need
yeah well I just I'm a wanted to see how
the footage looks on the z5 cuz this
isn't 4k
yeah be nice to yourself what are you
doing yeah or you could get a tattoo oh
okay okay yeah I can do that so you can
buy that
ever got a tattoo that seems like it
would be like really expensive John yeah
no it's not actually
oh really
yeah Wow Wow I should have known that I
was thinking about domains I should have
been I should've been thinking domain
