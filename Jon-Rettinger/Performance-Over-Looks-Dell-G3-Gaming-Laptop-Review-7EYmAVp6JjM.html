dramatic mural shots like this one it
would not help the del g3 to look sleek
at all there's just no getting around
the fact that this Dell laptop looks
like at one point it was fresh and new
and innovative but now just kind of
looks old but looks can be deceiving and
though this 2018 laptop from Dell
doesn't look all that new the components
under the hood give you a really good
amount of power and performance for it's
$700 starting price tag we've gotten
many requests to take a look at this
laptop and I understand why for 700
bucks the Dell g3 packs
eight gigs of RAM GTX 1050 and an eighth
gen I 5 processor for the price those
specs aren't too bad and it makes this
machine totally capable of running
popular titles in 1080p but to get to
that performance at this price point you
are making some major compromises in
terms of design and build quality the
entire machine is made out of plastic
and it feels very cumbersome and bulky
carrying this thing around with you in a
backpack isn't the end of the world but
at five-and-a-half pounds
this thing is no lightweight either
there is no ignoring the massive bezels
around the 15 inch display which I found
honestly to be pretty mediocre colors on
the display are gonna be okay for gaming
and watching YouTube videos though
viewing angles aren't great and it
doesn't get super bright either despite
all that though the design does have
some redeeming qualities I do want to
mention I actually found the keyboard to
be one of the best parts of this machine
as a whole there's good key spacing
between the keys there's good key travel
and I found it really comfortable to
type on for long periods of time you're
forgoing any kind of crazy RGB
backlighting for just a solid blue
keyboard backlight which is just fine by
me no frills no thrills but it gets the
job done the trackpad below looks
promising it's one big button with a
fairly large surface for navigation and
gestures but it has a kind of a weird
texture on top of it that makes it sort
of slippery and you're also reminded of
its totally plastic build every time you
feel and hear that loud mechanical click
but putting the design aside for a
minute let's focus on how well this
gaming laptop can actually play games
with four
the video memory thanks to that GTX 1050
inside this thing is capable of playing
pretty much every major title out there
you're gonna have to adjust those
settings a bit to get solid playable
framerate medium settings seemed to be
the sweet spot on the g3 with pretty
much every game that I tested
I could easily achieve 60 frames per
second fortnight in pub G both on medium
settings that looked pretty good and
that core i5 inside is more than
adequate for some light photo and video
editing as well don't expect anything
revolutionary here but if you want to
mess around in Photoshop or edit some
video and premiere this thing is totally
capable of doing so we always try to run
a standard set of benchmarks across all
the laptops we get in for review and if
you're curious on how the Dell g3 sucks
up to other laptops like the Lenovo y50
or even the higher-end razor blade you
can compare these results on screen to
the ones in those videos and here's how
the g3 measured up in our various PC
mark tests gaming laptops aren't exactly
known for having the best battery life
and unfortunately the Dell g3 is just no
exception
I found I could get about four and a
half to five hours on a single charge
this is great for using it around the
house or near an outlet but if you're
gonna go out to a coffee shop or taking
this thing to class definitely do not
forget to pack that charger and while
you're at it I definitely would
recommend to bringing some headphones
along with you as well because the
built-in speakers on the Dell g3 just
aren't all that good it's fine for
casual movie watching or watching
YouTube videos but if you want to sit
down and actually listen to some music
or listen to some good sounding audio
bring a pair of headphones but on the
plus side you won't have any issue
connecting those headphones to the g3
especially if they're wired thanks to
the g3 is pretty traditional array of
ports if you've got multiple USB ports
here an HDMI port and even a full sized
Ethernet port and an SD card slot but
one important note to make here is that
you're truly missing out on USBC not
really exactly future-proof without that
USB C port across all the models of this
g3 and it would have been even better if
that would have made it a Thunderbolt 3
port definitely what a future-proof the
machine but you're just not getting that
on this model
so if you're using this thing for the
past few months off and on I definitely
realize that there were some compromises
made on this machine to get it to a
particular price point with a certain
set of components inside and my opinion
is kind of mixed I'm a bit torn on one
hand I got to give Dell credit where
credit is due I know many of you out
there would rather sacrifice any kind of
fancy design or RGB or some super
high-end screen for the best components
the best performance and the best value
you can get for your money and I think
that when it comes down to this Dell g3
most of the money you're paying is
definitely going into those components
and you should be pretty happy but on
the other hand when you're not gaming
and enjoying those components those
small design trade-offs I talked about
earlier are very noticeable they just do
not go away those bezels around the
display the plastic build the trackpad
those things are all very apparent when
you're using them day in and day out and
it can get a little old pretty fast so
if you're looking for a full fledged
budget gaming laptop for under $1000 the
Dell g3 is a great machine to start with
and it does have some fairly easy
upgrade ability for some of the
components inside of this machine so you
can invest in better parts when you have
the money but I will say that if design
of your laptop thinnest screen quality
or even port selection is important to
you a little bit more money investing
into a higher-end laptop may go a really
long way so what do you guys think about
the dela g3 we've got a lot of comments
to check out this laptop from other
videos so that is exactly why we are
doing this video and reviewing it what
are your thoughts you care about
performance more than you design do you
like the components and everything you
get free $700 starting price tag leave a
comment down below and let us know as
always thank you guys so much for
watching I am Robert Rosenfeld
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
