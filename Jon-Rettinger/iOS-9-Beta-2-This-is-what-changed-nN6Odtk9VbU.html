to you by Harry's hey what's going on
guys a Markham sang it from
TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be going
over some of the changes in iOS 9 beta 2
we did a video a few weeks back
showcasing some of the newer features in
iOS 9 so if you guys haven't seen that
video yet make sure to check out that
video here so the first change in iOS 9
beta 2 is a podcast app the podcast app
has this newly updated icon that's
bolder the layout of the app has also
been updated slightly changing the
position of some of the download buttons
handoff is again being displayed in the
app switcher screen whereas in beta 1
handoff was not available in the app
switcher at all search appears to be
much improved in iowa sine beta 2
bringing up both more results in a wider
range of results for each search query
the newly added lock mute rotation
switch inside the Settings app in beta 1
has now disappeared in beta 2 but
hopefully it's not gone forever this is
a feature I use on a daily basis since I
watch a lot of videos on my iPhone I can
quickly lock unlock my screen
orientation without access and control
center and the Settings app under
general search there's now a list of all
installed apps with the option to toggle
them on or off in search results in iOS
9 beta 1 this menu showed only apple
search results and options like Bing web
results documents found in mail Safari
suggestions and more and iOS 9 beta 2 on
the iPad the edit functions on the iPad
keyboard have been tweaked slightly
there's now an undo redo option that
shows up as the default edit function in
place of the cut paste tool the cutting
and pasting edit tools will still pop up
once you highlighted text replacing the
undo buttons so the last one on our list
is actually a beta 1 feature but it was
discovered as users installed beta 2 if
for example you're trying to install the
update but don't have enough storage
there's an option to temporarily delete
apps to make room with the OS
automatically reinstalling deleted
content after the update is completed I
personally thought iOS 9 beta 1 was
horrible one because the battery life on
my iPhone 6 was just horrendous it
wouldn't even last a full day anymore
and two there were a lot of app crashes
and bugs that I ran into when using apps
I use on a daily basis like Instagram
Twitter and Facebook hopefully beta to
fix the battery issues and some of the
app crashes but we're still playing
around with it and I'm excited to see
what else Apple is bringing to the table
as the beta program proceeds so before
we end this video I want to thank our
friends over at Harry
shaving can be quite expensive nowadays
but fortunately our friends over at
Harry's can hook you up with premium
razors at non premium prices their
starter kit starts to just fifteen
dollars and that includes the razor
three blades in your choice of Harry
shave cream or foaming gel I personally
like the gel it feels nice on my face as
an added bonus you can get five dollars
off your first purchase by using the
code technobuffalo and after using the
code you can also get an entire month of
Shaving for just ten dollars there are
any changes in future iOS 9 bit as well
be sure to keep you guys in the loop
over at TechnoBuffalo calm if you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to give it
a thumbs up and we will see you guys in
an excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
