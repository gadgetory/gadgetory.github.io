brought to you by thrillist hello there
how's it going great awesome fantabulous
props meant spectacular John to hear
from TechnoBuffalo and welcome to what's
the apps in the last episode a few
people asked me to check out this
android application called go launcher
ex and you know what i did just that so
for the next four to five minutes or so
to step back and relax because i'ma tell
you what i think about this wonderful
application in the past whats the apps
episode i reviewed another android
launcher application called launcherpro
which is amazing by the way highly
recommended you know what this pause
this video go go get your android phone
downloaded right now play with it for
about 20 minutes and just come back
awesome yeah it's really good so ya
don't mind me making a few comparative
observations between the two because
they're just so similar go launcher ex
is a very lightweight simple and
attractive alternative home screen
application for android OS i've
installed it in both the LG revolution
and this old nexus here but we're going
to stick with the nexus for this review
because the LG icons they just annoy me
if you've used launcher type
applications before then you'll be able
to use this one out of the box no
question or rather that Android Market
Market shopping bag kind of thing it's
wonderful so cute I I wish I had one in
real life I'd carry it around all day
just tralala with my android market bag
showing off like hey look what I got not
applications groceries a banana and an
apple what exactly for those who haven't
tampered with this stuff before no
worries because it's really really
simple it just enhances how you launch
applications via the home screen widgets
or the application screen and that's it
but of course there are a few things
that may go launcherex unique and
special instead of leaning towards a
senzu I kind of feel it goes to the iOS
end of the mobile operating user
interface spectrum I can't explain it
maybe it's just how the widgets look or
maybe it's because the icons wiggle and
dance when you hold them too long it
just has a very aptly vibe to it but
it's not necessarily a bad thing in fact
i think it was really cleverly designed
it's like iOS android combined together
to
become one you know spice girls song
right there like launcherpro you can
have multiple dock icons multiple home
screens customizable skinnable widgets
where you can tweak both their size and
behavior wacky transition effects
advanced advanced operating screen and
theme settings and a whole bunch of
other life changing holy cow can't
believe this is in real magic tweets and
settings something I really like about
go launcher are the three tabs at the
top of the application drawer displaying
all of your applications you recently
opened applications and activities and
all of that wonderful miscellaneous
stuff that's running in the background I
like that plus it's really fast earlier
I mentioned that this application was
really lightweight and oh man is it
lightweight baby even on this modern-day
grandpa phone like this nexus one here
it runs super smoothly even after
downloading and loading a bunch of go
launcher widgets it still runs great and
speaking of great i'ma give a shout out
to our sponsors at Thrillist you know
how yet that one friend at that one cool
hip friend who knows everything about
everything and hooks you up with the
latest music and bands before anyone has
even heard of him well thrillist is just
like that but for cool new stuff to do
in places to go you want to know about a
star wars burlesque show in beer garden
that screens 80's flicks or a new
restaurant with a sociate robot then
sign up for thrillist a free daily email
to sift through the crap to find the
best new bars restaurants events and
services whatever it is they promise
that it won't suck hit up thrillist calm
flash Buffalo that's realist calm such
be uff alo and you'll start getting
through all this is sweet sweet
knowledge right away
this of course is a personal thing but
the only only downside i can see of go
launcher ex would be that i'm not a big
fan of the default clock to include my
opinion they're just kind of did ugly
you know they pug fugly pugs ugly ugly
ugly betty ugly what can i say hccs
spoiled me with their oh so beautiful
sense UI clock no worries though my
friends with go launcher ex you can load
up any widget you want so all you gotta
do is go down to your local android
marketplace and pick up something called
LP sense clock for a few bucks and bam
sends clock with go launcher ex with
that like launcher pro i give go
launcher ex a solid five out of five but
unlike launcher pro go launcher ex is
completely free no featured limiting
light seven-day demo version nonsense
here completely free and awesome so for
you android users out there just go to
your local market places and pick up go
launcher ex I mean it's free it's
wonderful it's fantastic BAM and if you
have any applications that you would
like me to check out free free to leave
a comment below and yes I am aware that
my screen turned off but that's okay
that's okay and yeah I'll pick something
from the comments and a review for the
next episode of what see apps thank you
very much for tuning in this with John Q
from TechnoBuffalo and I'm gonna get
that fixed latest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
