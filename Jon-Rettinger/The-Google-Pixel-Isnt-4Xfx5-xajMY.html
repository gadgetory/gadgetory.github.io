series this is the Google pixel isn't if
you want to know how the positive is
about the Google pixel hit the link up
above and check out that video but this
one is all about bringing this phone to
reality calling out where the negatives
are and why this phone might not be for
you let me get this one out of the way
the phone looks much better in person
than it does in video but this phone is
by no means gonna win a phone beauty
contest it is not a gorgeous piece of
hardware it's functional and it works
well it's kind of like Google themselves
if you want a beautiful looking phone
this one is definitely not for you this
one is also not for you if you any sort
of waterproofing its IP 53 which is like
bare minimum of dust and water
resistance so if you want take your
phone out in the rain or maybe you feel
I need to dunk into a fish tank for some
reason this is definitely not gonna be
the phone for you
also not for you if we want wireless
charging because that ain't here on
either the Google pixel phones and also
not here expandable storage not here
either removable battery not here either
and some sort of modularity also not
here on these phones you get what I'm
saying
you might be also a little bit pissed -
pixel phone just maybe your Nexus user
maybe just bought a 60 or 5x a few
months ago and you're like you know what
I'm gonna buy these phones because
Google always pushes out updates to
these phones first you are good at a
look because you're not getting 7.1 for
many many months unfortunately you're
knocking a Google assistant for many
more months officially either which is
also kind of a bummer you are totally
left out to drive if you need a medium
amount of storage in 32 is too little 42
128 too much for you you're also at a
look also if you don't have a lot of
money to spend on a phone then this is
not for you 128 gig pixel XL is gonna
set you back almost $1000 u.s. that is
crazy pricing for a phone crazy pricing
pricing that Apple is barely been able
to get away with and this is a very new
for a for Google so it's expensive it's
got limitations as far as battery
wireless charging water resistance these
are things that a lot of competition
have
now there's a lot of negatives about
this phone it's got Gorilla Glass for
covering the screen but not gorilla
classify things you'd expect from a
higher-end phone and also as you decide
maybe you still want to ignore the
advice I'm giving this video and pick
one up and you might be like hey very
blue looks nice fingerprint magnet
silver looks nice too kind of boring the
black one I think is probably the best
color out there just if you're deciding
to buy one so a lot of negatives
surrounding the pixel phone but they're
definitely positives - about it
you get the Google sustainance daydream
ready the screens do look really nice
and the cameras are supposedly pretty
baller trying to hear about all those
things to link up above and check out
the Google pixel is for all dem
positives but if you run the negative
side of things let me know because video
thumbs up you always appreciate it so
