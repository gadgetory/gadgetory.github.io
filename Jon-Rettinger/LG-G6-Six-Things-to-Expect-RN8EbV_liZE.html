let's just say a galaxy worth of problem
selling their phones which is not to say
it hasn't had awesome hardware it's had
great screens pretty awesome specs and
they've tried some new things there's a
leather back on the g4 of course they
move the buttons to the back of the
phone the modularity of the g5 but
nothing has come together and a package
of consumers have been clamoring for so
LG is hoping that the strategy is going
to be less pixelated so to speak and the
g6 is gonna be the phone that's gonna
bring people back to LG so in
preparation for the g6 coming instead of
sitting in the Far East movements g6
song which I do think should a hundred
percent and be part of their ad campaign
here are six things to know about the LG
G six and also stay tuned to the end of
the video we're gonna pick a comment of
the day from a previous video and share
it with the audience and if you want to
check out the person you make the
comment we will link to it down below
and if you want to be featured in the
comments of the day just do the nice
comment so phones much like tech
reviewers need to look sexy and it looks
like the g6 is going to be bringing some
pretty sweet curves you have a screen to
bezel ratio of 90% which is only bested
by the Xiaomi me mix so it's gonna be
like holding an entire screen in your
hand we've got a really nice looks and
this entirely nice looks are gonna be
made out of completely metal and glass
so no plastic that your precious little
meat stylist is gonna be touching it's a
gross term tell me to never use that
again number two it's kind of a weird
one to get excited about but that phone
jack is still gonna be there that's a
really shook attention for a lot of
folks don't throw away your wired
headphones to be able to plug them right
into the g6 number three this one I'm
excited about LG took risks with the g5
they tried the modularity of the friends
but didn't really work you weren't
hot-swappable like you've got with the
Motorola phones they can just swap on a
battery pack you got to turn off the
phone or turned off the phone you pulled
out the battery didn't work that well
they weren't that many options they're
ditching that modular design going for
more traditional smartphone because and
have pieces and parts that come in and
out so see you later this next one is
kind of a bummer and you could probably
blame Samsung for it for hoarding
snapdragon 835 chips because it's not
going to be
g 6h deceive got a lot of flack for not
having these 35 and their new you line
of phones looks like LG rents the same
problem beige to see had samsung has
them also expect a Snapdragon 820 1 to
make it into the g6 number 5 this is
probably one of the biggest ones least
one of the difference makers for the
phone it's gonna have a different screen
resolution a new screen text so LG's
going to be calling it qhd+ honest 5.7
inch screen which you going to have an
aspect ratio of 18 by 9 which I guess
could be 2 to 1 if you just do the
division so it's gonna be 20 840 by 1440
s opposed to regular qh2 you to 2560 by
1440 it's not sharp they can be doing 2
extra vertical pixels but the rumor goes
it's gonna be better for multitasking
when you have apps running side by side
LG's got really good software
we're gonna run apps side by side so
well see how that works in practice see
what effects to just regular apps that
you use and last but definitely not
least number 6 it is coming soon it is
going to be announced at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona on February 26
shipping hopefully about two to three
weeks after that so you don't have to
wait that much longer to see what LG has
in store if they haven't given LG a shot
I think you should this screens are
pretty incredible they've been almost on
par with what Samsung has been doing
they're doing a lot of cool stuff with
software it's a little bit UI heavy in
the past little cartoony but the tweets
they've done are really nice of course
you don't like it throw a launcher on so
I'm gonna echo back to a video that I
had in the past wait to buy a smartphone
you should definitely give it a break
before you buy a phone to see what gets
announced and Mobile World Congress
because if you wanna buy an older device
so it might be discounted so get your
ing five if you want to wait till the G
6 comes out and our comment of the day
from the don't buy a smartphone yet
comes from AG nod and nod to says no g 6
jokes yet none so to you mid old video
now that hopefully you've just watched
about bad G 6 puns gonna be featured an
upcoming comment of day pretty obvious
had to do it
leave a comment tell me a joke ask me a
question comments on something and
they'll feature that coming video I'm
gonna link you enter description as well
hopefully get some more subscribers
your channel so next time I'm John
