to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys I'm Markin sangun from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's video we'll
be talking a bit about the LG g4s camera
LG has made some lofty claims about the
camera tech included in the g4 the
biggest of which is that the g4 can
replace your DSLR well I don't believe
that's entirely true the g4s camera is
still pretty remarkable nonetheless so
before we begin let's talk about what
we're working with the g4 features a
three axis optical image stabilization
and updated laser autofocus for faster
focusing and a new color spectrum sensor
which improves color accuracy by
precisely reading the RGB values in the
scene according to LG all of these new
improvements promise to combine into one
of the best mobile shooters out there
and we got to say LG isn't far off while
you'll get perfectly serviceable images
out of the g4s auto mode you'll get even
better pictures using the device's
manual mode which is one of the most
robust and powerful experiences we've
ever seen in a smartphone even though
the g4 is incapable of replacing an
entry-level DSLR that doesn't mean it
can have the SLR like functionality
manual modes are nothing new to
smartphones but the g4 brings it to an
entirely different level only match by
what you find in a Lumia device you'll
be able to change the shutter speed ISO
focus and white balance by using a
series of dedicated sliders on screen
giving you absolute control of what
you're shooting the white balance values
here are actually in Kelvin instead of
the usual presets that most smartphone
cameras offer like tungsten daylight
incandescent and fluorescent
unfortunately the only setting you can't
change here is the aperture but you do
have a constant F 1.8 aperture to allow
more light into the g4 sensor in manual
mode you'll get more information in
terms of what your settings are up at
the top of the screen there's a live
histogram which is a visual guide to the
range of tones and brightness levels in
an image next to that you'll see your
white balance values your focus your
exposure meter ISO levels shutter speed
and aperture the biggest advantage of
shooting in manual mode versus auto mode
is that you have full control of the
image
rather than letting the device determine
that for you the g4 actually has two
different auto modes simple auto which
lets you quickly take an image by
tapping on a screen and auto which
basically does everything for you though
you can tap the focus before you snap an
image so let's go ahead and talk about
what the shutter speed does to your
images in a DSLR the shutter speed is a
measure
how long your camera sensor is exposed
to light how fast or how slow the mirror
goes up and down the same goes through
the g4 with the exception of an actual
mirror going up and down say you want to
capture an action you need to use a
higher shutter speed like 1/1000 of a
second for example and this is only
really doable with a lot of light
present since the shutter speed is so
fast like at the beach when not a lot of
light is present or you want to create
some cool effects you can leave the
shutter open longer you can set the
shutter speed all the way from one six
thousand of a second down to a
ridiculous thirty Seconds you'll also
notice that when I bring up the shutter
speed the live preview of the camera
gets darker and that's because it's only
letting a certain amount of light into
the sensor like I explained earlier the
faster to speed the less light and the
slower the more light and that also
determines whether or not you can freeze
the action in front of you without using
a flash let me stop the video real fast

one word in caps at domain comms check
out so moving on to ISO next in very
basic terms ISO is how sensitive your
camera sensor is to available light the
lower the ISO number the less sensitive
it is to light while a higher ISO number
increases the sensitivity of your camera
back in the days of film cameras there
would be different values assigned to
different films and that would also
determine how noise the images turned
out so to put it in perspective shooting
at a lower ISO value like ISO 100 will
give you a much cleaner image with less
grain or noise compared to shooting at a
higher ISO value like ISO 1000 which
adds grain or noise to the image just
like shooting wood at the SLR using the
exposure meter at the top and mixing the
shutter speed and ISO values really does
help out a lot to create better images
and not just better but you also get
more creative as you shoot in manual
mode in auto mode you only have to rely
on the phone to figure out what's best
for your images shooting in manual mode
will give you the freedom to shoot your
pictures however you want whether that's
to shoot sports or capturing light
trails the g4s manual mode will allow
you to do that
and one thing that I noticed in manual
mode is that you can also shoot raw
that's right
you can shoot raw directly on your phone
wrong
is essentially a file format in a
similar way that JPEG is the file format
the difference here is that one
compresses the image within a camera and
processes the photos while raw keeps all
the data and information it captures
without compressing or processing the
image so to put it in perspective you
shot an image but forgot to change the
white balance well in RAW you'll be able
to fix that issue no problem you'll also
be able to fix exposure to a certain
extent compared to a JPEG file it
essentially gives you more room to edit
in post without the horrible compression
and an in-camera processing from a JPEG
file the camera tech inside the g4 is
great the device's auto mode will
produce some vibrant and crisp images
but if you really really want to see the
full potential of the g4s camera take
some time and use manual mode you'll
find yourself using it more often than
not and in time it should help you
become a better photographer anyways
thank you guys so much for watching and
if you guys found this video helpful
make sure to give it a thumbs up and we
will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
