lot of time in arcades as a kid there's
probably shocking to you I know actually
probably be shocking if you saw how bad
I am in video games but I did I grew up
in arcades and so well this thing isn't
exactly like my dreams of owning an
arcade game back when I was a kid you
know like Rick Schroder on silver spoons
what was his name Ricky Stratton was
that the name of the show whatever was
anyway technobuffalo is on revision3 new
episodes every Monday Wednesday and
Friday 5 p.m. pacific time going on i'm
noah from TechnoBuffalo calm thanks to
the folks at thinkgeek who took an April
Fool's joke made it come true it's the
thinkgeek icade they sent over a unit
for me to put together and try out it is
basically what it is is it's a Bluetooth
controller arcade-style controller
joystick eight buttons and then it's
this that little wooden cabinet here
with a little holder for your iPad and
so what you do is you slide your iPad in
and you pair it with the icade it's
actually made by a company called ion
audio who's made a bunch of a USB based
audio peripherals that kind of stuff but
you pair the unit with your iPad it
works with ipad 1 or ipad 2 and you
download this app the Atari greatest
hits here and the app comes with one
game for free I guess it rotates but
when I downloaded the app became with
missile command for free and then the
other games are 99 cents per 4 pack or
you can get all the games 100 games for
fifteen bucks 1499 in-app purchases and
these are old classic Atari arcade games
and also Atari 2600 games i'll zoom in a
little bit here and then what you can do
is you can play the games using the ik
and i'll tell you what if your retro
gamer or you know your retro gamer ooh
as kids from what i've read some people
have kids like this thing or you know
whatever it is you're into these old
atari games this is fun stuff the unit
itself is a hundred bucks ninety nine
dollars which is kind of expensive
frankly for what it is but it works
pretty well my own
bad Missile Command skills
notwithstanding this game that i
remember this game from there's this
place near where I grew up called Malibu
Graham free it was a go-cart track and
they had a huge arcade inside and on
Saturday mornings they had a thing where
you could pay whatever it was like ten
bucks and you got unlimited gaming and
like a free coke for like three hours or
something and it was just full of junior
high elementary junior high high
school-age nerds all boys there were
like two girls that ever shut up there
and it was good times and this is one of
the games they had there and this thing
was hard this actually had a trackpad or
trackball rather on the original here
obviously on the icade you've got your
joystick with your fire buttons but I
cade unit works well unfortunately it's
only compatible right now with this
entire Greatest Hits app and while there
are a lot of cool games on the App not
you know whoops not all of the games
that i would i would really like to see
her i mean this thing is just begging
for pac-man miss pac-man don't have that
what you do get got Missile Command
you've got centipede and millipede
asteroids asteroids deluxe and then some
of the older Atari games the the vector
based games battlezone Black Widow
Crystal Castles I was a fun game again
another track ball game ah gravatar
Liberator lunar lander major havoc
course palm have Red Baron space duel
super breakout tempest another awesome
game warlords and they're back to
missile command and so whether the games
had you know trackballs of joysticks or
whatnot you know the commands are mapped
out to work the responsiveness is pretty
good I'll show you asteroids here and
Astros you can use either with the
joystick or just with the buttons the
original game was a just with the
buttons and you had the five buttons for
rotate left right hyperspace thrust and
fire original graphics original sound
original mad skills this game 1979 make
it 1 30 irony want to add that up 32
years old that's crazy
but good stuff if you're a retro gaming
fan and then if you go back also a ton
of a ton of Atari 2600 games
and so a lot of times in these four
packs you get you know you get a couple
of each you get on well this one
adventure for pack is just the console
games but some of these you get a
console game and and arcade games
together so here's circus Atari 27 gamer
had that game as a kid that was fun so
you get the arcade game super breakout
and then you get a breakout circus Atari
and off the wall for the council and you
can see here the old graphics man you
kids you young whippersnappers with your
ps3's you don't know how good you have
it because this is what I played back in
the day but pretty cool pretty fun stuff
the games work well the ports are really
nice the controls generally work well
they're kind of loud the buttons are
pretty loud but they're responsive the
joystick has kind of like a clicking
action to it it's also kind of noisy and
pretty loose so not you know the most
precise awesome joystick ever but it's
got a pretty good feel the the retro
arcade ball there is great but again it
just it really makes me want to play
pac-man or miss pac-man ah the website
on ion audio com and on thinkgeek says
that you know they're working with
developers to to map more games to these
controls to develop games for the ik but
again right now it's only the Atari app
so hundred bucks for the console or for
the arcade cabinet if you will 15 bucks
for all the Atari games and that's not
to mention the price the iPad not cheap
but a pretty cool works pretty well you
know the back you hear and the nice
retro graphics and then on the back I
mean all this really is is some
compressed wood with the decals on the
side I might got a little wobble to it I
just put this together over the weekend
comes with an Allen wrench it's like
assembling a piece of ikea furniture you
know took about 15 minutes put together
not a big deal one thing though that I
don't like is that the unit is Bluetooth
powered and so I mean is battery powered
rather for the bluetooth so there's
actually no dock connector near this is
just a piece of plastic with nothing
there it just holds the thing in place
so i was expecting there be some kind of
a docking station to keep your ipad
charged or if they're very least a
pass-through for your ipad cable to keep
it charged while you're playing but
there's not there's an AC port on the
back of the unit but no we see
after control the ik comes with two
double A batteries to play it's got the
little fo the power light years behind
the full quarter slot were just kind of
fun but you know so all in all bang for
your buck wise no it's not a good value
but it's fun if you've got the money to
spend or you want to get somebody you
know a retro gaming fanatic a cool
present especially if they already have
an ipad or ipad 2 it's a fun thing so
it's a thumbs up on the ik thumbs down
on the price what are you gonna do it's
the icade from ion audio and thinkgeek
again hundred bucks works of tards
greatest hits would love to see it work
with some other programs because I here
I'll take you to them I was playing some
centipede on or millipede on the 2600
here and this is the kind of thing where
it's really you know it's really the
retro factor that's going to get you
because the graphics here are are
nothing to write home about in today's
day and age that's for sure you see my
battery's running out there I get the
charge of the thing but the old graphics
and then atari 2600 I'll tell you what
come a long way doom gun place of my
adventure they have adventure on this
thing go capture the microdot anyway
there you go good stuff more information
available over at thinkgeek com thanks
to those folks percent of the review
loop with you unit over I'm gonna see if
I can break my high score protect my
Buffalo taking a trip back to my
childhood I'm dawn crab it's much much
