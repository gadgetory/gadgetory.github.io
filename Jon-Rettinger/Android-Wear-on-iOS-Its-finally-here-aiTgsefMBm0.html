to you by harry's hey what's going on
guys a mark from sang and from
TechnoBuffalo and Android wear for iOS
is finally here
Google this week revealed that it's
Android wear platform will now work with
the iPhone however there are a few
caveats namely only a select few Android
wear devices are compatible such as the
LG watch urbane Huawei watch and a Susan
watch too and any other Android wear
devices that gets released in the future
we did find out that if your Android
wear device is running the latest
Android wear 1.3 software it should work
properly though it's unclear how long
these older devices will unofficially be
supported the other big caveat of using
Android wear with an iPhone is that the
watches can do quite as much as the
Apple watch nor can they do as much as
an agent wear the Vice paired with an
Android smartphone as you'd expect
iPhone users won't quite get the full
Android wear experience because of
Apple's control over iOS but the
platform still does a lot on an iPhone
notifications are mirrored you get
Google now cards you can use voice
search and support rich notifications
would first-party Google apps such as
Gmail and calendar setting up an Android
wear device with an iPhone is fairly
easy simply download the Android wear
app from Apple's App Store
pair the watch with the phone go through
the setup process and that's about it
after your watch of choice is paired you
can start receiving notifications get
Google now cards install different watch
faces using the angel wear app on your
iPhone and even use a few native apps on
a watch like the weather app or the new
Translate app unfortunately because if
Apple's hold over iOS users won't be
able to install third-party apps
directly on their Android wear devices
users also won't be able to reply to
text directly though they will be able
to reply to Gmail messages but Apple
strict control over iOS experience isn't
as fleshed out which means your Android
wear device is mostly relegated to being
a notification machine Jeff Chang who's
the lead product manager for Android
wear I said that Google will continue to
work with Apple and make sure that they
understand and abide by their guidelines
and that they'll continue to do that as
they update the app in the future unless
Apple becomes more lacs with its
restrictions
this is the best Google can do Google
did manage to offer some advanced
features with its own Google Apps if
you're using calendar or Gmail for
example you'll receive richer
notifications with more details than you
would with the default apps from Apple
Google also figured out a way to
autoblock notifications from duplicating
which
very convenient if you're using Apple's
default calendar app and Google's app
you'll also be able to block an app
manually which essentially stops
notifications from hitting your watch
we paired both a watch urbane and a mode
of 360 which come with their own watch
faces pre-installed through the Android
wear app for iOS however Google has
essentially put a mini app store for
other third-party watch faces inside the
app so you can further customize your
device if you simply can't justify
spending three hundred fifty dollars for
an Apple watch and maybe you just want
more variety in your life now's a great
time to consider an Android wear device
using one would your iPhone won't be
quite experience of using an Apple watch
or even using an Android wear device
would an age or a smartphone but it's
still a great experience and with a ton
of new Android wear devices on the
horizon iPhone users will have more
devices to look forward to in a near
future so before we end this video I
want to thank our friends over at
Harry's shaving can be quite expensive
nowadays but fortunately our friends at
Harry's can hook you up with premium
razors at non premium prices their
starter kit starts - just $15 and that
includes the razor three blades and your
choice of Harry shave cream or foaming
gel I personally like the gel it feels
nice on my face now as an added bonus
you can get five dollars off your first
purchase by using the code techno after
using the code you can also get an
entire month of Shaving for just ten
dollars anyways thank you guys so much
