brought to you by Netflix welcome back
to another episode of renter's rants I'm
your host Jon wrenches to show where I
rant and rave and give my opinion on
stuff and I have lots of pinions on
stuff this is a topic that seems to
creep up every four or five months and
this time I want to put the question to
you I want to talk about why you feel so
strongly about cell phone operating
system cell phone brands and why any
sense of decorum and what's socially
acceptable goes totally out the window
as soon as somebody mentions apple
android samsung HTC or anything that has
to do with the mobile phone world this
is retinas rants let's go ahead and get
random so last weekend i unboxed the HTC
one which is thus far have been one of
my favorite phones of the year and as
soon as that video went up the comments
section was inundated with android sucks
apple sucks HTC sucked and just the hate
words being thrown out so instead of me
trying to explain why you feel that way
why that happens i want to ask you the
audience why why does it happen i'm not
cheer to pass judgment I'm not here to
say you're wrong you're right but I do
want to try and understand it'll help us
make better videos it'll help me better
understand the content and better
understand the rationale of the islands
because sometimes i just cannot
understand so the full disclaimer here i
understands as well that that's not
everybody out there I know it's a vocal
minority that does that kind of thing
but I want to know why what is about
cell phones and tablets in particular
that make people feel so strongly I'll
draw analogies in the past and same
phenomena doesn't exist with other
products if I go out and buy broccoli
people aren't gonna ridicule me
providing cauliflower if I zucchini
people aren't gonna yell at me for not
buying a cucumber I just cannot
understand why and why people aren't
allowed to like one product over another
weather lots of like both products I'm a
fan of iOS and a fan of Android I've
certainly used both pretty close to
equally actually I'm not sure why that
sometimes seems so crazy to people I
really want to understand what goes on
at rationale and the excuse that I just
get so upset because iphone users are
Android users feel so cocky and I just
want to bring him back down to earth is
not a good point that's not a good plan
people are gonna feel cocky about
anything in the world and to create a
response try to bring people down is so
silly but that's the reason I want to
know why tell me please i want to read
every one of these comments to try and
understand why these wars happen why the
term fanboy is thrown around like such a
negative thing if you like a product you
should be allowed to like it and the
idea that people are biased or not bias
is absolutely ridiculous any review is
completely subjective it's a review
based on that person's opinion that's
doing it so to throw the word bias
around makes no sense at all yes there's
gonna be biases about everything that
goes in there if I'm wearing a blue
shirt today I was biased against wearing
a green shirt I suppose it just doesn't
make sense to me on are you trying to
find people that agree with your same
decision to try and make you feel better
and reduce your cognitive dissonance
about buying your products if you bought
an iphone 5 someone didn't buy an iphone
5 to make you feel bad about your
purchase is that where else is coming
from please try and explain I cannot for
the life of me understand why all sense
of decorum goes out the window as
students smartphone operating systems
are mentioned leave your comments down
below please I'm going to read all of
them lose it away from the fanboy wars
