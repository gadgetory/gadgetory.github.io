party-line desk raspy voice I'm still a
little bit under the weather about two
weeks ago I made a video about my
experience with Dells customer service
I'll put a link to it in the sidebar
but the real quick recap is that I
wanted to order a 23 inch monitor from
them and accidentally ordered the wrong
one totally my fault
but what followed afterwards there's a
customer service nightmare
I tried to return the monitor I was hung
up on I was transferred 10 and 20 and 30
of times I was told I didn't really want
to return it it was just a really bad
customer experience so taking advantage
of sort of having a little bit of a
larger audience I wanted to share my
experience of you guys so you wouldn't
have the same trouble with Dell if
you're looking to buy a monitor or any
other one of their products but long
story short I was contacted by a few
different representatives from Dell and
one of the representatives in Horn me
that Dell was undergoing a very large
initiative to improve their customer
service which clearly is needed Nassif I
would speak to Dells customer service
reps and also Dell the executive team
sort of recant my experience this is
supposed to happen tomorrow
and I asked if I was only contacted
because because of my on it's because of
you guys supporting me you know people
see my videos maybe more than a few
other people's and they insist that my
audience had nothing to do with them
contacting me although I certainly tend
to disagree but tomorrow was an
opportunity for me to be a customer
service advocate to sort of speak out
for for me speak out for you guys on
some customer service experiences that
you've had with them so I'm asking is if
you leave your comments down below about
what happens with Alan maybe suggestions
you might have them to improve customer
service leave a text response or video
response and I will relay these messages
to Dell senior executive board to help
them improve their customer service
it is certainly well needed my
experience was absolutely awful on some
of the worst customer service I've ever
experienced so the fact that maybe I
have to be helping you guys in the
future they even helping me in the
future with the positive experience is
very exciting I'm looking forward to
being a consumer advocate sort of
helping out and sort of speaking for the
common man you know
I clearly him so I I'm excited and I
want to know sort of if you guys can
help if you can share your experiences
so that I can relay the message and I
can help
maybe spearhead some changes within Dell
anyways that was it see ya thanks video
thank you and I'll also let you know how
it goes when I speak to Dell I'm gonna
ask they're good let me record it it's
actually going to be done via Skype web
call I don't they're going to allow it
or not I'm totally gonna try and if they
do of course I will post it here see you
guys the next one buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
