to you by gamefly what's up everyone
welcome back the episode of rumor
roundup the show title should give it
away we take all the tech rumors from
the week and we pick the four most
important and serve them up to you in
one several minute video so you know
everything that you missed of this week
the HTC to apparently to Apple
smartwatches might be coming crazy new
touchscreen tech also coming to apple
and google glass is getting a competitor
from a super unlikely source is rumor
roundup i'm jon rettinger let's start
rounding them up you know that hot new
HTC one you just picked up thrown away
Oh obsolete I feel like I'm at a nap
aquino the projects got at least six
months ago it's obsolete you don't need
it anymore evidently HTC one is going to
get a sequel that can come as much a
surprise but last week we saw the first
photo so it might be the follow-up to
the aforementioned HTC One codenamed HTC
m8 maybe just mate trying to be cute
like down the back the license plates
the device bears a pretty strong
resemblance HTC one with very few
noticeable differences at least based on
the super blurry photos that we saw so
now our friend every stepped in to clear
things up claiming to know whether the
device will launch in which you excuse
it will support saying it will come to
all US carriers end of q1 so March ish
2014 what you feel to get your hands on
the new HTC two or a mate or maybe some
they call it something different so
based on recent leaks the m8 appears to
feature kind of a curve design instead
of the one sandwich edges which might
everybody down could a fingerprint
scanner on the back of the device just
above the rear camera I know that sounds
kind of cop outing like it might or
might not also cure cancer probably not
but it's one of those two for sure the
leaf casing is also missing the Beats
Audio logo that's no surprise because
beads bought back all the shares from
HTC recently so buh-bye beats and
bye-bye red headphones included in the
box you've been holding out for a brand
new apple television set or ITV ever you
want to call it you may have to wait a
little longer supposedly those
initiatives have been halted but the
good news is it's been halted in order
to get a smart watch out the door or
smartwatches SmartWatch I so according
to research from displaysearch which
hasn't had the best track record I'm
just going to throw that out there Apple
will supposedly launch two models there
in accommodate different sized wrists
and one day one point seven inches
playing one to one point three inch
display by comparison just so you know
galaxy Gear's got a 1.6 three inch
display while the pebble smartwatch is a
paltry 1.26 inch screen difference that
was supposedly going to be to appeal to
men and women at the idea being that
women typically have smaller wrists and
then I'm still marking is clearly the
speculation column until we hear more
concrete info but Apple did suggest
going to enter new product arenas in
2014 and wearable tech is definitely hot
hot hot new commodity and while we're
talking about Apple let's go and keep
with them supposedly new touch room
technologies coming to the smartphone
maker app at discovered by our friends
at Apple Insider add some credibility to
recent bloomberg article Amy apples
working on crazy new futuristic enhanced
touch sensors to go in their iPhones so
over the weekend Bloomberg sources said
that Apple was developing touchscreen
tech that was more receptive different
levels of pressure possibly allowing
Apple trigger different UI functions
which is kind of neat this patent
supposedly implies to the physical
buttons but really deep down they're
suggesting Apple could use technology on
touchscreens themselves so meeting a
light press does something in a harder
press that something which is kind of
cool a bloomberg reports are kind of AZ
I want to be implemented so don't hold
your breath but to consumers might not
see this tech if you even exist until
2015 or later meaning iphone 6s or
iphone 7 it sounds interesting and it
definitely changed the way we interact
with our devices but I don't know that's
it kind of squishy right the competition
is always a good thing and you expect a
google glass to get some competition
from I don't know maybe like apple or
Samsung but we don't expect them to get
competition from is nice on the car
manufacturer supposedly engineers over a
Nissan have been watching way too much
dragonball z look at these glasses on
Sunday the automaker T's crazy new glass
like technology that looks almost
identical to the scouter device Nissan
doesn't really reveal anything at all
about the device being teased although
its unveiling is supposed to be at the
43rd annual tokyo auto show which is
supposed to open up on the twentieth of
november we've got no information with
share d size instead a word at all
supposedly being called a 3 e and i
would guess going to use it for
navigating highways byways and wherever
might want to drive looks kind of cool
that is until the cops had to pull you
over for wearing some freaky looking
