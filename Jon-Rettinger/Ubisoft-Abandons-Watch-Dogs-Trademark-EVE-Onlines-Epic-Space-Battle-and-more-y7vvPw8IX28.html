to you by gamefly Ubisoft abandons the
watch dogs trademark a massive space
battle commences in EVE Online and
Nintendo's newest future venture also we
played octodad dadliest catch and check
out the week's new releases let's get
out of controller hello and welcome out
of controller the weekly TechnoBuffalo
show that covers all your gaming news
reviews demos and new releases in an
easy to digest capsule form I'm your
host Ashley skele it's always a big week
in gaming so let's hit the news some
crazy things happening in the world of
gaming yesterday morning news broke that
Ubisoft had filed for and received an
express abandonment of their trademark
for watch dogs of course tons of
theories then swarmed the internet from
watch dogs is getting rebranded as an
assassin's creed game 2 oh no UV safa
scanning watch dogs but it looks like
something even more nefarious is at play
here Ubisoft announced this morning the
application for express abandonment was
fraudulent and they'd made a new filing
with the u.s. patent and trade office to
get the trademark back it's pretty
strange to think this went through
without the USPTO or Ubisoft finding out
mid process but if I had to pinpoint a
likely culprit well obviously everyone
this is the work of aiden pearce if
you're not familiar with the workings of
EVE Online I will try to sum up it is a
massive sandbox MMORPG with a very
robust economy and some crazy deep game
systems last week there was a massive
battle and the eve online community blog
laid out the crazy timeline of events
after a player missed a payment on a
system the controlling alliance came to
reclaim it but then another alliance
came to fight for it the aftermath
resulted in around 21 hours of total
fighting 7548 unique characters
participating 75 Titans those are the
games most expensive and time consuming
to build ships destroyed and an in-game
economic impact of 11 trillion if
which by the way could equate to
approximately 300 to 330 thousand
dollars in real world money whoa
Nintendo held a strategy briefing late
last week with CEO Satoru Iwata
discussing the company's plans for the
future he reiterated there were no plans
to release games for mobile devices and
insisted the 3ds handheld console would
drive operating profit next year
speaking of the 3d wada said to expect a
merging of handheld and home console
software in the future he also mentioned
an interesting new future venture
involving health to be released sometime
in 2015 and hinted the device or service
could be used quote beyond the living
room unquote unlike the fit in fact he
said quote I'm sure you're thinking of
we fit but this is not like anything we
have made before unclipped based on
precedent I predict whatever it is it is
going to be wacky and people might
really love it let's play as a feature
