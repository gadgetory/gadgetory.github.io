TechnoBuffalo here at than unboxing of
one of the hottest handsets on the
market this is the extremely powerful
and capable in galaxy s2 I've already
seen it dressed up and sprint clothing
let's go ahead and take a look at AT&amp;amp;T
barian all right so you're gonna be able
to get your Android loving hands on this
guy on October 2nd for just under two
hundred dollars this is hot off the
presses it just came to us courtesy the
folks Samsung so we've got a galaxy s2
on the front Samsung's name some
pictures blah blah blah and some specs
on the back but of course we're going to
talk about oh good stuff for G is the
HSPA+ variety alright let's go ahead and
dig in I'm really excited to take a look
at this the galaxy s2 is arguably one of
the most powerful if not the most
powerful phone on the market and capable
phone on the market looks like this
one's actually powered on the system
alright so here's the phone push it off
to the side for just a quick minute and
see what else we are going to get in the
box anybody taking guesses it's gonna
have a cord and charger we've got some
books that's probably not gonna read the
standard Samsung charger we've seen with
most of their phones and a microUSB port
blah blah blah accessories let's go
ahead and take a look at the phone it is
worth noting though that in our FedEx
package at this payment there was a hdmi
cable included in here not sure if it's
going to be included in the box when
this finally gets retailed but you know
it was included in ours alright so we'll
go ahead and peel off any stickers
looks like doing something here
something happen in the shipping I'm go
ahead and kill off the sticker there and
we'll go ahead and let it reboot samsung
galaxy s you see the splash screen while
I talk go ahead and move it over zoom in
let's run through the specs because
there's a lot to talk about on this guy
you've probably heard about this I'm
assuming and probably know the specs by
heart like I do let's go ahead and run
anyway you are looking at an absolute
gorgeous 4.3 inch of quartz at the
diagonal Super AMOLED plus display so
what a Super AMOLED plus mean
essentially what it boils down to is
you're gonna get darker darks you're
gonna get more vibrant colors you're
also gonna get better visibility in
direct sunlight you're gonna get a
little bit of a bluish hue but not
nearly as bad as we've seen on previous
AMOLED screens this is probably one of
the best screens on the market right now
one of those phones you really have to
sort of see it to appreciate it slide to
the side here protecting the screen side
the resolution of 480 by 800 is Corning
Gorilla Glass let me put this guy in his
pocket with some keys not to worry
you're going to be okay are we looking
at right now is TouchWiz 4.0 sitting on
top book and enjoy Gingerbread and
powering this guy is a crazy fast
dual-core 1.2 gigahertz processor and if
you're like me you probably would I see
what the quadrant score is gonna be on
this guy so I'm gonna run that probably
the first thing I do when I do my test
to see how fast this thing really is
it's got a gig of ram to help it do its
thing 16 gigs of internal storage on the
back we have an 8 megapixel camera with
LED flash it can also shoot 1080p video
at 30 frames per second and on the front
that is not a VGA camera that's actually
a 2 megapixel camera on the front for
video chat or taking your Facebook
photos of yourself or making sexy face
this thing is extremely thin and really
light and what he's in at 116 grams
let's go ahead and pull off the back
let's see what size card I'm going to
come with the phone so with sim card
included looks like no microSD card I've
been here these on our demo game but you
all have 16 gigs of storage here as well
and you can augment that with an extra
32 gigabyte card go in slide this
plastic back on and we'll do a real
quick to our device the stack was very
thin kind of blending alright so let's
take a quick look at what we got push
that down on the table so you got your
screen obviously your for Android
capacitive
that menu home back in search camera and
sensors on the upper left-hand corner on
the left and volume rocker up and down
it will pronounced on the right hand
side you've got a power and lock button
on top there's your three point five
millimeter headset jack on the bottom
your microphone and micro USB charging
port so it is really incredibly light
one of those things you got it up hold
in your hand to appreciate let's do a
real quick size comparison here here is
the iPhone 4
I'll gussied up in white he's definitely
difference in the screen size look at
this business especially when you
consider this guy's rock in a 1.2 bigger
dual-core processor give your RAM it's
very impressive
let's bring in my daily driver here this
is the BlackBerry Bold 9900 see all
these guys on top of each other we'll
make our smart phones sandwich and you
can really appreciate the goodness of
the samsung galaxy s2 I think you guys
want to see from this phone be sure to
let me know on the comments I'll be
doing hands-on its clone of other videos
but I wanted to show you these two quick
demonstration
I didn't the unboxing what the phone
looks like and a short overview of what
it can do you see the keyboard right
there as well next wipe on the air
but not enabled by default a bit like so
we'll see what you can see you've got on
here welcome in to jump into
applications a quick look at some of the
ETM c businesses in here typical stuff
my AT&amp;amp;T AT&amp;amp;T Navigator and it's smooth
scrolling so if we keep going from a
page to app page without worry but you
can keep up with me you can see
everything that's on there so for all of
your Samsung Galaxy S 2 coverage sure to
