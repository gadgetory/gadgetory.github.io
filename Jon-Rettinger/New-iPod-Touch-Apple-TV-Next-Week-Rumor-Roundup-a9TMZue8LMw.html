technobuffalo here just a few minutes
ago Apple issued press conferences for
an upcoming September first media
focused event let's go and run through
what I expect them to an axe so
traditionally apples help September
events to launch new ipods and expect
this year to be no different I think
we're going to see is finally a brand
new ipod touch with that long rumored
and much speculated front-facing camera
which should give users of the ipod
touch access to FaceTime additionally
now at the iphone for facetime has been
based on a phone number to phone number
abu seeing the reports that perhaps face
home can be used with an email address
so probably see it just Wi-Fi base as
well but if you have an improved email
address connected over Wi-Fi you'll be
able to get your face time on and also
that should work with an ipod touch to
an iphone 4 also speaking about the
iphone 4 1 the great things about or is
its high-definition retina display i
expect to see that i transferred over to
the ipod touch as well i think we're
probably going to see a new redesign of
the ipod touch i don't think we're going
to see the same design that we have on
the iphone certainly that metal bands
which people have been plenty of talking
about no need to really have that full
band of going all the way on the ipod
touch since the left side is for the
cellular radios on the right is for
Wi-Fi so you may still see that internal
radio and perhaps a bit of your redesign
probably see the prices stay just about
the same storage increases perhaps up to
128 probably 64 gig so will still be the
top of the line a sort of the next room
we've been hearing a lot about is Apple
TV you might not remember what Apple TV
was first announced it was actually
called ITV and then when it came to
launch time Apple rating that's Apple TV
it looks like they're reverting back to
that ITV name and we're going to finally
see a redesign Apple TV we haven't seen
her redesigns as it first launched many
many many years ago
presumably it's going to be the size of
an iphone I have a little bit of local
storage but presumably be cloud-based
and storage meeting your storage will be
stored all online I should be running
the same one gator chip that we see
powering the iPad new iphone 4 and
probably also the new ipod touch it's
also going to be getting some sort of
app support so there will be an app
store meant for the apple TV me like a
hulu app and all kinds of other things a
potential for apps really are in the
hands of developers it could be a lot of
fun we may also see the iphone ipod
touch and ipad surfers a giant remote
for this new Apple TV oh it should be
very cool again be running a modified
version of iOS unscannable TV we also
see some updates to iTunes else we're
playing with that new Apple TV or ITV to
get to renamed there's been a lot of
rumors of 99-cent TV rentals I would be
quite nice if you want to watch a TV
show ninety-nine cents if you need
access to it save the hassle of having
to go and buy the full episode for a bit
more well certainly could be a really
nice addition to itunes I'm speaking of
itunes apple bottom streaming music
service koala little while ago we
haven't seen the fruits of that
acquisition pay off yet but we may
finally see a cloud based itunes
electric a fantastic so you could access
your whole itunes library from any
computer whether we'll see updates to
the ipod classic I don't know we may
also see a new ipod nano especially what
we've seen them here many rumors about a
new nay not expect probably the same
design perhaps an improved camera and a
bump in storage I'll the ipod shuffle
calvi will stay pretty stagnant i
haven't heard much about that a shuffle
line may be discontinued perhaps an
aniline will drop in price and sort of
filter right in to where that current
shuffle is now so what do you guys think
about these rumors would you expect you
to come off you think I missed something
really close to what you guys have to
say anyway i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and of course come
September first we will be covering
everything a minute by minute on the
twitter feed and on the website so be
sure to stay tuned up a twitter feed go
to twitter com
that's John for lakers and we hit our
Twitter limit we bump on over to
twitter.com / technobuffalo see you next
video bye bye
