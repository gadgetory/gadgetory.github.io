to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rumor
roundup this to show we take all the
tech news from the week and there are a
ton of rumors this week and we picked
the four or five best and share them
with you in one condensed video of this
week the Nexus 5 was possibly revealed
inadvertently or advertently in a Google
video Apple developing some weird 17
watt power adapter for some crazy new
device the Moto X might get a price drop
to a cool Hyundai and the surface pro 2
might be on the horizon this rumor
roundup i'm jon rettinger let's go ahead
get started the nexus 5 possibly
revealed in a new google video so the
story goes like this google surprised
everyone by calling the next version of
android kitkat we all just assumed it
was going to be key lime pie which is
now a delicious but also not what the
name ended up being no one had any idea
was gonna be KitKat the Google put out a
video showing them erecting a kitkat
statue on their campus they showed all
the employees all excited about this
crazy and probably delicious KitKat
stash including one guy holding a phone
with the Nexus logo totally done in
landscape if you look at the Nexus 4
it's in portrait and the back is a matte
finish as opposed to Nexus 4 which has
for that glossy glass look getting
reflecting thing on it so the Internet's
went up in a buzz ins like hmm to see
how the Nexus 5 out on campus and that
Google not notice that and yeah it's
possible I would guess though that it's
google totally messing with bloggers and
to sort of follow the steps of what
happens next after a leak gets unveiled
they took the video down Google from
playing this game for many many years I
would guess they're probably messing
with us I will say though device looks
eerily similar to the sony z1 not saying
sony's making the next nexus just it
looks very very similar Apple's posli
developing a weird 17 watt power adapter
we don't usually cover power adapters
but this one is kind of unique according
to the folks at Apple Insider citing
people familiar with the matter they're
claiming that apple releasing brands a
new product besides the iphone or ipad
in the next 12 months although it's
totally unclear with the device is going
to be the case you're saying
John 17 bought what is that equal so the
current ipad comes a 12 watt adapter
whereas a macbook air uses a 45 watt
adapter so 17 seems like too much power
for a watch and not enough power for a
new computer so what bag is are going to
be four perhaps maybe a giant iPad or a
touchscreen laptop valid it's for a
television but it would be cool of Apple
totally surprised this with a one more
thing or a product we had no idea about
but it could come in the next 12 months
so I wouldn't hold your breath for that
September 10th event have you been
looking at that moto x and being like
man i wish i could make my own
smartphone and bright red with yellow
accents with the white front well you
might be in luck and your patients might
have paid off according to our good
friend evleaks on his twitter account
you should give him a follow @evleaks
moto x price drops to 100 coming in q4
along with wooden back configurations
for 50 bucks so your face is going to
pay off but I put a lot of koreans this
one and put it about as close to fact as
we can before motor oil actually danced
it themselves and last but not least
something I'm all excited about and I
have to do an updated review on the
surface pro I've actually been using it
as my dedicated computer at home for the
past three weeks and honestly I really
enjoyed it it's taking me about 10 days
to get the learning curve of Windows 8
and I really appreciate it now I think
it's only fair up at that review so I
digress that will be coming soon but
looks like my sweet baby surface / lucky
getting a new older brother as its
sequel like becoming very soon upgrade
is supposed to be a hass well based core
i5 with increased ram giving consumers
the option to choose between four or
eight gigs which eight gigs would be
awesome supposedly have kind of the same
design as a curtain surface pro a more
refined kickstand win super site says
the surface pro 2 will definitely be
more than a modest upgrade with improved
battery life and upgraded specs we don't
know when it's going to come but if you
do the math the holiday season is coming
up very quickly it would only make sense
for Microsoft releases some time at end
of October early November so you can go
buy it for your friends your family or
yourself for Christmas Hanukkah or any
