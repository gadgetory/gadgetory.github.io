review of the Nintendo 2ds there are
other opinions on the 2d s online but
this one is mine so let's take a look
okay so the Nintendo 2ds is an
interesting device at first I was really
skeptical who would want this thing if
they could have a Nintendo 3ds XL so
then we got it here in the office I used
it and I started really thinking about
it I'll get to my conclusions a little
bit later in the video but for now let's
talk about my usage I use the Nintendo
2ds for six days and I played the Legend
of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3d on it almost
exclusively I've used the standard and
XL variants of the 3ds so I do have
reference points and actually really
enjoy mobile and handheld gaming in
general okay so onto hardware obviously
the 2d s is a lot different looking than
the 3ds there's no clamshell you can't
snap it shut and as the name would
suggest there is no 3d on board the
control stick feels the same as the 3ds
with a nice soft touch to it and the
bumpers also feel really nice and sturdy
it does feel a little bit inexpensive
but other than that it actually feels
really solid it doesn't feel fragile at
all which is really nice since you can't
close the two TS there's a sleep switch
on the bottom right that will let you
put your 2d s to bed without shutting it
off which is a really important feature
if you're a big StreetPass person the 2d
S comes with a four gigabyte SD card
included with your purchase which is a
nice little extra but not terribly huge
in terms of space or card generosity I'm
not really sure why Nintendo felt the
need to keep the 3ds side-by-side
cameras on the 2d s since you can't
really preview anything in three
dimensions on the 2d s screens but AR
games I guess speaking of the screens
actually I should say screen because the
screens are actually just one screen
under the front plastic cover that makes
them look separate that's a cost-saving
measure by Nintendo and honestly you
won't really notice it you will however
notice how small the screens are if you
ever used or held a 3ds XL there are the
same size as the original 3ds but for
some of us that might not be enough and
now I'm probably saying this because of
my old eyes and I'm guessing kids won't
have any problems using the 2d SS
smaller screens um the one thing I do
worry about with the screens is
scratching since you can't close it shut
like 3ds and I wish Nintendo would have
included
either maybe a silicon cover for the
front with the device though I'd imagine
you could probably make one pretty easy
with some light magnets on the corners
that would be cool or even maybe
something from a third-party accessory
maker that's fitted to the front of the
device as for software it's all the same
as the 3ds love it or hate it there's
not much to say about the 2d SS software
beyond that it's easy to navigate
I wish the shop was a little faster to
load all that stuff gaming the number
one reason you'd buy this was really
straightforward on the 2d s there's no
slider for 3d and oddly enough a bunch
of my friends currently hooked on
pokemon X&amp;amp;Y said the game actually ran
smoother on the 2d s than it did on the
3ds using 3d so take that for what it's
worth though I'm sure if you already
have a 3ds you're not really going to go
get one of these I never found myself
missing 3d on the 2d S which was a very
good thing in my opinion
okay so let's wrap this review up I was
a complete skeptic when the 2d s was
announced it was too weird but then I
actually spent some time with it and
honestly found myself enjoying the
gaming experience with it it's perfect
for little hands and more than
satisfactory for adult ones the price
point alone is super compelling and it's
obvious when intend to release this
alongside Pokemon X&amp;amp;Y so I'm giving the
2d s the Nintendo 2ds a score of seven
point five if you don't have a 3ds and
you felt it was too cost-prohibitive to
pick up but always wanted to check out
the games on the system this is a really
awesome way to enjoy the 3ds game
library without breaking the bank
