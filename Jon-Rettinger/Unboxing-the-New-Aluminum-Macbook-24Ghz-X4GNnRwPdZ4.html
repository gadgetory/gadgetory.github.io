Lakers
with a very special unboxing of the new
MacBook that was released yesterday
October 14th here it is the specs on
this particular model is a 2.4 gigahertz
Intel Core 2 Duo where 2 gigabytes of
ddr3 RAM 13.3 inch wide screen display
the nvidia geforce 9400m assessor with
256 megabytes shared and that's a twin
and 50 gigabyte hard drive spinning at
5400 RPM it's got a built-in iSight
video camera 8 speed slot loading super
drive 2 USB ports mini DisplayPort into
2 11n the rest of that stuff you see in
the MacBook in addition to a backlit
keyboard so let me go ahead and show you
the box here and it'll get to the
unboxing size of this box is tiny I mean
you really can see how small is I'll
compare the size with an iPhone 3G box
so you guys can really can really get a
sense of how small it really is let me
just readjust the camera here so here is
the MacBook Box here's the iPhone 3G box
you really see it's about twice the size
and thickness wise almost exactly its
thick maybe just a little bit more so
really is a tiny box Apple definitely
has saved a lot of packaging and waste
this way so let me show you the box
before I go ahead and open it up MacBook
on the front 13.3 inch LED backlit
widescreen notebook got your black
handle let's the specs right there on
the side it tells you it's got I like oh
eight pre-installed the advanced Nvidia
integrated graphics and the precision
aluminum unibody enclosure picture of
the MacBook on the back Apple logo on
the side the front again and then just
the SKU and all the leave itself if
there was one would be on the back here
Marko's a lot kind of stuff so this is
my first laptop since I sold my macbook
pro about four months ago I did it in
anticipation of this I need a laptop for
graduate school
I'm currently enrolled so let's go ahead
and open this bad boy up for you
obligatory big knife I'm very excited I
actually haven't even seen one of these
in person yet I was the first one in the
Apple store to to buy one on the west
coast are at least in my store I didn't
even have that on display at all right
so we broke the seal put this down here
put it up and it looks very similar to
what the macbook air box looks like
there's a thin layer of let's not
styrofoam but cushioning up top there
you can see how thick it is right there
and the computer is sitting right here
in this tray with the tab you just pull
up similar to the air wow this is a
small computer I'm actually shocked at
how Findus and just on first impressions
again this is my first time ever really
seen what I'm holding when a person
it feels very sturdy so I'll walk you
through this in a minute so go ahead and
put it aside and see what else is in the
box
so here's the tab we'll go ahead and
pull that up and lift this piece
straight up and sitting inside the box
here you've got your MagSafe adapter
everybody seems with the extender cable
and then right here is your
documentation now surprisingly actually
does not say design by Apple in
California on this open it up everything
Mac everything else all your
documentation and install C's in the
tray here let's take a look at the
computer itself so it's wrapped in
wrapped in plastic as you guys can see
and I'll give you a walkthrough of it on
the front there is the magnet latch
everybody's familiar with on the MacBook
on the right side of the device is your
slot loading
I think the eight-time burning
SuperDrive on the back nothing on the
old macbook speakers used to be here I
wonder where the speakers are on the new
one we'll have to find that out and here
are the ports everyone's been talking
about so your mag save your Gigabit
Ethernet two USB ports that new mini
DisplayPort which can drive monitors I
think they're saying up to 30 inches
optical in optical out and the
Kensington lock and that new handy
little battery button right there you
can see the battery is you can see that
light up table as you can see in the
video
very good can see it just lit up sort of
there you so battery does come nicely
charged so let's go ahead and take this
out of the plastic here for the very
first time it really is white and very
thin I'll show you a fitness comparison
actually again keep with the iPhone
theme here is the iPhone iPhone MacBook
in front of it so inside you can see
that both sitting next to each other
it's the MacBook is really not much
thicker than the iPhone I'm actually
very surprised by that really just feels
small light and feels very sturdy let's
take the plastic off here and take a
look at the computer and stay tuned to
the channel and the website
www.getmoreoffers.com it really does
feel like a mini macbook pro it's a lot
of people are saying the lack of
firewire port is not a big deal deal for
me I've got an iMac as my primary
computer it's just gonna be used for
school
and maybe some lights video editing but
I mean I can change for that with
wireless or just with USB so firewire is
not a big deal let's go ahead and open
it up here for the first time I'll let
you guys see it first before I do how's
it look looks very nice with the 13.3
inch glossy and you can see the keyboard
right there is the black Chiclets out
keyboards I've seen on the MacBook Air
and here is the big trackpad with no
actual hardware button the whole thing
of the button see how that feels
huh actually feels pretty good I wonder
how it'll actually actually function so
I'll do a review on that as well um
close it back up again here show you
guys one last time and again be sure to
stay tuned to the channel for more
reviews and videos on the new MacBook on
the back when I say I wanted to show you
is the battery is now housed under here
with a user accessible hard drive and
the RAM is accessible as well with this
little latch pops right up you can pull
it off I'll make a video showing that
