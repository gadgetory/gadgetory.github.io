TechnoBuffalo here a few weeks ago I did
a video on an alternative browser to
Safari on iOS called opera coast and you
guys let me know if there are a ton of
other browser options out there so I
want to show you one of the other
browsers that you can pick from and this
is Opera Mini also by the folks at opera
I'll be demonstrating it on iOS
there is also an Android version but the
iOS had been updated to 9.0 or android
is still on 7 so we'll go ahead and show
you everything that Opera Mini can do so
us checking out third-party browsers is
something that's not new about three
years ago John Quach did a show called
what's the App Store checked out a super
old version of opera means how to be
kind of fun to update that and see
what's due especially considering we
took took a look at Opera Coast about
three weeks ago and people really liked
that and let us know if there are a ton
of other and often times better browsers
and what just gonna come on your phone
out of the box so in case you guys are
wondering what happened to the extremely
awesome junk watch he has started a
second career as an app developer and
I'm guessing he would be as awesome as
an app developer as he was at everything
else that he did in life all right so
first Opera Mini is free just downloaded
from the App Store a less drastic on
design front than we saw with opera
coasts so you're greeted on the home
screen sensually your speed dials which
is obviously just gonna be your favorite
you can customize whatever you want here
score to the left you can see your
history there's a big trash can in the
bottom right in case else I'm not
judging you maybe you don't want someone
to see your history you just go ahead
and delete that and just say I don't
know it was for research on the other
side you can discover and sort of a
magazine layout of popular websites
articles they think you might be
interested in and as you browse more
it'll learn a bit more about you and
start to show you different stuff so
let's go back here let me just show you
what the browser looks like first before
I get into the stuff under the hood I
think is really cool about this browser
so go ahead and go back TechnoBuffalo
calm you haven't gone there it's a good
site you should check it out and it's
gonna look from this standpoint like any
other browser it works well it's quick
it renders the pages fast no issue with
it at all you can go back to go ahead
and hit that grid you're gonna go back
to where we were and that button on the
right is obviously going to be your tab
to view you want to go ahead and open a
private tab you can do that right there
left so go ahead and go back go back to
our history go to our tabs again and
we'll jump back to TechnoBuffalo comm
alright great so the browser works those
web pages every browser does that
what makes Opera Mini unique is what
it's going to deal with data most of us
are on captive data plans I know I've
got a shared data plan with ten gigs and
oftentimes watching video or browsing
websites really eats up a lot of data if
you're one of those people that are sure
of watching your data very closely you
might want to pay attention to what I'm
going to say next
so go ahead hit that oh right down below
and there are two things that you're
going to see first agree to what the
savings enabled for opera turbo so opera
turbo is going to use algorithms magic
and probably hamsters in the spinning
wheel to help remove any extraneous page
elements can shave off image pixels
things they don't think you're gonna
miss and it also will compress download
so what that's gonna mean for you is the
page should look pretty similar it's
gonna take away some of the stuff that
you might not be using you can already
see I've saved 2.7 megabytes in my 5.3
megabytes of browsing to refer savings
of about 51 percent and over the course
of weeks months that's going to really
really add up so one of the concerns I
had was I don't really want opera
looking at every website that I'm
browsing
I'll necessarily want them to you know
know my passwords are trying sort of
compressed stuff down our world reasons
that I like operas sweeter products is a
really privacy centric so if you browse
a secure site like maybe you want log in
to your bank or something or email opera
turbo stays out of the way so sensitive
data is sent directly between your phone
and a secure site so I really like that
that it sort of gets out of your way
when it needs to then is there when you
want it to be so you're gonna save data
browsing you can see it right here but
also there's another thing which I found
even more sort of Awesome it's kind of
hidden and hard to find to go and hit
the arrow button you're gonna see
something called video boobs and it
looks kind of nondescript little toggle
button but video boost is one reasons I
like opera the most essentially it's
going to compress that video for you you
might have a little bit of quality
degradation if you used to watching a
1080p video it might not look as clear
as original but you're going to get a
huge huge
data savings so if you want like to
watch a lot of YouTube videos it is a
incredible way to do it probably about
50% data savings as well so if you want
a browser it's gonna be quick can do
normal browser things
it's got of course operas cloud sync so
you can sync with different opera
devices or opera enabled devices but
also save data Opera Mini is a really
good way to go it's a simple browser
there's really no learning curve to it
at all you can go ahead and pick a user
agent to if you want to be viewed as a
mobile or desktop which I like sometimes
like to see full versions of websites
like ESPN for example I don't like their
mobile version very much Opera Mini is
gonna enable you to do that it's a
really good very capable alternative to
Safari or Chrome on iOS
tope is of course that Android didn't
get these awesome features as well since
Opera Mini does exist on Android
hopefully it'll be coming very soon but
right now it's fun to take advantage of
the badass attune in Opera Mini go ahead
and give it a shot
there see Lizzy can you get off my notes
do you think that could be a possible
thing that you could do Lucy can you do
you think that I could have these back
and you maybe you just lay down you
don't have to be in every shot it's not
always about you okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
