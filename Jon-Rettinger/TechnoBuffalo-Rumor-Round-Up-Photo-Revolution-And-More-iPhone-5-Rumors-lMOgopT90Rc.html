we all take and look at photographs why
did Nokia hold a big launch party for a
phone that's built on what it called a
dead burning platform was it just a
setup for the future something called
sea ray hulu's for sale does anybody
care is Google TV coming back as a
gaming box and like that kid in math
class who wouldn't shut up ever but then
you kind of missed him when he was out
sick believe me i had that kid in 10th
grade we've got more iphone rumors for
you that's right it's techno Buffalo's
rumor roundup
what is going on everybody thanks for
tuning in to the roundup for today
Friday june twenty-fourth 2011 i'm noah
Kravitz editor-at-large for
TechnoBuffalo and by for it before I
tell you the story of that kid in
precalc who seriously just wouldn't shut
up ever but I'm esta my still like yeah
I gotta find place in my heart for kids
like that maybe because I'm one of them
before we get to that for more on any of
the stories we're talking about right
now any of the latest going on in the
world of technology product reviews
opinion pieces news rumors all that
stuff head on over to TechnoBuffalo com
our facebook page our twitter feeds all
that stuff and if you're hooked in this
empire avenue thing like like I am I
might need some help i'm getting
addicted to this you can check out
empire avenue as well NK 126 that's all
I'm saying first off what is lytro and
why should you care lytro is a Silicon
Valley startup who just might have
changed photography forever or at least
until the next you know forever thing
comes along the startup company that
just came out of stealth mode earlier
this week they had a party at an art
gallery they've got stuff up now on
their website samples in a YouTube video
they getting all this press and
basically what they've done is they've
invented this thing they're calling
light field technology that that it
boils down to this as far as i
understand it when you take a photo
instead of focusing on something in the
photo like the way we take photos now
what light field technology does is it
just captures all of the available light
in the frame and so their slogan is
shoot now focus later and so after the
photos taken you can go to the photo
digital photo obviously they have an
invented refocus about paper so far as i
know but you can go to the digital photo
and you can click on whatever area of
the photo you want the photo to focus on
and then you can also double click to
zoom in and zoom out so in their example
they have some cool examples up on their
site they've got examples of a photo
where it's taken at a party and there's
one person right up in front by the
frame or by the the lens and then in the
back of the frame there are all these
other people is are things going on and
so one of their examples it's pretty
cool they call these things living
photos because you know their whole
shtick is after you've taken the photo
you can you know you can focus on
different
things and zoom around in the photo and
catch all the stuff you might have
missed when you actually took the photo
which is a big problem if you're a lousy
photographer who shoots a lot of cell
phone photos like yours truly you know
shaky hands blurry photos are that kind
of stuff but in these are in these light
field photos what you can do is you can
just focus on anything you want so
they've got this example taken at a
party and there's a woman up up in the
front of the frame right near the camera
but then in the background there are all
these shady characters hanging around
and they've got a little YouTube video
where they go through showing how you
know you can click on the different
people in the background and they'll
come into focus and then you can read
dude with the tuxedo and you get a dog
and a backpack and a beer and the other
who was up with that guy anyway they've
got some neat examples and some
professional photographer friends I've
talked to you know when they check this
out they were like wow that's really
interesting that's got a lot of
potential so keep an eye on Lytro for
sure no word yet on when we'll actually
see these cameras and how much they
might cost but definitely very
interesting technology Nokia held a
launch party earlier this week a launch
event for a phone called the n9 the n9
honestly looks like a really really
sweet piece of hardware is a touchscreen
phone you know like Nokia does very
nicely made comes in a bunch of
different bright colors hi res display
very high-end camera on the back you
know etc Sarah looks like a great piece
of hardware and honestly in a world of
touchscreen phones this one actually
stands out a little bit with kind of
cool design but the thing is it's
running the latest version of me go
which by all accounts is a dead software
platform me go was this joint
partnership between intel and nokia and
it had a lot of cool features the n900
came out a while ago and developers and
hackers were kind of into it but you
know never really sold well no key has
been going through some hard times etc
etc and then Nokia signed this deal with
Microsoft to start making windows phone
7 devices and mego kind of left 4 dead
even lumped into when the new CEO of
neat of Nokia talked about how they were
standing on a burning platform in the
sea with symbian mainly simian but also
me go thrown in there and how they had
to jump off the platform and land on
something else well the interesting
thing is that after all this hoopla
about this sexy phone really with no
future
then the CEO in a separate speech when
and snuck in a little peek at this
device codenamed see ray same phone
running Windows Phone 7 go over to
techna buffle you can get the pictures
you can check it out really interesting
stuff we know that the next version of
Windows Phone 7 code named mango is
coming out this fall all kinds of new
features on it looks like it really
brings windows seven you know catching
up to the competition android and iOS in
particular and we're all waiting for the
first nokia hardware to come out because
nokia still has reputation for building
quality films with great reception and
great cameras which are too you know
really big features that people want so
this sea ray phone really interesting
how they kind of snuck that in a like
nokia playing some games now you know
maybe playing with the media a little
bit getting some attention trying to
build some buzz interesting start from
nokia for sure hulu wet and put
themselves up for sale that's really
kind of all i want to say about it you
know it's really interesting because all
these things floating around now but as
netflix going to buy and is Apple going
to buy them who's going to buy them but
then some interesting behind-the-scenes
stuff apparently one of the things going
on you know hulu they have all these
licensing deals with fox and these other
big TV studios who have who holds stakes
ownership stakes in hulu and now there's
some reports coming out about how well
you know what we could sell hulu but we
want to put a clause in that the hulu
app will authenticate to see if you're a
cable TV subscriber and if you are a
cable TV subscriber then you can watch
last night's Fox show you know right
away but if you're not a cable TV
subscriber you're gonna have to wait
eight days before you buy the TV show I
don't know who lo you know always a fan
favorite but kind of wondering like well
how is this going to play out in terms
of a business model and and you know
generating revenue and really being
something viable that doesn't just kind
of compete with the TV studios behind it
things getting Messier now that hulu's
gone they've gotten a couple investment
banks to back their sale they're
officially for sale be really
interesting to see how this plays out
speaking of TV back at the google i/o
conference google talked a little bit
about the next version of its google TV
box which frankly when it came out last
year did not set the world on
the first version of Google TV there was
some sony hardware there was some
logitech hardware I myself bought one of
the Sony boxes and then I took it back
to the store at that 30 day return
period because I just it was just it
didn't do that much for me some people
really got into it for sure but didn't
sell well we sort of quickly swept back
under the rug by Google and its retail
partners but now the next version of
Google TV based on Android the Android 3
platform which is promising to integrate
Android across the different screen
sizes the phones the tablets and the TV
screen apparently google has sent out
some developer boxes and these are just
dead boxes very very limited quality so
you can't read too much into this about
what consumer hardware might look like
but a bunch of extra ports that weren't
on the original box and some interesting
stuff going on and the chipset the
manufacturer of the chipset it's an
intel chipset the chipset promises
support for 3d gaming and support robust
support for flash and apparently the
browser on this device is not the old
Android browser but it's actually a
full-on version of Chrome so very very
interesting stuff also some interesting
stuff going on with what Google is and
apparently isn't allowing developers to
do with apps that include a real-time TV
feed because that's the whole thing
about interactive TV the coolest stuff
I've seen is when you've got you know
like a baseball game being played and
then you've got a graphic around it
shows real-time statistics of you know
the players up to bat or other you know
other games going on or whatever it is
so you've got that live TV element and
then information thats related kind of
going on in the same on the same screen
and apparently developers are not yet
getting access to do those kinds of
things in this new developer build with
these new developer boxes so interesting
to see how that all plays out and if
Google TV can reinvent itself and is a
really good you know chrome and apps and
3d gaming could there be something there
interesting stuff last but certainly not
least in my tenth grade math class
precalc this do do set next to me we'll
call him at I don't want to reveal his
real name
that was Matt I love Matt great guy
smart funny would not stop talking kind
of like me on video camera except you
know sometimes I was trying to pay
attention in math class sometimes I was
trying to zone out and Matt was just
going going going going on but the days
Matt wasn't there you know I missed him
that's kind of how I feel that's kind of
how a lot of people feel right now about
iphone rumors oh no more iphone rumors
but then when they're not there you're
kind of wondering what's going on with
iPhone well a new batch of rumors this
week that point to not a minor update
but actually a radical new redesign
brand new boom boom boom iphone 5 coming
out this September possibly this August
I'm still thinking September but some
rumors pointing to this August for a new
iphone 5 you can go over to techna
Buffalo check out you know all the
details some render images you know
suppose it what it's going to look like
etc but kind of a radically redesigned
back a teardrop shape back that narrows
from top to bottom big screen kind of
bezel a bezel or edge to edge rather
almost a bezel lyst design and a little
tidbits front end these rumors again
about another iPad device I still say
we're going to see another iPad this
year shawn says no either way there'll
be a funny youtube video out of it I
depending on who wins are a little bit
but perhaps some more evidence buried in
the iOS 5 beta about an ipad 3 with a
Retina display we'll see but at any rate
the flames have been stoked matt is back
in math class talking talking talking so
to speak about an iphone 5 a big
redesign coming this year you know most
likely to coincide with the release of
iOS 5 so stay tuned for that all right
that's the time i got for right now
definitely let us know what you think
check out at checkout lytro really
interesting stuff go over TechnoBuffalo
read the report check out the photo
galleries you know see ya let us know
what you think about light show is going
to revolutionize photography or is it
just another gimmick yeah you know
better than I do my name is Noah Kravitz

to revision 3 for having us and I don't
forget Monday Wednesday Friday ask the
Buffalo whats the apps and rumor
