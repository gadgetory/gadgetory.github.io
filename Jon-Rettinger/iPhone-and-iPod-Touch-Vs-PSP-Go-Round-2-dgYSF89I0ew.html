two of the PSP Go versus the iphone 3gs
or ipod touch in the first round we
covered games and we covered screen
technology and screen hardware
resolution now in this round we're going
to cover video playback we're going to
cover audio playback and we're going to
cover picture viewing so some of you
might be thinking what do these devices
have in common why would they be going
head-to-head well I think that Sony and
Apple are competing for a very similar
demographic here both devices to help
mediate playbacks both devices play
games all the PSP deklay is a dedicated
gaming machine and has a bigger full
version more expensive library whereas
the iphone has more inexpensive cheaper
games that you find in the app store but
games aside media play black web
browsing a picture viewing they all do
the same things I think it's worthy of a
comparison so without further ado let's
go ahead and get started first thing
we're going to check out is video
playback on the PSP go now I try to load
my own video content on the PSP go via
USB I tried mp4 I tried mov and I tried
windows media files none of which seemed
to transfer or play the only way we'll
get video onto the PSP is actually
downloading a trailer for a game from
the PA PlayStation Store let's go ahead
take a look at that you can see what
video looks like I'm not gonna get into
screen resolution again we're going to
go just based on what it looks like to
you so her video there's a game trailer
so this is a trailer for the Gran
Turismo series you can see videos very
crisp it's very clear the brightness is
turned out a little bit so it shows up
on camera but it is amazingly clear and
the idea that comes out through the
stereo speakers is actually pretty good
so I'll go ahead and pause that moral
being you could very easily download or
rent a movie from the PlayStation Store
watch it on an airplane and having great
viewing experience the screen is
gorgeous it's bright tie enough
resolution that you don't notice any
pixelation it looks good however getting
media on it that's not from PlayStation
Store looks like it could be a little
bit difficult at least for my experience
so video on the iphone certainly can
come from the itunes store or you can
put your own converted video on let's go
ahead and play a video that i've got on
here go to ipod and we've got some
videos i've got the first season of its
always sunny in philadelphia great job
we'll watch just a couple second clips
don't get any copyright issues just you
can see what video looks like on the
iphone you can sort of zoom in zoom out
stereo speaker anyway it looks great
those of you that have seen video on an
iphone or ipod touch you definitely know
what I'm talking about video quality is
absolutely fantastic on both devices as
far as the video quality playback I
think it's got to be a draw I was fully
prepared though to give the PlayStation
the edge for a more open platform being
able to play more video files but I just
wasn't able to get them to play so if
you can deal with video from the
PlayStation Store versus video from the
itunes store you know you really can't
go wrong either way both will download
video wirelessly which is great so next
let's move on to music since both have
pretty nice music players so you're
probably not familiar with how the
playstation go or the PSP go rather
plays music so i'll go over to music and
I've got just one song stored on here
the Boulevard of broken dreams by
greenday and again we'll just play it
for a very short time so get any
copyright issues but you can hear what
it sounds
like and what the interface looks like
when it's playing music you can close it
you can see the little bar down there
let me know how much you listen to you
open it up restarts it you got a general
pause fast forward controls you can use
this to go forward or back and tracks if
there were album art it would show up
right there but there really isn't any
sort of obviously flicks relics it's not
a touchscreen you're relying only on the
navigation down here moral being if you
just want to play music it works very
well it's not the most visually
appealing thing is that not a lot of eye
candy but it is functional and it
definitely works so let's take a look at
music playback on the iphone and ipod
touch and two core these things these
are ipods so you'd expect them to
definitely have a little bit of an edge
so we'll open up i pod here's video go
back to artists so not that much on here
my little cousin likes advanced to
beyonce songs i put them on there in
some green day if you turn the device
does have an accelerometer you can
scroll through the album art so i go
ahead and click it you get to rascal
representation of the songs you go ahead
and hit play on any of them put the
device back up in landscape or in
portrait rather you get the album art
and the controls right on the screen
that most people are probably familiar
with and your scrubber right across set
since it is a touchscreen you can scrub
as far ahead or as back as you like so i
think probably to no one's surprise the
iphone and ipod touch definitely take
the edge as far as music playback goes
Apple's got this nailed formats are a
little bit limited either at aac+ which
is the drm encrypted music that comes
from comes from itunes but you can now
download non-encrypted AAC files and can
also convert your CDs or WMDs whatever
you have to play so really has become a
much more open platform so i think this
is dead has definitely got to go with
the iphone or ipod touch so next let's
check out picture viewing now i've
loaded a few pictures here on the plates
pspgo keep saying playstation so go to
pictures this does not have a camera but
you can't import pictures very easily
here's a picture you guys probably are
mostly familiar with take a second to
load there's a picture of a my card this
is the one you guys are probably all
familiar with this is one that I've got
four for my banner on youtube so there's
not really that much you can do you get
some controls for pictures you can set a
slideshow you can view next you can
scroll you can rotate the picture to the
left to the right you can do a little
bit of zooming in a little bit of
zooming out you can send it often you
gotta set up to an email account which
is actually a pretty nice feature you
can set that your wallpaper you can view
it in widescreen mode if you'd like and
how you're going to display if you want
to put this on TV or something connected
have it show up so it's pretty
rudimentary picture viewer does work and
you know it works well you want to go
the next one you can tap the shoulder
button and it'll load the next one just
take some time to load and it doesn't
always show up so it took probably about
a second or so to to load up there but
if you just want to look at some
pictures you can do it if you want to
set it up as a gallery or an albums it's
actually imported as an album there's no
way to really manage your pictures when
you're on here but it's getting funky
know when it will work and it's a decent
way for you to view your pictures I
think picture viewing is one time when I
really wish that this was a touchscreen
be a lot easier to you know pinch and
zoom or at least hit the plus button to
zoom in zoom out definitely using the
controls can get to be a little bit
cumbersome so picture viewing on the
iPhone or iPod Touch should be something
that's familiar to everybody so I'm
going to open up my photos here and let
me find something that's non
incriminating let's find a good picture
here all right there is a picture of my
baby niece reading a book and when
you're reviewing pictures you can scroll
left or right there's a got a video of
her it's very smooth and if you want to
zoom in it's all touch touch controls
using advantage of the multi touch
capabilities two fingers in two fingers
out move around double tap zoom
you right back out certainly I think to
no one's surprise viewing pictures on
the iphone and ipod touch definitely
wins over the PSP go not much of a
shopper there the iphones been doing
this for quite a while and the
touchscreen clearly gives it an edge so
next let's take a look at the browser
since both have browser capabilities so
exit out here and we will go to browser
get this in-focus internet browser will
let it load up and this is using a
modified version of opera i should
mention so a load of sight that's
perhaps in the history so I've got
TechnoBuffalo and ESPN com let's load up
ESPN and that check how long it takes so
it's on a relatively fast Wi-Fi network
so to load up and now it will pull in
ESPN I'll let you guys sort of see the
the time illness and this does have
Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G built in so it's loading ESPN
it's not loading the mobile version is
loading the full-fledged big ol ESPN com
so navigation is done with the analog
stick you can sort of move around and
navigate on the screen but if you want
to move the page down you got actually
use the arrows it's not that quick not
that fluid but for viewing a sort of a
website on the go it'll get the job done
certainly there's no no multi touch
capabilities all your menuing is done
from the menu down below that i showed
you but now you can view it you know it
does does work it's not necessarily
gonna be able to handle all your Flash
content unfortunately but it's probably
to be expected for a mobile browser if
you're doing a slight little more simple
then it web browser is going to work for
you but i would not rely this i rely on
this as a primary web browser so let's
push this off to the side this is sort
of very quick overview in comparisons so
we'll go to safari got my youtube
channel up here let's load up the same
I'm espn.com this is not meant to be a
speed test so i'm not going to clear the
cache clear the memory i just want to
show you what the sites look like so we
load up ESPN this does load up the
mobile version let's load up the full
fledge non mobile version for
comparison's an ESPN had been loaded on
that PS apply station before the PSP go
and that certainly demoted on the iphone
3gs but it was noticeably quicker now
for navigation you could turn it into
landscape mode and take advantage of the
accelerometer zooming is much smoother
and viewing pages is just a little bit
of a better experience much much much
smoother and it's all done with your
finger so certainly I think to no one's
surprise here the iphone and ipod touch
should definitely take the edge so in
this round of PSP go vs iphone or ipod
touch clear winner for the iphone or
ipod touch with the one exception of
video in both playback great video at
the end of the day you're going to get a
playstation go for the games these are
sort of secondary features so check out
the game categories in the game library
agency which one's best for you if you
want the full fledge high graphic games
PSP go is a great way to go if you want
some of the small mini games the games
in the app store are fantastic there are
some little games in the PSP go the PSP
minis i demonstrated in their previous
video but there aren't quite as many as
are on the iphone app store so at the
end of the day decisions going to be
yours for exclusive content guys check
me out on twitter twitter.com / john for
lakers and to learn more about
TechnoBuffalo check out TechnoBuffalo
com video links will be in the sidebar
see you guys the next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
