and also welcome to the very first
episode of a new series i'm doing called
TB vinny's there's just a real short
videos where i answer any questions that
you guys might have also give more
detail on things i said in other videos
i'm just kind of a casual old-school way
for weeks ago when i did my Apple rhyme
video I mentioned that I was selling my
super underpowered macbook replaced me
with the surface pro 4 thought I'd show
you at my home office looks like now
that I did that uh still using an Apple
product subjects using an iphone right
now as an Apple watch that date here is
clearly enjoying daddy's watch clearly I
still enjoying so I used to have a home
office upstairs or wife and I are
expecting our second son actually in
about six weeks so coming up so my
office is being converted into a baby's
room so I had to move my computer and
set up downstairs to kind of an older
storage room so let me say what that
looks like and sharing what I'm using to
guess and get a sense of like a lot of
my work on whenever I come on alright so
here's my home office next to a child's
library ah it's a desk at the storage
room and it's also that alert home to
elliptical which I should should
probably use more so here's what I'm
going to be working on I picked up a
logitech keyboard black friday it also
picked up a trackpad also a logitech
I've really been enjoying using the
magic trackpad at the office on my
imac's is about as close as I can get
for windows also in my favorite things
this is a curved LG monitor booths 34
inch widescreen absolutely awesome and
then there the surface pro 4 it's the i5
version with eight gigs of ram and then
there's the new type cover it's nestled
in a surface pro 3 dog which works
perfectly by the way and this is what I
do all my work in case you guys want to
know any products you get more
information on i'll put links to them
down below get in my office so thank you
guys for watching the first episode of
TB minis let's know what you guys think
just a fun way for us to talk kind of
old-school style Nate can you say
goodbye everybody you tell him you tell
him to have fun hmm and give them a big
wave he says it better than I ever could
see you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
