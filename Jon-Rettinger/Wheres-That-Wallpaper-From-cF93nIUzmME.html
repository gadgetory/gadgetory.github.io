question we get when posting a video
well can I have it we can't always
answer those questions so instead I'm
going a bit behind the scenes to show
you where we get our wallpapers from so
you can find awesome web papers yourself
ok so there are a few apps and websites
we use specifically to find new
backgrounds first let's start with the
desktop which will translate over to
mobile the main place we find wallpapers
is unsplash unsplash is a theme you're
gonna hear throughout this video a lot
this is a website with tons of user
submitted photos they are for the most
part photographs so not really renders
which are the types that we typically
use in videos but these are high quality
photos that work great for wallpapers
another thing to note is they are all
royalty-free so you can use them for
pretty much anything
wallpaper school project website these
are free to use with the site you can
search for different categories there
are collections that have been put
together for you to help find what
you're looking for this is an excellent
resource not only for wallpapers but for
photos in general highly recommend now
let's move over to mobile both on
Android and iOS it's a similar story we
use apps that essentially curate the
awesome photos that you find from
unsplash and a few others let's start
with Android the first app is called my
splash this is a free app that
essentially is a portal to the unsplash
website but because it's a native app it
makes downloading much easier it works
in a similar way to the unsplash website
you have different sections like
trending new and featured and you can
search for the type of photos that you
want and filter them by keywords
once you find photos you can bookmark
them and favorite photos and you can see
what it will look like with icons
overlaid and easily download them to
your device it's my favorite resource
for photos on Android and it's free so
it's worth checking out now moving away
from my splash another excellent Android
app is called backdrops this app has
less photographs than the splash and is
more digital renders but they are high
quality and super easy to download and
set as your wallpaper there's a pro
version that will give you access to
more wallpapers and remove
but even without paying there's a great
selection when you select a wallpaper
you can see the resolution and size you
can also set it as your wallpaper right
from the app so you don't have to
download the image there's also a
section to explore user-submitted
content and this gets updated rather
frequently my favorite part of this app
though is I can always count on the
photos being high quality she's usually
my first stop on Android alright so
let's move over to iOS now unsplash
actually has their own I Oh s app but I
picked a few different apps that I think
are better suited for wallpapers
themselves even though a lot of it is
curated from unsplash the first app here
is called vellum with this app there are
curated albums of different types of
wallpapers and there's a new wallpaper
that is released every single day a lot
of these wallpapers also come from
unsplash although not all of them the
best thing is though they are formatted
correctly for the iPhone and they're
they're super easy to download there is
a paid version again but with this
you'll have access to all the previous
daily wallpapers the free version just
lets you see the current daily wallpaper
the best part about vellum though is how
it lets you see what the wallpaper will
look like once applied before I even
downloading it there's a preview section
that will overlay apps or a lock screen
so you don't have to go through the
process of actually installing the
wallpaper and setting it
you can even blur the background if you
want this makes browsing superfast and
best of all it keeps all those unused
wallpapers out of your camera well which
is nice the next app on iOS is called
background and this is probably my
favorite of the entire bunch just
because of how its implemented there's
also a paid version of this again that
unlocks a few more features but the main
content comes from Lund splash you can
search for types of photos there's a
curated section and a section for your
favorites but the best feature is how
you actually view the photos that uses
the accelerometer and your phone to
allow you to see different parts of the
image and how will actually look as a
wallpaper most of the photos from
unsplash are not formatted for an iPhone
so you have to do that yourself but with
this app it fills the screen for you so
you can see exactly how
when you find the wallpaper you want you
just hold down and get saved and you can
set it this is by far the fastest and
easiest way to find wallpapers and it's
my go-to on iOS the last place I get my
wallpapers from is just from photos I
take one photo that I've had a lot of
questions about is this one here and
this is just a photo I took on the
iPhone 10 of a mural outside at Chipotle
while we were filming the iPhone 10
review I just edited it myself formatted
correctly and makes a great wallpaper
this isn't exactly the easiest option
but it's definitely the most unique now
before we finish up customizing the
wallpaper is cool and all but it's also
cool to customize with AD burned skin
I've been using their new camo skin on
my iPhone and my MacBook really loving
it if you don't pick one up for yourself
links are down below now obviously there
are many more places to find wallpapers
but these are the ones that I found that
are the most reliable and the ones that
I can just go to and set very quickly
and I know I'm gonna find something that
looks great and now finally now all of
you that have asked where we get our
wallpapers know so you don't have to ask
anymore you can just go to these apps
and find cool ones for yourself I would
like you all so much for watching I hope

videos like this are out also we know

kind of behind the scenes look of what
goes into making a video in this case

there's anything else you'd like to see
