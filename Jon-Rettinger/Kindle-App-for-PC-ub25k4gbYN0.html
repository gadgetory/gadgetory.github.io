TechnoBuffalo and this is a look at the
new Kindle application for PC that was
just released I really enjoy my Kindle I
believe that in the future those of us
that read on a regular basis will have
some sort of digital reading device
whether it's an Amazon Kindle a Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble Nook or whatever else comes out in
the future the idea of having all of
your books in one small place or in one
device or even accessible through your
iPhone or your PC or Mac it's just a
really great idea and it saves you a lot
of space not having to tote around lots
of books with you so let's take a look
at the new Kindle application for PC
coming up soon they're releasing a
Kindle application for Mac so those of
you that have a Kindle and have a Mac
will be able to use this soon so let's
take a look at what this application
does here in archived items kind of like
the iPhone app you get a list of all the
books that you have and from here you
can choose to download specific ones so
for example let's double tap on this
book and in about three or four seconds
you have the whole book on your screen
it's really amazing and in the bottom
left corner you can see that you can
turn pages either by using the scroller
on the mouse or by pressing the right or
left arrow keys up and down will also
work now what's really advantageous
about reading a Kindle book on your
laptop or netbook or or PC is that
because you have a higher resolution
screen you can see tons more text on the
screen at one time and so we can
actually adjust the font size and
probably this is about this is a this is
probably about the amount of text that
you get if you're reading on a Kindle
but because we're on a computer we can
make the text size smaller and we can
expand the words per line hugely so that
now we're turning pages a lot less yes
the text is a little bit smaller and of
course you can increase the text size if
it's too small for you but it's really
great to be able to have the content on
a computer screen let's see what else we
can do with this we can click the go to
button which will allow us to scroll
through the bigge code right to the
beginning go to a specific location or
just jump right to the cover of the book
let's go home and go to another book the
Kindle app doesn't let you highlight yet
or a search that's coming up after the
but in the upper right corner we can go
and see any pages that we bookmarked and
if you've bookmarked something on the
iPhone app or on the Kindle itself and
you synced it it will sync with the PC
app which is really fantastic because I
can go back and I can see where I
bookmarked the pages that I found to be
the most interesting and I can bookmark
a new ones and have them sync to all of
my devices running at the Kindle
application or the Kindle itself so
extremely convenient if you are a heavy
reader the application doesn't do that
much else it's pretty much a reader if
we if we tap up your shop in Kindle
Store we are taken to Amazon's website
they don't even have an embedded Kindle
Store within the application
unfortunately but that's probably coming
down the line so it's really great that
this application finally exists and
we're looking forward to it getting out
of beta and having more features and of
course we're looking forward to the Mac
version coming out soon that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
