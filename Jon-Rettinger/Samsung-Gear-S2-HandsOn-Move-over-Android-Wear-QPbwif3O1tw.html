Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo here at
Aoife 2015 in Berlin checking out the
Samsung gear s2 you can see on the Left
I have the classic model which has a bit
more metal on it
the nicer leather finish to the band
versus the rubber sports band on the
regular gear s2 a lot to go over here
first it works with Android 4.4 and
above devices so no longer limited to
just Samsung which is pretty cool
obviously it doesn't work with the
iPhone though and it has this circular
crown as we suspected from all the
rumors and then the Samsung eventually
confirmed and you can go into apps here
and go through and select various apps
using that crown and go into specific
ones like CNN or something like that to
view top stories I don't know if it's
linked up with a phone properly and
there you go and scroll through so it's
really nice and that's powered by Tizen
which we've seen before but Samsung now
has a lot of experience working with it
through various iterations of its
watches going through on the back you
have the heart rate monitor that can be
used with watches different watch faces
one is Nike you can see it on the right
here actually but there's a custom watch
face again you just hold down on the
screen to go through and there's the
Nike watch face you can customize them
through various ways like if you want to
change the calendar or something like
that Apple calls those complications but
Samsung didn't have a specific name for
each one you can see there's a lot of
different watch faces here also you get
two to three days of battery life which
is pretty nice this one keeps losing its
connection to a smart phone but 2 to 3
days of battery life which is pretty
nice and it also charges using the
wireless magnetic charger sort of like
what the Moto 360 does any case that's
the classic here on the left the regular
one on the right both the gear s2 this
