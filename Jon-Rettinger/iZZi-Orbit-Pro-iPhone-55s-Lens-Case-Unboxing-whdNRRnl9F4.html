TechnoBuffalo here your iPhone 5 or
iPhone 5s still one of the better
smartphone cameras out there but it
doesn't do everything after an accessory
like this the easy orbit Pro it brings
four different lenses to the front to
help increase your photo productivity
comes in price that with 229 bucks let's
go ahead and see if it's worth your
money so here's the box for the easy
orbit Pro that's got a picture of it on
the front this model is made for the 5
or the 5s there's also a model available
for the 4 it's got four different lenses
on Loic only c3 right here of one or
that fourth one's hidden their lenses
for all kinds of stuff including there's
a two-time zoom there's a macro there's
a wide angle and there's a fisheye lens
this is going to set you back 229 bucks
that's too steep for you there is a slim
model also available for $100 you can
get this in five colors pick it up in
either silver black red blue or purple
let's go ahead and open it up to go
ahead and bring in the unnecessarily
large unboxing knife senior stabby and
let's cut the plastic on this the real
it should be able to dig right into the
Izzie orbit Pro let's see we're going to
have inside of the box we've got some
styrofoam and supposedly in here we've
got the Izzy I got the blue one which
looks kind of cool so is by no means a
small accessory it's kind of turning
your camera into a mini DSLR
point-and-shoot I'll use stabby cut that
plastic off it's made of aircraft-grade
aluminum serum dealing with really high
quality materials here and supposedly
the glass inside of it is also really
high quality so a couple interesting
things here first you've got three
separate tripod mounts here so it should
fit any kind of tripod you guys have it
also comes with a back protection case
so make sure you're back here from one
is protected cleaning cloth you've got
some getting started stuff and you've
got a strap make sure you can keep your
Izzy safe you can move this pretty
easily and it snaps into place every
time you move it so you get a really
nice audible click
whenever you switch lenses I'll only see
three here not sure how it's going to be
for but we'll take a look at that when
we actually use it let me go ahead and
bring in and iPhone five and we'll see
how easy or difficult it is to actually
put the Izzy on so you put the
protective sleeve on first it's just a
back cover for your phone and again
there's a four 4s models while we're
testing it obviously on the iPhone 5 or
5s so I assume it just slides on it and
go ahead and line up the camera push
that there we've got this guy all easy
up and ready to go you got a pretty nice
grip there on the aircraft-grade
aluminum
you've got all of your different tripod
mounts for ever you want to to mount so
get access to your volume controls and
your profile switch and you can still
access your power and lock button of
course the whole back of your phone is
there so if you want to unlock it with
touch ID or just unlock your phone you
can do so right there as well just a
quick example of what things look like
here go ahead and see kind of quickly
what it looks like they're going to keep
turning and again you got four lenses
here one is a two-time telephoto you've
got a fisheye a macro and a wide-angle
you can see when you switch lenses sort
of you can see the exposed camera and it
rests pretty satisfyingly right on top
so a quick example of lenses let's go
ahead and put it through its paces to
how it works and look at some pictures
so after we did the unboxing I went out
and shot some pictures using the Izzi
and it works pretty much as advertised
couple things to note they came out
picking one of those up first
I had a big question what that kind of
hole was and why was there turns out
it's to push the phone or right through
if you want to get it out it goes in and
out relatively easily of the easy case I
love the different holes for tripods you
can mount sort of any different tripod
that you want whether you want to in
portrait or landscape it's going to work
for you so it does have a few
peculiarities first you can't use the
flash with this so don't think you're
going to be able to do that second when
you go ahead and look the screen taking
a picture you're gonna see a bit of a
vignette on you got to zoom past that
but those two small things aside it
works as advertised I really like the
aluminum feel and the grip is really
nice it's sort of heavy enough to feel
like you are using something substantial
and you know what sort of high quality
material East it feels it I like
different color options I do a show
there was sort of a shutter button on
top from connector activate the camera
but it's an iPhone so it's all pretty
much on screen you could of course use
the volume buttons to get in and zoom if
you want to but they're a little bit too
recessed to get at very easily the
lenses though do work as advertised and
they work pretty well the fisheye one
was really cool to see you get it pretty
much 180 degrees from either side and
you could see everything so if you're
the kind of person that wants to do more
with your camera phone so going to be a
pretty good option for you if you want
to be able to take more pictures going
on the family vacation you want to put
some more style on your photos this is a
really good option but it's a bit hard
to carry especially if you're a dude
wearing normal dude pants it's a little
bit on the big side so you might want to
carry in a backpack if you're traveling
or something else I do come with little
lens cars not to worry about scratching
that the macro of course being macro
tend to a magnifying glass you've got to
get really really really close to the
pictures you're taking from but we took
pictures of all of it and things came
out really nice so you can see what the
telephoto looks like the fisheye was
probably my favorite to use again you
got a full 180 degrees right there the
macro we got up really close to that
action figure space and the wide angle
is wide-angle some some interesting
things here if you want to access the
macro it's actually hidden underneath
the wide-angle got to unscrew it and
then put it right
back on so it's not too hard to do we
got to find a way to hold that
wide-angle part in your pocket or put in
a bag so you know be aware of that price
point though it comes at 229 bucks
that's a little bit steep but if you're
not involved at the price you know that
this is the device for you if you want
to do more with your camera phone this
would be a great way to go if you're
sort of the Instagram kind of at Agra
exit just put filters on and do these
the digital zoom that comes with an
iPhone whether it's a 5s or four 4s then
maybe look at the slim option but for
right now the orbit Pro at 249 bucks
it's gonna depend on the user when I use
on a daily basis probably not but if I
was going on vacation with my family and
I wanted some better pictures I wanted
more zoom I want a more style on my
shots then yeah I would absolutely use
it so it's gonna be up to you whether or
not you want to pick up an EZ orbit Pro
or the smaller version which comes in at
just about a hundred bucks and I guys
