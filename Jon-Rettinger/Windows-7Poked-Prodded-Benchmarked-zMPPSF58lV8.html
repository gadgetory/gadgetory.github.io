today we're putting windows 7 to some
benchmarks and comparing it to its
predecessors windows vista and windows
XP in my previous videos we checked out
some of the basic features as well as
some of the more advanced features of
Windows 7 but in this video it's all
about performance we're going to start
off with some synthetic benchmarks and
finish off with a comparison of Windows
Vista and Windows 7 running a very cool
game called Batman Arkham Asylum super
pie is a very popular benchmark software
that tells how fast your processor
calculate spy to a predetermined number
digits it's basically a pretty
straightforward benchmark tool that
tells how fast your CPU crunches the
numbers it's a very simple piece of
software but it's a very cool benchmark
tool even my wife got excited when I
showed her this okay she wasn't too
excited but in my benchmark I'll be
using a 1 million digit test and here we
go pretty exciting stuff I won't be
using the current score in the
comparison because the recording
software I'm using is taking up a
significant amount of resources so I
took the liberty and ran the benchmark
without the recording software running
in the background on the three operating
systems and here are the results okay
the time it took windows XP to calculate
1 million digits of pi occurred in 15.69
eight seconds vista crunched the numbers
in 15.9 89 seconds and windows seven in
15.9 33 seconds not very significant
variations between the three but still
windows XP was the fastest by a third of
a second windows 7 comes in second and
Vista third in the next benchmark I
tested hard drive read speed with HD
tune which calculates the minimum
maximum and average read speeds and
random access time of your hard drives
the test itself takes a few minutes so
I'm going to skip forward in time for
your viewing pleasure okay the tests are
now complete and for this HD tune
benchmark I assess the read speeds of
western digital caviar black hard drives
which are running in a raid 0
configuration so they will be getting of
higher average read speed than off the
single hard drive
as you can see the average read speed on
Windows XP is excellent but the process
usage on Windows XP is significantly
higher than on Windows Vista or Windows
7 the HD tune test revealed some pretty
similar results not very significant
differences but the test revealed that
using the hard drive on Windows Vista
had a slightly slower random access time
and burst rate which might translate
into some less responsive use compared
to windows 7 but yet again not very
overwhelming differences between the
three operating systems in the next
benchmark I tested the system memory
speed with lava lyst Everest the Everest
memory benchmark calculates the read
write and copy speed of your memory and
also times the latency and as you can
see from the bottom of the benchmark
screen I'm running some pre standard ram
ddr2 running in dual channel clocked at
907 megahertz pretty much mid-range in
today's standards the memory benchmark
revealed the windows vista and windows
seven can both handle ram a bit faster
than the good old windows XP cat vista
is about 50 megabytes faster and read
speed and 80 megabytes faster in right
speed compared to windows XP and it's
nice to see the windows 7 is even faster
than vista even though the differences
are pretty much incremental
in the next test I use future marks very
popular gaming benchmark 3dmark Vantage
the benchmark features various kind of
3d graphics and physics tests that
really push your graphics card and your
CPU to the max for the benchmark I used
to August 209 catalyst drivers so the
playing field between vista and windows
seven should be quite equal and the
results are as such windows 7 came out
with a score that is about 200 points
more than on Windows Vista although the
scores in the CPU tests were about equal
advantage windows 7 scored better in the
GPU tests again not a massive victory
for windows seven but a 200-point
gaining 3dmark Vantage is definitely
welcome in my books so if your pc guy
like me you probably run the occasional
benchmark to see how fast your system
set a biz i'm curious to what kind of
scores you guys are getting for example
in vantage and super pie so if you want
you can post your system specs and your
scores in the comments alrighty the last
benchmark of the day is a real world
gaming benchmark using batman arkham
asylum and for this I use the benchmark
tool in craps which is one of the best
application for checking out just how
fast games run on your PC all this
benchmark probably isn't time typically
accurate because I could not play
through the same sequence in the exact
same way but it still gives a pretty
good picture of gaming speed on windows
7 compared to windows vista i use the
catalyst 9.8 drivers on both Vista and
Windows 7 and as you can see the scores
are quite similar the game does run a
couple of frames faster on Windows 7 but
the difference is definitely negligible
and you won't notice the difference
while playing the game so if you're
expecting games to be running a lot
faster on windows 7 you will be a bit
disappointed but the truth is that if
you want games to run faster on your PC
there are no magic tricks you're going
to have to upgrade your hardware and
this is one of the reasons why pc gaming
is considered a dying breed at least by
some the high-end gaming graphics cards
will cost you around 500 bucks which is
a bit much when game console prices have
come down to almost half of that I
recently played through Arkham Asylum on
the ps3 and I was surprised to see how
well it compared to the pc version in
graphics of course the frame rate and
resolution weren't up to the pc version
but this game looks great on all flat
jones
busy these poor I have to say it was one
of the best games i play in recent times
it's a nice mix between god of war and
metal gear solid to sum up this
benchmark video I was a bit surprised to
see that Windows Vista held up against
windows 7 as well as it did in my
benchmarks even though it did score
lower against windows 7 in pretty much
all the benchmarks the difference is
really were not anything to throw a
party over so if you're looking to
upgrade to Windows 7 it pretty much
comes down to functionality and features
so what do you guys think I have shown
you the features and ran the test is
windows seven something you're looking
forward to I have personally been
pleased with the beta but the price is
still a bit of a punch in the face and
actually a sucker punch for us beta
testers but that's about it for this
video catch you later LP from
