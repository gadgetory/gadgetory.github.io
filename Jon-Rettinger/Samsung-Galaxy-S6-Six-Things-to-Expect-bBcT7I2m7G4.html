TechnoBuffalo here you know that brand
new Galaxy s5 you just bought that you
signed up for two years for I've got
good news and bad news for you the good
news it's a pretty sweet phone the bad
news it's old and soon to be very
outdated the galaxy s6 is coming and it
seems very likely that it's coming
during Mobile World Congress in just a
few weeks which we will be at so in
honor of this new flagship from Samsung
showing its face in the very near future
I thought I would tell you six things
you can expect from the galaxy s6 we're
taking all the stats from recent leaks
rumors and insight sources that we have
so without further ado I'm going to you
a six things you can expect and take to
the bank for Samsung's latest galaxy s6
start with the brains of the thing and
that's the processor it's become super
apparent that Samsung's going to launch
a Galaxy s6 with its own a 64-bit Exynos
processor on board which is an absolute
beast
instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
processor rivers have hinted and
Qualcomm denied it that Samsung went in
to overheating issues even though other
manufacturers may not have and
ultimately decided just to bail
completely on the SD a10 the company
typically launched its own qualcomm
variant of their phones in the US
however opting for interested to see if
it's gonna affect the US launch a
Verizon AT&amp;amp;T mobile perhaps it have
enough those XE knows chips for all the
US carriers my bet they're ramping up
manufacturing really really fast so we
get that super sweet kid so we talked
about the brains what about the beauty
what's the thing gonna look like so
several inch photos and renders from
case makers and others who provided a
pretty solid look what we think the
final galaxy s6 design is going to look
like it almost certainly looks like
Samsung's good employ a metal frame
similar what we saw on the Galaxy Note 4
in the Galaxy alpha I can't say on the
records this is gonna be the best design
Galaxy S smartphone to date but kind of
expect out every new one but I still
think it's gonna look beautiful and
hopefully not much more plastic so we
talked about brains embodied what about
what's gonna shoot your brains embody
Galaxy s5 to the 16 megapixel camera and
apparently Samsung's going to step up
its game with a new 20 megapixel model
pretty badass so 20-megapixel should
mean way sharper images we've ever had
before though it's Apple HTC approved in
the past not always a negative count
that matters but I don't know
I'm amours gotta better write these if
you want to just zoom in for a lot least
photos that we've seen have backed up
these rumors with a large camera module
appearing on the back of we think is the
alleged galaxy s6 galaxy s5 already
takes some pretty solid photos so I
think can only get better with the
galaxy s6 Samsung seems to learn a lot
model year over model year so they put
the galaxy s6 to be pretty baller the
camera Department so I don't usually
talk about superpowers and phone videos
but I think the galaxy s6 might have
this is probably more speculative of all
of these back panel superpowers and like
January a rumor cropped up suggesting
that Samsung may sell special back cover
accessories to add different functions
to the galaxy s6 so there are various
functions opposed lead to these covers
and the rumor has it the Samsung is
gonna launch one that might be able to
measure your blood sugar for glucose
we've got diabetics if you're diabetic
for example other features that might
give you a Yoda phone like eating
displayed notifications on the back for
reading third report also synced up with
different Fitness machines to provide
information if you have worked out that
will sync with s health essentially it's
got a prepared - connector on the back
the back plates would do different
things and also one cover might allow
you to boost a 20 megapixel camera by
even further supporting special lenses
created by third party developers that
might mean things like audio clip like
functionality for different lenses and
also fisheye at a pinch and super zoom
and all kinds of other stuff
this one's again more speculative I
think that would be absolutely awesome
and open up just a ton of new features
and also more revenue for Samsung it
would probably be proprietary connector
on the back they can license the hell
out of it one of the features that I'm
most excited about definitely the least
sexy and it's the new TouchWiz so of all
the features removed for the galaxy s6
this one again I just I'm drooling for
said things apparently finally ready to
dial back TouchWiz on for a more pure
Android 5.0 lollipop experience out of
the box
excuse me well I just do a happy dance
rumor has it the company will still
offer plenty of other additional
software features but that users can
download them on their own instead of
finding them all pre-loaded on the
device immediately Raman lujah lighting
up touch with scales to improve overall
performance on device everything should
run just way smoother way smaller
footprint to have more storage
everybody's just happy and last but not
least quicker Android updates it ties
into the last thing we just talked about
because a lot of TouchWiz features will
be app based it means the core OS could
be updated much quicker Samsung you can
get those updates out to their carriers
quicker which means we will get quicker
updates Android and not have to wait
months and months and months and months
and months instead only have to wait
months and months and months in order to
get the latest version of Android they
get the doubt from Google overall this
is the most excited I've been for a
Galaxy S series advice since I think the
galaxy s4 if we get things that are more
Android like at least more native
Android like those crazy back covers
better cameras
I think Samsung is gonna have a huge hit
on their hands the galaxy s5 was not the
runaway success they thought it might be
dad hit the reset button a little bit
for the sixth iteration but if these
rumors come to fruition they're gonna
have a gigantic hit on their hands what
do you guys think if this is the phone
you want to get you're not excited about
I wanna hear your thoughts on it

smartphones you always appreciate it
