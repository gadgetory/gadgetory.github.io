brought to you by domain.com what's
going on internet friends and sometimes
internet enemies spent about 7 weeks in
C Apple watch came out so I thought it'd
be nice time to reflect on what it is
what it isn't my impressions on it have
changed now we know that watch OS 2.0
was coming what that's going to mean for
the existing Apple watch if you didn't
watch my Apple watch review link to it
down below essentially said this I was
step above ambivalent towards a watch I
didn't think it did that much that was
expensive overpriced which I guess the
same thing and it didn't offer anything
new my big problem with it was why spend
so much money for something that skeevy
notifications and sort of mimic phone
features although poorly when you're
spending so much money for a really
expensive phone it just didn't make
sense to me
so I've been using the Apple watch the
fact I've had it on my wrist every day
since it first came out so now for a
total of 7 weeks so I know it pretty
well what I use it most for is not for
notifications it's not for apps it's not
for sending heartbeats or pictures of
mushrooms to friends it's to remind me
to get up and move that's really why I
wear the Apple watch and I could do that
with pretty much any other SmartWatch
out there or fitness bands
I like the interface like it reminds me
to stand up I track my calories reminds
me to be a little bit more active but
that's the extent of what I use your
Apple watch for the novelty very quickly
wore off of answering phone calls with
the speaker phone's not that loud but
any microphones kind of hard for people
to hear me on I always say it sounds
very poor quality there's ambient noise
it is not the best so that's what I'm
using the Apple watch for I had a few
issues with OS 1.0 as it stood certain
Goffe on make your own watch faces was
really annoying that they out of control
the complications has been a bit tough
as well and complications just fancy
watch talk toward the information that
shows you things on the watch I first
didn't think it was a very good looking
watch but that's kind of change I feel
like it looks nice I made a video about
my poor decision buying process of
buying this brown leather loop so you
can watch that as well link to that down
below one of the things that I think is
really innovative with the Apple watch
though is forced touch that's something
you can really see a utility for in the
next-gen hardware I'm not just for the
watch back generation phone and tablets
it's a really nice way to have extra
button without
having a button digital crown has been
surprisingly useful the button blow it's
been useful but again I'm not using to
watch much much more than you know
making sure I've burned my calories
today or tapping me to remind me to get
up I've got all the notifications for
mail turned off so it's not a vibrating
or buzzing it hasn't something that I
really liked it that much but then OS
2.0 I was at the WTC where they
announced it in fact I did a
behind-the-scenes video of WWDC me if
you want to watch that video on my other
channel inside Jon's mind we'll put that
right here otherwise you can go over and
subscribe what kind of behind the scenes
stuff and things about my life over on
that channel you got an idea for next
great website domain comm has you
covered
they won't hook you up with a great
offer save 20% on domain names and web
hosting when you use coupon code
TechnoBuffalo that's all capital letters
one word at domain coms check out
I think domain names think domain.com so
watch OS 2.0 is gonna do a lot of things
that should have been there from day one
custom watch faces I mean come on
interactive watch faces videos the
ability to sort of do the time machine
and scroll forward in time to see what
the weather's going to be and such is
really useful features it's evolving the
watch forward I think what the big step
is going to be is putting the hardware
so the current watch that we have now
what the next generation is going to be
and I think we're going to see the next
generation I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say I think we're gonna see it in
time for the holiday season which and it
was not that much time between one and
two we saw about eight months between
you to show I pad launched and the iPad
to launch think it's going to be kind of
the same timeframe here think Apple is
really trying to get this right they
don't want to wait and hold hardware for
release cycle so having said that what I
buy the Apple watch again nope I don't
think I would I was in this industry I
mean if I didn't have to check out if I
didn't have to review it and share it
pains with it I don't think I would I
think I would really be in the camp of
waiting to see what comes next looking
at something at this expensive things
that exist in the other world
smartwatches and moto 360 has gotten
very very very cheap I still think that
the Apple watch OS is more useful at
Android wear but there are way more
options in the Android wear side and
also for way lower price points so near
kind of balances out almost parody
smartwatches still don't offer anything
new no compelling features to get one
nothing that my phone doesn't are
do so I probably better off ditching
this and getting like a Fitbit or
something to sort of track my calories
and remind my tubby butt to get up and
move around I'm excited about what OS to
point I was going to do but I'm more
excited about what next direction
hardware's going to do and I don't think
you guys thoughts on the Apple watch if
you pick one up do you like it do not
like it would you return it did you
return it are you waiting to buy one or
maybe yours has even shipped yet I
really like to hear your thoughts and
oppression Donald leave in the comments
down below and we can talk about it have
a dialogue the next time I'm John
writing TechnoBuffalo I'll talk to you
dear friends in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
