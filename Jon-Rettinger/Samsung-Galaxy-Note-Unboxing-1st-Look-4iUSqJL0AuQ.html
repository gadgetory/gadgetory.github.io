TechnoBuffalo here I'm boxing one of the
biggest baddest phones on the planet
this is the Samsung Galaxy Note this
phone tablet hybrid so I guess that
would make it a phablet or a tone as
rocking a 5.3 inch screen a beastly 1.4
gigahertz dual-core processor and a ton
of other goodness let's go ahead and see
how this phone works whether or not it
can work as a phone whether or not I can
go in your pocket and all the other
questions I'm sure you have and that I
have I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note
let's go ahead and get it unboxed
alright so do this we will use these
scissors of doom let's take a quick look
at the box this is the white model it's
also available in black got a picture of
the device on the front there is the
s-pen which we'll talk about the back of
the device samsung galaxy note this
model is currently not or any model the
Galaxy Note is not currently available
in the US it's available abroad but does
have support though for AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+
network so if you want to import it
you've got the option to do so this unit
came to us from the folks at Negri if
you follow the rumor mill though you
might also know that AT&amp;amp;T is the rumor
to pick one of these guys up hopefully
packing LTE what they presumed CES 2012
announcements just a week or so away
they'll go ahead and cut plastic I saw
this guy first one was unveiled in
Berlin at IFA and I was extremely
impressed I only had a limited amount of
time with it he only had a few display
models to show the press but I did try
the pocket essen if I remember correctly
it did pass let's go ahead and this
thing's sealed up as it should be
security seal alright let's go ahead and
break the seal it's actually called
ceramic white because you guys are
wondering so I'll use a white phone on a
white box on a white background and
there it is the Samsung Galaxy Note it's
got that similar form factor to the
unlocked or European or other galaxy s2
models sold outside of the US with that
one big button and two capacitive
buttons that'll show up on the side so
go ahead and pull it out of the box
that's a big phone there's no no ifs and
buts about it this is uh not the
smallest of devices push that off to the
side for a moment I see it else we're
going to have in the Box galaxy no
QuickStart guide for getting started
quickly we've got the monster battery
which is monster in milliamp hours not
so much inside it's not actually that
big but it is a 2500 milliamp hour
battery so hopefully we'll get plenty of
juice out of this phone I've been
reading that it will have plenty of
power to get through a full day but it's
gonna need that power to make this
screen light up so we're also gonna have
in the box charging and syncing cable
and micro USB variety um it's kind of
nice we've got some ear buds and
different sizes small medium large
depending on how large your ears are and
those go with these in-ear headphones
which you can see hopefully right there
buttons for volume up and down and send
an end you want to leave them in there
I've got a so many pairs of headphones
laying around I need to open them up
here is where the charger would go but I
presume we do not have a u.s. charger so
you can have to use another USB charger
for this guy but that's not what works
slides in you're good to go this thing
pops out this goes in and you can charge
like you would any other phone great but
all that's a back that's not what
everybody's here for at something I'm
here for
let's go ahead take a look at the Galaxy
Note and zoom in just a little bit I
will run through these specs on this guy
first
again not available in the US I just
running Android 2.3 but Samsung has said
we'll be getting its Gingerbread on from
a dimension standpoint it seems crazy to
say this on a phone five point seven
eight inches by three point two seven
inches by 0.38 so it's still an
extremely thin device and way is six
point two eight ounces with the battery
inside of it from a display standpoint
it is a 5.3 inch monster display WXGA so
that's 800 that's 800 this way by 1280
that way so it definitely an HD display
and it's a Super AMOLED screen as you
can tell by the HD AMOLED label right
there the 2500 milliamp hour battery we
talked about it suppose it gonna give
you 13 hours of talk time but 570 hours
of standby time 1.4 gigahertz dual-core
cortex a9 the Exynos chip set so this
makes it at least in theory the fastest
phone on the amorous one of the fastest
phones on the market higher clock speed
then the heavily regarded or highly
regarded galaxy s 2 Giga RAM I get it in
69 32 gig configurations this one is 16
but does have microsd expandable T on
the back it's got a camera the cameras
that we've known to love from Samsung
this is the 8 megapixel motto of LED
flash in shoots 1080p video on the front
we've got a cute megapixel camera
networks so none yet but it does have
support for AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ I believe that's
a 14 for a variety bluetooth 3.0 it also
has something kind of neat on the bottom
it's got something called an S Pen and
this is not just a capacitive stylus is
not a resistive touchscreen arcing back
to the old Windows Mobile days this
actually can turn the screen it's almost
a bit of a Wacom tablet where can sense
different pressure sensitivities there
are buttons on the pen here that you can
use for screen capture and selecting and
I'll walk you through that in a full
demonstration but that goes and lives
right in there it seems very odd to have
a stylus again alright so let's go ahead
and pop the battery in and do a boot up
this guy kind of curious then pull this
off alright so we've gotten that pulled
so we can get this back off somehow
there's the little groove and for Sam
start to get their phones to weigh so
little generally the materials they use
our plastic and this back piece feels
extremely thin so that's where the micro
SD card would go there is not one
installed that's obviously where the
giant battery goes go ahead and pop that
in I'll put a sim card in a bit later
speaker obviously there and there's the
camera sensors go ahead and try and snap
this monster back on
snap-in we're almost getting there all
right so we are snapped in let's go
ahead and power it on power button loops
here on the right-hand side usually like
power buttons on the top of the phones
but the film is big that was not gonna
be possible and it is booting up still
go and peel off the screen the only time
there won't be fingerprints on this guy
galaxy note the model is the GTN 7000
smallest is booting up let's do a real
quick size comparison my curtain film
that I'm using is what I thought was one
of the biggest films out there this is
the HTC Titan with a 4.7 inch screen you
can see a difference it looks downright
small and speaking of downright small if
we bring in a iPhone 4 or 4s with the
same size 3.5 inch screen it almost
looks like a toy uh-huh next to it and
you can just see how small it really is
next to the Galaxy Note so this is a
very very large phone so I'll go ahead
and finish putting up and I'll walk you
through the rest of the stuff that the
phone has so it's got your sensors on
top there is your speaker microphone
right there and that microphone is only
going to be used when it's in
speakerphone but it is a noise
cancelling mic 3.5 millimeter headset
jack on the top you can see those two
capacitive buttons lit up hopefully you
can see them lit up on the bottom that's
where you're going to charge and sync to
be a microUSB volume rocker up and down
on the Left nothing else there no camera
shutter button on the right-hand side
just the power and lock alright so here
is the Android guys go ahead and do a
real quick set up it looks like it's in
English but let's make sure it's in
United States English it was not so go
ahead and select that's there we go and
now we can touch the Android to begin
this is running TouchWiz the newest
version of TouchWiz I'm excited to get
some Ice Cream Sandwich going on this
guy I will connect to Wi-Fi later we
don't have a sim in there it's fine
Google contract me never know everything
about me anyway we'll do all the stuff
later automatic
next and boom here we are a lot of stuff
a lot of pixels to see and get a lot of
things on this screen so some custom
tweaks that we've got on here jump into
applications you've got a 5x5 grid now
because the screen is just an absolute
but Emmet
so you can see a lot more stuff there
this is a physical button here it's not
a a trackpad though despite that it
might look like a little bit of trackpad
it is not you've got some s applications
here there's S Memo and s note what
takes advantage of the well that S Pen
let's go ahead and pull that S Pen out
here and do a real quick demonstration
I'll open up s memo there we go
and it's sound you gotta do it double
tap the screen while pressing the pen
button s memo will be displayed okay
use two fingers and panning free okay
that's fine thanks for the notes there
Samsung let's go ahead and open up one
of their pictures how about this dog all
right so my pet see if I can draw on
this just try to draw on it we have to
go into edit version so let's edit all
right
so now I can draw I can take notes hi
you can edit stuff and you can pick
different pen sizes different texts so
you can choose which one you want I'll
do a full demonstration of all this
stuff just want to walk you through a
little quickly I can choose pencil pen
paintbrush different colors whatever you
want it to say and right now you can
also get an eraser you can erase all of
your scribbles go and now you can erase
the stuff so real short demonstration of
that it's go see what other stuff we
have unless since this is carrier and
lock you're not gonna have much carrier
bloatware but you have a lot of Samsung
Edition so you can take that to either
be a positive or a negative depending on
how you feel about Samsung stuff so
Polaris Office is included that's nice
FM radio voice Talk Crayon Physics
Samsung Apps - really apps meant for the
S Pen all the social stuff that we've
seen s planner so it should be a giant
calendar which it is with some additions
on the side to use that big screen we've
got a lot of screens so we've got
like it's one two three four five six
seven screens go and see what they show
here by default so there's some notes
the mess a Berlin Center where this was
announced at IFA it circles there's that
big old calendar widget breaking news
email all kinds of other stuff that you
can go ahead and add speaking of Atlas
he would kind of widgets they give us
widgets AccuWeather ap mobile bookmarks
does a little 3d shuffle as you move it
along agenda tasks mini agenda classic
clock lots of clocks here more clocks
and google surged and now we're on to
the standard maybe some of the standard
Android stuff that you see on here so
this has been a very first look at the
Samsung Galaxy Note will have a ton more
coverage coming up on TechnoBuffalo comm
so be sure to check us out for coverage
on this and all of your tech news I am
John Rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you guys in the next video
bye bye alright so the last thing I
wanted to show you guys is the pocket
test see if this phone can fit in just a
normal dude pocket then I don't really
take jeans just regular jeans let's go
ahead and give it a shot go ahead and
drop it in and it does fit it definitely
makes a little bit of an outline but
walking around I don't think I'm gonna
notice it all that much so I've got a
hoodie pocket here you can go ahead and
fit it in there kind of nicely it might
stick out just a little bit but you know
if it's okay in the pocket so there's
the samsung galaxy note i'll bring in
the HTC Titan so you can see what that
looks like right in the pocket doesn't
make that much of a difference release
doesn't feel that different
so Samsung Galaxy Note is pocketable
if you're not wearing super tight jeans
or pants or shorts whatever it might be
alright now I'll see you guys in the
next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
