to you by netflix hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me ashley's gather any question you
might have from the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on technobuffalo calm
you could leave your question in the
post comment otherwise you can summon me
anytime of the day or night at
technobuffalo or at ashleys schedule on
twitter just use the hashtag ask the be
so i can see it and usually i answered
between three and five questions every
episode so let's get answering cuz
disaster Buffalo what our user at KGC
shot says hey Ashley with the nexus 5
just releasing what is your favorite
android phone for the year well that is
a really good question and i haven't
used the nexus 5 a whole lot so I can't
say 100% sure that it's you know my
favorite phone so I would have to say
out of all the phones I've used
extensively this year my favorite
android phone would be the HTC One it's
just such a nice well-designed phone it
looks beautiful I actually really like
blinkfeed I think it's a really useful
integration of a Flipboard like user
interface I think it's really good I
love video highlights it's one of my
favorite things about the phone being
able to sort of stitch together all of
your zoe's and your pictures from an
event into a 30-second recap clip is
amazing and really easy to sort of get
different clips and recaps tough to
family and friends for a different
events so I would say the HTC One that's
my favorite android phone of 2013
twitter user app Bobbsey one says with
the holidays coming up would you
recommend a to TS 3ds or XL I sort of
have questions to ask you if that's the
case because usually it's sort of like
someone asking do you think i should get
Windows Phone Android or iOS it's like
well what do use your phone for and do
you prefer to have a lot of productivity
in widgets or do you prefer to have a
bunch of apps like these are the
questions I have to ask you so if you
are on a strict budget the 2d s is a
great option if you really really want
that clam shell but don't want to spend
the extra scratch for an XL go with the
3ds but honestly I think if you're gonna
go 3ds
gotta go big and you got to get the XL
so if you're on a strict tight tight
budget this holiday season 2 D s is the
way to go but if you have the extra
money you can't go wrong with the XL
josh asks hey ashley what are your
thoughts on where nintendo will follow
this holiday season with the release of
the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one coming up
this month what does Nintendo need to do
to sell more we use Nintendo is going to
be in the same position that it kind of
was in last console season which is it's
not a bad place to be in but um oddly
enough it's sort of a position where
it's like it's a secondary console that
everybody will kind of get they'll get
that one console that they feel they
really need whether that's the wii u the
xbox one or the playstation 4 and then
they'll get a secondary console so the
wii u is in a really good place because
of its price point to be that secondary
console in people's homes a lot of
people have families they want more
family friendly games obviously Mario
still has a huge pull on nostalgia wise
with lots and lots of people including
myself I definitely think that Nintendo
is gonna be in a position in the next
five years where people will start
really picking up their new next-gen
consoles and then saying you know I also
really want that new metroid game i
really want that new HD Legend of Zelda
so it really depends on Nintendo
bringing out those really legendary
first-party characters in new games that
are HD that are gorgeous and that will
bring people to the console that's what
I think Antonio cool Jack asked hey
Ashley when can we expect the new
TechnoBuffalo show that was shortly
mentioned on rettinger rants if possible

believe John gave up our secret it is a
new show and I will be hosting it I'm
