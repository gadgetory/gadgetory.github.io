TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the Polk Audio Omni s2 so it is the Polk
Omni s2 I'm glad you asked it is a
wireless speaker with DTS play-fi tech
which means you can play music anywhere
you are in your house which is going to
be huge for me I've got a one-year-old
at home who loves disney music now I can
just control it when I'm downstairs and
he's sleeping and he starts crying I
could just play some tunes for him and
I'm good to go
certainly your use could be way
different than that so here's the box
for the polk audio on the s2 well i'm
primarily gonna be using this to stream
the Mickey Mouse Club hot dog song
this is a great speaker though for all
genres of music no matter what you
listen to I can hook up with other Polk
Audio wireless speakers you can play the
same audio through different speakers in
your house which is pretty neat so tell
you stuff about it but why Reed when
you're watching a video will bring in
just the unnecessary I'm going to lose a
finger unboxing knife to cut this
plastic pricing on this guy is always
changing but around 200 bucks at least
as of this filming so if you wanna pick
one of these guys up I will put a link
down below so you can check it out boom
we got some poke some poke books
Omni s2 set-up guide preferred service
program and a little bit more about
their collection and different languages
which I wish I could understand but I
cannot I'll go ahead and lift up the
cardboard we got nothing in their little
heart when you just know that poke loves
us and there is the speaker weighing in
at just a little over 4 pounds wearing
the white trunks in the right corner
we've got a different color speaker oh
it's white I think the one that's on
there is a bollock and we got a little
box with another surprise in it let's
see what said surprise is my smart money
is on a power adapter I'm gonna cut up
always good advice cut up so you don't
slice your finger off
and inside a surprise box we have power
adapter so you can plug it in and you
can actually use it I'm glad as it just
sits on your shelf looking pretty push
all that stuff off to the side let's
bring this guy in hello little hearts
let's slide this off very slowly man out
boom now you can see all of its buttons
and here is the speaker so you're
probably saying yourself hey John that
looks nice but wouldn't look nicer but I
can put it the other way to you I say
yes yes you can put it the other way
worry not it'll go anyway you want to
put it in the depending on what you to
cordon your houses if you want the black
grille or the white grill or the gold
grill and your teeth you could have your
choice spin this guy around you got a
setup button you can set this up very
easily from your mobile phone using the
Omni up DC in we're I'm guessing the DC
and power ox it to plugging whatever
source you want and a USB port on the
front we've got a volume up and down in
your main poke button which can sort of
do multi functions stuff for you so
let's go ahead and try and set this
sucker up and stream some music through
the app so what makes this thing tick
when I was a kid I used to always like
to take things apart I would just have
like random parts of like calculators
radios around my house I wasn't very
good to put them together but I did like
to see how things work what's making
this thing work is DTS play-fi
technology and just a little bit of
magic to use that to stream over a
really any standard Wi-Fi network
the cool thing though you're not gonna
have any sort of audio degradation and
you shouldn't have any lag and all no
loss of sound quality it's gonna sound
just like you ran like a really long
cable around your house so the CTS
play-fight tech is kind of neat because
it don't care what brand of speakers
that it's in as long as it's in there so
if you're like oh I like poke and your
wife's like oh I like this other brand
it's not gonna matter no matter what
speaker brand you like put them all
around your house and everything will
work seamlessly also fully compatible
with although s's and I pretty much mean
all iOS Android Windows and Amazon fire
opera custom so it picked up a fire
phone you are gonna be set
didn't use that fire phone to control
your speaker also since its app based
are gonna continue to get updates so
cool new stuff should hopefully be
coming all over that yeah so I'm gonna
get technical with you for a minute so
put on your technical hat is it on
alright so the speaker uses two two inch
full range drivers powered by a
2-channel amplifier so you're gonna get
a ton of power coming out of this a
little tiny speaker and again you can
stream to any room you want in the house
long as you got a speaker in there
extreme the same music all over take it
out look at dinner party dinner party
goes from kitchen figure outside to your
family room and I want them to hear that
same lovely music you can do so but
don't let it go upstairs so your dinner
party got out of hand
people need boundaries so this up was
pretty easy I pushed that setup button
on the back so the light was pulsing I
went into settings and I found the
speaker profile that show up in Wi-Fi
reopened up the app and connected to our
Wi-Fi network here and that brings us to
now I think you're just working so from
the phone you can stream kind of any of
the apps that are here yet internet
radio Pandora Kay Bach songs and
settings connect to a media server or
every music you've got on your phone
let's go ahead give it a shot let's
let's play some music
so obviously you couldn't hear the sound
quality coming out of the Omni s2 it's
coming from the speaker to my microphone
going up to YouTube the hamster wheel
spins it comes down to a computer I'll
compress and every speakers you have
it's not going to hear the fidelity out
of this sort of diminutive really high
quality speaker so we've played some
audio samples don't judge my taste in
music I'm not judging your playlists
don't even begin to judge mine but music
does sound pretty good we did try it
from different genres and things do
sound pretty nice so if you want
something with a rich bass profile if
you wanna rock your classical music or
your old ease Saturday morning TV shows
you are going to be all set again get a
run you around 200 bucks and can be down
below if you want to check this sucker
