TechnoBuffalo here and we are unboxing
the just release Nexus S this guy's
going to set you back five hundred and
twenty nine dollars completely unlocked
or $199 the t-mobile service let's go
and see what you're going to get for
your hard-earned cash so the box is very
reminiscent of the first Google phone
the Nexus One you've got a picture of
the device on the front Nexus S on the
sides Nexus S on the sides go ahead and
pull off the top and there we've got the
device sitting there Nexus S push it off
to the side for just one minute see what
else we're going to get in the box and
assuming it's the usual array of stuff
t-mobile SIM card God some health and
safety terms of conditions we've got a
My Girl USB cord got a 1500 milliamp
hour Samsung battery this is made by
Samsung got a pair of stereo headphones
with mic adapter in there and you've got
a wall charger so enough of that
business let's go ahead and take a look
at the phone and let's recap the specs
on this guy real quickly really the big
thing is that it's a first phone running
Gingerbread so Android 2.3 it's got a
4-inch WVGA Super AMOLED screen with the
resolution of 800 by 480 5 megapixel
camera on the backside with autofocus
and LED flash also has a VGA camera on
the front 16 gigs of internal storage
there is no micro SD card here and again
that 1500 million power battery let's go
ahead and wash off the plastic very
whooshing the capacitive buttons which
live down there somewhere appear to be
very hidden and there's a whooshing
noise on the back on first Blodgett say
this feels very very similar to a galaxy
s smartphone it's got that same sort of
plastic Samsung back that we see on a
lot of devices it really makes for a
fingerprint magnet I'm gonna go ahead
and pop the battery in and see if this
guy looks like when we powered on so
we've got the back off the device you
can see where the SIM card goes no spot
for microSD because this guy
doesn't have it it's popping the battery
and see what the Buddha looks like on
Android 2.3 everything just snaps back
in sort of got that reverse chin effect
that we saw on a few of the earlier
Android devices so the power button
looks to be on the right-hand side go
ahead and let that power up I'll give a
tour the device walls are doing that
power button right there on the left
hand side you've got your volume up and
down 3.5 milimeter headset jack actually
lives on the bottom of the phone as well
as the charging port on the top you
really got nothing so I've got that same
sort of Nexus splash screen that we saw
on the Nexus One welcome to the Nexus S
Touch Android to begin we'll go ahead
and touch him you don't have a SIM card
installed ready connect to Wi-Fi and
I'll jump back in actually once I'm in
Gingerbread to give you guys just a very
quick look at what that's going to look
like and of course a lot of full
coverage what diaper system is going to
do alright so that was relatively quick
setup we are now in the operating system
which is pure Android and of course this
again is running Android 2.3 the first
phone to be running Gingerbread I'll be
doing a full overview of Gingerbread but
on first blush you can see things a
little bit different icons at the bottom
are now colored so I've got that same
Nexus background let's take a look at
the keyboard really quickly since that
is one of the big differences here as
well it's a much better laid out keys or
spacing in between them when you type
you get the letter serves more true to
where your finger is and just a lot of
improvements when you look at a menu for
example a little jump into the programs
there's a bit more fluidity when you
scroll through things if I go into
settings for example there's also now an
option to manage your applications right
from the home screen to go and hit the
menu button I jump at the settings there
really any list we need to get to the
bottom you know get that little sort of
yellowish orange glow let you know that
you're there just some animations weeks
there's a lot more sort of under the
hood for Gingerbread I'm looking forward
to showing you guys all that it can do
but for right now this was just an
unboxing of the Nexus S be sure to stay
tuned to the channel on TechnoBuffalo
for all kinds of
see comparisons and her guess I'll see
you next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
