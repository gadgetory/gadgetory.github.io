John retinue from TechnoBuffalo here at
a full review for you of the newest 3d
powerhouse this is the evo 3d first
sprint the successor to the very first
4G smartphone the Evo 4G let's see if it
lives up to the outstanding precedent
that its father set so if your ears are
still bleeding from that intro my
apologies so as I do with all of my
phone reviews I'd like to start out with
talking about call quality doesn't
matter what the phone can do or not do
but doesn't make good phone calls it's
not gonna be much use to you when I do
my phone tests I'll Drive
about a five-mile radius where I am in
Southern California and do a twenty call
test I'm in a fringe 3G 4G area
primarily I was on the 3G side and about
twelve of my calls were done on only 3G
and I didn't have any drop calls at all
call quality was absolutely outstanding
as I found to be pretty typical with
Sprint service however the other eight
calls were sort of on 4G areas sort of
not sometimes it would drop in and out
when they would drop in and out the cold
would also drop in and out so I had
three dropped calls and the call quality
was not outstanding when I was connected
to Sprint's 4G WiMAX network now granted
I was only connected with one bar of
service and the drop calls primarily
happened in the 3G to 4G handoff but
something to keep in mind if you are in
a fringe area sneaker phone as has been
true with most HTC phones that have come
out recently and this is of course HTC
built as is you can tell as is you can
tell huh as you can tell by that big HTC
logo right there
speaker quality's absolutely outstanding
so if you're big speaker phone user like
me you are going to be pretty happy so
as we go through the review will talk
about specs and I remind you everything
that this guy packs of course the
biggest things that things that I want
to know I assume you want to know - its
how does the screen and the 3d camera
work and how fast really is this because
it's got one of Qualcomm's new 1.2
gigahertz dual
core chips and this thing is absolutely
a screamer so when I did my review of
the HTC Sensation which is a t-mobile
phone and the first phone was actually
running HTC's new sense 3.0 I gave a bit
of an overview on sense and what it
could do because the first phone we've
seen it in this being the second I'm not
gonna do a thorough an overview of Sense
3.0 you can check out that previous
video if you want to watch it but I will
show you some of the highlights so sense
is essentially a skin that sits on top
of Android Android of course is very
customizable and this is HTC's custom
sense and it is on top of Android
Gingerbread so you are getting at least
the most recent phone OS so here's a
couple cool things to notice here about
this first the lock screen you can
customize any of these four icons you
can jump right to it so if I wanted to
say jump into gallery I could just drag
it right down and I would jump into
gallery I don't want to just unlock the
phone you can just unlock it pretty
normally and you slide that up you get a
cool bunch of coolest reading animations
here then of course you can see that
lockscreen that I just showed you can be
pretty customisable if you go ahead and
go to lock communic and choose a ton of
different HTC options you can set any of
those four programs to launch or
shortcuts whatever you choose very very
easily some of the nice addition to go
ahead and drag this on down you get
quick settings which I really like be
able to turn these things on and off
nice and easily go ahead and close that
up and of course you get all kinds of
neat 3d animation now because this phone
is an absolute screamer from the spec
department it's been augmented to I
should mention with one gigabyte of RAM
running this guy through a quadrant test
I got a score of 1733 now it doesn't
really mean that much to me I want to
use a phone I just want it to be fast
and I like it to not kill battery which
we will talk about this phone is an
absolute screamer is incredibly fast for
opening applications and my big test
sort of something that I use every day
is the web browser
I've got flash content loaded here it's
enabled and turned on and on some
previous single-core phones to flash
turned on if I did quick scrolling I get
that checkerboard pattern in the
pinch-to-zoom wasn't as a media
I would like not true here at the Evo 3d
this thing is fast I have never had a
checkerboard pattern show up credibly
quick as you see here pinch-to-zoom very
very fast really fluid no issues at all
and Sprint's three three do you keep
saying 3d there 3G network has also been
very very fast I'm getting speeds about
three or so megabits per second down you
can see the slash content showing up
there on the banner applications load
really quickly no matter what you're
loading just the phone you're gonna have
great performance from you're not really
have to worry much about memory
management as well often times some the
problems people have with their Android
phones when they experience crashing is
due to their task killing programs third
party task killers you're not going to
need that with Eve of 3ds certainly you
have the option to manage your programs
more judiciously if you'd like but not
gonna be necessary you got a Giga RAM in
here so things are always going to be
fast and always going to be working
pretty well so the next thing the big
thing I wanted to see it was of course
that the reading is and how does the 3d
cameras work or how do two 3d cameras
work so I mentioned earlier the HTC
Sensation which really is a very similar
phone you can see it right here to the
Evo 3d of those does have an eight
megapixel sensor that sensor does drop
to five megapixels when you do the 3d
business now when you shoot in 3d you
can also shoot early shoot rather when
you shoot 2d you can shoot in 1080p
you're not gonna be able to do that
unfortunately in 3d so let me show you
some of the stuff about the phone one of
the gripes that I have is that giant
camera button now I like a dedicated
camera button
I'm all for a dedicated camera button
what I'm not for is a giant dedicated
camera button it almost feels like it's
going to slice your hand when you hold
it if you look at it right the right
angle you can see it's raised there's a
bit of a sharp edge right there so if
you're a right-handed or you hold your
phone in your right hand as you pick it
up and you slide your hand over it you
skate can get caught and I've actually
had that happen a few times something to
bear in mind so you've got a really big
camera switch right there and you've got
your 2d the 3d shutter leave that on 3d
for right now and I really like that
shutters there or the button there
rather is to set it to 2 T or 3 D makes
it very
easy so I'll go ahead and open up the
camera application
and this is gonna open up the 3d camera
now unfortunately I'm not gonna be able
to see much in 3d I'll bring in my
camera mode here this is just gonna look
weird and blurry to you
this is using stereoscopic 3d to capture
the image so I'll go ahead and sort
again in focus I'll go ahead and take
the picture see there's a bit of a delay
and the picture is snapped stereoscopic
3d essentially means glasses-free 3d and
I will say that I was bit skeptical that
the 3d was gonna be a gimmick on the
phone and those fears were kind of
realized I'm not that big into the 3d
craze the Nintendo 3ds for example hurt
my eyes after using it for just about 20
minutes if you guys would be a computer
user you stare into monitor for five ten
hours at a time your eyes start to hurt
using something like the 3ds which also
uses stereoscopic 3d definitely hurt my
eyes I didn't have that same eye strain
though however with something like the
Evo 3d here so I should go back to my
gallery and I'll show you some of the
pictures here's some sample of 3d images
so we're going the one that we just shot
for example camera shots and there is
that 3d image so again not gonna look 3d
to you I will say the 3d effect though
really doesn't work well so if you're
into 3d there's gonna be a very nice
welcome addition however if 3d is not
that important to you you're gonna like
that you can just go ahead and do this
boom 3ds turned off and I can just have
a very quick really nice 2d camera where
you can shoot 1080p video and shoot very
high quality stills so is it a gimmick
yeah is it a deal-killer certainly not
if you'd like to have the option to have
3d then you have the option to do that
here and you're getting it in a very
very very nice package so you're gonna
see 3d of course on the screen let's
talk about this Q HD screen for a few
minutes go ahead and jump back into
gallery because there's a lot of stuff
to see here I have not been the biggest
fan I've got on record of saying I don't
think HTC is putting out the best
screens possible especially you compared
something like Samsung's AMOLED or Super
AMOLED screens or AMOLED plus or what
other other type of amyloids you can
possibly think of the screen just hasn't
really
popped for me so you're some images
these are in 3d yeah they look fine
the colors are sort of bright but
they're not as bright as they could be
you look at text for example text on a
website it's crisp and it's clear but
not as crisp and clear as it could be
oftentimes I use the example of TV
shopping so if you walk into your local
big-box retailer and you see two TVs
next to each other you're gonna notice
difference between equality between one
and two of them however it wants to get
that TV home on your wall you're not
gonna notice the difference in quality
so if you're holding phones next to each
other you're looking at this versus say
the galaxy s2 here can those difference
in the screen quality however if this is
your primary phone and this is what
you've got in your pocket the screens
going to look fine I just want to give
sort of people a frame of reference the
screen is not the best thing about the
phone however you are getting that
stereoscopic 3d screen so sorry you can
measure out the pros and the cons so all
that three deenis certainly is going to
come at a drain of battery as well as
that 4.3 inch screen
HTC packs a pretty big 1730 milliamp
hour battery and to this admittedly
chunky package and I'm happy to say that
I was able to get a full day of battery
life which is awesome granted I didn't
do much 3d watching but I did have to
exchange accounts pulling data
information all the time about an hour
and a half ish of phone calls pretty
extensive web browsing and a lot of
YouTube viewing and I got through a full
day so hooray for HTC for doing a pretty
nice battery manage event processor
management something to bear in mind so
let's talk a little bit about the size
of this guy cuz this is not the thinnest
phone on the planet clocks in at 6
ounces and you feel all the six ounces I
do like the back sort of that rubber
feel to it hopefully you can see the
texture there phone felt very good in
the hand definitely feels high-quality I
like that there's not a gap between the
battery and the back of the phone here
sometimes when there's a little bit of a
gap you can hear a bit of hollow noise
not so HTC's build qualities absolutely
outstanding that's certainly true here
with the Evo 3d the design is fine I
like the capacitive buttons here on the
bottom matters
encapsulated in those circles very evil
like I do like to 3d to 2d toggle here
and I like having the camera shutter
button again
but I've already talked about how it
slices your finger so sort of bear in
mind I did test this phone for the death
grip as I'm now starting to do on all my
phones I did not have a death grip on
here so hooray your phone is not going
to be draining not only battery but
losing signal strength whenever you try
and hold it design standpoint otherwise
is pretty standard Android camera on the
back I do wish that it had the kickstand
sort of evil like but alas that was not
to be here I like the location of the
power and lock button the upper right
hand corner 3.5 millimeter headset jack
has a little bit of a hump right there
you can see it on the right angle but
nothing that's a deal-breaker
now overall if you're in the market for
an Android smartphone if you're looking
for a super phone with awesome specs the
Evo 3d is really the way to go it is an
absolutely outstanding device and the 3d
is just an added benefit is it would be
the reason I'd say go out and buy the
phone certainly not but it's kind of
cool to take a 3d picture and show your
friends like hey it looks like I'm
coming right at you it works it works
decently well it's probably the best
implementation of stereoscopic 3d that
I've seen of a Nintendo 3ds included in
that this is an all-around really solid
package and when I can definitely
recommend if you're looking for the
latest specs and the latest Hardware on
a phone that's really gonna last you
throughout your two-year contract the
evo 3d is a wonderfully fantastic choice
and definitely gets recommended so guys
hope you enjoyed I am John render from
