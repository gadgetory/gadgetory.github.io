with a viewer mail bag so for this round
of the viewer mail bag I've actually
pre-screened for questions these are all
recent ones that were asked within the
past week so let's go ahead and get
started the first one here is from user
submissive Dean he's asking about custom
banners question reads hi John I've
noticed a lot of your directors and have
custom banners up and I was wondering
how I could put up a channel banner or a
banner on top of my username in my
videos Thanks what's a very easy answer
it's actually a question that I'd get
quite a bit you have to be a youtube
partner in order to get the channel
branding features so that means the bar
on top of my page or the banner that
shows up when you're looking one of my
videos you have to be a youtube partner
I made a video a little while back about
how to be a youtube partner if you want
to go ahead and check that for
references so I hope that answered your
question submissive Dean all right the
next one we've got is from the skin
asking about battery life hi how much
battery life while you're getting with
your macbook aluminum so on my macbook
aluminum I always have the brightness
turned all the way up I hate looking at
an on bright screen I am Bluetooth
turned off and wireless always on in
this doing standard web browsing I
generally get close to three hours of
battery life which is actually just
about what apple claims battery life on
the macbook has been really impressive I
do keep it very well calibrated and you
for asking how to calibrate your battery
all you have to do is let it drain all
the way so when it starts to say turn
off your computer powers running low let
it keep running make sure you save
everything computer will eventually turn
itself off or actually put itself to
sleep once it's a nap mode plug it in
I'll it in charge I'll way back up to
one hundred percent so that goes from 0
to 100 to get really limited battery
memory so you have to get your full
capacity actually your bill to see how
much value if you actually have it'll be
a more fair fair representation of what
you have so I taken calibrator battery I
hope that answered your question the
next one moving light or wrong is from
Kevin McGovern 777 this is actually a
bit of a long one but it's a question
that I get quite a bit and it's about my
job and education hey John great channel
for starters that's not the point in
this message I'm just curious if you
have time to answer this and if you
could answer a few questions so yes I do
with time and I'm going to answer it for
you right now I'm 16 met the point where
I want to start deciding what I want to
do with my life technology really
interests me so what I was looking into
is i.t a lot something that really
started addressing me was management
whether i tier business but for some
reason I started to find that more
appealing but I was curious since you
seem like a very happy guy which I am
what did you go to university to study
and as I understand your graduate school
now and what are you studying there
lastly what exactly is your job a
position at the moment while you go
through graduate school I would assume
in order to get higher up Jen don't have
time to answer his personal information
that's fine out of any connections at
this point in my life and he goes on a
little bit flip the end of the questions
so actually I made a video a little
while back for inside John's mind where
I answered kind of what I do in my
education I'll give you guys a kind of a
brief synopsis so I'm from Southern
California but I did my undergraduate
degree or my university degree is those
in Europe and abroad call it at the
University of Rochester an upstate New
York and I'm California upstate New York
big climate difference but it was a
great school and I was really happy to
be there I got a degree in religion in
classics essentially was a history
degree and from there he wasn't sure
what I wanted to do I've always been
fascinated by what motivated people so
right out of school I tried to look for
something that I could use that sort of
motivational tool with I kind of had in
my head that I want to be an attorney so
or a lawyer so I studied for my lsat
switch are the entrance exams for law
school and do well enough to to get in
and I applied and my parents convinced
me before I went to law school to work
in a law firm for a year and I fought
them on it to the nail and in retrospect
I'm so thankful that they did tell me
that cuz i realized law wasn't for me
it's a great profession
was just too big a time commitment and
it was too big of an uphill battle and I
couldn't see the top of that hill from
where I was and I'm the kind of person
always needs to be be moving up and see
where you're going and see the next step
and it was just too hard to see that as
an attorney so I kind of reevaluated
what I wanted to do and I was fortunate
enough to go back to my liking of
finding my motivated people and I got a
job at the very bottom of an ad agency
this ad agency is actually one of the
biggest ones in the country they were
doing all the ad work for one of the
largest automotive manufacturers and I
was what was called a floater which is
essentially an assistant to the entire
firm I made appointments for executives
I would make airline reservations aiwa
mean I would do any sort of small job
that needed to be done it wasn't putting
my degree to good use I wasn't really
learning but I was kind of seeing the
bigger picture so I was fortunate enough
to do that for about three or four
months and ended up getting promoted a
few times before I knew it I was doing
advertising work for the automotive
company and it was a lot of fun and
really great experience I was living in
Los Angeles at the time and I'm from
Orange County which is about 45 minutes
down south I wanted to move back home so
I ended up getting a job at a fanta
technology company doing marketing it
was a small very small company with a
really limited staff so I was able to do
responsibilities and do jobs that really
go get a chance to do as a junior level
person since there's no one else to do
them I always volunteered and because
that unique experience I was able to
kind of rise up that ladder a little bit
it's eventually where I was actually
running the marketing department and it
was kind of at that point what i
realized that i was going to need some
more skills to run a business and run
you know one day my own company so i
decided that i want to go to graduate
school to get my master's degree and
that's what i'm doing right now is I'm
getting a master's degree it's called an
MBA and masters of business
administration from a local university
right buying a university of california
school so doing it at night doing the
videos and trying to
find my own way like the rest that you
guys are so hope that answered your
question need a little bit of history of
kind of what I've done for a job in
education the advice I can give you is
education is the most important thing
make sure you get your degree you might
not see it now how important is you
might say one epic biology I'm never
going to be a doctor it's not always for
you but it's how other people might view
you so if you're going for a job and
looking at your resume and they don't
see a college degree they might think
you don't have the wherewithal to stick
with something it just is a good
representative representation of you
that you can stick with something and
that you have a foundation to learn from
so that's that's my advice sorry to get
all preachy on you there guys the next
question is back to technology this is
about the iphone the next generation
this is from evan mixon john i currently
have the 3g iphone i'm going to upgrade
to the new one it's supposed to be
coming out in june or july i have 400
141 contacts on my iphone 3g what's the
quickest way to move them to the new
iphone this is a really easy answer
itunes take your iphone 3g plug it into
itunes sync up your contacts whatever
the new one comes out whenever that
might be plug it in hit sink and all
your contacts will be there nice and
easy so guys it's just a short edition
of your mail back i'm using my hands
locker in this presentation anyway hope
you enjoyed this keep sending your
questions and i will keep doing the
viewer mail been can't always respond to
all of them but i certainly do read them
so i'll see you guys the next one for
exclusive content be sure to follow me
