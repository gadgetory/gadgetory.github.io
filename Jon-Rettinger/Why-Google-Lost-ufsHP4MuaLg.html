TechnoBuffalo here the four of you for
you of the Android tablet that's kicking
off the honeycomb craze full review for
you of Google's first four in that world
the tablets this is in the Nexus 7
brands new 2013 Nexus 7 this is the
latest tablet to come out of Google it
is the Nexus 9
I love a good fight iOS versus Android
Samsung versus Apple Ford versus Chevy
Lakers versus the rest of the NBA and
those battles generally play out over
decades with one company taken one round
the next company taken another very
rarely is very clear-cut winner and even
more rare than that is a huge billion
dollar company laying down their sword
and saying I give up but that just
happened
Apple has won the tablet war Google
officially threw in the towel so I hate
to be clear this isn't the end of
Android tablets it is the end of Google
made Android tablets the Nexus line the
pixel line and anything that came in
between but how we got to this point is
a fascinating story and we call it the
iPad 2 April 2010 the surprise of no one
rumored for years Apple unveiled the
iPad which was essentially a giant
version of the iPhone and consumers
loved that they were bought by the
millions and the iPad was a success so
that model seemed to destined to
translate over to Android that's what
Samsung did in September of that year
the Galaxy Tab came out and that was a
larger version of Android on a bigger
screen in fact in some markets it even
launched with phone support so that's
what it was at the time was a giant
version of Android launched with Froyo
but Google wasn't set on Froyo or even
Gingerbread as the platform for Android
tablets it wasn't until the next year
2011 that we saw Android Honeycomb and
that was Google's response almost a year
after the introduction of the iPad
Google said here is how we envision
tablets to be here's our version of what
a tablet should look like so oddly this
tablet wasn't made by Google it wasn't a
nexus it wasn't a pixel was made by
Motorola and it was called the zoom with
an
and this was a big deal this is how
Google envisions the tablet interface
they changed what widgets do they
changed the homescreen they changed the
look and feel of the OS I remember going
into Best Buy to pre-order the zoomin I
was pretty hyped down as were a lot of
people it looked awesome on paper so
pre-orders came in I went to Best Buy
picked up my zoom I got home and started
playing with it and it was very clear
that it was not ready for primetime I
had more app crashes than I ever had a
new version of Android widgets weren't
performing as they should but perhaps
the biggest problem was it was being
dubbed as an LTE connected device but if
you walked the LTE to work
Donald did you have to wait several
months but you had to send the tablet
back to Motorola themselves wait and
then get it back and then LT would be
working that was not a model that was
built for success and Google to their
credit recognized it honeycomb was made
just for tablets and still goes on
record as the shortest-lived version of
Android ever but maybe that was a
harbinger of things to come
since honeycomb we never saw another
attempt from Google to make a dedicated
tablet OS after honeycomb and starting
with Ice Cream Sandwich it was always
that main phone os tweaked to work on a
bigger screen so Google was clearly down
after the zoom I'm going to call it a
debacle but a little over a year later
they answered and they answered big with
the Nexus 7 Rock and jellybean
this was the Android tablet experience
that should have been from the get-go
now I did work as advertised it was an
amazing experience
you've got giant widgets on a beautiful
home screen you got a tablet that
performed as it should and didn't have
to be sent back to get features to be
enabled and the unique thing about the
Nexus 7 was it filled a niche that
didn't exist if you wanted a tablet it
was the iPad at ten inches this was a
smaller tablet form factor before phones
got gigantic you could see having a
three and a half inch phone or a four
inch phone and
7-inch tablet were very complementary
and it made sense for a lot of people
including myself to use in Nexus 7 so
what started with the original Nexus 7
of being solid well made really good
tablets continued there was another
version of the Nexus 7 that was equally
well received Google went a little
bigger
we saw the Samsung made Nexus 10
incredibly well-received tablet I
enjoyed it I switched to it people liked
the Nexus experience on tablets so I
mentioned it at the beginning one of the
beauties of Android is that it's open it
can be whatever manufacturers want it to
be but that can also be a detriment
so Android works on different screen
sizes by various manufacturers and by
default it'll work it'll scale up and
down depending on the screen being used
and that was the case with the tablets -
whether it was the Nexus 7 Nexus 10
whether it was a tablet made by a
different manufacturer the apps would
get big or small depending on what was
being used and that sounds great on
paper but the end user experience wasn't
always so great who ended up with giant
phone apps that weren't scaled properly
and developers because Android scaled
itself weren't really incentivized or
perhaps didn't care to make their apps
be tablet optimized and the ones that
were was a much smaller field that we
saw coming from Apple and the iPad so
after the success of the Nexus 7 and the
Nexus 10 that's when things started to
go downhill for the Google made tablets
2014 the Nexus 9 came out and all its
own was a fine tablet continued the
lineage that the 7 and the 10 put out
before it 2014 tablet market was very
different the iPad was maturing there
was various other Android tablets
available there was nothing about the
Nexus 9 that stood out the experience
wasn't better than any other out there
it was just one happened to be made by
Google so if we move forward a little
over a year to December 2015 Google
shifted from the Nexus line to the pixel
line we got the amazing pixel phone so
it made sense they ultimately would see
it
so tablet that's absolutely what we got
with the pixel see but this is where
things got weird it's come out after the
fact and it seemed very apparent anybody
who bought one or used one this was made
to run Google's relatively new at the
time Chrome OS and Chrome OS still had
some touch components but it wasn't yet
optimized for full touch so Google
instead opted to put Android on it what
we got was an aesthetically beautiful
tablet than any user experience that
seemed half-baked so all these little
negatives started to add up to a much
bigger picture for Google but oddly what
seemed to really be the death blow for
the Google made tablets was Rome product
lyon the rise of Chrome OS will be
remembered as what killed Android
tablets it wasn't until almost the end
of 2018 October where we saw the next
Google made tablet but in between and
Google really started to cozy up to
Chrome OS and make it a full-fledged
operating system and we saw some amazing
Chrome OS products come out from third
parties we also saw Google make their
own the pixel book for example is an
amazing computer albeit very expensive
but one that gave an excellent touch
experience I love the pixel book I used
it I recommended it it was an excellent
end-user experience it was everything
that the pixel tablets before hands
weren't but the pixel book Walt did flip
around was more of a traditional laptop
that could do some tablet things October
2018 we got the pixel slate and this was
not running Android this is sort of what
Google always imagined tablets to be
presumably running Chrome OS that also
supported Android apps and in theory
this sounds like the absolute best
experience consumers can have you get an
amazing Chrome OS experience with the
incredible app ecosystem of Android it
is a best of both worlds experience and
on paper sounds incredible but like real
life sometimes on paper doesn't
translate what we ended up getting we
got a buggy slow experience that didn't
deliver on a promise to consumers
of an excellent tablet experience and
there are very few products that come
out in the market that are universally
panned and the pixels slate was one of
those products and about eight months
later Google announced what I think we
all saw coming they were laying down
their sword and saying we are exiting
the tablet marketplace plain and simple
Apple won there other manufacturers
still making Android tablets if you look
at their slice of the pie it's very
small compared to the millions of units
that Apple is selling all over the world
so Google is out of a tablet battle but
the war might not be over just the
battlefront might be changing with
Google exiting the tablet space they're
free to refocus themselves again on the
awesomeness that can be Chrome OS I
mentioned the pixel book and how good
that experience was they already told us
a sequel to that is coming with that
team focusing on what that pixel book
can be and should be the potential for
Chrome OS is wide open
we might get that experience that we
were promised the beauty of Chrome OS
the app experience of Android married
into one incredible beautiful form
factor so a lot of people out looking
for is it the answer to not having to
use Windows or pay for a Windows laptop
or not spend the money for a Mac laptop
you might get the perfect laptop
experience a little bit of tablet action
