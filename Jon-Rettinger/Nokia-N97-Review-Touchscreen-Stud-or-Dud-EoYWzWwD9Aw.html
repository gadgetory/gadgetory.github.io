the biggest and baddest hitter on the
block
it has market share dominance over all
its competition and when the market
leader releases his new flagship device
expectations are overwhelming in this
review we'll find out how Nokia's new
n-series device can take on these high
expectations this is LP from
TechnoBuffalo and welcome to the n97
in-depth review
hey and welcome back okay today we're
going to put the n97 to the test we'll
be taking a close look at the devices
hardware and software and we'll also be
putting the n97 through some of the same
tests and benchmark I recently put the
touch pro2 through I'll also be taking
the n97 on the road to see how it's GPS
navigation works with the software
included on the device we'll be taking a
look at the Symbian s60 5th edition
software and especially focusing on the
devices web browsing capabilities here
it is in all its entirety it actually
resembles the 5800 xpressmusic it's not
at all a bad looking device there I say
it looks quite elegant there's a chrome
rim around the whole handset and to my
surprise it looks fairly good on most
occasion I rather see chrome on rim of a
car than on a mobile device sure the
chroming on a phone looks good when the
device is nice and new but after a few
hits and some wear and tear the chroming
starts to look like ass other than that
the device has an unique nokia esque
look to it unlike my Touch pro2 which
people opt a mistake for a damn iPhone
the back cover of the device is raised
from the edges which will prevent the
phone from getting scratched up when
laying it on top of different surfaces
the cover comes off moderately easy and
under the cover is defined the 1500
milliamp battery beside the camera
optics we find the microSD slot and
under the battery there's a small hatch
for the SIM card so no unfortunately
there is no place to hide your small
liquor bottle in fact I assume the
engineers and Nokia ran out of space
when thinking of where to hide the
stylus because unlike the 5800
xpressmusic that came with the stylus
built in this device comes with a
funky-looking separate one sure you can
attach your stylus to your phone with a
cord but seriously
you probably don't want any weird
attachments dangling off your device
probably the main reason for not having
the built-in stylus is the fact that
it's really not needed unless you like a
doodle on your mobile device the next
feature I'll be covering is the system
seller the mechanism itself is quite
impressive the keyboard pops out with a
bang even though the angle is not
adjustable the keyboard mechanism is one
of the most impressive things about this
device the screen pops out so fast that
it almost shoots out as it to take
flight even my girlfriend was impressed
and she usually hates everything with a
microchip in it
the keyboard itself has only three rows
of keys the keys are not too bad and
evenly spread out even these fat babies
can easily press and hit the keys the
layout of the keyboard is pretty
standard excluding the positioning of
the spacebar which is being moved to the
right after composing a few emails the
spacebar seems to be placed in a logical
position and feels decent the n97
keyboard is very good but perhaps not as
good as the fibro creaky bird on the
touch pro2 beside the keyboard on the
left is a very functional d-pad which is
a nice addition to the slide-out pad
itself like other devices with slide-out
keypads the n97 is a bit on the chunky
side it's really only fifteen point nine
millimeters thick
which isn't too much but the device has
a definite presence in the hand
thankfully the device is quite narrow
which makes it a better fit in the hand
and for example the touch pro2
even so the device is quite thick and
you probably won't be carrying this
device around in your side pocket a very
distinct feeling I get when taking hold
of this device is that the n97 is made
for use the phone is entirely made out
of hardened plastic despite this fact it
feels quite sturdy in the hand you won't
be having to wear silk gloves when
operating this device and the phone
feels like it could take a small beating
but it's always a smart idea to handle a
650 buck device with care ok
ergonomically the device is just
appropriate sized for single hand
navigation every part of the screen is
reachable with your thumb
you
even though screens on competing devices
may have bigger resolution n97 makes up
for this with good contrast in colors
blacks are moderately dark and the
brightest whites are also be sipped but
I've said it time and again that on
devices at this price range it would be
nice to see an OLED screen which are
superior in every aspect thankfully
Samsung is coming out with omnia pro
later this year that will be equipped
with an Ola screen so let's take a look
at the hardware in more detail on the
left side of the device we have the lock
key slider enabling the slider will put
your device into sleep mode and lock the
device as well
when disabling the lock the device is
wakened accompanied by a small vibration
on the opposing side we have the up and
down volume keys and the dedicated
camera button when inside the camera
application the volume up and down Keys
can be used for zooming as well the
front of the device sports only a single
mechanical hardware button which is the
Menu key beside the Menu button are the
two touch sensitive answer and end calls
Eve's answering phone calls on the
device is simple enough you can either
use the touch sensitive keys which gave
out a nice vibration feedback or use the
touchscreen itself for answering calls
moving on thankfully on top of the
device nokia has added a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack I was pretty pissed off
that the touch pro2 does not have this
feature in my opinion the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack is essential because
there will come a time on occasion when
you need to hook your device up to some
external speakers to show off your Abba
collection or not you can also plug in
for example your high-end headset the
device also sports a pair of stereo
speakers which are located on the side
of the device and while we're here let's
give the speakers a world
nothing too amazing but sound quality is
decent the device comes with a whopping
32 gigabytes of storage space dare I say
overkill but if you happen to run out of
memory you can always add another 32
gigabytes with a microSD card okay let's
move on and take a look at the user
interface the Symbian s60 operating
system is back for the fifth edition and
I have to say off the bat that compared
to you is like 86 touchflo 3d the
Symbian interface is starting to look a
bit aged don't get me wrong the Symbian
operating system is not bad it's very
simple to use and good in plenty of
aspects but when putting the UI
side-by-side with the modern competing
UI the Symbian looks like something out
of a cave painting it could be the Nokia
decided to stick with the old Symbian
because the hardware inside ncage device
which probably can't handle a heavier
interface even though the Symbian s60
5th edition runs smoothly with the
device's Hardware there are times when
it could run a bit faster screen
rotation on the device is also quite
fast there's not much of a delay when
opening the QWERTY keypad the AR M
processor handles programs with ease and
you can have simultaneous applications
open at the same time pressing and
holding the Menu button will give you
access to these open programs the home
screen is widget based which means you
can add your favorite programs to your
homescreen to suit your everyday needs
on the top of the home screen we have
the clock the date and the status icons
which are not adjustable but underneath
these icons are five adjustable widget
slots the default widgets are pretty
useful in the top slot we have quick
launch icons for composing messages the
web browser the navigation application
and the media player the second slot is
occupied by the weather application and
it's actually one of the best weather
applications I've come across a queue
where the widget gets you hourly weather
updates on your current location and
finally we have some nice weather
too bad I'm stuck at the office making
this review the Facebook widget on the
home screen works well also you can
actually have the newest status update
scrolling on your home screen because
it's always good to know when your
friends are off to buy milk or brushing
their teeth
under the Facebook widget you can add
your favorite contacts or not as default
the lowest slot is occupied by the email
widget on the icon itself you can see
headers of the two newest emails and
pressing the icon will get you to the
email application the email application
works well and composing emails with the
QWERTY keyboard is delight typing with
the n97 QWERTY keyboard is very fast
although not quite as fast as typing
with the touch pro2 keyboard it would
have also been nice to see a dedicated
row of keys for the numbers customizing
your home screen is a walk in the park
removing and adding programs is a simple
process
there's about a dozen widgets to choose
from and more witness can be downloaded
from the new Nokia Obi store
the Obie store is Nokia's new
application store where you can find a
variety of stuff spanning from a free
wallpapers to all kind of application
you can buy the calendar application on
the Symbian is pretty basic nothing too
fancy but it's fast and easy to use and
gets the job done
a slight disappointment on the device is
the YouTube application or lack thereof
it the YouTube icon in the application
menu is a bit deceiving pressing it only
links you to the YouTube mobile web site
so it's not exactly a dedicated YouTube
application you see on other devices but
you can always download the third-party
YouTube application made for Symbian s60
so it's not too big of a deal in the
other hand the Symbian web browser was a
very positive surprise the browser works
well and scrolling and zooming within
pages is smooth and fast the Symbian
browser works well in both landscape and
portrait mode the big screen on the n97
is ideal for web browsing most of the
time you won't even have to zoom in to
read text but in certain circumstances
you want to get in nice and close and
zooming in is done by double tapping the
screen loading times for content-heavy
sites on the Symbian are about the same
for example when loading with Opera
Mobile on a windows mobile device
navigation on the web browser is done by
using the touch screen there's also a
very good alternative this if you prefer
not to grease up your screen on the left
side of the courtesy board is the d-pad
which works great with the web browser
when comparing the two navigation
methods I personally prefer using a
d-pad it's fast and accurate and doesn't
smudge up the screen all in all I'm
quite pleased with the performance of
the Symbian web browser it's relatively
fast and seems to be stable which is a
factor when dealing with mobile web
browsers
the camera application on the n97
launches with haste the five megapixel
camera on the back is accompanied by
dual LEDs LED flashes usually tend to be
on the weaker side so adding a second
LED is not a bad idea I took some test
sauce with the device in different
lighting levels autofocus and the LEDs
work great and the camera on the n97 is
one of the best I've seen on a mobile
device it takes very good pictures in
high light and the thing that impresses
me most is the camera takes very good
pictures in low light as well you can
check out my tests on full resolution at
techno review calm okay let's check out
some of the more interesting features
the n97 comes pre-installed with Nokia
Maps
it's a navigation program that uses the
built-in GPS as well as internet a very
cool feature in this application is the
compass function that rotates the map to
where you're going in practically
real-time
this makes the n97 a very good
navigation device for when you are on
foot for example trying to find your
favorite sushi bar while driving around
my car I noticed the GPS signal was not
constant and I also had some GPS lag but
the application got me where I was going
and I'm pretty satisfied with the free
application on the device as I mentioned
earlier the device comes with a whopping
32 gigabytes of internal storage space
so that's plenty of space for pirated I
mean purchased music and videos the
music player on the Symbian is pretty
decent albums are easily accessed and
sound quality's satisfactory
unfortunately I can't say the same about
video playback the device supports only
limited amount of codecs not including
DivX xvid
and h.264 which are probably the most
common formats around these days so if
your entire video catalogue is in DivX
you're pretty much screwed unless you
want to convert your entire catalogue
into 3gp format I could not get core
player or DivX mobile to work with the
device because they are yet not
supported by Symbian s60 5th edition
eventually these formats probably will
be supported but for now DivX is a no-go
but the format's the n97 does support it
plays with ease excluding flash video
which is quite the slide show for my
benchmark video I'll be using the
trailer for a movie called 2012 I was
pretty excited when
I saw the first teaser for the movie but
after discovering that roland emmerich
is directing the movie my expectations
aren't too high his last movie 10,000 BC
was the worst piece of shit I've ever
seen I mean it was so bad that I almost
cried but I actually did like
Independence Day though anyways the
picture quality on the n97 is pretty
decent colors and contrast are very good
and the screen resolution is quite
adequate for video playback the n97
doesn't even skip a beat when playing
the 3gp format at relatively high bit
rates even though the image quality on
the 3gb format may not be perfect it is
still a very decent format for mobile
devices I was quite impressed to see
that the n97 could handle the format at
7000 kilobytes per second even though I
am unimpressed by the lack of supported
codecs I am impressed by how well the
device plays the codecs it does support
in conclusion the n97 is quite a mixed
bag external features in build quality
are excellent I'm still impressed by the
keypad mechanism and the QWERTY keyboard
itself but the Symbian operating system
may be a bit too old-school for my taste
but it works okay and the Symbian
browser was not bad at all is it a
perfect device by all means no it has a
few flaws here and there but I thought
the n97 is definitely a viable upgrade
for Nokia fans the new n-series device
arrived with the highest of expectations
and all things considered the n97 was
able to handle most of it so that's
pretty much it for my review thanks for
watching and get ready for some more
very exciting content to come from
