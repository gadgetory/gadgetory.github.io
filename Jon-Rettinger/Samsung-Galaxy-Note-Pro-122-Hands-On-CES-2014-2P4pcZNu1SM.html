technobuffalo reporting from CES 2014
we're taking a look at the samsung
galaxy notepro 12.1 this is the latest
in the Galaxy Note series you've got the
new magazine you x which has a little
bit of a Windows 8.1 feel to it but it
does have a new trick up its sleeve if
you want to run up to four apps at a
time you just simply go in here you're
going to open up one app then bring out
the tray again let's say you want to
look at gmail at the same time you can
then have both of them open you can drag
it so that you can resize to whichever
one you feel is more important as I said
you can do up to four of these at a time
but it's going to be a little bit rough
to try to manage all four of them at
once now the 12.1 interface error screen
size is a little odd it's great in
landscape the portrait is going to be a
little awkward it's going to be about
the size of an a4 piece of paper so it
would be you know you could see an
entire document on it but it's still
going to be a little awkward to hold the
keyboard the virtual keyboard does have
hectic feedback as you can see you've
got a full-size keyboard you even have
cursor arrows you have the whole deal so
it's going to be real easy to work on
documents but to give you an idea just
how big this thing is we're going to
bring in an ipad air over here as you
can see you're going to have a whole lot
of real estate this is definitely not
going to be a one-handed operation with
this tablet there is no release date yet
beyond the first quarter or 2014 and
also no price has been announced yet it
will be coming in both Wi-Fi models and
cellular models but we don't know which
ones are going to be where quite yet
they said they will have more
information that on that in the coming
weeks for now this has been a hands-on
with the Galaxy Note pro 12.1 until next
time we'll see you then thanks what's up
