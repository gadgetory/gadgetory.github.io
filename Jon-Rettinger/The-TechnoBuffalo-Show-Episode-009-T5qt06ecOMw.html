TechnoBuffalo show as always I'm your
three house for this week Shaun ani
editor-in-chief of the site I'm joined
by executive editor mobile Todd Hazleton
everybody and executive editor of gaming
Joey the ancient fear davidson was a
mouthful of fruit snacks ya got these
hablo and rolling on Dora the Explorer
fruit snacks right now okay so long as
you're up front about the factor Dora
the Explorer I what I had some left I'd
even show you they were like you know
like normal fruit snacks come in all
different colors these were just like
different shades of pink I have a
three-year-old all right and i also love
fruit snacks yeah same here don't judge
me so on this week's show we're still
gonna go with the original topics but of
course there's also been some news that
we will get to hear a little bit that
has a major impact on the show but first
off we're going to be discussing 4k and
if it's ever actually going to take off
and yeah i gotta say this when I was at
CES this year i was looking at all these
gorgeous 4k televisions and then i
walked around with ashley Esqueda and
she showed me the 8k television and i
was like but good but what ninety-nine
point nine percent of people don't even
have 4k yet can you Sean was there a
perceivable difference between 4k and AK
like a like a genuinely evil difference
there actually was there actually was
about it the 8k I got as close to the
screen as I could I mean I was like
millimeters away from that screen I
still could not see pixels wow that's
preacher as cool as that sounds I think
this is going to be the the direction
for today's topic um what what devices
are out
a take a right now none you are what I
mean sony I wrote a story last week
about like Sony's financial troubles and
just how their the PlayStation line is
doing awesome Todd correct me if I'm
wrong but the mobile line is doing okay
yeah it's coming back a little bit yeah
their pc line is in the can and they're
actually selling it their physical media
production line that blu-ray line is in
the can they can't they can't sell it
because it's just not even worth
anything anymore and their television
line they decided back in February to
just say screw it we're going high-end
TVs for kak here we come but the
PlayStation 4 arguably Sony's like
biggest and most successful product
right now does an output to 4k like if
it's Thompson 1080p so like why I mean
it I believe that that they're it
outputs digital video to 4k but like all
the games that people are buying it for
they're not in there stopping at 1080p
like why are we getting excited about 4k
right now i'm with you i still can't
even get excited about it but i
understand there's excitement around
seeing you know new format new TV shows
are coming out in 4k and like it sounds
awesome sounds futuristic but for me I
don't even I honestly don't care like
1080p is good enough for me and I think
the jump to 1080p was huge and and now
on my ass you know I feel like I'm like
way down in price I'm talking a couple
years from now I really not for me you
guys have seen 4k on a show floor
environment I have not because no game
outputs to it right now that I've seen
it at a show I'm sure that there are
some pc games obviously they do but this
stuff on the show floor is by and large
either console or running on a pc at
like a 1080p ish visual mmm is it is it
something am I gonna if I get a 4k TV
tomorrow okay and i have my couches like
you know the standard 10 feet away or
whatever am I gonna be able to sit here
and watch TV and think man that looks
amazing no not unless it's 4k content
right listen
lasam wrong Sean yeah and here's the
thing what a lot of people don't know
and I actually did not know this until I
went to the sharp presentation at CES
this year if you hook up a 1080p only
source to a 4k television a lot of them
it is not compatible mm-hmm now sharp
released three new lines of televisions
this year and I think it was the aquos
q+ line is their middle tier and it's
actually a 2k television that up scales
to 4k and is like 4k ready and can still
play 1080p you know content and the
thing was that it's only slightly more
expensive than a regular 1080p
television at this time that means that
arguably a good a good purchase exactly
exactly look for me but you know like
you were saying Todd I mean the leap
from 480p to 1080p was a world of
difference hmm and while 4k is crisp and
clear and gorgeous it's not as
discernible of a leap as that leap was
yeah this is this is the law of
diminishing returns that we see
happening in gaming all the time the
difference between the xbox 360 and the
xbox one in the PlayStation 3 in the
playstation 4 compared to the difference
between the xbox and xbox 360 is slimmer
mmm Super Nintendo next to the nes is
gigantic but then the nes next to the
gamecube starts to narrow the gamecube
next to the wii starts to narrow again
and wii u it narrows again that that
diminishing returns factor applies more
to the visual nature of technology than
our anything i can think of i mean it's
it's we're getting to a point now where
we're starting to improve subtleties and
nuances and i don't know if that is
enough to encourage most consumers to
cough an extra 5k up for a television
right and you know it's funny when i
look at the older tvs today and i'm
talking just like 34 years old the first
thing I notice is the change in the
bezels and stuff and how thick and they
used to be and
that to me is a bigger improvement that
we've come to these thinner TVs with
thinner bezels then you know the pixels
on the display sure I think it just
looks better in a living room and
everybody agree with that oh yeah I mean
some of the televisions I saw at CES
this year I mean the bezels on the side
and the top are so narrow that there is
it's like gone yeah they're almost gone
and so it's gotten to the point where it
is like a floating picture mm-hmm you
know a you could be happy to hang that
on the wall in your house but again I
don't think the difference between 4k
and 1080p is going to be make that much
of a difference I I do agree sheet i
think it's the physical design the
televisions that's making the bigger
difference right now yeah and I think
that's what kind of takes your breath
away at CES even you're walking yes
they're 4k TVs but they're also like 82
inches and you're like whoa you know
this is cool and it looks amazing
because it's so thin and all that so
it's this whole package I think that's
really compelling to me maybe not so
much the actual panel I think what we're
seeing right now and what I think has me
kind of wary of 4k is the same thing
that had me wary of smart TVs and 3d TVs
and everything else TV manufacturers are
starting to struggle to come up with
ways to sell you televisions right if if
you look at them that for the longest
time the biggest way to sell a new TV
was display size well then it became
rear projection versus tube televisions
then it became plasma vs rear projection
and it became ltd vs. plasmid and
there's this whole oil ed argument going
on right now it it seems to me that that
the higher end this stuff goes the less
of a reason there is for consumers to
switch and at a certain point and I'm
not saying that this is the case with 4k
but I am saying that at a certain point
TV manufacturers are going to start to
go into basically snake oil salesmen
there the discernable difference between
the products is going to be so
negligible that it's just them trying to
meet their bottom line not consumers
trying to get the best picture that they
need in their household yeah certainly
it's like the price collusion thing to
remember they were caught we were just
reading about that the other day but
Samsung and others had been caught you
know
trying to set the prices of TV's so that
they were expensive I mean so that they
could keep the prices up so everybody
that we're selling expensive TVs even
though the price is for them to make
them were dropping right and yeah yeah I
don't trust TV makers I don't either fan
it away you the whole salesmanship of a
television is wrong I mean like show
floor mentality of televisions is that
it's just crazy yeah it's okay I mean
cars yeah the TV sections almost always
the oh I don't get much time to go out
on the show floor when we're at CES
because of how busy we are but i always
do make sure to walk through the TV
pavilion because that's kind of my area
of coverage and you you kinda have to
like every 20 feet you have to pinch
yourself and remind yourself that you
are in a show for environment right that
it will not look like this at home
exactly exactly did perfectly yeah by
sometimes paid two thousand dollars an
hour to do it yeah but best i'll come
out and do that for 200 bucks if you
wanted to yeah exactly oh that whole
mess a lot of questions about 4k so
let's jump into a couple of these here
we've got one from future game dev if 4k
took off and 1080p became somewhat
obsolete what would replace 4k in the
future well I think we already kind of
covered that it's there's already eight
k sets they're not readily available but
it's out there and at that point I mean
it you have to wonder if the cameras
would potentially burn off the actors
face the amount of nation it was
gathering the pitch is gonna change soon
guys if my point with that whole bit
about snake oil salesmen the pitches it
has to change that they can't keep
pitching consumers better picture
because it my mother can't even tell the
difference between 720p and 1080p how is
she gonna know what the difference
between 4k and 8k is I can't tell the
difference between SD and HD I was at a
restaurant once we looked up and just
because it was a big screen TV she's
like wow that looks so great I was like
I with the sea and there isn't yeah
there's a bit was an HTC vive with an SD
feed coming
Oh Oh my parents do it that's exactly
the point every time I go see my parents
I have to pick up the remote and
unstretched the image every single time
it's without fail I call it may just
have like a four by three image
stretched d hi mom hi dad where's the TV
remote I just waiting here the pitch has
to change maybe it's smart televisions
maybe it's it's gonna go the way of tvs
with with games in them I don't know but
that picture quality isn't gonna be
enough for too much longer yeah I know I
totally agree I think that's why we're
seeing so many television manufacturers
now starting to add apps you know and
making sure that like Netflix is built
in hulu plus is built in amazon instant
video and so on they're even giving them
dedicated buttons on the remotes right
you know so i think that's actually
going to be the bigger deciding factor
for a while hmm then what the resolution
of the television is now I Todd this
questions for you and I actually think
we know they answer this one from sahal
Raja will 4kb on tablets isn't I think a
sous is doing one yeah I think we've
heard from several people that what
they're moving there I mean if we've
heard they're going on phones they
should appear on tablets too I have to
ask again the big thing what's the point
Todd yeah exactly the big thing is like
sort of what's the point you know I
think to me 1080p is pretty sharp I mean
sharp enough I I have no qualms with
what exists out there now and then you
know with 4k you're going to be really
drinking up the battery life so right
now to me battery life is so much more
important than displays I completely
agree with that Todd the trade offer for
upgrading a display to 4k in battery
life alone is is a big enough mitigating
factor for me to never buy that device
yeah I don't know I feel like we're
finally getting to the point where the
batteries becoming better with the the
current generation of flagships you know
we have the Xperia Z 2 Z 2 if you live
in the UK the galaxy s5 HTC One m8 all
of them are doing fantastic jobs with
battery life and then we're
you put a new panel on it it's gonna be
sharper then we're gonna lose the gains
we've made like I don't I agree with you
that's not worth it to me and I don't I
personally and this is coming from
someone who did audio-visual like tech
and installation as a career for a while
before i started writing about games on
the internet um why used to tell clients
like your until you get a big enough
display you really don't need to worry
about resolution and if you put a hit if
you put a 4k display in this I don't
really think it's gonna be worth the
extra expense and loss of battery life I
really don't yeah didn't they used to
say like 720p didn't really matter until
you hit 40 inches at the distance you
sit on a couch or something there was
yeah I mean there it's it's all about
sighs and there's there's like a there's
calculators on different websites but
it's like you know okay so if your couch
is six feet away from your television
you would want a 32-inch television at
720p or whatever once you like above 40
inches that's when 1080p starts to
become a bigger deal right now we're
gonna go for k I mean unless at five
inches like a foot right that's that's
exactly my t wait like why yeah I guess
your phone in your TV but I mean again
I'm perfectly satisfied with 1080p on
the phone so I don't know why we need to
go further but ya know they can their
reason a couple more questions related
to 4k coming in here from Sasha Mahal do
you think 4k will actually take off or
go the way a 3d TV and the dinosaurs I
on price if it comes down in price it'll
take off because that's just you know
and probably to what Joey was saying
earlier we're gonna be marketed 4k till
we bleed out of our eyeballs and that's
why we're gonna buy 4k yeah and I think
3d was an anomaly in that nobody wanted
to wear the stupid glasses hmm they've
been trying to let 3d take off for
decades yeah in cinema at
home 3d was study or film history
specifically your American film history
and you'll find out that 3d movies was
something that they did in the 50s and
60s because home television was killing
theaters it was killing them so they
came up with ways to get more people to
say oh man the cinemas much better than
my house it has 3d like that was one of
those things it was a it was a pure and
simple gimmick made up to drive people
to movie theaters interesting that
there's no there's there's no reason to
have it at home I don't I don't 3d
doesn't make movies better I'm sorry
hurry I agree not make some annoying for
me right the first 3d movie I saw in the
theater was back in the 80s space hunter
adventures in the Forbidden Zone how'd
that go is the the only other 3d movie
I've ever seen in the theater was a
partially 3d movie and that was one of
the nightmare on elm streets okay but I
know I have not seen any of the 3d
movies for since avatar I I didn't see
avatar in 3d I'm effect I didn't see
avatar two lives on cable but yeah I
know I have zero interest in 3d at home
I have zero interest in 3d at the
theater 4k is there's a lot of people
that say 4k is a gimmick and I can
understand that line of logic but to me
3d is like the definition of gimmick
yeah okay is is an upgrade that may not
be perceivable to the general public but
it's not a gimmick and the technology is
actually there to make a pictures
quality better 3d TV in my opinion is
it's an unnecessary gimmick is my point
yeah I think they're two slightly
different beasts that we're talking
about here and I can see where people
would put them in the same category but
I think you hit the nail on the head
Joey 3d is very much a gimmick 4k is
just a natural progression of the
technology right yeah 3d whatever
no interest in an omni and remember 3d
phones awful and I guess Amazon's trying
to do that again Ron had one yeah we get
a bunch tits in as a profile picture on
the site really yeah it's a picture of
him holding out phone it's his 3d I
think it was three de veau that's
awesome future game dev asks will 4k
ever be as fordable as 1080p probably
yes yeah it has to be yeah yeah it with
any new technology they have to get to a
tipping point with the price where you
know they've got enough consumers
purchasing it so and I think 4k i mean
the the prices of 4k televisions have
dropped drastically even in the past 12
months yeah like I remember when LCD
computer monitors were coming out they
were like a grand for this 13-inch with
no viewing angles and now you spend less
than that for 50 inch TV at best buy you
know so yeah no idea if you look at what
flat panel monitors have done but that's
a perfect example of how technology hits
a tipping point and then it gets
affordable for everybody you just need
those first few suckers too yeah yeah I
know I mean you're welcome earth and as
much as I'm a sucker a lot of times for
early adoption I have not purchased a 4k
television because happen by haven't
bought a new TV in like seven years now
I got one through my wedding that's it
your wife lets you put a TV on the
registry my it's like a thing all of my
college buddies whenever one of us gets
married we buy each other TV because we
know the wife isn't allow us to I wish
my friends did that yeah it's been
awesome there's been three of us so far
so like our present everybody is going
on the latest TV that you get first got
an embarrassing lap dance also for me
comes Tasha Mahal what should be the
next big thing for TVs I think I already
said that a little bit I think it's
going to be making the the connectivity
of the television that much easier
be it Netflix Hulu Plus a 0 RR
integration of apps I guess yes yeah
that's what I would say apps are so
clunky now that's why I think LG's
probably doing something cool with webos
we saw that yeah I mean their own on
apps are horrible man yeah that's why we
need they're having their own operating
systems you know there's a couple power
by Android I haven't used them in real
life yet but i think you know when they
have their dedicated processors in a
real operating system that's where
things should get smoother i play a good
example is my samsung television at home
has netflix built into it but my parents
are more comfortable with using the roku
even though i mean switching input and
everything else and you know and and
getting to the apps is built into the
remote it's just so much clunkier than
the roku interface yeah yeah it's the
same i have friends that have a wii u a
specific couple as a wii u and and they
have a DVD player and a television and a
bunch of other stuff that has netflix on
it but just because of the UI of the wii
u it's much easier for them to pick up
and launch that and to do it inside the
TV mmm it's crazy when TV manufacturers
are selling televisions with this stuff
built in but it's it's done so horribly
that people are actively going out of
their way to try something else like
it's like I see that you have the
application there but it's crap so I'm
just gonna do it this yeah yeah yeah I
mean Oh to the televisions in my house
have netflix built in and both those
televisions have Roku's connected to him
yeah yeah mine has a built-in i don't
think i've ever used it yes use the you
know i would you I know you it's a
hassle how many different times you can
assign in netflix in your life yeah
exactly exactly let's see here uh from
saw Raja I'm sorry if I mispronounced
your name well sharp only be the only
one to have an AK TV or well other
companies could be actually it wasn't
sharp the headache a TV on the show
floor i think it was samsung you kind of
get lost when you get into a CD burner
but
die there there's going to be other
companies with 8 k's but it's I fear
it's going to be a good eight to ten
years before we see him on the market at
an even remotely consumer price hey it's
gonna be quite a lot i wouldn't even be
pondering aki just don't even worry
about it using samsung and sharp both
have them by the way miss thank you I've
got it future game to have asked a
question about can you find that one how
long will take game makers to move to
porque I think it's a good question i
think it's the the the threshold
therefore for a at 4 k's jump relies
heavily on the game consoles and the
issue is that right now pc game
developers could probably put out a game
in 4k tomorrow that could happen pcs
have no yeah they have no high cap you
know what I mean consoles the xbox one
and playstation 4 just launched if they
follow the life cycle of the playstation
3 and xbox 360 we are seven eight nine
ten years away from home consoles that
can natively output video games to 4k
were seven to eight years from that
that's wild to think about yeah cuz TVs
are in it we're gonna have those TVs
much sooner than that absolutely so yeah
we'll see we'll see sports and 4k will
see movies in 4k video games in 4k on
televisions unless you've got a pc
hooked up to your TV that's not gonna
happen for a long time yeah yeah bring
me if I'm wrong Sean do sports don't
they still come in both of you guys
through 720p a lot of them I have no
idea I stream all my sports from the
internet is not really was 42 1080p
Murphy and even experimented with 3d
sports but that doesn't last long haha
everyone did I wonder if you take all of
the money spent on trying to push 3d and
like put it I don't know into the Social
Security Fund how's that would would
like retiree
be well Shawn's gonna be okay but we're
out of it yeah you're welcome Sean keep
those raisins coven buds you have some
more money laying around in social
security now actually and the this is an
interesting point I'll I've never spoken
about this with either of you so I'll
see oh here you know what is actually
more important in sports broadcasting
watching a sports broadcast on your
television then the resolution frame
rate now your refresh rate yeah yeah it
there's a world of difference if you go
out you go out on like bike frame find
these cheap televisions are like oh wow
it's a 55 inch television but it's a 60
Hertz refresh rate yeah it's going to
look so bad watch anything that's fast
moving like you say a soccer game 120
hurts will be ok but 240 hertz refresh
is really what you want if you're going
to be watching sports well so yeah bit
me so i am going i'm actually i'm going
to skip the second topic that we had
about fake rumors because we're actually
the 4k conversation ran a lot longer
than I expected but there's another
story that came out just today I hear ya
that anybody that has listened to tech
on the range well no this is a momentous
day I mean even this show even the show
there it hasn't been in quite as thick
oh it's about to get thick Shawn but to
Pokemon remakes for announced today whoa
Empire no mega red yeah I'm still
working on the last two or the last you
know what I say yeah get your joy take
it away what what does this mean for the
world of Pokemon I don't know i mean
this generation people really love i
love groovy and sapphire in the Hoenn
regions probably my favorite out of all
the regions that have that we've done in
Pokemon uh so what is it again Omega
Ruby and alpha sapphire is that what
is you know it's exciting I mean just
based on the Box aren't alone it looks
like we might be seeing mega evolutions
the trailers and the press release say a
new adventure in a in a new take on the
Hoenn region so now here's my question
having never played any of the the
remakes now I know that x and y
introduced some new tools in the game
will those carry over to the remix or
will these keep the same mechanics
probably um typically with the remix
they're not just they're not just point
for point ports there they actually
carry in the additions at the series
admit if you play a lot of Pokemon you
know that a lot of times the evolutions
inside the game and they don't mean
literally the Pokemon evolutions I mean
the mechanic evolutions are typically
really convenience based so being able
to trade while you're anywhere in the
game instead of having to jot back to a
polka center like that was a big deal
stuff like that will probably be pushed
into these remakes so the convenience
mechanic changes will still be there
which is awesome there's a lot of stuff
about the old pokemon games that make
them not unplayable but harder to get
through the many ones i have a question
that actually goes into the top of we
were going to talk about with leaks in
the mobile space all of this stuff you
know these days is just leaked months
and months ahead of time with were there
any leaks showing this because it seemed
to me like a surprise today pretty much
girls Nintendo does it do this you know
Nintendo's another company they're an
iron trap man um typically their stuff
doesn't leak out in the state they
wanted to or or something big happens
though we leak down a little bit early
but that was like the last time I that's
really really happened this one they
dropped hints in x and y that that we
were going to see a ho and remake so you
play the game and you have an intimate
knowledge of ruby and sapphire and you'd
be like oh man that's a ruby and
sapphire reference and they referenced
it again and again and again and then
one npc was like you should color i
should tell you about the region i'm
from but you'll see it soon anyway and
that was
like a big like uh huh clearly
something's gonna happen it's funny
though and I wrote an article on this on
the site did you know in mobile we don't
have these kind of Joy's anymore you're
like oh I haven't seen this because
we've seen everything months before
their nose yeah uh swai III still like
Christmas the mobile industry they have
that anymore no we don't we don't sucks
I wondered Todd I I wonder if it's the
fact that they're there are so many more
hands i have to touch a physical III
understand yo game cartridges have to be
made or game discs have to be made but
they don't have to be it made as far in
advance but there there are so many more
hands that have to touch say an iphone
they go there there's the computer
graphics guys that have to make the the
schematics there's the people that have
to make the molds there's you know the
actual production line i wonder if it's
just because there's so many more points
of potential leak yeah i think it's the
thing that I mean these days we even are
seeing press images months at a time
it's like had we seen these pokemon like
the box art four months ago just
wouldn't happen I think that the
production happens is just so completely
different and the triple a shooter team
is 300 people and those 300 people are
300 people that are intimately working
on the project from start to finish the
team that works on a phone I mean you've
got the R&amp;amp;D team you've got the the
engineering team you've got the design
team got like they're so marketing team
the carrier stated ever yeah right so
there's a lot more links along the chain
that should and could break hmm yeah
fortunate I don't see it fixing anytime
soon either no do these plate do these
places pay for for rumors and leaks as
does that happen it does l yeah i'm not
paying but they do place them for sure
yeah i wrote an article on that once too
i mean i've even worked at sites before
we're sort of you have you know like a
marketing person come in they're like
hey no no i meant the other way around
it what the site is the site page oh i
think i was that used to happen a lot
more of i'm not
sure if it happens that much anymore I
don't know we sure do rumors every so
often a of somebody paying bounties but
well you look at like the gizmodo thing
where they paid for that iphone forever
right yeah and just for the record
TechnoBuffalo has never paid for a leak
and never will pay for ya I'll don't you
love it when you gotta know if you guys
get emails this is kind of off-topic but
kind of not where you get emails from
people that are just like hey we have a
story about our product that we'd like
you to run and we'll pay you to run the
story the other I'm just like no my god
i actually have a folder in my gmail
account my personal gmail camp from when
I used to work at another site and I
won't say the name of the folder on on
the show because we tried to keep it
clean oh boy uh starts with an A ends
with an S uh its people over the years
they've emailed me and God hey could you
go back and edit that one post you
didn't include our company and you know
we could make it worth your while uh
yeah yeah new no i i i i do reply to
those people and tell them that what
they are doing is completely and totally
unethical I don't even reply I just yeah
I've never replied I just deleting them
yeah uh ya know that not good I mean
after they take me to dinner and stuff
you know and that's definitely a topic
for another day that we should cover
about you know we we do get questions
about the fact that we sometimes have
dinner with you know people from these
companies but it does not influence what
we write in any way shape or form you
know it I think every writer has to be
able to separate what is done in a
friendly manner and you have to sit down
talk with these people and you all have
to eat sometimes you sit down and eat
with them yeah yeah I don't think I've
ever gone out to dinner with a PR person
from gay
that's just never happened yeah I it
actually happened a lot when I was in
the toy industry hi Bo they would take
me a dinner I'm like I'm still gonna
tell you what I think if you're lying
socks yeah I actually did that once to
accompany I won't say what company or
what toilet it was and by the end of my
show room tour the vice president ice
met me at the end of the tour I see it
already gotten back to him what I had
said nice he's like can we fix it I was
like no you're and it lasted 11 cycle of
release and there was never a second
series of that door line Wow yeah I
called it right back anyway so let's go
ahead and take some off topic questions
we got a lot of different questions
coming in here we've got one here from
rockster 103 do you think the upcoming
Apple iWatch might match the sales of
the rest of the I Apple lineup not even
by sales like because the different
units sell different quantities across
but I think I wrote an article about
this too i think the iWatch if it exists
and personally i think it does but I
don't know if it exists i think it has
the potential to bring wearables
mainstream sure um because i think it's
the brand and like so like I was saying
and I think a lot of people like my
family members that know that there are
smart watches out there sort of like
well is Apple going to do it to like
what are they gonna do I think a lot of
people whether they're fans of apple or
not just want to see what Apple does and
I think for that matter what Google does
now with the Google where although I
don't think Google where is something my
mom would ask me about for example i
think you know she's more inclined to
ask about Apple but I know III I
personally don't see it ever reaching
the same level sales as phones just
anyone's will anyone's wearables not
even Apple in particular right exactly
it's just it it's it's a it's a
need-based market and I can I guarantee
most of the market base doesn't need a
wearable
yep i'm with you i think that's right
yeah yeah no i totally agree with you I
think it'll do well I just I don't think
it's ever going to be you know we're
never going to hear tim cook on their
earnings call going we moved 92 million
i watches this quarter oh I bet we do
because we did I didn't nobody really
thought the ipad was gonna do that well
right and then all of a sudden I mean I
don't know but if it's really health
focus and it does a really good job then
people might be like whoa this is cool I
don't know a question from Sasha
biologist because I it made me chuckle
hey Shawn what about all those gold bars
that you get from google happen well you
know I'm redoing part of my house right
now and then you know I've got so many
of them now then the closet behind you
there yeah exactly that's what else the
curtains left flashy what just a huge
pile of Google and Apple gold bars that
are sent to me on a weekly basis yeah I
don't know what to do with them all
anymore you think it's desk is made out
of how do you i melted some of them into
a dog dish classics dogs yes I am ah as
well hey might as well yeah yeah because
I look like I have piles of gold bars
right right uh now here's an interesting
question from Rockstar 103 how long do
you think Apple keep going with the
iphone until people stop buying it yeah
I mean keep seeing record sales so is no
reasonable to stop the brand it is it is
synonymous with smartphone still in the
in the casual consumer side of the
industry yeah I I think somebody yo be
at Samsung or LG or whatever they would
have to come up with a phone that a was
as impressive as the iphone in and I'm
not slamming the phones from anybody
else and be have a sketchy a name
yeah so really we're the way that Apple
either purposely rapid accidentally
positioned themselves with their
branding leading up to and and after the
release the iphone is wild yeah that's
wild yeah because I mean as much as like
say i love my LG g2 you know I don't
think you're ever going to hear anyone
going around going oh and the g2's yeah
it's it's it's not it it's catchy yeah
you know yeah Apple is able to compete
in samsung still beating by sales by a
huge margin but Apple still compete on a
global level with its you know arguably
a single phone but a little family of
phones versus Samsung's huge massive
family of phones in Android millions of
different phones out there which is
really impressive to see ya know uh from
future game dev have you heard anything
about the next version of android yet
not really yeah no I don't think we saw
I mean we just saw the leaked sort of
icon pack but we don't know how
legitimate that was and then it
addresses i guess a lot of bugs right
which is what we've heard but i don't
know i mean um we also wondering though
do they mean four point four point three
or highest in that assuming point where
I've yeah but I think even for five is
supposed to be sort of you know
addressing bugs and some UI changes but
I don't know google i/o is going to be
really interesting i think especially
with project ara I mean it's supposed to
in the next version of android should
support modular based smartphones too so
I think there's going to be a lot to
discuss and probably how it works with
Android wear and all kinds of stuff yeah
it it's going to be interesting and of
course you know what will it be called
from oh boy I'm going murder your name
and I apologize in advance midi mubarak
i think and i apologize if i got that
wrong can Apple introduced I ouais I
s8 without the iWatch in June second
they could announce that i watch at WWDC
but not ship it out kind of like the
first iphone ipad and mac pro they were
not available to ship until a couple of
months after being announced yet to me I
don't well at least according to several
reports from people who are usually
accurate on it WWDC is not going to have
any new hardware the only reason it
would make sense though is that they
have a room full of all of their best
developers there so why wouldn't you
announce a new platform for them to work
with but if they're know if you know the
current rumors are saying there's not
going to be an iWatch at WWDC it'll be I
guess even iOS 8 and some of the new
features coming there are going to be
sort of pushed off later but hopefully
we see health book and stuff yeah Joey
re kind of addressed this one this one
comes from Tehran Sorensen how long do
you think the consoles will last yes if
they follow the life cycles of the
previous one six seven eight years I
think I think the only console that's
that's on the verge of getting replaced
is the wii u yeah it's just not
performing well not Nintendo even
adjusted their financial expectations
for the first time since the thing has
been out they expect it will only sell
3.6 million this year that's a horrible
horrible figure it's realistic yeah but
it's horrible so I imagine that Dale
probably put out a new console which
might actually be really good for them
everything about this a little bit and
it's it's if Nintendo puts out a new
console in the middle of the PlayStation
4 and Xbox one's life cycle they have a
big chance of running away with it I
don't know if it'll ever be able to
compete with those others but that's
where they are right now that's for the
xbox one playstation 4 they just came
out people are asking about when the
next one's will come out that's crazy
talk this relax a decade yeah basically
a decade basically a decade and the
hardware manufacturers want them to last
as long as possible so it's in their
interest to keep them around longer so
what
you were going over the Nintendo
quarterly financials today and you did
point out that one very interesting
thing to me about how much money has
been spent on R&amp;amp;D in the past fiscal
year yeah jump from from from what was
it 50 billion yen basically five hundred
million dollars to over seven hundred
million dollars and in a single year so
there's Nintendo suddenly putting 200
million extra into R&amp;amp;D and that's a
that's all money hopefully into
multitasking on the three yes okay I
would expect that that's all she wrote
for the 3ds and Wii U that they're just
kind of kind of live out the rest of
their lives in retirement communities
but they're both awesome systems the 3ds
is it is a killer system it really is I
just I have a feeling that they're going
to wind up putting out new ones soon so
now this question comes from s on e in
Kirksville Missouri uh he would like to
know uh does vanillish appear in their
fire no unless they get uh unless they
put become the current gen in there as
well which they could for the previous
gen gen 5 or 6 or something I don't know
uh it's just not Pokemon conversation if
we don't mention vanillish at least
thanks bud hmm I'm here for you Joey I'm
here for you I noticed uh we're going to
take one last question here and here is
a interesting one that applies to a lot
of different fields uh this comes from
the motion 91 what do you guys think
about google glass parts costing only
eighty dollars well i think there's a
big whoa alright maybe maybe they do
cost eighty dollars but that report
didn't consider research and development
costs two trues talking about and that's
a lot of money does the production or
anything like that i think sure we know
parts in most electronics are super
cheap that's how they make their money
up usually and I believe it I don't know
about some of the sense
cheers like the the actual uh the class
part that sits in front of your eyeball
I don't know what that really costs but
you can't you can't properly say it
costs eighty dollars and not consider
research and development which is always
taking into a buildin terials right the
research indulgent on something like
Google glass aside from the marketing
alone it has to be hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of millions of dollars yeah
so that just because it costs eighty
dollars for Joe Schmo to buy the parts
for manufacturers doesn't mean that it
costs eighty dollars to make exactly
yeah I think it's like you were just
saying Joey on Nintendo dropped over
seven hundred million dollars on RD last
year they've got to make that money up
somewhere okay now $1,500 I don't think
it's worth that either but I think
that's what right now this is first gen
it's not the consumer release and in the
prices expect you to come down right
yeah now but any electronic out there
you have to consider that part of the
price is made up by the manufacturing
costs you of paying the factory the R&amp;amp;D
costs the marketing costs there's a lot
of cost ya got for context counts sorry
yeah yeah I was just go saying google
also said that they priced it at $1,500
partially to keep it from being too
widely out there yeah because then
everybody buys it and they're like this
thing's bugging doesn't work it's crap
and I'm never buying it again and then
obviously they don't want that to happen
either it's not supposed to be a
consumer launched yet um but to put it
in context the galaxy s5 parts i think
we're like to 65 per unit and that
includes the manufacturing and stuff
like that so and i think the most
expensive part is usually the display
and on google glass obviously it doesn't
really have a that kind of display but
right so yeah and in samsung cells that
for what like 600 bucks unlocked so you
can see you around there alright so
