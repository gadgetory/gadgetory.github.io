to you by Ford
what's up everyone welcome back to
another episode of ask the Buffalo this
the show you asked me John render any
questions you got from the wide
ever-expanding world of technology up
this week got asked to Buffalo we're
gonna talk I owe a 7 iphone 5s
blackberry 10 and all kinds of tech in
between disaster Buffalo it's go and get
started our first user Tyler Burke
Tricia once asked or Burt trikha one of
those John I was wondering what you
expect to come out of iOS 7 under new
management
you think major changes will be
incremental or come out altogether
here's what I'm thinking for iOS 7 work
on iOS 7 probably started long before
iOS 6 was even released so do I think
iOS 7 is gonna be the big Johnny I've
version of iOS the answer is probably
not I will probably see that in iOS 8
but there's a big caveat here when the
iPhone 5s is announced you know next
October ish perhaps it won't be
announced with a new OS maybe it'll have
the current version of iOS 6 on it and
perhaps an dived up iOS 7 will come a
few months later that'll be the only way
I'd really expect John has influenced to
really sort of filter through and the
full operating system new features that
I expect or I hope that we can see I
would like a way to close all the apps I
hate having to go through one by one by
one by one by one it's such a pain in
the butt if you guys ever closed
applications you definitely know what
I'm talking about second I think with
Johnny i's influence we're gonna see
things stopped looking like extra you
look like in real life so the calendar
not kind that leather look and feel to
it I'm gonna see a much more stylized
operating system I also think we're
finally going to see some sort of
widgets on the home screen or an Apple
way to quickly show information right on
the home screen so whether or not it's
something like lie of tiles or androids
widgets like we're finally gonna see a
new redesigned home screen for iOS so
Clapp been a long time coming user has
149 Deezy asks hey john feasts on all
the previews of blackberry 10 so far do
you think rim can
bounce back or this be gibbehh I really
hope ridden can bounce back maybe it's
cuz they review a lot of phones but I've
gotten kind of bored with all the
devices that are out there right now
iOS has gotten stale to me even androids
got a little bit stale Windows Phone
even a little bit as well so I'd like to
see something new and fresh and I'm
hoping that rims got some in store I'd
like to give him the benefit of the
doubt they have had tons a time
Lord knows they've had tons of time to
go ahead and get that done I've been
working on it for years some would say
the better part of six years have gone
into blackberry 10 about a year after
the iPhones launch so I'm hoping they
can do it I'm hoping they got the qnx
code set and ready to go for a late
January launch I'm not overly optimistic
though but I'm hopeful so for the
BlackBerry feel out there what do you
think I know I'm looking forward to a
blackberry tenth the physical keyboard I
would love to have that glorious bold
9900 keyboard on a robust modern
operating system maybe that's just me
what do you guys think that's what comes
from Twitter at shiev Neal ninety three
asks at John four Lakers will they begin
iPhone 5s in the near future if yes what
can they add yes there will be an iPhone
5s in the near future we've seen the
iPhone 3G good guy phone 3GS the iPhone
4 go to the iPhone 4s and we did expect
the iPhone file we go to the iPhone 5s
as well I think will follow the same
path of minor hardware upgrades and
probably software upgrades as well maybe
you'll have some new Siri features maybe
I'll even get NFC or some sort of mobile
payments to sort of the new hardware the
phone's gonna look exactly the same as
the iPhone 5 I always recommend people
are gonna get a new phone every two
years get the first version either at
chop Allah 72 wants to know at John 4
Lakers galaxy s4 may be coming with an
unbreakable screen is there another tech
with this screen so the answer to that
is no there's no such thing as an
unbreakable screen no matter what
anybody wants to say so first of all
they're just rumors same things I'm come
out and said our galaxy s4 it's gonna
have a crazy unbreakable screen you get
through a house on it and it's not gonna
crack but presumably it'll have you
Gorilla Glass technology maybe Gorilla
Glass 3 perhaps we'll see at CES or
maybe you'll have some Samsung's own
glass technology go out and get a Galaxy
s4 for the faster processor for the new
operating system for the new camera for
the new look
the phone all those reasons but really
don't spend that much time worrying
about the glass but that's just my
opinion so we take a minute from answer
all the questions to thank our friends
and sponsors at board so there are a lot
of ways to make sure you keep your Ford
Focus Electric full of juice and ready
to go where you want one of the easiest
those take advantage of public charging
stations these are popping up all over
the country and can be really easy to
find using its ton of smartphone apps
all you do walk up to the station pay
for the charge in some cases are even
free plug it in and go on your way
charging into charging stage is
incredibly easy pull out the nozzle take
it to your car open up the latch plug it
in you're good to go
get plenty of juice making range anxiety
a thing of the past
is the Ford Focus Electric credible car
great drive and plenty of juice to get
you where you need to go so thank you
