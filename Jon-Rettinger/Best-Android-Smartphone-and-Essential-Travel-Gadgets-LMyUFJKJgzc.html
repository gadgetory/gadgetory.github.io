to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of ask the
Buffalo Umberto's John ventures to show
you could ask me any question you've got
from the world of technology and
sometimes outside up this week we're
gonna talk about the moto 360 what
devices I bring with me when I travel
some Windows Phone 8.1 devices and
watchphone would I pick if I could pick
any of the current flagships out there
that's a buffalo it's gonna get started
so first question comes from Edgar uge
gawa who asks it's not a secret that
Android wear is half-baked as a bunch of
flaws do you believe that moto 360 could
be different if so how could Motorola
make the Android wear experience better
concerning only software so first it's
not a given that's just an opinion on a
lot of people really love Android wear
we felt that it needs a lot of time to
get better so the thing about Android
wear is that Google releases software
for it and really not allowing any
customization options on it right now at
all so the same experience you've got on
the G watch think you're gonna have on
the gear live the same thing you're
gonna have on the Moto 360 though it
will be circular and have Motorola zone
watch faces on it doesn't that it's
gonna be pretty much the same experience
from the software standpoint so not much
they can do about it if you like Android
wear now you'll like it on 360 if you
don't then you're not gonna like it even
though it's on arounds very cool-looking
watch next question comes from our
friend Josh hey John when you travel for
press events what are the products you
most travel with the products change
from event to event or they're just as
simple as bring in your smartphone and
tablet and that's it so you see when I
travel I give the view editing on the
road have to bring my MacBook Pro I
bring a couple phones that kind of stuff
now I don't have to do the video editing
on the road I can just send it back to
our home office and Ron or Mark and
handle the video editing for me so I
think is my bag a lot lighter I'll
usually what I'll bring is make sure
I've got a cost internet connection so
I'll bring two phones on different
carriers usually it's either AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile or Verizon device that I can
tether with if necessary the phones that
I bring it really sort of depends and
doesn't matter that much I'm using him
as Internet devices whatever phone I'm
using it my time plus another device
I'll bring a backup battery usually when
the movies use pack something like that
or a juice tank something
got an external power I can plug in
necessary I'll bring in a battery pack
forever phone I'm using and that's
really it I've been traveling a lot with
the surface pro so if asked do any video
editing which usually I don't as I
mentioned I just be able to have it
tapped I can do a little bit more than
just an iPad and that's really all
bringing it up travel I'll keep it keep
it light keep it funky fresh the next
question comes from Twitter ads yeah me
underscore 630 net jump for Lakers have
you tried out Windows Phone 8.1 yet and
if so what are your thoughts yes you've
absolutely chatted 8.1 from the very
first day of its developer release until
now I think what Microsoft is done with
Cortana is absolutely awesome so first
the voice sounds like a normal person
doesn't sound super robotic you can
speak to a conversational you can learn
what you do and tell you jokes and do
impressions you can sing to you I think
Cortana's probably Brad say the best
Assisting going out there right now as
far as what it can do I think sort of
tosses depending on the day between
Google now and serious Microsoft
absolutely nailed it there Developer
Preview now as folders hello what they
did with the folders you also still get
the live tiles inside of the folder to
determine how big they are inside of the
folders and the location in the folder
the Microsoft did a really really
awesome job there in fact I tried to
switch to Lumia 1520 last week I use it
as a daily driver right through cheese
though with getting my pictures from
Dropbox on to the device took like 40
steps I was a little more complicated
than at the time for but I think
Microsoft sent a really really good job
of the software I think it's getting
very very very close to me a complete
even race as far as features with
Android and iOS stopped the questions

comes from Twitter as well at Giovanni
zero nine one eight asks at John four
Lakers feta cheese between
the m8 the g3 or the s5 is daily driver
or recommend which would it be so you
know I can have that option
I picked the g3 I picked the g3 90 out
of a hundred times I love the camera I
love the feel I love the screen I love
the speed I really love everything about
that device I think it's absolutely
incredible as probably my favorite phone
that I've reviewed over the past year
and perhaps they were phone ever so I
would pick the g3 ii it would be the m8
in third with BBS five the last question
comes from add little bucha a1 ass at
John four Lakers which a daily driver
right now I switch depending on the day
between the oneplus one and the LG g3
sort of go back and forth on those two I
love both of those devices actually
carrying two phones I've got the g3 on
t-mobile and the oneplus one on AT&amp;amp;T so
those are both of my daily drivers right
