day for me because i am going to be a
father my wife and I are expecting our
first child September 27th of this year
so really not that many months away she
is 25 weeks pregnant right now and I
cannot wait to be a father and I'm going
to be a father to a baby boy so we got a
future geek in the making perhaps we'll
see him on future videos I am so excited
I just can't wait to show him the world
I'm just to see him grow up and be a
part of his life I from the bottom of my
cart this is one thing that I'm so you
just I'm just excited about I can't wait
to be a dad it's our first child I can't
wait to be a father and I can't wait to
see my wife be a mother and can't wait
to be a parent with her so it a little
man if you're watching this video at
some point in the future be nice treat
people well and make this planet a
better place so next year father's day
is going to be very interesting Dave for

very interesting for me sep tember is
coming up super fast because you guys

excited to share with you guys I don't
