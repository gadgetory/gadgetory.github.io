TechnoBuffalo here at the unboxing of
the iPhone 4s all gussied up in white
let's go ahead dig in and see if it's
going to live up to the iPhone hype
alright take a quick look at the box
pretty similar if you have ever seen an
iPhone 4 box picture the device on the
front except now there's an iCloud and a
logo i phone 4s information on the back
this is the 64 gigabyte model of course
you can get it in three different sizes
16 32 or 64 this is with AT&amp;amp;T although
they can get it now for Sprint or
Verizon the unblinking Tauri big ol
knife hasn't quite made the trip to the
office yet so we're going to use the
surprisingly disappointing scissors but
there's still danger that there might be
blood so yeah alright let's go ahead and
cut this open kaboom and it is the same
phone interestingly enough now for
Verizon and for Sprint the CDMA and the
GSM models are one it's a global phone
alo software and your carrier is going
to lock it for you so you can't go into
a sprint store pick up a iphone 4s there
and pop in your AT&amp;amp;T SIM card it's not
going to work for you so take off the
box we'll do a little unboxing
striptease I would feel a little dirty
when I take off the top here alright cob
boom iPhone 4s look at that it looks
like an iPhone 4 go ahead and pull it up
and it feels like an iPhone 4 so I push
it off to the side for just a quick SEC
let's see what we're going to get in the
box
I'm guessing same stuff we've had the
cost couple boxes so here we are what
we're not going to have anymore is a sim
removal tool so you've got to use a
paper clip or a thumbtack or something
worked really well fingertips iPhone 4s
and Apple stickers yay everything looks
very white here we've got the power
charger the small one green sticker lady
no it's not going to explode and kill
you the same the 30-pin charger can
there that we've seen in the past so
that's their iPhone headphones with
microphone that's there as well push all
that business off to the side
iPhone 4s let's go ahead and walk
through it got the same stuff we've seen
in the past though now we've got the a5
process they're in there it's dual-core
supposedly clock at 800 megahertz on the
back is where some of the other action
is going to happen 8 megapixel camera
now that can shoot 1080p there is the
LED flash and the front-facing VGA
camera let's go ahead and do a real
quick comparison here with the iPhone 4
the GSM variant we're sort of patriotic
here with the red and white so the
antenna bands a little bit different
they match the same bands that we saw on
the CDMA variant so you can see it
they'll match there no notch there and
then these two line up on the other side
pretty close the same although the mute
switch or the profile switch is a little
bit lower so what I'm going to go ahead
and power this sucker on I'll walk
through a whole setup process and we'll
do all that good i phone 4s business and
fortunate it's all going to be iCloud
set up so nothing over the exciting to
show there I'll be doing a full
demonstration of Siri and the rest of
the iPhone 4s goodness that you guys
know and expect very animated with my
hands right now you can't see it so
imagine me waving my hands over my head
like a madman are you guys excited about
the iPhone 4s not excited do you care
not care are you hoping for something
different or you're waiting for an
iPhone 5 or are you Android all the way
leave your comments down below I'll see
you guys in the next video be sure to
check out TechnoBuffalo comm for all of
your tech news bye bye
