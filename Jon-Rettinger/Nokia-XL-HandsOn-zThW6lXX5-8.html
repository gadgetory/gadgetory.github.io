with TechnoBuffalo here in Barcelona
Spain checking out a new Nokia XL just
announced today in addition to the nokia
X which we were expecting and the x plus
which we weren't expecting so it's
similar to those phones in a lot of ways
and it's running this custom version of
Android created by Nokia so the goal
here and what they told us on stage
Stephen Elop told us that they're really
trying to push Microsoft services the
next 1 billion people who are preferring
Android perhaps over Windows Phone or
where it's a lower-cost device so you're
seeing Mix Radio you're seeing here maps
from Nokia in addition you'll see one
drive from Microsoft skype they're
really trying to push these services to
to the other markets where they might
not be used just yet also be BMO
Cumbrians pre installed on the device
you see that there so it has its own
custom store through Nokia and the Wi-Fi
is not really working right here so he
can't show it to you but you can also
side load a ospf so if you want to
install any specific android apps like
Instagram it should work just fine look
at the phone itself though you've got
the front facing facing camera up top at
a 5-inch display the largest of the
nokia X devices announced today and just
this one home button here that kind of
goes into this recent application area
or fascinating if you're heading there
on the right side you've got the volume
controls and the power button I noticed
there's no dedicated camera key which is
sort of something that's been on the
windows folks on the back of 5 megapixel
camera with the single LED flash
up top of the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack nothing on the left and then on the
bottom just a microUSB charging so
pretty pretty simple device but supposed
to be very affordable and it will be
launching in q2 around the globe not
sure about the United States of you know
there's aptopix a dual sim so we're
probably looking at emerging markets
where Nokia wants to get a foothold with
Android as opposed to Windows Phone so
interesting play here and let me just
actually before i close i'll just show
you how to use the interface you can
move these icons around notice there's a
little bit of sluggishness there but
familiar we've seen that sort of on Asha
and on Windows Phone and stuff like that
you just saw that notification pop up on
top there's a small shade there for that
as well in any case that's a quick look
here at the nokia X tell this is Todd
Hazleton from Mobile World Congress
