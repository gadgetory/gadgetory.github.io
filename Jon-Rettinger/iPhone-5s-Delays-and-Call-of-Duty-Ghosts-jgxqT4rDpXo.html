to you by Linda welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup the show we
take all the tech rumors from the week
and we serve them up to you on a tray of
tech rumor awesomeness up this week we
got a ton to talk about iphone 5s
delayed because of a fingerprint scanner
issue Verizon's Nokia Lumia 928 event is
expected to hit next month windows 8.1
is gonna bring back an old friend and
call of duty ghost has been leaked by
multiple retailers this is rumor roundup
let's start rounding them up allegedly
the iphone 5s has been delayed because
of fingerprint scanner issues last week
we published a report that claimed
manufacturing issues were forcing Apple
to delay the mass production of several
new products including the iphone 5s now
report from Rueter says the company has
indeed push its plans production from
June to later in the summer or early
fall the culprit for the delay is
apparently related to apple's
fingerprint scanner which is expected to
launch on the iphone 5s right under the
home button Reuters also said that at
least one parts manufacturing first the
company has poison apple because it has
such high standards a separate report on
Monday suggests apple returned five to
eight million dysfunctional iphones
pink-apple if they release another
product that's a sort of incremental
upgrade with a few new features I think
it's only gonna hurt the company's image
I say come out swing and bring back so
that Apple glory don't think the delay
is a bad thing take it as a good thing
that they're trying to get it right
Verizon's Nokia Lumia 928 is expected
next month smartphone has been rumored
for forever we've already been treated
to several leaked photos really show you
exactly you need to know if you're
hoping for some sort of awesome
ultrapixel age or their 41-megapixel
sensor got the wait a little bit longer
however bloomberg also said the phone is
made out of metal which doesn't quite
line up the leaked photos that suggests
it's built out of the plastic we've seen
on previous nokia devices Nokia's
aluminum smartphone is allegedly
codenamed the catwalk and his entirely
different device from the Lumia 928 so
who knows you've been enjoying your
touch
Green Metro you died up windows 8 well
supposedly 8.1 is coming soon it's gonna
bring back an old friend the start
button but supposedly this source
speaking to the verge claimed that the
buttons return will allow users to
access the Start screen although it
won't include the traditional Start menu
the button is said to look near
identical to the existing windows flag
using the charm bar the wider consumer
response to windows 8 hasn't been overly
positive you know it's very interesting
windows 8 they really tried to sort of
redefine the OS it was very difficult
for new users who weren't actually text
I picked up a new computer to learn how
to use Windows 8 so perhaps have that
start button there get people the option
to use a traditional Windows environment
still have that start button versus
using the metro or modern UI whatever
you want to call it could be a nice
bridge between the two different windows
experiences so ready brace yourself I
don't want to surprise you too much but
it looks like Activision might release
another call of duty this year I know
I'm surprised to a new call of duty this
year they just released one last year
this leak has been making the rounds
earlier in the week on gaming sites
around the net game is dated for 12 30
13 which is more than likely just a
placeholder date then Saavik izing was
leaked from target those are the release
day there is no vember fifth 2013 I
think the name change was brought on
because of a potential super awkward
alternative if Infinity Ward stuck with
modern warfare 4 this game would have
been modern warfare 4 call of duty 4
modern warfare but regardless new call
of duty I used to love the call of duty
game please to get them every single
year sort of all sarcasm aside they got
a little bit stale for me a year after
year after year so hopefully ghosts will
bring something new and revamp the
franchise give it a shot in the arm if
you will so what do you guys say excited
