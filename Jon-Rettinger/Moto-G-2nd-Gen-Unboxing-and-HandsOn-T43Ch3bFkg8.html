TechnoBuffalo here and I've got the
budget wonder this is Motorola's latest
iteration of the Moto G it brings a ton
of work to table at you ridiculously
awesome $179 price it's got open it up
take a first look so nothing too
extraordinary about the box is pretty
standard motorola fare just a little bit
about it and what's inside but you're
going to see what's inside in just a
moment so here is the Moto G push it off
to the side real quickly inside of the
box you've got pretty standard inside
the box things if you've got a wall work
which is not removable attached to a
micro USB cord and some getting started
information not over the exciting pull
is exciting is this guy go ahead and
peel off
satisfactory noise as you protectorates
go ahead and turn it on and run through
the specs that brings a lot to the table
for a ridiculously awesome price so
again 179 dollars it's gonna get you a
5-inch display at 7:20 so it's 1280 by
720 you can do math real quickly then as
a PPI of 294 it's quad core it's a 1.2
gigahertz Snapdragon 400 but you have
plenty of speed for it needed to do
Android 4.4 it launched they said this
will again support future Android
updates so shouldn't have any worry with
Android outcomes ouch it just be days
not weeks never that does happen a
megapixel sensor on the back two
megapixel sensor living right there on
the front
a 2070 milliamp hour battery and a gig
of ram again just for that awesome $179
price also a few other tricks up your
sleeve you can go ahead and pull off the
backplate like your clothes original
moto X let's go ahead and pry that off
your fingernail all the way around it
enough of a grip to yank that thing off
and you will see that now have
expandable storage slot which is a
really nice addition here to the Moto G
lineup so let's say you like different
colors better I've got a blue one go
ahead and snap the blue plate on the
back phone's got a really nice feel to
it it's got that little sort of dimple
right there
it also feels really nice though and
it's looking for a phone they're just
gonna work well you know I spend a lot
of money having that in Bucks just a
ridiculously awesome price support for
HSPA+ there's not LTE onboard here but
that should be plenty of fast or if
you're traveling you want to fun to
bring with you that'll work
internationally it's just a really
really good choice here I'll go ahead
and run into settings and see what kind
of apps here it's pretty standard Google
motos editions are just apps they can
always update those separately through
the Play Store I'll go and run into
settings go down to the bottom about
device and there it is Android 4.4.4
just a really awesome phone excited to
take a look at it test it in particular
