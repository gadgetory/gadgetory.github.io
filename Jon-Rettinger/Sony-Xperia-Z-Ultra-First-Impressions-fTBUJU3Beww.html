TechnoBuffalo here I want to give my
first impressions on this ginormous
phone this is the six point four four
inch Xperia Z ultra let's get started so
when I first heard about the Xperia Z
ultra I figured it was a bigger version
of the Xperia Z that waterproof 1080p
phone at least on the paper looked to be
pretty awesome when we finally got it in
our hands to review it was less than
spectacular that 1080p screen looked
washed out because of all the
waterproofness that covered the entire
screen just didn't look very good to me
the phone felt okay it was a little bit
chunky and I just didn't love it overall
taking this guy out of the box was a
totally different story
so if the Xperia Z ultra represents
Sony's move towards build quality moving
forward their future is really bright in
the mobile world this phone feels
incredible in the hand and really
impossibly thin for a device of this
size my worries about how the screen was
gonna look or completely put the rest
when I turn this phone on this green
looks absolutely gorgeous
1080p screams out beautiful on this
phone soon it's got all kinds of
proprietary technology put in here
Browdy engine and stuff to make things
look gorgeous the black levels look
completely black the whites are popping
video looks incredible games like
awesome video looking really really
solid on the big screen makes it awesome
for e-books this is probably one of the
best screens I have ever seen on the
phone the build quality again is
absolutely awesome the plastic back
feels like a glass well it's a
fingerprint magnet the black version and
just feels really great and I first took
it out of the box I thought the power
button
I was very oddly placed however I think
a power button at the top and a more
traditional place would have been
impossible the phone this big stepping
down the side made it really simple just
push it right where your phone is be
able to lock the device so no issues
there at all we're not gonna have this
for our usual two to three week test so
I can't cover everything
unfortunately device has to go back at a
very short loaner period on it but at
least in my couple days with it battery
like some pretty awesome that three
thousand milliamp hour battery is able
to go oh my god any issue but certainly
you might want to test that more
thoroughly
I've decided this a device that's right
for you there are a few auto missions so
here on phone this big
it does not have a flash not the flash
by Adobe that Steve Jobs hated I'm
talking like for a camera to use a
flashlight it's just not here which is
very weird to me so the big thing here
I'll just say is the screen size can you
live with the screen size and I'm
immediately loved giant phones I picked
it up but look you know what I think I
probably could do it I was able to put
it in my pocket I was able to walk
around of it then I tried to sit down
and that becomes a complete
impossibility no matter how big your
dude jeans are with the phone of this
size you have to take it out and put on
a table every time you want to use it
that became a little bit cumbersome so
for that reason and it kills me to say I
could not use this phone on a daily
basis it just became too annoying they
were too slim this down just a little
bit and shave couple inches off the top
there maybe instead of a six point four
four even a six inch phone this would
probably be one of my ideal devices it
is absolutely incredible I love the way
it look though the way it performed it
was really really really fast
Sonia's new skin is relatively light and
you left Android alone for the most part
I really enjoy this refresh icons
ability to put on some themes but for
the most part it's pretty stock Android
and I enjoyed that no more Timescape and
Mediascape garbage i letting android do
its thing
sony's got a really bright future if
this represents the direction they're
going I just wish it was a little bit
smaller what's up everyone its Ashlee
