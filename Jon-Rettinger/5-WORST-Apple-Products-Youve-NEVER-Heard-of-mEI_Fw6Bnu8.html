product successes you may not always
love them but people are buying apple
products in droves and despite them
teetering on being the first
trillion-dollar company they have laid
some gigantic eggs in the past some
you've probably heard of things like the
g4 cube the Pippin the trashcan inspired
Mac Pro the Apple Lisa and the Newton
while researching Apple's history
I found five giant duds most of which I
had never heard of some of which came
when Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple
and obviously weighed before he came
back so before I jump into the list be
sure to subscribe for more videos like
this and turn notifications on cool here
are your top 5 worst Apple products I'm
pretty sure you've never heard of number
5 the Apple 3 I loved the Apple 2 as a
kid my family actually had an Apple 2 C
and a 2e they were amazing made sense
Apple had followed up with the
appropriately named Apple 3 when I
launched in 1980 it was geared for
business so Steve Jobs and typical Steve
Jobs fashion was a perfectionist with it
and demanded the computer have no fans
or air vents to make sure it was pretty
close to silent sounds familiar to Apple
products now Apple has loved aluminum
since long before the MacBook Pros and
decided to use the metal for the chassis
but for some reason they didn't
accountant for the logic board doing a
logic boards do get hot so it caused
overheating and caused the solder to
start melting in fact it got so bad
every single Apple 3 that was ever
shipped had to be repaired coming in at
number four the Macintosh portable never
heard that name before so this thing hit
in 1989 four years after Steve Jobs was
booted from Apple this was their first
real tried making a portable computer
but it weighed 16 pounds and wouldn't
run unless the batteries at a hundred
percent and if that wasn't bad enough
guess what the cost was pause the video
and leave it in the comments
this thing costs $6,500 and you didn't
even get terabytes and terabytes of of
SSD storage number three the 20th
anniversary Mac so now Apple released a
20th anniversary Mac in 1997 or or Tam
this was mostly called that a weird
design but Apple tried to cram way too
much in it had a built-in TV tuner FM
tuner had a Bose sub and take a shot in
the dark where you think it costs it was
75 hundred bucks only 12,000 of them
were ever made and of that 12 thousand
only eleven thousand six hundred and one
rubber released to the public
so I pathetically be pretty damn rare
say a certain YouTube channel have to
have one of these odd machines just
laying around
damn did that much for a purpose and it
was a jack of all trades and a master a
master of none coming in at number 2
Macintosh TV or still waiting for Apple
to actually make a TV set they did kind
of try in 1993 just in case you were
wondering Jobs didn't come back in till
97 Apple was trying to bridge the gap
between computers and TVs which makes
sense but there really wasn't any
marriage of those two features you could
essentially just use the computer screen
as a monitor to watch TV that was that
was it you couldn't watch TV inside of a
window or have a computer window open
while you were watching TV it was just
one or the other the Mac TV costs 2000
bucks when it launched and it solved a
problem nobody was asking for Apple II
produced 10,000 these before completely
killing it rest in peace and before I
get to number one worst Apple product
you've never heard of how about an
honorable mention the Apple quick-take
this was just an idea of head of its
time the tech hadn't caught up to the
concepts which led to a kind of a
half-baked product there are a few
versions of this but it was really one
of the first digital cameras originally
released in 1994 the line did last on
the market for three years and if you
needed more proof that this came out
during a time when Jobs was gone the
quick take was actually developed by
Kodak and it cost five hundred and forty
nine bucks
it's expensive so there's been a lot to
choose from over the years the road
success is often paved with failure but
the number one worst apple product all
time you haven't heard of is the
Macintosh poor forma X 200 series I
actually fun fact had a reason my house
growing up and it was a disaster and
even I knew it then released in 94 this
was a turd wrapped in was like a poop
sandwich from the outside it looked
awesome
I had a cd-rom it was super slick inside
though is a totally another story this
is a computer actually started the
narrative that still kind of exists
today that Mac's are slower than Windows
PCs so Apple put a seventy-five
megahertz 64-bit CPU and a motherboard
designed for 25 megahertz 32-bit CPU the
RAM was a half for a third of the CPU
speed which meant it took four CPU
cycles to load a 64-bit word to make
matters worse or generally slower I
guess Apple I used an IDE drive instead
of a scuzzy making this thing an
absolute dud and starting decades of PC
fanboys flexing their muscles on Apple I
had a ton of fun writing this script
researching these products to find five
that I had really never heard of so be
honest in the comments how many of these
five or six if you count the honorable
mention had you heard of sound off in
the comments if you liked the video
please give a thumbs up it really helps
us out and again subscribe to
notifications on all the other stuff
that YouTube's not doing anymore and
makes this a until next time I'm John
