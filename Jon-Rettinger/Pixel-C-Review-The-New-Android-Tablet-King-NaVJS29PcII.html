the pixels see instead of relying on a
big manufacturer to deliver it's a
vision of a flagship tablet we will turn
to its pixel team who cut their teeth on
the gorgeous Chromebook pixel with the
pixel C designed in-house Google is free
to bring their version of a tablet to
life that vision is a work simplistic
beauty instead of fancy sham furred
edges and exotic materials we've got
aluminum in a monolithic slab design
which works well for its simplistic
elegance but simplistic elegance aside
what I buy the thing that's a question
I'm gonna answer Google pact is the
latest Hardware into this $499 beauty
it's powered by the NVIDIA Tegra x1 with
Maxwell GPU augmented with three gigs of
RAM either 32 or 64 gigs of internal
storage have been reports of some a
plaque but after a few incremental
updates since launch those are a thing
of the past year our review model hums
along but because benchmarks were just
didn't happen here you go
19,000 547 on quadrants in 90 3522 on in
2 2 6 0 1 which is fun to say and tooth
to the 10-point two inch 2560 by 1800
LTPS LCD screen is equally beautiful
colors a bright black slick dark and
over 500 nits it's super visible outside
but all is not monolithic roses and
chopped after the pixel see while it is
running the latest version of android
6.0.1 as it is filming the shortcomings
of stock Android on a tablet are
definitely starting to show the screen
has a very mathy sounding asset ratio of
a square root of 2 which is
theoretically ideal for cutting in half
maintaining original aspect ratio which
translates to being absolutely ideal for
side-by-side multitasking and probably
guess where I'm going but despite almost
every forked and skinned version of
Android supporting some version of this
stock oddly does not
I'm usually an Android purist for this
omission well easily overlooked on a
phone is go layering on a tablet Android
also still has issues with apps simply
treating tablets as just big ol phones
often resulting in odd empty spaces and
strange stretching the last oddity is
decision to move the multitasking
buttons the right-hand side it's weird
just took some getting used to these are
West cripples though are not unique to
the pixel see so if you're thinking
about picking one up just go in knowing
what they are if you do decide though
you want to get one
there's have a cool a few tricks up its
cold aluminum sleeve
I love the ability to tap on the back
it's a battery life it's implicit
elegance and is kind of emblematic of
the tablet as a whole should you have to
buy one though I would absolutely
recommend the seller albeit really
expensive $149 bluetooth keyboard it's
not quite full-size but close and Google
made the key throws feel really good and
I found it super easy to type on
function aside though it's got a cool
factor too it's a Bluetooth but charge
is wirelessly from the tablet itself so
you'll never have to plug it in it also
has the strongest magnetic hinge I have
ever seen gives it a really strong 90
degree angle other cool additions to the
pixel see are the four mics on top so
you can scream okay google TechnoBuffalo
sorry how to do it the speakers are also
amongst the loudest on any tablet I've
ever tested save for the iPad pro so
what I buy this thing I absolutely would
I really enjoyed using it during my six
days of it being my only tablet I've
long thought the Sony Xperia z4 tablet
was the king of the Android tablet world
but the pixel C dethrones it
it's got great battery life awesome
performance and just looks good knowing
it if Android tablet is in your future
you don't mind shelling out almost 150
bucks just a tab on the keyboard
not for disappointment so thank you guys
for watching I hope you enjoyed what do
you think of the pixels see if you
bought one you thinking about buying one
are you like hey pixel see you got a
dumb face I'm not interested look at
your thoughts on it nicely in the
comments down below
convene your thumbs up you always
appreciate it till next time I'm John
writing you from TechnoBuffalo see the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
