to you by netflix what's up everybody
ashley escada from TechnoBuffalo calm
here john is obviously on vacation he's
gone he's laying by beach somewhere
which leaves me to do read in jerz rants
I hope I can ran okay so I thought long
and hard about this and I think that
I've come to a really good rant I get
irritated by people who decide to judge
things like hardware software
experiences by their beta now of course
you could assume that i'm talking about
iOS 7 by talking about this but i'm not
just talking about iOS 7 this is across
the board i always see people playing
betas of MMOs or games and complaining
that the product is not what they were
expecting of course it's not we are
expecting it's a beta it's not finished
product and also even hardware is now
becoming a victim of this weird beta
bullying people were paying $1,500 for
google glass now the problem with that
is is not only you're paying $1,500 to
participate in a beta you're doing so a
voluntarily and be you know it's a beta
so why go out there and trash a hardware
product especially something as cool and
innovative as Google glass when you know
it's not finished this is the kind of
thing that makes me crazy in technology
over the last couple years we have seen
more and more people take to the
internet to complain about products that
haven't officially been released yet of
course they're not finished they're not
meant for a day to day consumer these
are products that are meant to be tested
these are things that you should be
writing bug reports about if you're
going to beta test a game a piece of
hardware or software you should be bug
testing you should be writing reports
you should be helping the developers and
engineers make the best product possible
so that when it does come out all the
consumers that you know are happy with
that product so if you ever get invited
to a beta whether it's for a piece of
hardware a Kickstarter something like
that oh yeah I think if you're a backer
you're still kind of getting a beta
product so it's
not officially released to the public as
of yet well technically this week it is
officially released to the public but
before then you've got to treat things
like a beta and take care of your
technology take care of the things that
you're backing take care of the things
that you want to see be great by giving
great feedback by writing measured
responses or disagreements to the way
things are designed I know a lot of you
out there are not super thrilled about
the new design of iOS 7 to which I can
only say that's okay that's your right
as a consumer but you have to talk about
it intelligently and if you're involved
in that beta you have to make an effort
let those engineers know what doesn't
work for you specifically not just to
say i hate this LOL it's crap because
that is not your job as a tech lover you
and i know that we're at the forefront
and so it's your job to make everything
great for all the people around you and
also if you make a good during the beta
maybe they won't come to you for help
when it breaks am I going to take a
second from all of this ranting because
it is exhausting to thank our sponsors
