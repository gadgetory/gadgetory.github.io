had a good new year this is my first
video of 2008 and it is a new unboxing
so without further ado let me show you
what I've got to unbox for ya this is I
move it down to you guys can see it here
the 40 gigabytes PlayStation 3 which I'm
going to be using as a dedicated blu-ray
player and then maybe play an occasional
game um the box itself is actually
pretty big um I can show you a
comparison here I've got my old Xbox box
here and maybe you can see the
PlayStation box is much much bigger here
um mark ever so um this version like I
said is the 40 gig and comes with a free
blu-ray copy of spider-man 3 I was
deciding to what blu-ray player to get
now that the HD DVD blu-ray Wars pretty
much over with blu-ray winning and the
ps3 is actually one of the cheapest
players that's firmware upgrade a lot of
players aren't firmware upgradeable to
the new profiles so I talked to a few
people at some of the big box stores
that's by in Circuit City and I'll
recommended the ps3 to use the
standalone brute blu-ray player so
figured give it a whirl why not I want
to play a game
I will so let's unbox it for you here's
my knife let's open this bad boy up do
it over here too and we'll see what this
comes with
this is also a full upscaling DVD player
as well for all your standard def DVDs
some of you guys know I had a HD DVD
player that I bought 100 bucks I got as
a deal I'm going to sell it to anybody
don't want some
so anyway open it up right on top there
is the spider-man 3s quits actually I'm
pretty excited to see like the special
effects but it'll look great in blu-ray
there's that we put my monster knife
over here okay the side top here tells
you how to take the stuff out of the box
if you're some time to read it have a
six axis wireless controller I think I'm
really going to use I'm not really going
to play games on it so much but there it
is if you guys haven't seen it it's got
a blue mini USB port on top to charge it
and it gives it like the Wii Remote to
you can actually turn left and turn
right for driving games and up and down
for other stuff it's got the gyroscopic
sensors built in hence being called six
access because it moves on six axis
these axes put that back see what else
we got in the box assume the consoles in
there as well
on the top here in this little part
looks like that is there some two
component cables or composite cables
I've been told HDMI cable I'm going to
use so not necessary a mini USB cable I
guess to charge a controller
the power cable I guess unlike the Xbox
the PlayStation has the power brick both
right install you need to plug into the
power cord which is nice it's that
little uh three pronged dealing um I
guess a penny were you depending what
country you live in
that's what we look like now for the
console itself take this thing out you
know I've always had a I never had a
playstation wall never had PlayStation 2
really never thought I'd buy a
Playstation 3 but all the features of
this console really made it very
appealing for streaming HD content and
playing plug blu-ray movies that mostly
figure also is probably got the highest
resale value so if I ever decide I don't
want to play movies anymore I want to
get rid of it I'll be able to sell for
more than I could I think that the
standalone blu-ray player here also at
the bottom of the box it's like you're
reading material user manual and stuff
I'm not really gonna open up or probably
ever read it so here's the console take
it out the cardboard shell it's actually
pretty heavy um surprise how heavy it is
and here it is the first time I guess
they'll ever be fingerprint free my
shiny new PlayStation 3 which I will
show you
here it is guys I can see it reflecting
my desk
um playstation3 let's give a little
quick overview of it here and again this
is a 40 gigabyte model on the front
you've got your slot loading discs just
pop the disc and no tray it comes out
and there's some touch sensitive power
button right there and a checked button
right there
it's like fans on the side and this also
has Wi-Fi built into so I don't have to
plug it in if you don't have a
connection so fans over there on the
back HDMI Ethernet optical audio and
gets us where your a component cables
plug in power switch and where you plug
it in and I guess also on the front
where I forgot to show you guys our
let's see we're over there two USB ports
so you can plug something anyway guys
this is the PlayStation 3 I'm going to
use as a blu-ray player I'll let you
guys know how it how it works how it
looks all that business and I'll do a
review for you guys um when I feel like
I know it well enough
oh also one last thing I almost forgot
I also bought the remote to go with it
it's a Bluetooth remote sorry it's a
little glarry there that's better
it's a Bluetooth remote not IR but it'll
control the movies like a standard
remote and I'll play pause slow next
chapter all that kind of business
so that should be nice anyway guys
that's it that was my unboxing of the
PlayStation 3 hope you enjoyed watching
and I will talk to you guys soon buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
