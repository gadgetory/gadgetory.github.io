guys in the next video alright guys so
here we have the Android homescreen and
the really cool thing about the device
is while most smartphones only have one
screen the g1 and Android actually have
three so on this home screen here I've
got some icons and a Google search and
if I scroll the write actually get
another home screen and I can drag icons
here or if I hold down I got a little
haptic feedback and I can add widgets or
clocks or anything that I like your so
let's put a clock there and I can hold
it down move it anywhere I like go back
and you can select icons that you want
on the homescreen if you find one you
want you could just hold it down and it
shows up by on the home screen go to the
right and you have another home screen
and you actually have the option to do
that one more time so three home screens
make it a very customizable experience I
personally enjoy having everything on
one but you may like having applications
on one screen clock on another shortcuts
or settings on a third really at various
on user experience so let's go ahead and
get started to walk through the software
so the first thing you'll notice when
you look at it is the strange little
arrow down there a little arrow is
actually one of the most important
features of the operating system itself
take your finger slide it up and it
pulls up the myriad of menu choices that
you have comes with alarm clock Amazon
mp3 browser which is sort of like
Google's Chrome calculator Calendar
camera contact styler email Gmail which
actually it syncs your contacts
automatically with Gmail that prompts
you to set up a gmail account or log in
to your existing gmail account when you
first turn on the device I am Maps
Android Marketplace messaging movies is
an application I downloaded
music my favs pictures pro-basketball
another one that I downloaded quote Pro
for trapping your stocks download that
as well
ring toggle which is a must-have I'll
show you that a little bit later
settings twit droid which is a Twitter
client for the device voice Tyler and
YouTube so we'll go back here and then
I've got a Google search bar you can
click it slide open the screen type in
anything you want and Google works so it
will search it for you so you may have
seen my browser comparison versus the
IFO let me walk you through the browser
here one more time now I'll just show
you the highlights of the browser
doesn't want to be selected there we go
typing at a wrong angle and I'm using
the devices capacitive touchscreen so
it's not resistive so here we are in the
home tree let's go ahead and search for
will do basketball since I had that
basketball application right there and
the keyboard is extremely usable and it
pulls up a list of choices I'll hit the
scroll ball into enter and we will let
it search just scroll down to search and
we are off so we've got nba.com that
sounds like a good choice we'll go ahead
and click that
and it's loading up on t-mobile's 3G
connection which is actually relatively
fast loading up and it's let me know
that I need Flash Player which don't
have right now let's go ahead and keep
looking at the browser scrolling is very
smooth zooming in and out is done
through these positive or negative
magnifying glasses so zoom out and you
do get a very desktop like browsing
experience it is very smooth and fluid
one of the cool things that this browser
has is in the corner there's four little
arrows if you click it no trouble please
select me right there one more time not
want to be selected there we go if you
have to tap it so if you tap it you can
move around and you get a little sort of
magnifying glass type things let's tap
it again and hopefully you can see it
right there on the screen I can move it
around anywhere I like to find an area
that I want to zoom in on let's say that
advertisement let go and it zooms in
right there it's actually a very cool
feature tap it zoom it on that flash ad
and there we go zoomed in and the
browser is very full-featured and quite
nice and if you want to rotate it get
the slide out the keyboard and it will
rotate device does have a built-in
accelerometer but it Ford fortunately
right now does not work with tilting
similar to the iPhone let's go back to
the home screen so like I mentioned
before you can scroll up and scroll
through your icons nice and simple I'm
sure you would have figured that out
what this does have though and is a very
cool feature is makes use of the top bar
for alerts actually take your finger and
scroll down and you get a listen
notification so if I had text messages
your emails they would all show up right
there in a list it's actually quite
handy scroll that right up and if you
want to see that again flick it right on
down very cool feature so let me go
ahead and walk you through some of the
things that you've got to have on the
device one of the annoyances I had with
the phone was it didn't have an easy way
to change profiles meaning if I was
walking into work or a meeting and I
want
to set the phone to vibrate how to put
the volume button down all the way all
the way all the way that'd be a little
bit annoying so I downloaded there's a
ring toggle program essentially what it
does pretty self-explanatory lets you
select your profile so say it to vibrate
and there it goes it's nice and set to
vibrate very quick very easy and
certainly very painless so the next
thing you guys are probably gonna want
to know is how does a stack up to the
iPhone compared to the App Store
well the Android Marketplace is in its
infancy but it certainly has a lot of
room and potential so let me go ahead
and show you what the marketplace looks
like as we're speaking about programs
that you have to download so you're
greeted with a very simple home screen
applications game search or my downloads
so we'll go to applique top locations
its queuing up right there and I'm going
to keep this in real time so you guys
can see how this will load over your
typical 3G connection so all application
entertainment finance lifestyle and
right now all applications in the amp
store are free so I'm very into the
social aspect of it so let's click
social and it sorts by popularity or
gain click a whole bunch of different
choices so here we have one for Saint
Mike's based mobile and it gives you
star review on it there it goes if you
love MySpace you're really gonna love
myspace mobile you can read some reviews
and just hit install and that is it
piece of cake so let's install it so you
can see what that looks like hit OK
access to the network
give me a hardware controls and it's
downloading now if I pull down a little
menu bar it should give me the
notification status there it goes
myspace mobile 0% 11% really shows the
speed of t-mobile 3G network is actually
relatively impressive so it's already
halfway downloaded and now it's fully
downloaded actually so I'll hit the home
button go back to the home screen scroll
up to where applications do we can find
it there my spit is mobile
hit the wrong button
there it is my space more and simple
login now as I showed you before on
different home screens let's say I
wanted to put that my space mobile icon
let's say on the blank home screen so
the one all the way over there right
drag that up go back to my space mobile
hold it down and I get an icon that I
can drag anywhere that I like and even
notice when I click the guy canal that's
on the home screen little arrow down
below - in the - a trashcan I can drag
it right to that build trashcan and it
will remove the icon from the home
screen it won't delete it will just
remove it remove it from the screen so
we'll go back to the home screen here so
it really does come with a myriad of
games it's got a Google Maps application
that everybody is very familiar with it
looks like Google Google Maps on any
device nothing terribly exciting there
it's got a music player built-in but
does not have a built-in video player
although there are third-party video
players that you can download artists
albums songs and playlists it's a priest
straightforward music player there are
some pre-loaded songs in here here's one
flight of the conchords big fan of them
so let's open that up click it and it
pulls the album information opens up the
song go and hitting a quick to avoid any
copyright friend here I'm not gonna be
able to play that anymore for you but
you guys can see what it looks like
album art some information about it you
can shuffle or go back I'll take a look
at the home screen here so overall a
felon device to be very usable the user
interface is intuitive and it's only
gonna get better with software updates
so guys this is John Rhett enger' with
John for Lakers comm just give you a
very quick software overview of the
t-mobile g1 and Android in particular
