technobuffalo here and i am feeling very
animated with my hands today we are
going to talk about the final
predictions and rumor roundups and what
have you for tomorrow's iphone
announcement which is actually a verizon
ounce minh but it's really no surprise
this has probably been the worst kept
secret in the tech world sends all the
first iphone in 2007 so this event is
going to be happening tomorrow which is
january eleventh two thousand eleven at
11a of eastern standard time in New York
hence the eastern Santa time because
it's in the east coast of the US so I
want to run down all the rumors and what
we can't expect well first we can expect
a cdma compatible iPhone of Verizon uses
a cdma network primarily which is a sim
card less technology so that's why you
don't see sim cards we really can't use
it unlocked ATT or tmobile phone on
Verizon really them the big question
isn't if Apple is going to release a
cdma kickball iPhone whether or not
they're going to release a 4g capable
iphone verizon has been pumping out
advertising campaigns for their 4g LTE
network it was all over CES in fact i
think they owned CES with their 4g ad
campaigns in fact i was using the 4g
network balls in las vegas i found it to
be really outstanding so the question is
is Apple going to announce a 4g iphone
and we can really look back at what
happened in 2007 with the launch from
the initial iphone AT&amp;amp;T was really up
and hyping their new 3g network an apple
decided against the launching a 3g
compatible original iphone instead
opting for a 2g or two and a half g edge
the only phone which is much slower data
and they did that because they said the
network wasn't mature enough to handle a
3g traffic turns out they were pretty
right on that one and also the battery
she had an advanced enough that I could
handle the extra battery drain that 3g
was going to put on the phones so here
we are in 2011 on a very similar
situation we've got a new network a new
standard for this technology interaction
with the LTE network similar what we saw
with 3G technology interaction didn't
make sense we've got a new data network
I guess would be K a better thing to say
which is also a difficult Lee a bigger
battery halt so how is Apple going to
respond to this well I think just
announcing a cdma compatible iphone and
just an iphone on verizon using their
evdo rev a now or could be big enough
announcement news anyway but I think it
would be at a reputation hit and the
detriment to verizon with the ad
campaign they've been pushing and all
the 4G 4G to see everywhere bombard in
you I think that make people think twice
about picking up the current generation
verizon iphone when a 4g compatible
device could be coming out soon and it'd
be a really big hit i think to verizon's
reputation now 4g their LTE network
isn't in a lot of metropolitan areas
it's not in a lot of rural or urban
areas either but it is growing very
quickly and there do exist chipsets
which use LTE and cma technologies into
one so we wrote an article a couple days
back on technobuffalo about why we
didn't think it was going to be LTE but
serve on some reflection in my personal
opinion is that we are going to see an
LTE 4g compatible devices a very
long-winded answer also I think we're
going to see is the return of unlimited
data on verizon itt put a two gig cap on
the highest tier plan they can be able
to use the verizon compatible iphone for
as much data as you would like so then
all you can eat all you can drink so you
can just drink all your data i also
think that we're probably going to see
the iphone be white on verizon or at
least the option to pick up a white
iphone i'm going to differentiate the
verizon model from the 18-team model and
speaking of differences i think we're
going to see antennagate put behind us
and we're not going to have that that
big flashing arrow that says do not
touch here is not going to be there i
think we're going to see
an iphone 4 that looks very similar to
the eighteen t iphone 4 including the
sim card slot on the side as LTE uses a
sim card minus the little antenna breaks
on the side of the phone and this Prince
approve interesting question as I kind
of be coming along with the video and I
got a lot of my mind it's my channel so
i'm going to talk about uh what happens
with mid-cycle so the iphone 4 on AT&amp;amp;T
is about halfway through its life cycle
18 tease phones are generally about our
apples AT&amp;amp;T iPhone that gently have
about a year life cycle been refreshed
about every July uh you know right now
here we are in January um so not that
many months away from would be a July
announcement of let's just call it the
iphone 5 so Verizon releases their
version the iphone 4 and AT&amp;amp;T is going
to put out an iphone 5 in a few months
are there gonna be two phones and
different life cycles that are going to
be out there is just a teensy phone
always going to be newer than verizon's
or maybe we'll even see announcement of
an iphone 5 exclusively on verizon or
perhaps we won't even see a new iphone
announcements on 18 to this year and
we'll have to wait till next July before
we get one when I'm thinking that we're
going to see is a verizon announcement
tomorrow and perhaps we won't even see
it shipping until July which i think is
sort of doubtful i think we'll see some
minor improvements i think will sort of
be the iphone 4gs over what we have
right now i think we'll see a relaunched
updated version of the iphone on AT&amp;amp;T so
the big question here is are you going
to switch if there is an lte-capable
iphone i would have a very very hard
time i'm not going over to verizon i
think a tech review or every like to go
to swap sim cards and such and the LTE
compatible devices on verizon while they
do use sim cards that's not what they
used to identify the phone so you can
swap out sim cards quite yet and test
different devices but I think having
that fast fast fast data would be a very
appealing proposition so I want to know
if you guys are going to switch to
verizon have you been waiting for the
verizon onsen do not care you say sick
about hearing about apple and verizon
that you want to throw up are you more
in this camp right here right there
this guy that guy right there the
verizon or the android guy he's eating
the TechnoBuffalo logo um are you more
in that camp and you're just waiting for
Android LTE devices I want to hear from
you this video became much longer than I
expected but you can tell I've got a lot
to say about it if you're still watching
thank you if you did not watch and then
you're not hearing what I'm saying now
anyway anyway i'm jon rettinger
TechnoBuffalo see you next video bye one
last thing that I almost forgot if you
guys want to chat iphone live
technobuffalo zone no kravitz will be
hosting a live show on our youtube
channel put the link down in the wet
havea to check it out at noon pacific
time so that's four hours after the
iphone event starts so it starts at
eight pacific time and this is going to
be a new pacific time so for time zone
you're in you can do that math but no
we'll be chatting iphone ever else you
want to talk maybe you'll be taking some
calls I don't know but stop and say hi
to him and suck some news bye guys
