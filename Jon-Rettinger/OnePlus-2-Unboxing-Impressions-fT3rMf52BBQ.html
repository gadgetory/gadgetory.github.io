technobuffalo here at that unboxing I am
really looking forward to this is the
one plus two I had a chance to go check
out a pre-release version of this guy
last week but now we've got the full
shipping box for you notice gone is that
kind of cool book look we had on the
original one plus unboxing the folks at
one plus told us that got to be super
expensive because we're shipping two
separate boxes if you remember the power
brick and the phone actually shipped
separately so we've got a more
traditional phone box here all dolled up
in red with kind of a cool to their 1
plus logo 1 plus 2 and some specs and
such on the back we have the 64 gig
sandstone black version though Samsung
black is going to ship on all these but
we are gonna have four other color
options so let's bring in our old friend
so your stabby this is unnecessary for
opening a box and I'll probably end up
bleeding on it but least is red so you
won't see the blood too badly I'll go
ahead and pull all that off and let's
see what we got inside a bit of a soft
touch feel to it so it still feels nice
this one came straight from some child's
I've got a little bit beat up on the way
from DHL I remember the original one
plus shipped with cyanogen this one is
shipping with one plus is own oxygen OS
oh this is oxygen OS two point oh we'll
do some more coverage on that as well so
go ahead and pull this up you got to
never settle slogan right there push up
the side real fast to you also going to
have inside of the box we have an
envelope for i'm guessing getting
started quick start guides but come on
how many phones are we set up now we
know how to set up a phone push all that
off to the side this i don't really
spend much time on cables usually
because usually they're just micro USB
but this is actually a USBC cable which
this phone is equipped with and we've
got data pretty cool red and white just
wallwork standard there but that is not
why everybody is here this is why
everybody's here the 1+2 let's go ahead
and pull this off the oneplus one was
our one of my favorite phones of last
year some hopeful that this can keep up
that mantle on first blush by picking it
up the phone feels much more premium
there's a much more weight to it aways
175 grams or six point one seven ounces
it now has an aluminum band around it so
it sort of feels a lot more
as well we get that cold metal feel on
the back this is the sandstone black
version but I mentioned there are four
other color options so that's I was
going through and setting this up you
notice that this is not your typical and
Roy first get the option to use either
software buttons or the capacitive
buttons down below they're just little
dashes if you can see them right there
so you got to remember which ones which
I'm going to go with software buttons
you also get gestures double tap to wake
up you can open the camera with a zero
toggle the flashlight with a V or do two
lines to draw music you can choose with
keyboard swiftkey plus emoji or google
keyboard I'm a purist enable shelf shelf
is a feature that's in beta we took a
look at it essentially it shows you all
the stuff you care about on the left
hand side of the screen but I'm a Google
now kind of guy so we're going to not
enable shelf alright so we got the phone
all set up which actually is a very
quick process and let me run through all
the specs you are looking at a 5.5 inch
screen 1080p 1920 x 1080 1 plus told us
they opted for a 1080 screen instead of
a 2k screen to make battery life be
incredibly good but we will judge that
and the battery left i just mentioned is
3,300 milliamp hours on the screen has a
401 PPI powering this guy is the
Snapdragon 810 it's a 1.8 giga hertz
octa-core processor 64 bit and one plus
has worked with Qualcomm pictures
running very cool but i'll be using this
thermometer to test how cool this guy
actually is when we do our full review
its oxygen OS two point O of base on
android 5.1 let's go ahead and jump and
take a look at that scroll down to the
bottom about phone Android 511 and it's
oxygen OS to point of the original
oxygen OS though we did seed launch on
the last generation 1 plus 1 rounding
out the specs this has four gigs of ram
in it which seems like a lot of RAM but
it's got it and so everything should hum
along relatively quickly two versions
are available this is a 64 gig version
there's also going to be a 16 gigabyte
version I which will launch later this
year but we've got the higher spec model
right here no external storage on the
back we've got a 13 megapixel camera the
camera sensor has been moved down a
little bit from to the top where it was
dual LED flash is going to be there as
well on the front we've got a 5
megapixel camera living right up there
in the upper right-hand corner one they
got a mission though on the one plus two
is no NFC I had a chance to talk to one
plus is co-founder Carl pay who said
that he thought people weren't going to
be that interested in NFC people not use
it that much on the last generation and
I thought that maybe something that
people might need with Android pay next
year so least I was a rationale for why
it wasn't better whether you agree or
disagree you can answer that question
with your wallet another unique thing
about the 1+2 actually has dual sims so
what that's going to mean you can pop in
to Sims and use data from one invoice
than the other or just have two lines
active at all times soompi that's
prevalent a lot of other parts to work
with and see much of in North America
left hand size device things are a bit
different than we saw last gen this is a
notification switch which means you can
turn on the priority or have on
locations come in or just kind of meat
everything a really nice welcome feature
one of my favorite features actually on
the iphone so I'm very happy to see that
on Android device on the other side
volume up and down and power button this
right here is a fingerprint sensor which
is a very nice welcome addition a 1 plus
claims it is crazy fast but of course
I'm going to test that and see how crazy
fast it really is on the bottom we've
got dual firing speakers and there is at
USBC port which does look so much like
micro USB we don't be mistaken it is not
top 3.5 millimeter headset jack noise
cancelling mic as I mentioned these back
plates are now totally removable so I'm
go and pulled off as you can see what's
underneath here you will not find a
removable battery though so don't hope
for one and that's how it looks like
nothing too exciting there but that is
where the dual sims are going to live
this is a bit different feel of the
sandstone material than shipped with the
original one I when I asked 1 plus about
it they said they're based in Shenzhen
China so they have access to pretty much
every material so they're able to find
an even better kind of more tactile
version of the sandstone it does feel
great with the back well it is very sort
of flimsy and plastic when it's put on
the device it's almost flush so it feels
still very premium have any sort of
indentation or any sort of give when you
push it in snap it back on well this
does look like pretty stock Android
oxygen OS to does add some nice tweaks
most notably if you pull this down you
can customize what's going to show up
here you can drag
to rearrange a lot of other sort of nice
things that have made the device easier
to use and easier to access from
settings but we'll run you through all
of those when we do a top list of oxygen
OS two point oh the pricing 64 gig is
389 bucks you're getting a lot of
spectrin or four hundred dollars if you
want to opt for that 16 gig version of
only three gigs Aram it's going to be
about three hundred and thirty dollars
so bear that in mind I'll be coming out
later this year but I imagine this is
the one most you guys are going to be
jumping on board with if you guys want
to see some other size comparison videos
we did at the launch event will link
those right here and put a link to them
down below and thank you guys for
watching hope you enjoyed till next time
I'm around your home TechnoBuffalo
taught you guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
