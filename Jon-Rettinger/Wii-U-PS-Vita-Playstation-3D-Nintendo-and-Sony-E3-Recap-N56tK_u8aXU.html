crabs from TechnoBuffalo calm I've got a
quick recap for you of the day's news
from e3 focusing on to the heavyweights
in the gaming industry Sony and Nintendo
big product announcements coming from
both of them Sony the newest portable
the NGP is now officially called the
PlayStation Vita reminds me of let dolce
vita not a gaming system but whatever
PlayStation Vita and then the ps3 3d
monitor very interesting with a unique
3d exclusive I think they call a unique
feature there also Nintendo finally
taken the wraps off of what was
codenamed project cafe is now officially
called the wii u and yes there is a
display in the controller and a little
bit of I don't know if you want call it
controversy but something a little
strange happen at the press conference
play about that in a second first off
you can check out all of our e3 coverage
over on the website John render is
actually at e3 today hopefully we get
some hands-on time with some of these
hot new products and report back from
the show floor and our man Jack has been
doing a bang-up job covering III from
afar keeping everybody up to date on all
the product announcements new games new
features all stuff going on Microsoft
yesterday so need to tend up today so
check out their coverage for sure for
more on all this stuff but to get back
to it sony playstation vita portable
device five-inch OLEDs screen capacitive
touchscreen super high res 960 x 540 for
on a touchscreen the device itself is
said to be kind of large but actually
feel really nice apparently it's it's
solidly made but it's lightweight and so
that sort of mitigates a little bit how
large is because the 5 inch display with
the controller to the other side that's
a pretty big device but you've got the 5
inch display on the front capacitive
touchscreen and then you've got another
touch panel around back on the backside
so kind of like the motorola kick flip
phone if a you know that phone touch
screen on the back and then you can
reach around for additional controls
that looks gross I shouldn't do that
additional controls on the back side and
then of course you've got your regular
controls dual amp dual analog stick
d-pad your four button array and then
your top trigger buttons
well and then all kinds of sensors in
the device the six axis sensor system
with a gyroscope and accelerometer and
also a digital compass you've got Wi-Fi
built-in you've got bluetooth you've got
GPS again there's an AT&amp;amp;T model that
i'll have 3g the u.s. pricing 250 and
300 for Wi-Fi and 3g respectively not
different prices for different countries
abroad as well launch date i forgot to
mention is towards the end of this year
holiday 2011 is what we're hearing but
then you've also got front and rear
cameras on the device so that just opens
up all kinds of possibilities from all
kinds of interesting games you know
regular controlled games games that use
the touchscreen games that use that back
back touch panel games that use the
motion sensors for you know steering or
force feedback whatever have you but
then augmented reality games could use
the camera that you know the outward
facing camera that forward facing camera
you can do all kinds of stuff with
screenshots or possibly video chatting
or even you know talking trash to people
with video while playing the game I mean
who knows I'm just making stuff up here
but a lot going on with that device and
it's powered by an ARM Cortex a9
processor with 4 cores so that's a quad
core product quad core mobile gaming
products a lot of pixels to push around
that screen but a lot of horsepower to
do it plus a separate GPU and apparently
from what I've heard from folks at the
show it's living up to the hype at least
in pre-production demo mode the screen
is apparently just gorgeous you know
some some glitches here and there in the
software but it's all just use tradeshow
stuff it's not it's not in final form
yet but apparently the screen looks
really really nice Oh LED known for very
very vivid colors that pop very high
contrast ratio so sort of lends itself
well to gaming you know ladies popular
display technology in the cell phone
world so I make sense you know that it
would be there on the PS Vita so
exciting news from sony coming out there
and also the playstation 3d monitor
that's pretty interesting this will be
out in the fall october november time
frame we're hearing and really seemingly
aimed at the college crowd given that
they on the show floor recreated the
dorm room from animal house too
College movie to show this thing off but
area it's a 24 inch monitor 1080p
resolution 3d comes with an HDMI cable a
copy of the game resistance three and
one set of active shutter 3d glasses you
can purchase additional it's 500 bucks
you can purse it purchase additional
glasses for sixty nine dollars each so
two players set up is going to run yet
you know close to six hundred dollars
with tax and everything and the deal
with this modern is that it's not just
3d but it has this exclusive technology
sony has some patents on multi-person 3d
multi-picture viewing and this seems to
be the first fruits of those patent
labors and what it is is you can have
two people playing and you can either
both be looking at the same 3d image or
you can have a split screen setup where
you each have your own image and you see
your image only in 3d so it's not like
some kind of crazy thing where you've
got competing 3d views going on but
apparently there's technical glasses
actually have a button I guess so let
you switch between viewing modes but you
can see you know either the shared view
or just your view in 3d ah sounds pretty
cool sounds like one of those things
like well split-screen gaming's been
around for a while on 3d games being
around for a while why why didn't
anybody else think of this sooner they
probably did that sony held the patents
at any rate again you know first first
eyes on reports from the show floor say
it seems to work pretty well we'll have
to see what kind of games were developed
for it and how oracle is actually out in
the wild and you know production
production run for Matt and not just
these one-off demos on a show floor but
kind of an interesting thing they're
building on that line of PlayStation
accessories the 3d monitor again you get
the Mater you get one game you get one
set of glasses an hdmi cable 500 bucks
and you can use it not just for these
exclusive you know these games with the
exclusive viewing mode but you can use
it for any 3d content apparently so you
can have one monitor using your
PlayStation use it for 3d movies you
know hook it up your pc all that kind of
stuff now back to Nintendo they took the
wraps off of what was being called
Project cafe the code name and now has
the official name wii u capital w I I
space capital u wii u it's their
next-generation gaming console it's
going to be out sometime in 2012 no
specific date
is given no pricing was given and the
deal is that the console steps it up
with an IBM processing unit multiple
cores from their power line apparently
it's the same process processor
technology used in the Watson the
supercomputer that recently went on in
one jeopardy so got some brains behind
it full 1080p gaming you know it's said
to have the horsepower right now to
surpass what a ps3 or an xbox 360 can do
in terms of just pure you know pure
graphics performance you know what we'll
have to see you know how that bears out
meds have it comes to market what rumors
there might be about the next-gen of
those consoles but no matter Nintendo
stepping it up full 1080p gaming you
know kind of taking that we think i'm
not a huge gamer but you know i have a
wii and even i know you know i love
Nintendo's quirkiness and i love their
gameplay and then they're so inventive
and innovative but the graphics on we
leave a lot to be desired so it's great
to see them stepping it up in the
graphics regard and then in terms of the
quirkiness and innovation I mean
potentially a whole new level here with
the controller the controller on the Wii
U has a screen in it just like all the
rumors say it's a 6.2 inch touchscreen
apparently it's not multi-touch but
single touch no resolution specs given
on the display but people in the show
floor said that it looks pretty good so
it's a 6.2 inch display widescreen 69
aspect ratio inside of controller that
has your standard thumb controls on both
sides so you've got dual analog sticks
you've got a d-pad you've got buttons
you've got more buttons on top you know
all the buttons you've got all the
motion control sensors you've got a
camera you've got a microphone you've
got stereo speakers you've got Rumble
vibration feedback in the device in the
controller you've got a sensor strip and
it's got a stylist so I mean literally
just about every form of input
imaginable you know like we were saying
about the PlayStation Vita it goes up a
notch with the stylus and the sensor
strip as well and in the demos they
showed off you've got all kinds of
different scenarios where you're playing
the game on the main screen and then
you've got additional information on
your touchscreen you know for
managing your arsenal of weapons or
seeing player stats or if it's sports
game controlling your lineup you know
power-ups whatever is you're doing right
so you can each have you know every
player can have want to do their own
thing or you're playing a game somebody
else wants to watch TV transfer the game
you're not playing the game on the local
screen the thing itself can't be the
controller can't be used as a portable
gaming device the games all get beamed
from the console to the controller but
apparently you can just you know play
the game on the controller so you don't
have to use the TV and you can take it
around the room they showed somebody
doing a Wii Fit kind of thing where they
were tracking just in the controller's
then have to be in front of the TV as
long as they were within wireless range
of the console where it gets really
interesting though is in demos they
showed that kind of split the gameplay
up between the main big screen the
controller screen and even another
controller because the the wii u will
support all legacy wii controllers so
they showed a golf game where the main
you know the golf course is on the main
screen the controller has the golf tee
on it set it down on the floor take one
of the wii controllers the wii remotes
use that as your golf club stand over
the controller line it up with the
virtual T swing and then you see the
ball goal go on the mainstream swing
anyway another demo showed where the
controller was a rifle sight snapped
into a plastic rifle you know accessory
and now you're lining up your target on
the main screen but you're seeing it
through the new wii u control there with
that six inch screen that's your rifle
sight you line it up so all kinds of
potential there for really clever
interesting games and the thing with
Nintendo again not being a huge gamer of
knowing this much is you know is it
going to be that the first party games
that all the good games are Nintendo all
the innovative ones all the clever ones
or a third-party developers really going
to take the system will intend to give
them what they need will developers
developers want to do it and really come
up with some really cool innovative
games for this new system that aren't
just from Nintendo not to say that you
know we don't want to see the the next
generation of the Mario franchise and
the carts and you know all the great
Nintendo French
sizes on the new system but be great to
see some some really cool third-party
franchises take advantage of these new
control systems as well so that's the
big news from sony and nintendo nintendo
the wii u with the crazy controller the
screen in it Sony's got the 3d monitor
setup for PlayStation and the
PlayStation Vita which is what the NGP
is now officially called sony stuff
coming out later this year Nintendo
sometime next year and a little bit of
see how sort of controversy I mentioned
real quick is that apparently during the
Nintendo press conference they showed
off game footage as part of introducing
the wii u they showed off little
snippets of titles after the fact a
Nintendo exec one on record saying oh
yeah those are our wii u games we showed
that footage is from xbox 360 and
playstation 3 there are no wii u titles
that are far enough far enough along
that the system is not going to be out
for a year how could we have any titles
but we wanted to show what titles are
coming so we showed footage from the
other console I don't know does that
matter is that a lame move because they
weren't upfront about it or is it fine
because they mentioned it afterwards and
you know those titles are coming doesn't
even matter I don't know just throw it
out there I'm just reporting the news so
let us know what you think hit the
website for much much more coverage on
all this stuff and then some all the
other stuff going on at e3 Microsoft's
announcements yesterday all the other
business going on let us know in the
comments listen on the website listen on
Facebook and Twitter what do you think
