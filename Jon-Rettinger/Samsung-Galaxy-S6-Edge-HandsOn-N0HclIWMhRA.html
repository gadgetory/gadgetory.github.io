Hazleton from Mobile World Congress for
technobuffalo we're checking out the
brand new galaxy s6 edge Samsung's
curved version of the galaxy s6 and
you'll see it's a little different than
the note 4 edge in this era the note
edge in the sense that it doesn't have
as drastic of a curve around the edge
where we had like about 120 pixels or
something like that on the note for that
kind of curved over this goes over both
sides and it's a little more seamless
feels like you're not going to hit the
edges so much as you did on the note
edge but other words you have really
similar specs to the galaxy s6 you got
the 5.1 inch quad HD display a 5
megapixel camera up top you have a 16
megapixel shooter on the back with the
heart rate monitor and the LED flash on
the right-hand side you have the power
button on the bottom you have the new
speaker it's 1.5 times louder than that
on the galaxy s5 micro USB chargers
ports up to really fast charging so
about two hours of video playback with
just 10 minutes on a bug or I believe
fifty percent charge after just a half
hour so really awesome they're 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and then the
volume control buttons on the left hand
side you'll note on some units to that
the should be oh I'm sorry it's up top
the SIM tray is up here on the on the
galaxy s6 it's on the right hand side
then you have the IR blaster I'm so
speaking of the sim we don't know yet
where this is going to be sold with this
kind of configuration what I mean by
that is under the hood we have a samsung
exynos seven series processor so that's
64-bit octa-core and that's the global
variance so we don't know if that's
going to ship in the US variant as well
under the hood you have three gigs of
ram 32 64 128 gigabytes of storage
you'll notice the back cover doesn't
come off this time so you're not going
to be able to add a micro SD card or
remove the battery so that's all built
in but the cool thing about the battery
is it supports both of the biggest
wireless charging standards out of the
box it's already embedded so you'll have
to worry about a special case or
anything like that just drop it on a
charger and you're good to go and again
you have a quick charge and then in the
bottom here you have the home button
which now supports touch finger breeze
sorry touch-based fingerprint reading so
you don't have to swipe it like you did
on earlier mod
which should be great for mobile
payments which is supported it supports
magnetic checkout counters as well as
NFC so ninety percent of retailers were
told support the magnetic based options
so you'll be able to use this pretty
much everywhere and you can see the
slight curves around the side of the
screen here and again just like on the
note for edger the note edge you can
swipe it to wake it up at see which
sides on there it is and you can go
through various applications you have
yahoo notifications and stuff like that
and then samsung also uses the edge
which is with this neat little feature
over here so you can have your most
frequently used contacts quickly tap one
to call them or send a message and
anything is you'll see these are
color-coded so when it's laying face
down on a counter it'll glow that color
along the edge so you know who's trying
to contact you a quick look at the
software here it's Android lollipop
running a brand new version of touch
with Samsung City got rid of forty
percent of the stuff that was in earlier
versions so it's a lot more fluid
quicker you're not sort of overloaded
with stuff at the get-go and speaking of
new features the camera the 5 megapixel
up top here is built to snap really good
photos in all light conditions and it
actually uses both cameras actually use
the IR blaster or I believe it's right
here to read infrared to predict the
kind of light that you need for white
balance and stuff like that so Samsung
is promising a really good colour
production in all kinds of features like
that and then again perhaps not a whole
lot pre-loaded on here milk video of
milk and the stuff that we usually use
SL and this will actually support the
gear VR to we're told so you'll be able
to load this up into the gear VR headset
that's built for it and take advantage
of virtual reality so really beautiful
phone here and look for it soon sometime
this spring this is Todd Hazleton from
TechnoBuffalo checking out the galaxy s6
edge
it's all your truth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
