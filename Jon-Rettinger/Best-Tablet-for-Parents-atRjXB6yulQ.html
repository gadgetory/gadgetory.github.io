brought to you by gamefly what's up
everyone what about the episode of retin
jerz riffs to show right talk about
anything technology-related that's going
on in my mind and professionally or in
my life and this week I got a good story
for you it involves my dad this is
written just riffs let's start riffing
so if you're watching this video chances
are i know i'm generalizing a little bit
you're probably consider yourself a geek
and if you consider yourself a geek then
your family and friends probably due to
which means i'm wagering that you were
probably tech support for everybody that
you know especially your parents my dad
for example is a very educated man he's
a very smart guy in his sort of late 60s
early 70s uses an iphone to be using one
for about two years so he knows
technology a little bit calls me about
once a month asking how to connect to
Wi-Fi or had a changes email password
sort of general dad type questions with
his phones and no problem there at all i
can usually can walk him through it we
went on vacation last week I was out of
the office one with my whole family my
sisters and their kids and my wife and
our son and my parents had a good time
my dad before he left said he wanted to
get a tablet I wasn't sure which one to
get he said hey probably like your
parents too should i get an ipad and i
said no hold on a second we had in the
office just so we're sitting around
kindle fire HDX 8.9 version he loves to
read use a kindle paperwhite thought it
might be a good device room to try to
use so i brought it with me on the trip
and of course i had the barrage of
questions that came with it how do i do
this how do i do that and i was like dad
it's got made a on it we've had a good
Wi-Fi connection where we were I'm like
click this button here's how you go you
pull down hit the button on the right is
made a and somebody will come on your
screen that will answer your question
and my ulterior motive was a I didn't
have to do it but also when I'm not
there he can just ask the question that
somebody can always answer them for him
you know I don't use in HDX every day I
don't know you know by memory had to
tell him how to change his name an email
out I could use a device and go through
the figure it out but I don't know
this gave him somebody there all the
time that could answer him so he went
through he did it and he was let you
just shocked that somebody came on his
screen started circling things for we
should click and he was just floored and
I told him dad they can't see you you
don't worry but he want to make sure he
was all kind of dressed up and looked
nice yes serve an old-school style and
was kind of fun to see it was like dad
they really can't see it was it you
don't know you don't know he got really
excited that he could do that that is
Kindles were syncing up so he could read
his paper white on the beach and pick up
the Kindle Fire he's at home and it be
around the same page you just like
flabbergasted by it so if you're looking
to get a device for a parent someone's
not tech-savvy kindle fires a good way
to go let me interrupt the story for
just one quick second and thank our

so I've taken a buffalo you're free 30
days so my sister's between my two
sisters they have two kids each and I
was sitting with my niece who's about
two and a half I was just watching her
on my own and sitting on the couch of my
dad's kid looks is using it was right on
the table and I want two entertainers so
I figured out watch them Elmo videos
with her on tablets but I went to his
kindle fire he didn't have a youtube app
so i downloaded one forum we started
just watching elmo videos when she was
done I just sort of blocked advice and
put it back on the table I didn't notice
my dad came picked it up again and
started watching youtubes and started
watching elmo videos we were eating
and he say he was going to come and join
us and I hear from his room Elmo I hear
like the elmo song going on it's very
strange because all the kids are here so
I sort of sneaked in to see what was
going on and he was sitting there
watching YouTube and then he just left
him alone then he kept watching YouTube
I mean for probably about 35 minutes I
went in I was like dad what's going on
he's like there's everything on youtube
I can watch the Ingalls concerts live he
was like news floored I haven't hair see
I'm just excited about technology since
he realized the internet could come
without wires he just couldn't believe
he's like did you know everything's here
on YouTube I was like dad I'm like I
know you know what I do for a living but
like that's what I do for like I'm on
YouTube he just couldn't believe that it
was there he was searching anything you
could think of on YouTube he's watching
tutorials I had to use a kindle fire he
was so excited it was like watching like
a baby deer take the first steps and dad
if you're watching I apologize now you
know how to watch youtube videos but
it's true it was absolutely incredible
to see so I'm sure you guys probably
have parental moments like this as well
and they sort of grasp you know that
like I can't believe they can actually
do this thing it it's crazy but if
you've got sort of a maybe not so
tech-savvy member your family kindle
fire is a great way to go because you're
not going to be tech support and amazon
has no relation to this video at all it
was just sort of my experience but being
able to use may date was absolutely
awesome and i didn't have to be involved
at all i know i'm not gonna get a
billion phone calls how do i do this how
do that's my answer now is always go to
mayday let them walk you through it and
he stopped asking me questions any sort
of learning on his own he's super proud
of himself which is which is kind of
awesome to see so if you guys have
similar parental stories I'd love to
hear them got sort of kind of crazy to
see them discover these things for the
first time that we take for granted
leave you in the comments right down
below thank you guys for watching an
episode of retinas riffs hope you
enjoyed my parental story we're back
every week with new pinions and weird
things to come out of my head hope you
