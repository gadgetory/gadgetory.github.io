Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm a couple of times a
week I'm Ashley ask Emma and before we
get started if you're interested in any
of the stories we talk about today you
can click on the links in the
description to go to the full story or
if you have annotations toggle on you
just click the graphic takes you right
over to our site here are your top
stories yesterday we found out that
Google and Microsoft were at odds again
after Google found Microsoft's Windows
Phone 8 YouTube app to be in violation
of their terms of service google revoked
their access to the api for a second
time this time claiming Microsoft
reverse engineered Google's code to
implement an ad serving work around
Google and Microsoft have been playing
this cat-and-mouse game for a while now
for various Google services but there's
some kind of idiom involved here that
applies about glass houses stones and
proprietary api's and software and my
right Microsoft big market share news
this week for android fans as we
discovered Android is pretty much
crushing it in market share bringing in
seventy-nine percent of the total pie
while Apple on the other hand dropped
from 18.8 to 14.2 percent oh the sky
isn't quite falling for Apple just yet
though as the drop is a usual dip
whenever we have a new iPhone looming on
the horizon a Windows Phone actually
continued inch upward moving from 2.82
three-point-three percent of the market
but for now is still barely a scratch on
the knees of mobile giants over in
gaming Grand Theft Auto fans got their
first look at multiplayer gameplay for
grand theft auto 5 yesterday whipping
everybody up into a frenzy of
anticipation the multiplayer component
will include the ability to rob banks
race vehicles and even create custom
activities with up to 15 and your fellow
hooligans which is a big expansion /
Grand Theft Auto 4 s 4 player co-op
missions so my question is if you beat a
hooker to death post coitus and steal
her money do you have to split it with
your friends Microsoft continuing to
announce more xbox one changes this week
announcing that they had delayed
deployment in eight original launch day
countries Belgium Denmark Finland the
Netherlands nor
way Russia Sweden and Switzerland will
all be left out in the Xbox one cold on
launch day with Microsoft saying they
need more time for localization language
optimization and making those content
partnerships in those areas in related
news I've been trained to pretty much
expect the worst when microsoft
announces anything about the new xbox
one as for our grab bag today Todd
Hazleton is at it again with another
edition of tech talks back on
technobuffalo this time around he's
interviewed NQ mobile's chief product
officer gavin kim who actually wrote an
opinion piece about Jay Z's Magna Carta
Holy Grail release specifically the
artists collaboration with Samsung to
release the album early to galaxy s4
owners and the specific app permissions
those fans encountered it's a really
great read that's worth your time if you
have a few minutes and gives us a little
bit of insight into how a chief product
officer views things like those specific
apps that's the Buffalo bulletin for
