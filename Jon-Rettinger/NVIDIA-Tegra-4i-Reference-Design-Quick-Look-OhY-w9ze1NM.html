TechnoBuffalo i'm here in the nvidia
booth and what you're looking at is
basically just a white box design of the
Tegra 4i chip you can see the amazing
gaming performance already now this
gives me two questions is nvidia going
to build its own phone it certainly has
the ability to we're looking at it right
here and to you know how sooner we're
going to see these Tegra 4i chips we
already know that ZTE is going to launch
them later this year but when they have
a design like this basically they're
laying out all the parts and everything
that somebody needs to do in order to
build the phone sort of encourage is a
manufacturer to use a Tegra 4i is close
to Qualcomm or something like that
especially when you get these kind of
amazing graphics hopefully they're
coming through on the video for you any
case I think my biggest question is are
we going to see a smart from from Nvidia
and what we're seeing here is total
possibility yes it could happen and it
seems like it would happen in the way
sort of like HTC did things where they
used to build devices for other
companies and here it's coming from a
different angle they build processes for
other companies but they certainly have
the ability to build phones too so quick
look we can't get inside but you can see
it even despite the power the phone is
relatively thin
get the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack up
their the volume buttons on the top
anyway quick look here at the sample
design of the Tegra 4i chip nvidia booth
mo World Congress and this is Todd
hazleton</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
