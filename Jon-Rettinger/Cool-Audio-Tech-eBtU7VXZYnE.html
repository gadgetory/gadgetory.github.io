Ron Pereira from TechnoBuffalo and today
in this video I have for you a couple
cool audio items some are more expensive
somewhere on the high end and we have
cheaper alternative options some are
very rugged all sorts of speakers
headphones that I think you guys should
check out that are noteworthy that are
definitely on my list and that I've been
trying out recently so first off we have
a pretty expensive item it's a new bose
qc25 s they are wireless noise canceling
extremely comfortable over your
headphones with incredible battery life
and that probably has to be one of the
highlight features on standby
not using them the headphones can last
and stay on for up to three days so
that's pretty amazing whereas most other
wireless headphones in the category like
a pair of Zeke's need charging much more
often usually once or twice throughout
the day very comfortable in the year you
can wear them for long periods of time
the cushions feel awesome I think Bose
still makes the best most comfortable
ear cups on the market without getting
too into the nitty-gritty these
headphones sound very very good the
sound profile is very clean crisp not as
bass heavy as some other headphones
might be a sort of signature sound that
we've come to know and love from Bose
the one big downside and the big flaw
that I saw here was that when you do
eventually have to charge the headphones
you still can't use it in a wireless
mode so you have to use it as a wired
pair of headphones using an auxilary
cord meaning you have two wires one to
charge and one to listen to music too so
it goes from being completely Wireless
to a wired mess when the battery is dead
next we have the anchor sound cord sport
XL portable bluetooth speaker it has 16
watt audio output two subwoofers and
most importantly it's ip67 waterproof
and dustproof and shockproof with up to
66 feet bluetooth range so all good
stuff the big features here to me were
that it feels very chunky in the hand
works very well with sealing off water
and dust there's a flap on the back that
protects your ports which will allow you
to actually charge your phone which is a
nice little bonus feature if your
phone's running low on battery the top
of the device has five very chunky
feeling buttons that work very well the
very tactile so if you are out and about
or have something on your hands or
gloves something like that you can still
feel around and make the speaker work so
prop
to anchor for that and finally the most
endearing feature to me about the sound
course port was the back subwoofer it's
like the little subwoofer that could I
didn't actually know it was a subwoofer
until I started playing music and I
started vibrating it's a little hard out
with 15 hours of playback time battery
life will not be an issue in terms of
sound quality everything is very clear
crisp sounds great
little subwoofer definitely adds some
bass it won't fill up a huge room but
will more than likely get the job done
if you're going to the beach to the pool
camping or any other outdoor activities
you choose to do now this third item is
going to be a bit of a counterpunch to
the original bose QC s if you want to
get high quality over your comfortable
headphones but don't want to shell out
over $300 which i don't blame me if you
don't want to I recommend you take a
look at these
the modern portable hi-fi elites they
are very comfortable headphones very
clear very good audio quality for the
price the head strap is extremely
comfortable the headphones just feel
very pliable in your hands without
feeling cheap or low quality for most
common listening to compressed audio
from Spotify Google Play Music and all
that kind of stuff these headphones are
going to be very very good I wouldn't
recommend them for anything high-end
audio monitoring or mixing and stuff
like that these will get the job done
for 9 out of 10 people out there and
save you a ton of money at the same time
and so if you guys do pick up one of
these headphones or speakers the big
question is what are you going to be
listening to and for me I love
audiobooks I love reading while not
reading and that's what audible does
they put together awesome audiobooks
with awesome narrators and as if that
wasn't enough audible has all sorts of
genres for you to choose from and over
250,000 audiobooks one of my favorite
books recently has been the Elon Musk
biography I have between a one to two
hour commute almost every single day and
so I try to take advantage of that time
to read and to learn and all that good
stuff let me know in the comments down
below what books you guys are reading or
well books so you guys would listen to I
highly recommend you go check audible
out at audible.com slash techno and get
a free 30-day trial again that's
