TechnoBuffalo here yesterday was June
7th 2011 which marked the four-year
anniversary of my first video getting
uploaded to YouTube it was an unboxing
of my very first Mac it was a MacBook
Pro at the time there weren't all that
many tech reviewers out on YouTube I had
no intention of being a tech reviewer or
even trying to become a tech reviewer I
had never used a Mac before I didn't
know how I thought that it would sort of
force me to learn to use my computer if
I made videos I thought maybe one or two
people might watch a bit of a back story
I had been watching a guy out of the UK
his name was Danny as ace I don't think
he's even making videos anymore he had
done such an awesome job talking about
computers that I figured it would be a
fun thing to sort of have someone in the
US do it so I very much in mimic to
style you can see the video playing over
my shoulder I was so nervous
I remember I set up the camera I set up
the products in front for probably a
good 30 minutes I filmed about 10 takes
I just I wasn't confident I was nervous
the video it wasn't obviously wasn't HD
it wasn't even widescreen YouTube wasn't
even widescreen I didn't know how to
edit a video I really knew nothing and I
was so incredibly nervous to make a
video I thought that I was going to get
absolutely ripped apart the people were
going to just make fun of me I was just
extremely self-conscious and the
audience police initially the ones that
watch my first videos were so incredibly
supportive it meant it just a tremendous
amount to me and this is where I'm
probably gonna get a little bit
sentimental I look back from where I was
in 2007 when I started making YouTube
videos you guys might not know this I
was a marketing guy before I became a
tech reviewer technology has always been
my passion but I could never make a
living out of it so marketing is what I
was doing I was running a marketing
department for exhaust where development
firm
and I really hated my job I hated my job
so much to the fact that I would hope
that I would get in just like a minor
car accident on the way and not worried
it would hurt anybody but ride have an
excuse to not go into work oh my god
right into a stop sign or something that
would be my hope I never actually did I
was just I was miserable of what I was
doing a slaving away you know working 50
60 or more hours a week at a job I
didn't enjoy I had pretty much already
hit my ceiling there and the tech videos
were an outlet for me it was a chance to
express my passion to have an
interaction with folks that shared my
interest and YouTube the audience grew
and you guys in particular have given me
a chance to live my dream and you might
have heard me say that quite a bit but I
mean it every time what would I look
back four years how unhappy I was with
my life and where I am right now
it's just it's so wonderful and I'm not
always the most emotional guy in the
world but talking about this really
really gets me emotional I I've shared
so much with you guys over the four
years I've gotten married obviously
engaged before then bought a house you
guys have met my cat you have even seen
my parents show up in videos you're
gonna have to look back to some older
catalogs find that you guys have grown
with me going back you know four years
and I was 26 now we're in 30 I feel like
we've both grown together and I just
want to say thank you from the bottom of
my heart for giving me the opportunity
to to really live my passion and it's I
wake up with a smile on my face even on
my worst day when I read comments people
are saying you suck what are you doing I
hate you I hate you you know YouTube
comments can be a little bit tough
I can always smile and I can't be happy
because I get to review technology for a
living and it's something that I don't
take for granted I will never take for
granted and for as long as you guys will
watch me I will be here doing this it's
what I love it's it makes me happy and
there aren't that many times when I'm at
a loss for words
and you guys would know and talking
about this something that really puts me
at a loss for words I just want to say
thank you it's been such an amazing four
years and I'm so happy with what I get
to do now and I hope that I could
continue to grow and hope that I can
look back on my eighth year anniversary
and say wow look look look look what
I've done
look how much better my videos are look
how much more confident I am on camera
just wanted to say thank you guys and to
celebrate a little bit of a four year
milestone if you guys want to check out
that first video again links gonna be
down below and to all of you out there
who are thinking about starting websites
starting YouTube channels I hope that my
story can serve at least is a little bit
of an inspiration because you can do it
you have to stick with it and you have
to get past the hate comments there are
some days when is actually early on that
it was really hard to keep going into
videos because the comments get tough
but bear through it and something that
you guys want to do and you stick with
it and you find your own voice and you
find your own style you can make a
career and you can be successful and
most importantly you can be happy so
I've said this a million times guys
thank you thank you thank you from the
bottom of my heart thank you
my family thank you my wife thanks you
my cat Mercedes thanks you everyone and
just thank you thank you a million times
over for giving me the opportunity to
live my dream to start TechnoBuffalo and
have a platform to get my voice out to
give other people a voice is just a
truly wonderful opportunity that's an
opportunity that you guys have so before
I embarrass myself more on camera and
get a little more emotional I'll see you
guys a happier more upbeat less
emotional perhaps wasn't misty-eyed the
show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
