to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo it's an
unboxing for you the latest from HTC
this is the desire I listen let's just
be honest with each other
selfies are like pooping everybody does
if you don't always want to talk about
it HTC is trying to take that mainstream
big listen we know you take selfies you
want the best possible camera to face
your face and face your friends faces so
they think the desire eyes got your
cover its go ahead and unbox it and take
a first look so here is the box for the
HTC Desire eye was unveiled along with
the arre camera which we did some
coverage on if you want to check out
that hit the link down below it's a
difficult 18 T box so it's a little bit
bigger than what we've seen in some
other boxes go ahead open this sucker up
boom there is the desire I have not yet
checked this guy out so I'm kind of
excited to to see it this was sent to us
from our friends at HTC quick started
guide but we don't read those here is
that phone well I get a two-tone look I
think there are other color options
available too but the white and red
looks super nice shelf decided for a
real quick second what else we going to
have inside of the box safety and
regulatory guide a meet the rec√°mara
which we did
HTC stickers for showing your HTC pride
you're not this card this place is label
and then you just have a wall work and
micro USB cable nothing else exciting in
there what is exciting I think is the
phones go and pull this out you could
already see the gigantic front facing
camera go ahead and simply gonna open
this up and here's the phone
so the phone feels kind of different
than the other HTC phones first it's not
that metal build kind of a polycarbonate
plastic but it's almost a soft touch
feel to it it feels really nice and a
hand that I'm really diggin the two-tone
look here it's good powered on it will
run through all the specs of this guy so
as the screen boots up it is a 5.2 inch
screen it's a 1920 by 1080 which means
424 PPI Android 4.4.2 it launched
presumably that will get some upgrades
two E's Aram are on board inside of this
guy as well as 16 gigs of storage but
don't be like a John it's not that much
storage you can just expand that with a
micro USD card up to 128 gigs you stop

the back is a 13 megapixel camera with
dual LED flash the front equal 13
megapixel with dual LED flash so pretty
impressive 802 11 a B G and n 2.4 and
2.5 gigahertz Bluetooth 4.0 and a 2400
milliamp hour battery is powering this
guy let's go ahead and see what's going
to come on the phone first you got soft
card for mobile payments take advantage
of that NFC capability formerly was
called Isis wallet we've got all of our
let's just do this real fast I can see
more on screen grid size 4 by 5 there we
go you can see all them apps see what's
gonna come board here support for each
DC's dot few keys which are kind of cool
uber pre-installed and just call our
name ID not much in the way of 18 t apps
they're all hidden inside of that AT&amp;amp;T
folder
I've got your Google stuff all your
media stuff and tools
the big story though is that camera and
how it's going to perform I think the
best way we can do it is just to try and
take some selfies and see how they look
like looks like on the UI and everything
else about the phone so let's do a quick
tour of the phone so you've got your
on-screen buttons you've got your back
button your home button and your
multitasking button living right there
on the left hand side you've got your
SIM card slots there's some card tray
rather and your micro SD card slot
volume rocker up and down power button
and dedicated camera I love me some
dedicated camera and you've got your
AT&amp;amp;T logo there HTC that's our soft
touch back as well so noise cancelling
mic
on the bottom you got some mics here
charging port and the top 3.5 milimeter
headset jack the phone feels really
really nice in the hand despite not
being made of metal I think HTC did a
really good job here with this no boom
