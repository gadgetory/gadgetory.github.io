john retinue from TechnoBuffalo here
taking a look at the samsung series
seventh slate pc that i wish i could
take out of here
this is taking Windows 7 and it is
tablet izing it so it's running Intel's
2nd gen core i3 or i5 processor it's
going to come in 32 64 or 128 gigabyte
SSD storage capacities to incredibly
thin at 0.5 inches or a twelve point
nine millimeters it's got an really
light as well at one point nine pounds
in six hours of battery life let's go
ahead and see how it worked with your
finger that's always been one of the
issues with taking a PC operating system
making the tablets how was it going to
respond let's go ahead and try so it is
a capacitive touchscreen going to cancel
out don't save out of this and you can't
actually go ahead and navigate it's
gonna see what scrolling looks like
let's see if we can go to pictures and
see if we have pinch-to-zoom and
multi-touch here if you double tap usage
of what I guess with a mouse but
jellyfish
all right so pitch to zoom does work on
here also have you scrolled down below
if you don't want to use your finger you
got a more classic keyboard here and
then go ahead and plug in a mouse also
you've got a capacitive stylus here so
go ahead and do your drawings great for
digital designers that need sort of the
tablet to do their sketching but also on
a powerful computer let's go ahead and
close this out on the left hand side so
you've got HDMI out volume up and down
3.5 milimeter headset jack and then
you've got one USB port lives there
under a door and then we've got your
power cord which is a proprietary power
cord up the top here you've got a micro
SD so if you want to get all your
storage done you go ahead and do that
you'll see the thickness of the tablet
coming down on the right hand side so
you're going to have your power on/off
button and if you want to switch
monitors you've got that option there as
well to go to an external display this
is the keyboard accessory very very thin
very light chiclet style reminiscently
else that we've seen you have one home
button there to go ahead and turn it on
some tablet optimizations have been done
here some widgets on the side but mostly
it's a pretty standard Windows 7
experience with some giant icons so I'm
