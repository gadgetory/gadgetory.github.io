going to talk about macbook pro upgrades
the HTC One m9 could Apple be making a
car and what keeps me coming back for
more tech videos all this and more
brought to you by the LG G flex 2 by LG
life's good our first question comes
from ad big dan's a man who asked at
john for lakers i've got a 13 inch 2012
macbook pro just a regular version was
wondering if an SSD or extra ram would
be the best for improved performance to
you I say yes absolutely my wife
actually has exactly that same macbook
pro and the thing was dog slow it would
take minutes and minutes minutes to load
up to close an app would take way longer
than it should have to shut the thing
down could make myself a cup of tea had
a nap come back and still would be
shutting down I threw an SSD in it I
upgraded the ram 8 gigs and thing
screams like a brand-new computer I
should also say that I completely did a
wife of the hard drive as well and
installed a brand the new fresh
operating system and the thing works
like the day came out of the box so yes
by all means to do that it should say
you're having to buy a new computer the
next question comes from at MTG 2016 us
at john for lakers the lack of a duo
camera make a difference on the one m9
in your opinion hashtag ask to be so
first we don't know much about the m9 it
hasn't been announced yet we did do a
video though about what you can expect
in it if you want to watch that link
down below baidu oh I believe you're
referring to the ultrapixel camera and
the other camera sensor lives above it
to let you do sauna some cool stuff like
focus after the fact ultrapixel camera
was great especially for low-light but a
lot of people are clamoring for more
megapixels which doesn't always take
better pictures just let you do a lot of
zoom and cropping so we're hearing
rumors that the new HTC One m9 will pack
a much higher megapixel sensor and get
rid of that duo camera which I would not
worry about keeping do a software what
you had to do with Hardware on the HTC
One m8 so I can make that figured out
the next question comes from our friend
at Red Sox 2009 who asks at John for
lakers what do you think about apple
building an electric car so this one is
very interesting there have been these
minivans least apple with this crazy
camera sensing equipment on top that
have sort of been all around palo alto
recently also reports at apple's poach
up to 100
the Tesla employees apples allegedly
hired some design folks from forward and
other automotive folks which is kind of
dressing the prevailing rumor is that
Apple is looking to get into the
electric car game which that's a whole
other story I think it's gonna happen I
don't know it starts starting to see
more and more likely where there's smoke
there tends to be fired what I think is
more likely that Apple is going to part
with another car manufacturer on some
apple Brenda Tech in an existing car but
also some rumors of possibilities Apple
might make a bid for Tesla which as of
this filming Tesla has a market cap
around 25 billion which as far as
Apple's cash reserves goes is like this
much out of like that much that they
have it might be more likely scenario
there have been reports that Elon Musk
and Tim Cook had in-depth conversations
about something early last year and Elon
Musk verify those conversations happen
didn't say what they were about is it
gonna happen though who knows fun
speculate though that question comes
from ad Gregory one 1987 who asked at
John for lakers what keeps you coming
back to make videos and you enjoy in
other sports like football and if so
what's your favorite team I keep coming
back to do this because i really love
technology like unhealthily love
technology i still read about all the
new phones tablets and technics coming
out not because it's my job because i
have like a nerdy passion that burns
deep my nerdy the loins I live and
breathe the stuff and I still can't
believe that I get to do it for a job
I'm also a huge sports fan I used to be
a giant le Rams fan used to play in
Anaheim my dad and I used to go to two
or three games a season when I was a kid
and actually loved it they moved out go
in 1994 to st. Louis and it left me
without a team so now I mostly just
follow football in general I went to
college dups at New York and instead of
falling Buffalo Bills I kind of got into
the Cleveland Browns I went to a few
games the new brown stadium and I loved
it got an underdog team and I love the
fans I've had to pick a team right now
it'd be the brown but the rumors are
true and Stan Kroenke is bringing the
Rams back to LA I will dust off my old
blue and gold sweatshirts and half we be
a Rams vanagon I don't think you guys
