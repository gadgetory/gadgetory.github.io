TechnoBuffalo here with a Saturday
delivery special for you this is the
t-mobile g2 X built by LG it's really
one of the new flagship handsets that's
going to be available on t-mobile it's
got a ton of awesome specs including a
dual core Tegra 2 processor and a lot of
other goodness we are gonna get to so
without further ado let's go ahead hack
this package open
so this was sent courtesy of the folks
at t-mobile for review we haven't seen
this in a while we'll use the obligatory
big ol knife to cut into the FedEx box
here insert joke about not cutting off
my finger I gotta say this knife is
getting a little bit dull in its old age
all right open the package you see me
got some press material in there we do
which it looks like I totally destroyed
LG baa there we go so this is what it's
going to look like when you pick up your
g2 X from t-mobile which actually you
can go ahead and place your order today
the g2 X rather it is actually the
American brother of the lg optimus 2x if
you're in Europe and you've seen the lg
optimus 2x or somewhere else where it
souls this is the u.s. equivalent take a
quick look at the box and we'll jump in
check out the device g2 x with Google
t-mobile picture of the phone got some
important tell us is brand new that seal
on that seal has been broken maybe they
popped into SIM cards on the back
letting you know some of the specs we'll
talk about all that stuff big one there
is powered by nvidia tegra 2 and nothing
really else in the box alright so let's
go ahead and open this up and I'll run
through all the specs and that goodness
so here is the phone it's got a nice
feel to it
and it looks like it was already powered
on so the batteries in there will push
it off to the side very quickly and take
a look at what I expect to be a pretty
standard array of accessories in the Box
got some reading material getting
started guide microUSB cable wall Kayla
don't appear to be any stereo headphones
in there though so the foam is on that
makes this a lot easier to go ahead and
run through the specs emergency dialer
let's not call 9-1-1 okay so here is the
G 2x let me bring the camera in just a
little bit I will say on first blush and
certainly about reviewing it or using it
it does have a nice feel to at the back
is that sort of soft touch that we've
been seeing quite a bit and a lot of
phones that soft touch feel actually
seems to extend to that little bit of
there's plastic on that is to come off
on there is so now it feels metal no
more soft touch as you can see that 8
megapixel camera looking at you
something run through what you're going
to get with this guy so of course you're
gonna get that Tegra 2 which is a
dual-core 1 gigahertz on each core
processor which should be crazy fast a
quadrant scores for Tegra 2 phones are
blazing this is Android 2.2 Froyo
it's 2.2 without any bloatware t-mobile
is really pushing that this is 2.2
android as google built it without any
skin or anything else on it you've got a
4 inch screen that's always measure
diagonal and that's not edge to edge
that's just screen the corner to screen
corner were they now a very common
resolution of 480 by 800 I'd love to say
comments that's a pretty nice resolution
it's great that a lot of phones are
getting it from a weight standpoint it's
gonna clock in at just about 5 ounces or
142 grams if you are so inclined the
battery which we'll take a look at in
the back is in there is going to be 1500
milliamp hours and t-mobile's claim
that's gonna get you about seven point
eight hours of talk time or 400 hours of
standpoint standby time damn boy time
which would be I don't know I'm guessing
that something like 17 ish days my math
is good which probably is not for those
of you gamers out there like do any sort
of the reading intensive stuff this does
have a 3d graphics hardware accelerator
so games should look pretty awesome on
it on the back if you go ahead and flip
that phone over we will see the eight
megapixel camera that I talked about
with LED flash that's actually the
camera that's the flash which also has
sort of a cool functionality does multi
shot panorama so if you want to look at
a panoramic scene you can take a picture
of that I shall take a few pictures and
loop them all together it will take
video at nine twenty by ten eighty and
at 1080 number means you're going to get
HD video at 1080p for those you guys are
wondering why Cisco kill the Flip brand
phones like this are the reason this was
1080p
we'll see how impressive it is on the
front there also loves another camera of
pretty nice resolution this is 1.3
megapixels which is a lot higher than
what we've seen
most front-facing cameras released a
majority of front-facing cameras
generally they're VGA other sort of
goodness you got Wi-Fi 802 a leaven BG
and then of course support 14 levels 4G
you're getting eight gigs of storage
built in on the top will have HDMI out
I'll give a walkthrough of the phone so
if you want to get your HDMI out going
on you can do that here doesn't look
like the cable was included and LG has
really been pushing DLNA which is a way
to sort of wirelessly kick content from
your phone to a DLL and egg same DNA
DLNA device
sort of similar to Apple's AirPlay you
just need to keep a wolf device to
receive the signal so let's take a quick
look at the phone we got nothing rockin
the left hand side on the right I assume
love a little bit of action volumes like
there's separate volume up and down
buttons not a rocker and that is about
it on the top never you like when phone
manufacturers do this they put the lock
and power button on the upper right hand
side it really just feels like a natural
feel to me sometimes
HTC puts it there sometimes they'll move
it it's like LG really did a nice job
least in my opinion put it on the upper
right there is your HDMI out living
under a little bit of a door 3.5
millimeter headset jack on the bottom
there's your microUSB charging and dual
speakers there's a microphone I'm sure
live in there somewhere in the back as
you guys saw we got the camera LED flash
that with a Google strip let's go ahead
and pull off the back here if I can
figure this out and we can see what
we're going to be getting in there all
right so the back looks pretty easy to
pull off there's a little notch there go
ahead and run your finger around it and
you can pull off the soft touch back
don't take a look at what sort of
storage or memory bin be getting so
there's the battery that I mentioned is
a 1500 milliamp hours this is going to
come with eight gigs of storage inside
it does not look like we're going to
have any sort of microSD expansion going
to become in the box perhaps and they
shift the actual units you might have
some sort look like there's anything
included in there that's where it would
live you don't have take out the battery
to get to it though which is kind of
nice so I'm going to shut this thing
down and do a boot up I know people are
sort of curious about boot up times
especially with these Tegra 2 phones how
quick or slow they might be some
surprises guys
and has a charge let's go ahead and you
can see what the official name is o GP
nine nine nine nine nine
let's go ahead and turn this off and see
we can get a boot up time power off
we'll turn it back on and let's see how
quick it is I'm always very curious
Integra two phones tend to boot up very
very quickly we'll see if that's the
case here as well I really like the
t-mobile has made it sort of straight up
and during those skins on it give you
the native Android experience that you
can choose to customize as you like
that's really one of the benefits of
Android know one of the reasons a lot of
people love the Android so we've got an
LG splash screen life's good I don't
know if that's what LG stands for but
they always say that in commercials
life's good with a smiley guy I haven't
really been the biggest fan of LG phones
in the past this one is supposed to go
in a very different direction and
actually seems to have a pretty nice
build quality so hopefully this will be
the start of a new trend for them so
t-mobile g2 X guys remember the original
g1 when it first came out the very first
Android phone didn't even have an
on-screen keyboard and here we are back
so that was actually a very quick boot
up no Tegra 2 splash screen just kind of
addressing and now we are good to go so
let's go ahead tap Android guy skip all
this business let's go ahead and skip
this and hopefully we should get right
into Android 2.2 there here looks pretty
straightforward getting a nice 4G signal
and there is nothing else going on here
other than straight Android you do have
the Tegra zone those are games specially
designed by Nvidia to be optimized for
the Tegra 2 chipset supposed to work
very well and supposed to be some really
neat games in there so we'll take a look
at the Tegra zone runs application see
if really there is nothing else bundled
in here got its mobile app pack you can
see you've got that 3d view this is very
native Android 2.2 got Tegra game smart
share and looks to be about it the only
things that are bundled are those few
things what's the T Mobile app pack
welcomes app pack it looks like there
are few sorta mobile specific things you
get access to highlights or t-mobile
maul when I get out of that four
capacitive buttons the bottom I probably
should have mentioned you've got your
typical Android buttons that new looking
one is just going to be the menu all
right if you guys want to see a size
comparison to what this is gonna look
like with a few other phones here is an
iPhone 4 a little bit smaller screen you
can see how thin this guy really is and
here is its t-mobile stablemate we've
got the sidekick 4G certainly the
sidekick is a little bit fatter because
of that slide-out QWERTY keyboard which
you guys may have seen in previous
videos lives right there slide that back
so the g2 X is actually a very thin
slender device go ahead and line all
those up and I guys what do you think
about the g2 X if you're a t-mobile fan
this might be the phone that you've been
waiting for a great build quality got
that next generation hardware the Tegra
2 is a screamer and hopefully all the
software is going to be optimized for
that hardware it's certainly been one of
the disadvantage as opposed to having
this awesome hardware as Android 2.2
hasn't taken full advantage of that yet
but with future updates hopefully we'll
see that rectified I know you guys I'm
John rende you're from TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you the next video
buh-bye
what's up everyone John rapture from
TechnoBuffalo here with a satirist yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
