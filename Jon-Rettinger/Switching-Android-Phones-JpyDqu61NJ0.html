to you by Gamefly what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of renter's
rants I'm your host John Rutgers the
show where I rant and rave on something
with the technology of this week is kind
of interesting topic I was all set to
rant on how big a giant pain in the ass
'it is to switch android phones and I
mentioned it to our managing editor Roy
Troy he sent me written his rants from
April where I ranted on what a big
pastures to switch Android phones so I
thought that I would make an update to
that talk actually about how I switch
Android phones and maybe if you're
looking to get a new phone to take some
of the pain and button s
out of that whole process this is right
just rants go and get started there are
many awesome things about my job I get
the privilege to play with and check out
some the latest technology in the world
and part of that is I switch phones I
test different phones and always
switching what my daily driver is so we
got our HTC One Maxx and Todd Hilton
finish this review and I wanted to try
it and I was switching from the Galaxy
Note Lorain I realized switching Android
phones can be quite difficult
iOS whether you love it or hate it has a
really eloquent solution for backups and
restores you can backup on an iPhone 4
and it look exactly the same
on your iPhone 5 or 5s or backup on a5
look you're saying on the 5s it's just a
very very elegant solution nothing
really exists on the Android platform
whether it's because they're manufacture
different skins we really difficult for
that to sort of work cross operating
system to if they're different versions
of Android that you're running now some
manufacturers have their own backups HTC
has got a pretty good HTC backup
solution samsung has something similar
but really nothing that goes across
different manufacturers so I thought I'd
share what my process is to switch
Android phones and it really was a very
convoluted process he used to be I would
start over from scratch I would log into
the Google Play Store from a web browser
I would sign in to that phone using that
same email address and I would send all
the apps that I had or write to that
device I'll go through one by one from a
manual read web browser and I would send
each app there then I'd go through each
email out set that up individually I go
through and set up permissions all the
AFT individually
everything up from scratched it took a
while probably you know 45 minutes an
hour and a half depending on how
in-depth I want to get with the device
or how long I was going to use it for
then I thought there's got to be an
easier way so I was doing that I was
losing all of my sms issues you know I
might call this trio starting all over
from scratch a lot of times I store
numbers and text messages and I just
didn't have that so then I thought all
right there's got to be a better way to
make this work I did all you guys do I
went to the App Store I looked online I
found an app called SMS back up pro so
okay I had my SMS backed up but not
everything else so I did some more
research and I found an app I've called
my backup pro the pro version a free
version I paid the money and I bought
the pro version actually worked really
well so what it does it's going to
backup all of your applications back
with your call log backup your SMS
contacts if you want I will restore your
phone almost the way it was to what it
looked like before I move over all your
pictures it makes life a lot easier when
it comes to moving dad at information so
I really appreciated that it worked
that's really what I do now when I
switch phones first thing I'll do is I
will download my backup Pro download on
both devices it creates sort of an ad
hoc Wi-Fi no answers everything a via
Wi-Fi and it just worked really really
well it's not perfect there are a lot of
things I'd want to improve on it but it
does get everything over I have to go
through and download all my pictures
again from Dropbox it just saves them
and moves it right on over it's worked
very very well for me it's a concern my
process from again at 45 minutes to an
hour and a half down to maybe 20 minutes
which Android phones so it's not as
elegant as what you see on iOS but it
does work very well so if you're like me
and you want to try and switch Android
phones been a giant pain in the butt for
you try doing that app you maybe you
find a better app that works better it's
better for you leave in the comments
down below I'm always looking for
something good I'm not married to this
app but it has worked well for me in the
past so let me take a minute to thank
