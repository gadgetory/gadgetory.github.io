technobuffalo it's April thirtieth 2010
and here's a look at what's on my iPad
okay so I'm going to take you through
the applications that I've been using on
a regular basis let's go through them
now and of course there are a lot of
applications on here that I use once in
a while I'll make a full list of all
these apps on technobuffalo and you can
go there and see exactly why I have
these other applications so let's just
go for the first screen and I'm going to
go through a half a dozen or so of these
applications that I use a lot so going
down the list I use maps a lot mostly
because it does a really awesome job at
doing Street View so if i go to say
somewhere over here and I go into the
street view look how amazing this looks
so if you're planning a trip or you just
want to see where that Pizza Hut is you
can go into Street View and say oh I see
it's next to that on to next to that
white building near the other tall
building thing so straight view is
awesome on google maps on the iPad it's
extremely immersive okay so let's
continue on I also use the imdb
application probably not on a regular
basis but whenever I'm looking for a
movie it's awesome so I can go into
avatar and I can watch a trailer right
on here I can see all the actors this is
a really good example of how a company
is making great use of the of the
resolution on an iPad you can scroll
down and see more about it going over
here we can just watch a trailer right
here in full screen and you get the
point you can search for movies so let's
search for say Shawshank Redemption
probably one of the best movies of all
time and there it is comes up really
fast you can see that it's got a really
high rating probably a movie that you
want to watch imdb's awesome it's free
okay going down the list I don't really
use these too much I books I don't use
that much i use the kindle app i'll show
you that in a second these racing games
are really awesome but I use them very
infrequently analytics HD is a fantastic
app it costs actually I think ten
dollars but it lets you look
the Google Analytics of any website that
you're tracking so it's really fantastic
I do use Pendor a lot but it's really
really annoying on the iPad that I can't
listen to pandora radio while doing
something else hopefully or most likely
in version four point oh and we get it
in the fall on the iPad you'll finally
be able to do this I don't use aim that
much I definitely use the weather
channel application a ton it's the best
weather application that i found on the
ipad so we get a different background
every time I can jump right into local
and it finds your nearest city and here
we are showing me the forecast in
fayetteville north carolina we can swipe
to the right to get a beautiful forecast
down here we can click into radar and
the radar is really really cool it
integrates with google maps so it
doesn't look like there's any
precipitation around the area but if
there were it would overlay onto the map
and then you could use this like google
maps to see where the storm cells are
and everything the weather channel free
application it's awesome I use it a lot
Wall Street Journal I absolutely use a
lot there's a little bit of a bug with
it you're going to see in a second first
of all it's slow in loading and so I can
see all of the issues in the last week
on paying two dollars per week to get
this and it's downloading today and
sometimes it freezes when it downloads
today hopefully it won't do that today
let's see what happens and see it seems
to be stuck on today so I'm just going
to go to yesterday's issue of The Wall
Street Journal just to give you a little
taste of what it looks like on the iPad
and why I like it so then not the
fastest appt here here we are we can
swipe to the right for the front news
pages or we can click on what's news
this is always a good place that I like
to start so you see the top headlines
and it's such a relief not have to flip
through to Section C for to see this
story if I want to see this story I tap
on it and boom there it is it's also got
multimedia within it it's got an image
gallery and a lot of the article is also
a video with it which is quite fantastic
and then you get this nice index on the
side of all of the different articles
within this particular section which is
what's news and we can swipe to the
right get a little advertisement which
is kind of annoying especially since I'm
paying for this but what are you going
to do
okay back to the home screen kindle
application i use a lot i'm really
really happy that they approve the
kindle application for the app store for
the ipad so here i am in a book let me
get out of here this is the 21
irrefutable laws of leadership i
recommend it tremendously and what i can
do is somewhere around here i can go to
my archive showing all the books that
i've ever bought so here they are all
the books I've ever bought I can
download them to the kindle within
seconds so let's say i want to check out
the interpretation of dreams by Sigmund
Freud good title so right now it's
downloading it right to my Kindle I've
already purchased it so now if I go to
home there it is the interpretation of
dreams starting on the page that I left
off with and of course down here if you
tap on the screen you can change a few
things about the text you can make it
larger and smaller you can change the
background to white or if you think it's
two contrasting and go to sepia which is
actually a lot better so the kindle app
i use this a lot to read books okay
going down the list we have a link to t
ed calm which is formatted properly for
the ipad so you can watch all of the
fantastic te d videos right on your ipad
as if they were meant to play so i can
go to any of these and you're going to
see in a second that the video should
queue up and then you can use a gesture
to make the video wider double tap to
make it full screen
awesome so you can see why I have that
bookmarked it works so well in the iPad
we got the App Store New York Times
editor choice it's a free app awesome
app New York Times has fantastic
journalists on board and you can access
it right from your iPad so it's probably
going to refresh there it goes and see
what just happened is that the New York
Times application closed itself this is
a bug there are a lot of these bugs
still in the iPad in applications things
don't always work but you know it's only
been out for about a month so we can go
to the next page just like the The Wall
Street Journal you can tap on a story
and it will bring it up full screen
after it downloads it and this is a
little bit different on in the page
navigation down here we get a variety of
dots to indicate how many pages you have
left whereas on the wall street journal
it would just say page 1 of 2 and we can
go back and we can filter through the
categories on the bottom awesome
application i use on a regular basis
facebook has still not been updated for
the ipad so i am running the the iphone
version which is just it's horrible it's
horrible because it has to scale to the
larger screen i use this program to
track stocks not going to show that i
use this a ton speedtest.net this is an
iphone application that's why it looks
blurry but i like this it's fun to see
how fast my internet connection speed is
at times so you get the point that's
actually kind of slow for today ok so
let's go down the list this is an iphone
application koi pond if they haven't
updated it for the iPad this is a really
fun game i'm not going to show you it's
called tap tap radiation it's free this
is another free game called magic piano
going down the list coloring book
something i got just for fun i use NPR a
lot NPR is another awesome source of
news this is a free application that
lets you listen to the audio broadcasts
and read articles and it remembers where
i left off from so it's going to
download and you can even have a
playlist down here to keep track of the
different times that you the different
playlists that you add to to your
playlist and we can swipe to the right
this is a beautiful interface a really
interesting way that they decided to do
this so we can tap on a particular story
and it's going to load listen now
get a lot work for it get a little
advertisement and then it'll go right
into my house today declared challenge
ok here it really fantastic high quality
news on your iPad it's a really really
good thing then pro keys I like to mess
around with this this is a free
application you play the piano you can
change the preset here to different
sounds since it has multitouch it
responds quite nicely to your touch
going down to list further good reader I
don't use that too much but people that
use a lot of documents on google docs
say it is awesome scrabble is probably
the best game that i found on the ipad
so far the graphics are just incredible
and i love using this when i have people
over what's really cool about this is
that you can use iphones and connect it
with bluetooth to show the letters when
you're playing Scrabble so i'm going to
go to a new game really quick just to
show you what it looks like graphics are
awesome so scrabble in its full glory i
can't wait for more board games to come
to the ipad ok continuing on yahoo
entertainment is an awesome app that
lets you see what's on TV tonight and
it's perfect because your ipad is
probably going to be on your coffee
table and to be able to have a online
guide program like this is just really
great and it works quite well to take a
look so this is the only annoying part
it has to update update the guide but
it's downloading a lot of information oh
you can see my reflection hello so
another thing about the ipad screen it's
so reflective it's very hard to take it
outside because any little reflection
will show up like my head in the glossy
screen so here we have an awesome
looking guide this one actually works
better in portrait because you get more
screen real estate we can swipe quickly
it works just really really marvelously
ok let's keep going on draw Meister is
an awesome application that i discovered
i play the drums and so
it's fun it's a it's two dollars and
it's kind of cool because you can
actually change the configuration of the
drums so I can move this around I can
actually add drums this is another
example of a cool ipad interface so I
can actually take one of these let's
take the floor tom and add another one
and I'm done and I can actually change
the size of this like so and check mark
and you got it ok continuing on opera
mini it's an iphone application don't
really use it don't use this don't use
city series illusion HD is just a co-op
costs 99 cents it shows you optical
illusions stopwatch I just use it to
test the time it takes to do certain
things down here you see twitterrific
which i think is the best ipad
application for twitter although there
are many so it's very likely that there
is probably one out there that is better
and you just heard a little big I got a
new email so that was a look at the
applications that I've got on my iPad
right now April thirtieth 2010 this will
probably change in a month and i'll be
sure to make another video talking about
it be sure to check TechnoBuffalo i want
to list all these other apps and tell
you why i got them that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
