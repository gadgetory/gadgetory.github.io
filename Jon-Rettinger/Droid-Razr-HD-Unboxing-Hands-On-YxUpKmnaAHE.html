TechnoBuffalo it's an unboxing of the
Droid Razr HD the newest addition to the
Droid Razr line this guy brings better
battery life an HD screen and all kinds
of Android goodness under its Kevlar
backed phone let's go ahead take a look
alright so here is the Motorola RAZR HD
in all of its box glory before we get it
all naked style if you've ever seen a
box for a previous razor to bicycle are
pretty familiar and that's not a bad
thing is that kind of soft touch feel to
it we'll go ahead and slowly and
seductively remove the packaging boom
we've got the Droid Razr HD branding
right there this guy's going to be
available on October 18th for 200 bucks
with two-year contract but if you're
looking to buy check around prices about
time you watch this video that may have
changed and there we have the main
attraction the star of the show the
Droid Razr HD just hanging out in its
box not really doing much go and pull it
out for just a second got all kinds of
stuff tells us what the buttons are but
we will check that out let's see the
other kind of goodies we're going to
have boom
those are goodies we've got a trowel
charger made in China we've got a
sinking cable micro USB I've got a sim
removal tool hang on to these things are
great to use for other phones sometimes
they don't always come with them or
you'll lose them like me some start here
guides and other kind of business that
probably not going to read all right so
let's take a look at the phone itself it
is going to ship with Android 4.0 point
4 but John you're saying 4.1 is out why
can't my brand-new fancy don't have it
well Motorola saying it will be coming
soon and of course 4.1 is jellybean I'm
going to remove the screen protector and
not pay attention to where stuff it
looks I like to live by hitting my pants
and we'll see we can figure it out on
our own I'll go ahead and turn the power
on which lives right there and while it
is booting up I'll run through all the
specs of this guy so from a dimension
standpoint it is 5.19 inches by 2.6 7
inches by 0.33 inches in weighs five
point one five ounces I'm doing this to
show you how much out light it is but
you can't tell you turn up my hand the
display that we're looking at is a very
pretty tough above the sky finish doing
its boot up screen
every razor gets a crazy little eye
Buddha Trin this is one for the HD all
right so the screen here is 4.7 inches
always measured diagonally with a
resolution of 720 by 1280 and that is a
312 PPI
Super AMOLED display I'll run the dress
to startups here and I'll take you
through the rest the specs all right you
got this gorgeous screen all ready to go
from a battery standpoint it is a 2530
milliamp hour battery it's gonna give
you seven hours of video in 20 hours of
music or six hours of LT browsing but if
battery life is yo thang there's also a
razor HD max with two X's which is going
to give you max battery life pardon this
guy is a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
dual-core 1.5 hears processors that
should give us plenty of speeds very
familiar processor and a lot of phones
nowadays augmented with a gig of ram and
16 gigs internal but there is a micro
card slot somewhere on here which you
can go ahead and up to storage under
there take a look at that in a second
it's got an 8 megapixel camera on the
back and shoot 1080p video of course LED
flash on the front it's got a 1.3
megapixel sensor on network this is a
CDMA phone and LTE which is a GSM
technology so you get sort of both in
their meeting it's going to have a SIM
card bluetooth yep it's got it NFC yep
also got it it's got a Kevlar back that
we've seen with some of the other Razer
designs here which is kinda need also
make the splash proof your Kevlar I
don't think it's gonna work as a
bulletproof vest I recommend
but splash-proof and all kinds of other
resistance proof so if you're prone to
spilling juice on your phone like I
definitely have several times this might
be a good phone to look at and of course
Gorilla Glass is protecting the screen
so looking at the phone don't have any
physical capacitive buttons we've got
the on-screen buttons I've saw
introduced in Ice Cream Sandwich and
those are multitasking
we got nothing open their home button
and back button slightly redesigned to
match Motorola's skin so some cool
things going on your first chrome is the
default web browser of choice so you can
download the regular Android browser if
you choose the circles is a very cool
which you can add all kinds of new
cities and information here different
type of clock stuff battery information
you can always set all kinds of
different things it takes up a lot of
real estate but for me it's primitive
worth it then you've got all kinds of
ways you can start with a template or
blank pages and the templates in the
past have been kinda silly they sort of
plunk in some apps but you can see what
they are here for your mobile office
you've got your calendar right there I
prefer just to add my own but there are
options here quick setting options here
as well you can go ahead and set all
that kind of business it's going to take
a look at some of the apps that are
going to come preloaded with the razor
HD so we've got Kindle already installed
on here camera email files help we've
got modern combat 3 so if you want to
get you a combat on that's going to come
included that's kind of a nice little
addition let's go ahead and go back to
else you're going to have continuing our
tour of applications you got a file
management system on their mobile
hotspot of course and a fellow mobile
some setup wizard Smart Actions is
actually pretty neat Motorola's Adams
their phones if you're going to walk to
serve up essentially to let you do
different things with your phone
depending on locations it's actually a
really handy feature to have so if
you're always at home you can set it to
connect to Wi-Fi or disconnect Wi-Fi
just does all kinds of neat
personalization options there i'm my
verizon mobile and all the verizon stuff
that comes standard vcast and VZ
Navigator the rest up business now we've
got the widget circle widgets a couple
other color widgets some motorola data
and then they go to the standard android
for the most part motorola lets Android
the Android which something that I
really appreciate love a native
unadulterated Android I think Motorola
LG I'll do the best job sort of
leaving it alone and letting it breathe
and do its own thing I'll take a quick
tour of the rest of the device on the
left hand side that is where the center
is going to be and that's where the
microSD card slot is also going to live
we've got charging and syncing port HDMI
out on the right hand side power and
lock but it's got a bit of texture on it
too so you can really feel where it is
in a very well pronounced volume rocker
up and down for time what you want to do
we've got on the bottom stand with
cancelling microphones on the top thirty
point five and millimetre headset jack
alright so I promised I was going to see
what was underneath this hood here so
let's go ahead and pop in that sim
removal tool and see what we got we
should have a SIM card and expansion
storage and that is exactly what we have
in there so there's where your microSD
card would go and that's where your SIM
card live and it is a micro SIM pop that
back end and we're off on our LTE way so
again this guy is available October 18th
they're probably available by the time
you watch this video it's going to set
you back about two hundy that's how I
say two hundred some cool like that I
know I hope you guys enjoy stay tuned
