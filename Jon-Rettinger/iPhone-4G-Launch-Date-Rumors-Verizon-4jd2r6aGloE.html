technobuffalo here there's been a flurry
of iphone 4g rumors coming out recently
and i want to put them all together to
one place and actually when you do we
get from a clearer picture of what we
can expect from the fourth generation
iphone and we can even sort of
extrapolate when a possible release
dates going to be let's go ahead and get
started first recently the CEO is small
canadian carrier sasktel did go on the
record as saying a new iphone to coming
out in june this company does run a cdma
network which is what Verizon and Sprint
run on but they are getting ready to
launch a 3g hsdpa which is the same
network technology at 18 he uses a
little earlier on in the summer and is
claiming that they will have the hsdpa
gsm version of the iphone now it could
be just a case of a small carrier CEO
trying to get some exploited for the
network that does jive a little bit with
what else we're going to talk about the
next thing was ett employees we're told
no vacation for a specific date in june
but certainly they've only done with
iphone launches and they usually
coincide with apple's WWDC or Worldwide
Developer Conference which has generally
been when the next generation iphones
have been announced we saw it with a 3g
and we saw the following year with the
3gs I traditionally the phones have been
announced in junior at least in July and
all these conferences always take place
at the moscone west center and the
calendar there if you check it out right
now so there's a corporate event that's
being booked where that's already been
booked from June twenty-eighth to july
second which certainly would drive quite
nicely with not only the time of Apple's
Worldwide Developer Conference which is
generally just about five days ish but
also the timeframe that we're hearing
the rumors of an iphone 4g launch so
let's suck some the features that would
expect to see what rumors have been
circulating gets the past day about an
all aluminum enclosure in the next
generation iphone i'll show you guys a
picture of it right now we talked about
a little bit on technobuffalo now while
there's a very good chance this is a
fake image i think the design cues that
we're seeing
images 0 may actually come to fruition
they all aluminum enclosure is that what
Apple did with the iPad there's been a
lot of talks okay it's now aluminum
enclosure going to reduce Wi-Fi and free
reception well the answer is really know
what Apple did was instead of making the
back of the apple logo sort of look like
a mirror it's actually right where the
Wi-Fi radio is always now certainly
there have been some Wi-Fi reception
issues with the iPad become the assume
at the engineering team has learned from
those so I think that we can't actually
get an all aluminum enclosure and
without really sacrificing much wireless
transfer fidelity that's one big one of
the big knocks on having a wireless that
was also why the first generation iphone
serve had the aluminum on the top and
the block black down below the black was
where all the sort of wires and teds
were and on the iphone 3g and 3gs the
plastic so the signal could be
transmitted a bit easier so let's talk
about some features there's been talk of
video chat and mobile i chat in the
iphone since before even saw the first
generation iphone however there seems to
be more concrete evidence of us finally
seeing i chat in the fourth generation
iphone developers and some really
fantastic hackers have gone through the
sdk for OS four point oh and i've gone
through and seen many many instances of
mentioning of ichat they even gone
through to extrapolate icons actually
show what the video chat icon go will
look like so i think we're finally going
to be able to see this looks like a EMTs
network has gotten into shape or bombs
reported which may have been the reason
we didn't see it in previous versions so
video category is something that we are
definitely going to see Apple has been
addressing I'll be it very slowly some
of the biggest concerns and problems
people have had at the iphone operating
system first there was no mms and it was
no cut copy and paste then it was no
multitasking what you now have with
iphone OS four point oh sure to seeing
sort of things one by one start to get
slashed out and the video conferencing
is for the next big thing i think
is do so with OS four point oh we see
multitask and we see folders what we
don't see what we haven't had any sort
of file management system you can't just
put something in a folder and go back
and get it later like you can in OS 10
or Windows you can create folders for
apps but not really folders for
documents we're seeing Universal in
boxes which is something that Apple
definitely needed although I do expect
to that when OS four point oh is finally
launched we'll have some additional mail
features which the mail is really a
lacking application on the iphone
ability to star or flag and better
integration i think with online storage
and exchange servers are sometimes going
to be coming but no all you guys drop
there wondering what about an iphone on
verizon well I've gone on the record as
saying I didn't think one was coming of
it saying it for years however it looks
like this may be the year we finally do
see an iphone on verizon other than
rumor circulating that AT&amp;amp;T exclusivity
is actually going to end with this
upcoming device so if we were ever going
to get an iphone on verizon i think
we've got the best chance of seeing it
on the fourth generation phone which
again looks like we could end up seeing
towards the tail end of june which would
be really quite nice the other hardware
manufacturers and software manufacturers
hopefully cut up to Apple I think Apple
set the bar very high for generation
iphone and we had web OS and Android
even now Microsoft's Windows Phone 7
which dropped the series from its name
I'm trying to give Apple a good run for
their money they're being forced to
compete now it forced to re innovate
between the original iphone the iphone
3g okay we got a 3g radio from the 3g to
the 3gs we got better processor and more
ramp that incremental flash storage
increases which i would expect as well
for the 4g nothing really big and i
think a video chat weirdly be the killer
features at the other platforms least in
the u.s. just aren't offering instead of
talking about the flash increase I think
we'll see a jump from the 32 largest now
size up to 64 and probably have 64 32
configurations for the iphone 4g which
is a ton of space for mobile device and
something i think would really be the
sweet spot for these mobile phones so
what do you guys think about the iphone
4g
I think that Apple's got a few sort of
aces up their sleeve with tricks they
haven't showed us yet I think the
biggest strict is going to show us is
going to be video chatting so guys you
agree/disagree any future you love to
see you think your brides and iPhones
coming or iPhone on another carrier
t-mobile or sprint I'd love to hear from
you either text or video response any
