Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo and we're
finally here checking out the brand new
Galaxy s6 it was just announced in
Mobile World Congress today so you're
looking at what Samsung called zero
project zero internally and that was a
total reimagine of the design of a
galaxy device so here you have an
aluminium body running all around it
gone is the plastic and then on both
sides you have glass you can see it's so
reflective here although it was
purposely built so you can see it really
well outdoors too we're told any case
there's Gorilla Glass 4 both on the back
and the front so it should be really a
scratch resistant you know it won't
shatter as well or it won't shatter
shouldn't shatter and then let's go
through this software user interface
here you're looking at Android 5.0
lollipop with a brand new version of
TouchWiz they said they got rid of 40%
of this stuff here so you're not gonna
see a lot of bloatware just pretty basic
stuff pre-loaded on the phone I'm just
going through the features you have a 5
megapixel camera right up front you can
acts actually activate that by a quick
double tap of the home button and they
said it made a wide-angle and better for
taking shots in all kinds of situations
for light going around the phone you
have on the left here the two volume
control buttons and again this feels
really nice because it's metal on the
bottom you have the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the microUSB charging and
a speaker port which was moved from the
back and is 1.5 times louder than on the
Galaxy s5 samsung told us and then on
the right-hand side here you have the
SIM card tray and then also the power
button within each easy reach here at
all times now under the hood you have a
XE no seven series processor it's a
64-bit octa-core chip Samsung's not
specifically telling us what's gonna
happen in the United States just yet
whether they go with Qualcomm or not but
this is the international unit and in
that case you're getting an X eNOS chip
up front you have an IR blaster and a
microphone and then on the back you have
a heart rate monitor as the LED flash
and then a 16 megapixel camera
and improved here focuses on speed
improvements in low-light and all kinds
of other areas so should take really
great pictures pictures and samsung says
it should be a lot quicker to so we'll
just go again through the apps milk
video milk and eventually you should see
milk VR because this will support or
actually it'll work with its own gear VR
unit like we saw with the note 4 um so
some other features here three gigs of
lamb under the hood
it also has wireless charging built-in
for both standards in the United States
so I believe it's WPA and power matters
alliance so it'll work both and that's
it's already built in here so you don't
need a special cover or anything like
that
also wireless charging should be quicker
than before and then Samsung improved
its charging for the base 2 so if you
plug it in you should get about 2 hours
of video playback within just 10 minutes
so really awesome there and then I just
love how thin the design is here too so
you have wireless charging the octa-core
processor great cameras everything
built-in it look like that was showing
you teensy there than maybe that's just
a simmer all into this device and it
feels really quick and everything like
that new version of s health it looks
like although we haven't been briefed on
that so we'll try to play with that a
little bit more
and then finally the home button here is
home to a touch fingerprint scanner so
unlike before where you had to swipe it
and it didn't always work as well this
time you just hold your finger there and
it'll work and it'll actually work with
magnetic stripe check outs in 90% of
retailers around the world so and it
also supports NFC if he wants you but if
it doesn't support NFC the retailer
you're at you can use magnetic swipe to
get that working so in any case quick
look here at the Galaxy s6 and sorry one
last thing here of course the 5.1 inch
quad HD display which we expect it to
come here looks fantastic Super AMOLED
and everything like that so quick look
here galaxy s6 metal body glass on both
sides really awesome looking phone this
