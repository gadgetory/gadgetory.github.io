to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a mark in Sangin from TechnoBuffalo
and in today's episode of rumor roundup
we're going to be talking about the new
moto 360 Motorola is three new qhd
phones and Samsung's Galaxy s6 active
this is rumor roundup so let's go ahead
and get started last week we got a first
taste of what the Moto X 2015 may offer
when it launches later this year now a
new report reveals that Motorola may
already be testing the third-generation
flagship phone out in public in addition
to two other phones according to one
Reddit user Android leaks Motorola is
testing three new phones in or around
Chicago all three variants feature a qHD
display operates on verizon and running
android 5.1 point one lollipop we also
get three new model numbers xt 1578 xt
1585 and xt 192 a droid life points out
that none of these numbers really match
up with other Motorola's recent lineup
it is possible that one of these could
be the new Moto X 2015 but we have no
evidence to back that up yet it's
unclear if this leak means Motorola will
solve three new devices through verizon
this year though that wouldn't be out of
the ordinary for Motorola since they've
done that several times in the past with
a droid razr HD droid razr maxx enjoyed
razor mini hopefully we'll get to know
more about Motorola's playing for these
three new qhd devices very soon second
rumor of the day goes to Motorola yet
again rumors of a new Moto 360 have been
floating around for a while now but the
updated SmartWatch may finally be within
reach a new Motorola gadget passing
through bluetooth certification this
week appears to be the alleged wearable
device the gadget in question isn't
listed by name but we do get a model
number Motorola's be tmw 03 seems like a
clear successor to the original moto 360
which went by the model number be tmw 01
joy lie points out the first-generation
moto 360 didn't show up for bluetooth
certification until August 2014 just
before he got an official launch that
suggests the updated version of the Moto
360 could be announced in a very near
future maybe even at google i/o later
this month though there's no guarantee
Motorola won't wait a full year to
unveil the new version of the Moto 360
based on earlier leaks we're expecting
the new Moto 360 to come in more sizes
and color options it could support a
larger lugs at the top and bottom of the
watch face making it much easier to swap
in different Bay
hands finally we should expect Motorola
to get rid of that small black strip
along the bottom of the display so
hopefully we'll hear more during I oh

check out now are you not impressed by
the galaxy s6 and it's sleek metal
design I personally like the design of
the s6 and s6 edge but in case you don't
Samsung has an answer with that rugged
and unrefined galaxy s6 active images of
the rumoured handset leaked out this
week we're viewing the rumored rugged
smartphone for photos that leaked this
week shows the galaxy s6 active from the
front and back it looks pretty similar
to Samsung's earlier active handsets
sporting three physical buttons and a
heavily armored rear panel it's not ugly
by any means but it can't compete with
the flagship galaxy s6 and it looks
department reports are saying that the
galaxy s6 active may also feature a huge
3500 milliamp battery and a 5 points you
qhd display the device is apparently
being referred to internally as n0 which
could be a reference to the project zero
code name use for the galaxy s6 we still
don't know when Samsung will actually
unveil the device but it seems like the
perfect phone to ship in time for the
summer if you have any more details
about the s6 active we'll be sure to
keep you guys posted over at
