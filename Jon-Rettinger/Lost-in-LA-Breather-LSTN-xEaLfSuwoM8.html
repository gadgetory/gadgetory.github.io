technobuffalo and I'm not sure if you
guys have heard but there is a new app
called breather out and it's not a new
app period it's a new app to here in Los
Angeles the idea is that you book of
space you take an hour half an hour two
hours out of your day you can work you
can meditate you can relax you can catch
a breath it's been released in New York
and San Francisco for a while now and
getting a rave reviews so when it came
down lay I really wanted to try it out
and use it as a spot to film changeup
location and review these brand new
listen headphone so it's two for one I
also got to try the new app out let's go
ahead and get started right out the gate
the app was very well designed very
simple clean intuitive no problems
booking the space it took me like 30
seconds however it took me a lot longer
than 30 seconds to actually find the
space because breather gave me the wrong
address let me explain the breather app
told me to go to 8 45 south los angeles
street but when looking at the map
within the app it was pointing me to a
complete different place that happened
to be a construction site when i went to
apple maps it was pointing me somewhere
else turns out the marker that breather
made within the map on their app was
completely wrong sorry if that's
confusing so i spent a good 15 minutes
of wasted money that i'd spent on the
breather space looking for the space
itself asking random bartenders where I
should be going however once I got there
everything was good enough the space was
awesome clean and simple the big
question here is what do I think of the
service I think it's great I don't
really see myself using it especially in
a place like la given how sprawled out
the city is I'm sure it makes more sense
in places like New York or San Francisco
where you can walk from point A to point
B but with a place excelled in
California everywhere you go you have to
drive go through traffic look for
parking that in itself add so much time
that the 30 minutes of bliss that you
get in a breather space just doesn't
seem worth it to add another destination
to your trip but I still do really like
the app in theory so I want to go ahead
and try it out when I'm in San Francisco
when I'm in New York and hopefully it's
better there now moving on to the listen
troubadours other than being a cool
funky retro looking pair of headphones I
really like listen as a company because
they're a for purpose organization based
here in LA for every pair of headphones
sold they work with the Starkey Hearing
Foundation to provide hearing aids to
people in less fortunate situations much
like toms or warby parker
for a lot of people that's going to be
more than a reason enough to support
listen as a company and I highly
recommend you do design is always a very
subjective thing but I think the
troubadours look awesome they look like
something out of The Aviator with metal
finishes would nice glossy feel as per
comfort i found the earcups to be a
little small maybe because i have giant
will smith years but i found it after
long periods of wearing it would get a
little bit uncomfortable fantastic for
short periods though for like 30 minutes
an hour hour and a half they were great
let's talk sound quality when dealing
with compressed audio which is what
comes out of Spotify Apple music youtube
that kind of stuff the troubadours are
more than good enough for the average
listener you can enjoy them they sound
fine it is a slightly different story
when you look at specs something like
the Troubadour has a frequency response
of 18 hertz to 20 kilohertz whereas
something like the audio technica ath m
50s have 15 hertz to 20 8 kilohertz so a
significantly wider and flatter sound
profile but for me it really boils down
to what you're looking to do with these
headphones even though it's not as flat
of a sound profile the more bass heavies
type sound is very welcome for casual
listening it's a pleasure to listen to
hip-hop rap EDM electronic music some
dubstep all that kind of good stuff with
heavier 808 sand sub bases those lower
frequencies come in very hard and
powerful still leaving room for the mids
and the highs to be crisp and clean and
so what's the final verdict on these
headphones i would say i highly
recommend them for a bunch of reasons
having great sounding headphones from a
company that supports an amazing cause
they're well designed is nothing really
to complain about along that you get
things like the nylon not entangle cord
you get a great pouch to put the
headphones in on the go it's very well
designed i don't really have any major
complaints here obviously i'm aware
there are always going to be a lot of
better cheaper headphones out there on
the market but I think you'll be
hard-pressed to find a pair of
headphones that look quite as cool retro
and behind quite as cool of a cause as
the troubadours are for anyone who's an
audiophile music maker or whatever it
may be mixing I would not recommend
these headphones there's many other
options out there that'll get you more
bang for your buck but for the average
listener who's looking for a cool
looking package behind a cool cause at a
decent price I definitely recommend you
check these out and so that's it for
this video guys let me know what you
think of breather the headphones the
whole package the whole video style i do
want to know I do like talk to me you
guys i want your feedback in the
comments down below
