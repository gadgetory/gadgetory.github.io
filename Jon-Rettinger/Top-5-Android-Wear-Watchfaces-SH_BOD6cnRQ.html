to you by ting mobile that makes sense
what's going on guys the Marklin segment
from TechnoBuffalo and today we're going
to be checking out our top 5 watch faces
for Android wear so let's get on with
the video the first watch face on the
list would have to be the crown watch
face it's compatible with both the LG G
watch and Samsung gear live though it
says under description that the specific
watch face is optimized for AMOLED
screens meaning the gear life has a
slight advantage over the G watch's IPS
LCD display Chron features this nice
round bright digital design that
displays the hour minutes seconds and
the date right below that it also
features a dim mode if you have
always-on enabled free device which will
turn the watch face to a monochrome and
dim your screen to save on battery life
unfortunately notifications on
third-party watch faces like this one
will cover a pretty much the entire
screen which can be a bit annoying but
as of now developers won't be able to
fix this and so Google releases the
proper API to developers the second one
on the list is called weather wear watch
face it's a pretty unique watch face
that shows information like today's
weather or what the next few days is
going to look like battery % and of
course the time and date like most of
the apps nowadays in today's App Store
this one is more of a freemium app the
basic watch face already looks good but
there are tons of options and features
that are unfortunately only for pro
users like the ability to configure the
watch face in every part using your
phone the option of vibrate to watch
every hour to let me know I've been
editing for too long and there's many
many more here that you can customize
the default watch face will do for the
average Joe and if you want to change
things up a bit with this watch face
then you have those extra features to
choose from the third one on the list
would have to be modern classics the
thing I love about Samsung's watch face
selections are that they include a bunch
of watch faces that already looks great
modern classics looks a lot like a
regular modern watch and the clean and
simplistic looks just won me over modern
classics includes a built-in battery
indicator so you don't have to keep
swiping down to check your battery which
can sometimes be a bit of a hassle when
you're on the go and that's pretty much
it it's clean simplistic and I think
it's a true eye candy especially if you
have a round watch face like the Moto 3
or the LGG watch our so let's take a
quick break from this video and thank
our friends over at ting so what take
endures no plans you're not forced to
pick a plan based on what you assume
you'll use in each month there are no
hidden admin fees or sketchy charges and
ting bills are simple and easy to
understand and they only charge you six
dollars per device and the tax and your
usage per month bottom line consumers
were overpaying and underserved and
current customers would ting will likely
see a significant decrease in their
monthly bill so go check out the rates
page at TechnoBuffalo ting comm to see
what your new lower Bill's gonna look
like and again that's TechnoBuffalo ting
comm fourth one on the list is speeds
watchface it's from the same developer
as modern classics and it's relatively
the same kind of watch face but with a
much thicker clock hands and the
addition of the speedometer that
separated as an individual app it's
ideal for most cyclists or runners or
even when you're driving and it seems to
be pretty accurate when we tried it out
it does use a GPS on your phone so it
can impact already horrible battery life
on your G watch or Gear Live so just be
aware of that last but not least Tech's
face for Android wear if you've ever
used a pebble or familiar with what the
pebble looks like already the tech space
for Android wear is a pretty cool watch
face it's a lot like the default Pebble
watch face and on Android wear there's a
few more add-ons here like today's date
the day and shows your battery
information when the screen is them now
all of these watch faces come with their
own individual app that you can
customize through your phone and all of
these are free on the Google Play Store
Google promised third-party developers
that make and watch faces for Android
wear devices will be much easier in the
future but these are some of the cool is
available right now anyways that's it
for this video guys if you guys have any
suggestions on which apps or watch faces
we should try out next just let us know
in the comments down below and as always
a Marklin setting it from TechnoBuffalo
