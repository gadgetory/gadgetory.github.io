to you by godaddy is the Amazon tablet
coming this October and bring in a
kindle with it a kindle with a
touchscreen is Windows Phone 7 launching
the next breed of devices code named
mango this September and was it leaked
thanks to somebody's Twitter account
Europe's favorite streaming music
service finally lands in the US but as
the USS favorite streaming video service
in trouble what they raise their rates
so much anyway blogger on blogger
violence will it ever stop this week
it's all things D vs TechCrunch there
are a ton of new phones John was in New
York I was in the San Francisco we
covered a whole bunch of them and what's
in this box anyway it's technol buffalos
rumor roundup
hey what's going on everybody I'm Noah
crowds from TechnoBuffalo and welcome to
the roundup for today july 15 2011 this
episode of the rumor roundup is brought
to you by godaddy and unfortunately I do
not have a godaddy girl with me here to
read that ad copy to you I can try but
I'm neither a racecar driver nor do I
look like a racecar driver if you get my
drift anyway I hope you're all doing
well busy busy week lots of new phones
launched this week lots of stuff going
on let's get right to it as always you
can get more especially on all those
phones that came out the status those
new Sony tablets were showing off the
mytouch slide 4g all kinds of stuff
going on whatever is in this box over on
TechnoBuffalo calm you can you can stay
on top of all of it including our own
jon rettinger hands on coverage from New
York City this week so check that out
after you watch this because this is all
about the rumors the Amazon tablet may
be arriving at long last but it might
not be arriving this summer like many of
us hoped instead the latest reports
latest rumors have the tablet dropping
in October and it looks like we are
going to see two devices but possibly
not you know the rumors change every day
and the latest is that it may be one
touchscreen tablet based on Android
probably the gingerbread version of
Android although it might be 22 and
probably a single core tablet not a dual
core tablet probably not with a camera
but honestly I don't think all that
stuff matters because Amazon's target
audience generally care about that stuff
they just want this thing to work and
they want to use amazon services the
books the magazines the streaming music
the streaming video the shopping all
that stuff and you can bet your bottom
dollar that you can bet your sweet bippy
whatever that means that the amazon tab
that will have access to all those
things i think we're going to see a big
push around streaming video content
amazon is going to keep pumping up there
amazon watch instant or their instant
video whatever they call it watch
instance Netflix we're going to head to
myself there their video offerings
perhaps tied into prime but in any rate
looks like we're going to be seeing that
device in October and with it a touch
screen kindle perhaps to battle the
touch screen note that
I think is the best ereader out there
right now I love that thing so I stay
tuned for more but it looks like it'll
be you know October maybe four lucky
September for the Amazon tablet and a
second device probably a touchscreen
ereader speaking of mobile device is
slated to come out this fall an
inadvertent tweet that was pulled down
or maybe it was planned maybe it was
like a little show-and-tell little you
know a little flash and and put it back
in that's mushroom do that on camera
anyway but it's my official NBA lockout
protest sweatshirt just so everybody
knows and the lockout okay enough of
that anyway whoever it is behind the
official Twitter account for Microsoft's
imagine cup competition may have
inadvertently or on purpose narrowed
down the launch window for the new batch
of Windows Phone 7 devices to be running
with us on 7.5 mango now hopefully
probably in all likelihood this will
include the first batch of nokia windows
phone devices and could also include a
samsung phone that was also sort of was
it leaked was it not what was going on
there showing off very briefly at a
microsoft partner conference earlier
this week this phone looks a lot like
the samsung galaxy s2 which is a super
high-end Android device hasn't hit the
states yet but launched in other
countries and our just one of the
hottest phones on the market so a device
like this would be huge for Microsoft's
Windows Phone 7 efforts I go along with
120 120 million dollar ad campaign that
Nokia apparently is cooking up for I for
their part in the lodge but at any rate
this this tweets it something about how
all imagine cup finalists will receive
windows phone 7.5 mango the newest
release and they'll get their phones by
September so who knows that could be
pinpointing a September launch date it
could just be saying that they're going
to get current phones with 7.5 on them
or maybe they're prototypes or who knows
what but the tweet has been pulled down
you can get more information from our
own adriana lee over on the website but
you know we've been talking about a fall
time frame for the official release of
mango which has been you know showing
off and putting developers hands and
everything
for a little while now so you know fall
release September all kinds of lines up
so I stay tuned for more on this story
in the coming months moving from things
that will be coming eventually we think
we hope to things that are here right
now tap it on the box again Spotify
Europe's favorite or one of their
favorite streaming music services has
finally landed in the US just yesterday
it went live it's an invite only thing a
very small number of invites I got an
invite and I had a link to invite up to
five other people and I posted it on
Twitter on Facebook and people told me
immediately now the links dead man sorry
so you know stay tuned for that this
whole whole exclusivity thing with you
know Facebook started out that way and
then Google+ recently and now spotify
invite only build a buzz whatever anyway
Spotify streaming music with a ton of
Facebook and other social networking
integration there's a free plan there's
a five dollar a month plan there's a
ten-dollar month plan the ten-dollar
month plan gets you access on mobile
devices as well as your desktop clients
also there's sonos integration some
integration with other devices going on
so I am psyched i get this video over
with so I can check out Spotify and see
if it really lives up to the hype but
I'm very excited to try it out you can
do some cool stuff like you can you know
build playlist and share them with other
people and that kind of thing so maybe
we'll have to get an official
technobuffalo spotify playlist going so
keep your eyes open for that and of
course if you are a spotify user
especially if you're not in the US if
you're in Europe and you've been using
it you know definitely hit us up go over
the site his up in the comments or find
me on Twitter find the official
technobuffalo count let us know what you
think let us know some of the tips and
tricks for us newbie American users
finally getting to use Spotify speaking
of American users of streaming media
netflix announced price hikes earlier
this week that have a bunch of people up
in arms basically you get all the
details over in the site but basically
what they did was they took the model of
799 for unlimited streaming plus two
dollars a month for one DVD at a time
that was the base plan that's the plan i
actually have so 10 bucks a month for
unlimited streaming plus one disc out at
a time
and they split it up and effectively
raise the rates by sixty percent so that
plan now went from ten bucks a month to
sixteen dollars a month eight dollars
for unlimited streaming eight dollars
for one DVD out at a time and then they
have another plant it's more expensive
if you want two dvds at a time or you
can just go streaming only for eight
bucks one disc only for eight bucks so a
lot of backlash to run that allah
discussion people up in arms they
basically you know raise the rates
without offering anything new and it was
such a big price hike in terms of
percentages still you know 16 bucks a
month for unlimited streaming plus one
disc at a time is a pretty good deal but
apparently netflix has just been
spending a ton not only on licensing the
content that they put out and also
developing their own content but also
the streaming costs themselves so you
know it had to give because that was
just such a good deal for 10 bucks a
month it has to give eventually it gave
now maybe the way they did it not the
best way in customers eyes to bring on
that change existing subscribers won't
have to move to the new price plans
until September so we've got a couple
months to decide you know is it worth it
we just you know eat the cost it's
really only six bucks a month depending
what plan you have or do I go streaming
only or DVD only and then spend that
other money may be on hulu plus maybe on
Amazon maybe I get my DVDs from redbox
now and you know save a couple bucks but
actually drive no pickup spot I don't
know if you're a big watcher of
streaming media and you get your discs
through the mail as well definitely let
us know what you think what you plan to
do me I'm cutting the cord i am cutting
the cord this summer and we'll see how
it goes but i'm going to rewrite some of
the money I spend on my cable TV bill
into more streaming media because I just
not worth it especially if there's no I
be a blogger on blogger violence it's
got to end increase the peace we're all
in it together last week I talked about
the war between X and gadget errs and
well not really current and geysers but
in gadgets management AOL another AOL
property in the I hope this doesn't
become a regular feature but in the
blocker Wars segment
this week TechCrunch owned by AOL has a
bone to pick with all things D which is
the wall street journal's digital block
I TechCrunch writer mg Siegler called
out all things D writer in a freed for
running an article which basically
referred to something that was posted on
tech arms that secret up several weeks
ago and not including a link back to the
TechCrunch article now this is the
second time in just the past few weeks
that all things D and actually the same
writer has been called out from not
linking back to original source I daring
fireball which is a mac app people call
me mac fanboy mac enthusiast shall we
say to use all things DS language mac
enthusiast john gruber runs this site
during fireball it's huge in the Mac
community and he called them out from
not linking back to a source on a macro
later article a couple weeks ago and
just this week just yesterday on
Thursday there was some stuff on during
fireball pointing to a post on mg
Siegler personal blog about a techcrunch
article it didn't have a link and once
they were once all thing I mean all
things D article linking back to tech
crimes that didn't have a link once it
was called out all things do you went
back and added the link in but some
name-calling going on all kinds of stuff
I'll tell you this i firmly believe if
you're going to source somebody you
gotta link back to them that's how the
web works that's how it goes but you
know is there a way to can we settle
this privately do we have to call people
out or do you have to be called out to
you know to change I don't know you tell
me but all you bloggers out there make
sure you link back to your sources and
attribute the original sources because
you know when you get that big scoop and
everybody else is running it you want
their links back that's how you grow
traffic the tiger audience that's how it
