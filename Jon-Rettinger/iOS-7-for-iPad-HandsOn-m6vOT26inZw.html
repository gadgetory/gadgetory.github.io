TechnoBuffalo here we are checking out
iOS 7 for the iPad this time around we
have it set up and there are some
differences between this and the iPhone
version obviously because of scale so
let's check it out okay so we are gonna
wake up our iPad here you can see we
have a couple of new features this is
the control center so now you can
actually look at that I'm assuming if
you don't have a security code setup I
really like the addition of these five
quick options so do not disturb mode
orientation lock Bluetooth Wi-Fi and of
course airplane mode for when the FAA is
gonna take give us the right to have our
iPads on while we take off which will be
really nice so let's slide to unlock and
let's check out the homescreen so here
it is this is iOS 7 not at first glance
not a whole lot different than iOS 6
it's still the same icon grid that we've
seen traditionally from Apple but there
are some changes so you'll notice in the
calendar there is no more foe calendar
so this skeuomorphism calendar with this
sort of torn off edge over here and the
upper corner is no longer there this
really nice year view we're able to get
a nice glance of your year as a whole
and of course month week day you can see
they've gone with this sort of white and
red color theme I'm gonna move on so we
can check out lots of other stuff so
here's notes it's no longer a yellow
legal notepad which I always thought
looked ridiculous and they've now just
sort of changed this there's actually a
little bit of a texture to the screen
when you're looking at it it's really
interesting it just looks like paper so
it looks as if this is typed on paper
and I don't know if we can get that on
camera but it is there and it's very
very subtle and very interesting on
really quickly this is the new share
icon and here are those line art
versions of copy print we'll see some
more later in a different app but we
also have our message mail and different
so you'll see in this bar here so one of
the things just keep in mind that this
bar and this Share Option is in the
upper right hand corner because there's
something design-wise that I have a
little bit of an issue with that I'm
hoping they fix before the official
release candidate comes out later this
year
so that's notes really simple
straightforward reminders same type of
thing they also have this kind of
textured paper that I I wish you guys
could really see in detail it's it's
pretty subtle which I prefer as opposed
to the straightforward the very
straightforwardness of that legal pad
that bright yellow legal pad with marker
felts as the default font we have of
course our photos now we can look at
collections we can look at years so of
course we don't have a lot of pictures
on our lovely on our lovely office iPad
but if we're looking at some things say
we wanted to look at this totally random
picture I discovered on it of dog a
redshirt dog wearing Vulcan ears here's
that picture now going back to this year
button this time in photos the share
button is down on the bottom left which
to me seems like a design flaw and I I
tend to like to have my options in the
same place for every single first party
app so more line art so we have some
different options here assigned a
contact airplay uses wallpaper print
copy slideshow we also have message mail
iCloud Twitter Facebook and Flickr for
sharing and I'm sure those will increase
as you install other apps that will work
with iOS 7 but yeah that's photo I as I
said I didn't care for the fact that
they've kind of moved these icons around
just what feels willy-nilly to me so
let's take a look at Game Center I find
Game Center to be very interesting I'm
glad that they changed the icon because
oh that's another thing that's a little
bit interesting in this particular beta
of this first beta you have these really
lovely animations for when you go into a
folder from your home screen but if it's
in your dock it just pops up so I'm sure
Apple will fix that but it's definitely
something that somebody should bug
report at some point so here we are in
Game Center this is very different from
the look and
you love before it's along the same
lines but not quite what we had before
so here's our lovely games turns
challenges you can see everything
recommended games so they'll say hey
like we see that you are playing these
games and that your friends are playing
these games maybe you want to check them
out so Ralph here at the office has been
playing infinity blade and infinity
blade - so it says hey maybe you want to
check that game out if we have any
challenges they would be in here we
don't have any right now obviously but I
just wanted to show you guys game center
really quickly one thing I'm really
excited about the ability to put
newsstand into a folder finally I don't
have to look at that hideous wood
shelving on my iPad anymore and also
they've they've made this much much
nicer so now you have this beautiful
sort of again with the flat design it's
not made to look like something in real
life but newsstand I think it just looks
spectacular and one of the things that I
really like about it is that when you
press the home button you're no longer
taken to your home screen it takes you
right back to whatever folder you were
in when you when you originally launched
the app let's go and check out series so
Siri now has the ability to do a couple
of new things we can now pick language
so if we wanted Siri to have maybe a
British accent
we could pick English United Kingdom and
we can also pick if you have English
u.s. you can actually pick the gender of
series so we can pick a male Siri or a
female Siri so if we wanted to pick male
let's do that and let's go and boot up
Siri Siri what is Star Wars about
it's about a couple of really nice
robots who get mixed up in a silly
intergalactic war so there we have a
male Siri telling us what Star Wars is
about funny and on an Easter Egg if you
didn't know Siri would tell you of funny
stories about movies with robots in them
so yeah that's pretty much it will let's
try to get the the parallax feel of this
I'm trying to find the best way to sort
of show it off but you can see it's very
subtle and if you're into something a
little less subtle you can go into your
settings and your brightness and
wallpaper and there are actually dynamic
wallpapers so very similar to live
wallpapers and Android you have this
wallpaper preview you can set this as
your lockscreen your homescreen or both
so let's just set it as both because we
can so now when we go back to our home
screen you can see it's alive its living
another thing they've gotten rid of is
you'll notice if you swipe this way
there's nothing there you can't search
but actually it's just right here you
just slide down just a little bit and
now you can search iPad we also have a
new flatter keyboard but pretty much the
same that we've seen before if we double
click on the home button we can get our
multitasking windows up and this is
obviously something very new to iOS 7
before I used to have the dock bar where
you could just swipe through your app
icons you couldn't actually see what was
on the screen or where you left off now
you can see so if I want to go back to
this lovely our lovely dog friend in his
red shirt costume with Vulcan ears we
can do that and then we can switch right
back to anything else that we were doing
which is pretty cool
we're big fans of that and it's a lot
easier to navigate and remember what you
were doing in a particular app so so
that's always a nice feature to have and
one that iOS users have certainly been
asking for so that is a very short tour
of iOS 7 for iPad I'm sure as time goes
on the Apple developers and everybody
working on iOS 7 to make sure that it is
bug free will smooth out a lot of the
kinks that are happening I know we've
had a lot of reboots and things like
that but it has to be expected on an
early beta
for something so that is ios7 and we
hope you enjoyed it and we'll see you
next video
