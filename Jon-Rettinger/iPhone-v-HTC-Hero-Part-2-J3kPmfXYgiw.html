technobuffalo here with part two of my
feature comparison of the iphone 3gs and
the HTC hero today we're going to cover
their respective app stores and app
downloading capabilities as well as the
built-in native YouTube viewing
experience let's go ahead and get
started one of the things that the
iphone is really known for and I think
one of its biggest selling points is its
App Store there really is an app for
everything and I think that it helps to
fill in some of the emissions in the
holes in the iphone operating system if
you want a scientific calculator there
is an app for that if you want a
financial management software there's an
app for that I know it sound like that
cheesy iphone commercial but there
really is an app for everything although
you do stay with an apple sort of walled
garden iTunes environment if you can
deal with that there really is a quite a
bit of applications out there so let me
show you what this app store looks like
there's an icon that comes on every
iphone now it says App Store and here
you go you've got your feature your
categories your top 25 your search and
your updates if the application has an
update available and you can scroll
through and really search by categories
whatever you want like I just said so
let's say I pick one so it's Weber on
the grill this is a 409 application you
can read about it you can see what the
user ratings are and you can scroll down
you get some screenshots looks like some
grilling recipes here if you want to
view the ratings you can go ahead hit
the ratings right there and you can see
what people are saying about it seems
like people are really enjoying it and
this is tied to your iTunes account so
when you want to download it your build
just as you would have if you download a
song from your computer on iTunes and if
you would like to download it you just
go ahead and hit the button hit by now
type in your password and it will be
downloaded a lot of these can be
downloaded over 3g although if they're a
little bit larger it's going to require
a Wi-Fi connection most of the
applications in here do cost some degree
of money although there are some lighter
free versions of a majority of them I'd
say most of the apps are generally
around that
99 cent to dollar frame so definitely no
you're going to have to spend a couple
bucks Apple does keep an almost
draconian rule over the apps that go
into their app store so if you can deal
with apples limitations you're going to
find there are a lot of things in here
that are great to play around with there
are games calculators all kinds of stuff
that really think that you will enjoy
and obviously apples done a fantastic
job I think with their app store
although people do have issues with
their restrictions I can certainly
sympathize with that so that is the app
store on the iphone 3gs if you have the
same experience on the 3g as well let's
go ahead and take a look at the Android
Marketplace found on the HTC hero and
other Android devices let's go ahead and
unlock it I don't have a sim card in
here right now so I'm going to get an
emergency dialing screen but not a big
deal and you've got the android
marketplace right here with that little
android guy squared away thing i do like
that logo so go ahead and open it up and
i can view by popularity and by date
it's not as graphically impressive as
the iphones app catalog but app store
but who cares as long as the apps are
there you can view by popularity and by
date you can view by a whole bunch of
different categories you can view by
communications entertainment finance and
a ton of others and this is very fluid
when you go through and scroll let's go
ahead and just hit all applications for
example so you see obviously what the
application is let's go ahead and click
say myspace mobile those you a little
bit about if you want to hit install you
go ahead and just hit install you can
view more applications you can send an
email to the developer you can flag it
as inappropriate and you can read some
of the comments and star ratings on it
as well one thing i will say about the
android marketplace is you're going to
be hard pressed to find applications
that cost some money most of them in
here are free which is fantastic and a
lot of them are really great
applications and the same things that
cost of money on the iphone are free on
android which is quite nice I don't mind
telling you the android marketplace is
much
open than the itunes and the apple app
store really people can post what they
want as long as they're not malicious
app so you get a ton of very strange
apps I saw one app in here that was
follow me on Twitter and it was just
like one guy up an application that he
made people to follow him on Twitter
it's kind of weird but if you like the
openness of it really the android
marketplace is fantastic and if you want
to download an application just go ahead
and install and much like the iphone i
really found that there is an app for
everything found on android i think
they've done a really nice job and short
amount of time we're putting together a
developer friendly sdk that is now very
very heavily populated so hands off to
google and the various handset
manufacturers for making it nice and
easy for developers I really have to
call this this one a draw if you like
the sort of again walled garden found on
the iPhone and I came to that you're
going to get with the applications you
may get developers that spend more time
on applications on the iPhone because I
think there's more of a revenue stream
there there's more of a larger user base
for them so you may find some more
applications on the App Store but you're
going to get more openness on the
android marketplace what's really going
to come down to your personal preference
I think both companies really did
fantastic jobs with this so next let's
go ahead and check out the youtube
hearing experience if you're watching
this video odds are you use youtube
since you're watching this on it so if
you're like me i watch youtube videos
all the time in fact when I go to bed I
like to watch the most viewed videos of
the day and see what's going on let me
show you what the YouTube viewer looks
like on the iphone go ahead and tap
YouTube and you can view your videos by
feature you can view of most viewed
search favorites or more so here I meant
featured I'm actually doing the most
featured for the week you can view most
viewed by today this week or all and you
get the title of the video and you get
who it's by and the star rankings let's
go ahead and pack the mean kitty song by
the mean kitty which is cory williams
from SMP films and it just starts
playing and it plays just in landscape
go ahead and stop it here
but you can see what it looks like
there's not a portrait view when you're
done watching the video you get the
information about it you get the tags
you get the category a day it was added
and if you're signed in you get these
comments and rating systems that you can
go ahead and put in your own comments
actually is quite nice and easy and
using the 3gs you can actually upload
videos directly to youtube right from
your phone using the built-in camcorder
video playback is quite smooth and fluid
even over 3g on end certainly you're
going to have some playback issues but
if you've got a nice 3g signal or if
you're at home over Wi-Fi playback is
generally nice and smooth and if it's an
HD video it looks fantastic on the
iPhone one thing the iphone does very
well is video playback and youtube here
is no exception let's go ahead and move
on to maybe a device that you haven't
seen and this is the youtube viewer on
the HTC hero obviously we'll go home go
ahead and go to the applications and
youtube is found down at the bottom
there it is youtube go ahead open that
up and much like the android marketplace
you get a less impressive graphically
application but you do get very
full-featured one so let me show you
what this looks like here rotate the
screen and you've got just a simple grid
view with thumbnails of the video and
you can view it by most popular most
viewed top-rated so we're going to say
most popular for example and here are
the most popular videos and you get the
name and the star rate let's go ahead
just pick one of them and it starts to
play and like the iphone as well it only
plays in landscape mode go ahead and
just pause this year and i will say
that's video playback on the HTC hero is
also fantastic same rules apply if
you're on Wi-Fi or i assume if you're on
3g since this is an unlock device it
doesn't have us 3g band but if you're in
a country where it does i assume
playback would look just as nice over
edge it's definitely pixelated but i
guess that's what you would expect the
hero handles
quite well if I have to sort of pick a
winner here since you're pulling from
the same content and they both have
YouTube viewers I got to give the edge
of slight edge to the iphone this
because i think the user interface is a
little bit nicer and a little bit more
refined but it is very very very close
and again I think that Google did a
great job putting a quite nice youtube
viewer on the android devices and this
is the same experience that you'll get
with the g one or the mytouch 3G or
whatever other Android device you may be
using while you're watching this video
so guys I hope you enjoy it and one last
thing I want to mention is that you
can't upload videos from the camcorder
on the HTC hero directly to your YouTube
account like you can on the iphone so
overall guys is a very neck and neck
competition is really going to come down
i think the personal preference for
exclusive content be sure to give me a
follow on twitter twitter.com / john for
lakers or if you want to check out
technobuffalo give TechnoBuffalo follow
twitter com splash technobuffalo and i
will see you guys in the next video bye
