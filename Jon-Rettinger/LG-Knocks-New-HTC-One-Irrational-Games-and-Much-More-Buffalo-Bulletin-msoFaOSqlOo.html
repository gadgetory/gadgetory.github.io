Buffalo bulletin time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin we recap stories from
our site technobuffalo calm every
wednesday and friday if you're
interested in reading more about any
story mentioned on the show go ahead and
check the description below for links or
click on the graphics if you have
annotations available and toggled on I'm
Ashley sceva here your top stories
Mobile World Congress is almost upon us
and we're starting to get glimpses of
phones and features will see in full at
the show yesterday LG dropped the teaser
video with some new devices and a new
nut code feature that will be present on
the LG G Pro to knock on already exists
and lets you unlock a device with two
simple taps and knock code expands that
feature by letting you unlock your phone
by tapping four spots on the screen in a
pattern of your choosing it might be
added to existing LG devices but a quick
word of advice tapping shave and a
haircut is totally the 1234 of passwords
HTC dropped some future happenings on us
sending out a save the date for an event
on Tuesday March 25th obviously this is
the event that will introduce us all to
the HTC one's flagship successor but the
invitation is pretty sparse and doesn't
really give any hints as to what the
devices official name might be we're
obviously expecting things like
processor improvements android 4.4
kitkat onboard more boom sound and sent
six the leaks also suggests we might see
surprising features like dual rear
facing cameras on the device will be
covering that event live so don't miss
it over in gaming some big news dropped
yesterday when ken Levine mastermind the
Bioshock franchise announced his studio
irrational games would be shutting down
after the final BioShock Infinite
downloadable content was released
unfortunately ninety percent of the
staff will be let go meaning a lot of
talented people will be out there
looking for new development gigs the
remaining staff will be working with
Lavine to start something much smaller
than irrational with a clearer focus
anna rationals parent company take two
is allowing him to actually do that in
house instead of making him launch his
own startup so good luck to everybody
involved we all like to think we would
like annual releases big-ticket games
like Grand Theft Auto but so we're up to
Strauss Zelnick the take to CEO
oh that will not happen any time soon
basically he says there's so much
quality in their game releases they
would rather make you wait a few years
between major franchise sequels for a
good solid game with a lot of expansion
potential this is a great way to
encourage risk-taking and creativity at
take two studios and honestly as a gamer
it's nice to see a studio not go for an
annual cash grab at the expense of their
franchise madam call of duty sorry just
allergies the wild-card story for today
will hit you right in the nostalgia if
you're a Back to the Future fan Nike
shoe designer Tinker Hatfield said that
those self-tightening Power laces Marty
McFly marbles at and back to the future
two may become a reality by 2015 for
those of you not playing at home that's
the very same year Marty travels to in
the film of course there are a ton of
logistical questions as to how Nike
could even make Power laces a real thing
but since we're not getting a hoverboard
anytime soon this might be the best we
can hope for that's the Buffalo bulletin

thumbs up would be super awesome of you
