TechnoBuffalo here and we are at Google
i/o 2014 taking a look at one of the
coolest looking products that is here
this is a prototype version of the Moto
360 of course being powered by Android
wear look at it it's got a round LCD
it's going to take a real quick first
look so there's something about a round
LCD that just looks cool honestly this
looks like they're just stickers on here
like it shouldn't even be actually
moving but this is the Moto 360 it's set
to demo mode so we can't really work
with it to show you everything it's
gonna do but we can serve briefly give
you an overview but first let's talk
about the design you're gonna see a lot
of Android wear stuff show up the way
this looks is awesome motorola really
put a lot of time into the design and
feel it's almost look really watch like
it's a little bit on the thick side it's
got some heft to it but not too heavy
it's gonna sort of drop your hand down
so very something you can say okay
Google and I'll start showing you
reminders that you can do remind you
call your mom when I get home you go
ahead and scroll left or right if you
want to pulling down well mute it for
you
PC wants service pin a private time also
to show you the battery to go ahead and
swipe to the right you can see if
wanting a quick reply to attach
something if you got it show you what
that'll look like sort of keep swiping
if it'll let me do it on the demo here
reply there we go
so it's a little bit on the limited demo
site here but you will get cards and
stuff that'll show up you've got one
button that'll turn it on and off on the
side a very reminiscent of a normal
watch if you go ahead and turn that on
you can sort of keep swiping
so we're gonna get dinner tonight you
can tap it you swipe it off the screen
that would also swipe off on your phone
as well so the cards do sync up you can
see the weather keeps web you can see a
forecast it's sort of a brief overview
of what you can do with an Android wear
device I also of course Fitness is a big
deal here so count your steps for as
well to make sure you know you're losing
that weight that you want to okay Google
okay a little bit more about what it can
do so take a note and they'll show up on
your Notes app on your Android device
which is really kind of neat just talk
to it most thing I'm excited about
though would be a navigation if I want
to figure out how to walk place I could
do it right from here really handy to
see
it can do okay google and then again
they'll start to go do it
Google now things but when the screen is
off they just have sort of a watch face
on which is kind of tricky to get the
demo unit to show us to do least right
there it looks like a regular watch this
is an incredible scream you don't know
any specs it on it yet the rumor is it's
gonna be about a 320 by 270 display but
Motorola's been really tight-lipped on
we don't know release date we don't know
anything other than fact that we'll be
getting one sometime soon but that watch
looks just like a regular kind of big
face watch and it looks absolutely
awesome I am really excited to see his
neck Motorola absolutely nailed it
anyway guys what device she was excited
about it's moto 360 and while I love to
hear your thoughts on it
