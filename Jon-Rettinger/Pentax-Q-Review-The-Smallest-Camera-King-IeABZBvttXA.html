digital camera workshop I'm Mike Roman
and today I'm reviewing the Pentax Q
does the Q stand for quite lame or a
quality digital imaging device find out
after this awesome intro I'm back with
the camera that represents the Lollipop
Guild the Pentax Q is the world's
smallest interchangeable lens system
camera on the market and the reason is
because this thing packs a back
illuminated 12 megapixel one over 2.3
inch
c MOS sensor that is the smallest sensor
on any interchangeable lens camera in
the intergalactic solar system let's put
the sensor in perspective compared to
the olympus EP m1 which has a 4/3 sized
sensor and the Nikon 1j one which has a
one inside sensor the Pentax qs one over
2.3 in sensor looks like an at stacked
up to a praying mantis so let's talk
image quality because the Pentax Q gave
us a point-and-shoot size sensor we had
more of a point-and-shoot performance I
shot side-by-side with the canon
powershot s 109 con coolpix p 70 100 in
bright light the Pentax Q rivals the s
100 very good performance in bright
light
very few chromatic aberrations I just
found a few purple fringing experiences
along some highly contrasted edges but
that was about it I favored the Canon as
far as its high ISO performance the
Pentax Q is still a very good high ISO
performer but I think the nikon p7100
and canon s100
the Pentax Q little noisier also this
camera shoots 1080p 30 frames per second
video recorded in the h.264 codec now
video quality and bright light pretty
darn good but any time there's any hint
or thought of darkness coming into the
shot this camera is going to be noisy
it's going to noise up the place so
that's another downside I preferred the
s 100 s HD video and the P 70 100 s
video to the Q so to wreak
the Pentax Q rivals some of the best
point-and-shoot cameras on the market
when it comes to image quality
let's talk lenses the Q ships with an F
1.9 which is a very nice bright aperture
lens it's a prime lens which means it
doesn't zoom it's just flat right on
there and it has manual focus ring right
on it
very nice lens we also have this
optional viewfinder that can attach
right to the the top which is a hot shoe
of this camera very nice and it is
optimized for the prime now there are
also other lenses there's a 5 to 15
millimeter zoom lens there's also a
fisheye and - toy camera lenses which
are so small that they look like they
came out of a 50 cent machine and that's
part of the Q's allure this thing is
tiny even the canon powershot s 100 is
taller than it the Pentax Q makes the
olympus EPM won the mini pen look like a
monster truck and I absolutely love the
styling of the Q it's got this retro
front grip panel here it also has a
front dial with four settings that
dictate different digital filters and
color accents we have a rear mounted
control dial there's a rear 4-way
directional pad with ISO and white
balance flash self timer settings we
also have an exposure compensation
dedicated exposure compensation button
and Pentax green button which is
customizable the cameras got a great hot
shoe on top for adding an additional
flash or a viewfinder and it also has a
great built-in flash that pops all the
way up and it looks like Johnny Five
from short circuit this flash is very
bright so I had to dial back the evey
steps while I was shooting with the Q
also it has some great manual controls
shutter speed that can dip down to 30
seconds with a Bulbul mode we also have
white balance grid selection color grid
and we have a built in neutral density
filter and an ISO that reaches 6400
aside from that the Q and Pentax as a
brand in my opinion has the best digital
filters in camera built-in digital
filters you can ask for out there so if
you don't have Photoshop if you don't
have access to advanced photo editing
programs software the Pentax most Pentax
cameras will really do you well this
thing has 19 different digital
filters with individually adjustable
parameters the best thing about this
camera also is that any of those 19
digital filters can be applied after you
take a picture so you can just shoot raw
you could shoot however you want and
then it's applied right after the fact
saves as a copy
you could also develop RAW images right
from within the camera it's a great
thing this this camera really is a
digital tool belt I did have a few
gripes with the Pentax Q one it has a
short battery life to the LCD screen if
there's a 460k pixel resolution I think
it needs to be bumped up to like a 920
in order to be competitive because it
got a little grainy at times also I
found the firmware on the Q to be a
little sluggish at times the AF system
was a little slow to respond also when I
captured certain images depending on the
filter or depending on if I was taking
RAW images it took a long time to
process before I could take the next
picture or I could shut the camera off
or I could jump into playback mode so
firmware a little bit slow aside from
that my major gripe with this camera is
the price it's $750 shipped with the
standard prime lens and let's factor in
some things here if you go for the 5 to
15 millimeter zoom lens that's about 240
bucks if you go for the fisheye lens I
think that's another little under a
hundred bucks we're talking about a
little over a grand for a camera with
the basic one over 2.3 inch sensor and
that's just too steep especially with
the competitors out there you've got the
Micro Four Thirds cameras yeah they're
bigger they're not too much bigger
you've got the Olympus EPM one you've
got the nut new Nikon 1j one camera out
there you've got a lot of the a Sony NEX
series so the Pentax Q needs to be
priced a little more reasonably but
overall I have to be honest the Q is one
of my favorite little cameras I've ever
shot with this thing was just a blast
the amount of times I went this is
awesome while I was unboxing this camera
total way past a hundred I mean this
thing is just it's it's a lot of fun it
really looks like a little toy camera
that is capable of some pretty
high-powered performance I would read
commend the Pentax Q to a beginner or
intermediate photographer or film
student somebody who wants to retain the
awesome size of a point-and-shoot camera
but does not want to get bogged down
with expensive lenses and cinder block
around their shoulder like Nikon d7000
or AOS 5d Mark - even though they're
awesome cameras this is a totally
different market so this has been the
Pentax Q review I'm Mike Perelman for
TechnoBuffalo be sure to go to the site
