to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
from John render from TechnoBuffalo here
they for review for you of the latest
flagship from the marriage of Nokia
Microsoft it is the Lumia icon
no more Lumia numbered name you now have
an actual name for the product let's go
ahead and see if it really is an icon
deserves a spot in your pocket as I get
with all my phone reviews let me give it
asked lamer I used this as my daily
driver for six days the full written
review was done by Brendan Russell he
used it for five days check that out if
you want more photo galleries a little
bit more in depth than what you'll see
in the video before I get into
everything about the phone the specs and
the screen the OS let's first talk about
call quality cuz for at least for me
that's the most important with any new
phone call quality it was pretty awesome
now like any modern phone I didn't have
any drop calls at all least in Southern
California's a little bit subjective
we're blanketed by Verizon LTE
everything on the phone was absolutely
awesome when it came to call quality no
white no is no popping couldn't tell I
was on a cell phone at all so for me the
big monkey in the room is Windows Phone
8.1 we should see it released pretty
soon and allegedly I'll be making its
way to all Lumia devices but we can't
review a device based on what it might
have so if and when the icon does get
the update will update this review so if
you're a new follower or someone new
watching the videos you might not know
but I've been a big Windows Phone fan
from day one in fact I've switched to
Windows Phone with my daily permanent
driver twice now first with the HTC
Titan later at the Lumia 1520 I lasted
for about three months each with both so
I know the OS inside it out and I still
think it's one of the most elegant
systems out there even without notable
8.1 additions like a virtual assistant
awesomely called Cortana and a real
Notification Center Brenda here with the
written review differs when it comes to
aesthetics to the device for him it
looked just like another Lumia which
translates to a high quality phone but
for me it's definitely identifiable as a
Lumia but it feels tremendous and
beautiful in the hand the aluminum ban
has that cold industrial feeling I love
that I found the iPhone 5 and the iPhone
5s and the HTC One the physical buttons
are crafted so brilliant
and that's really where Nokia shines
hardware-wise it's the little things the
icon is deflected with the current Lumia
line regardless of a pure view camera
Microsoft can run all the product
placement ads on TV it wants if you
watch arrow its rigging it everywhere
but the harsh reality is that a device
like the icon probably isn't going to
suddenly push Windows Phone into new
territory and they'll probably satisfy
longtime Windows Phone fans but what
Android users are benefit from switching
over that's really a tough argument to
make either Microsoft or Nokia's figured
out how to convince a significant number
of people just yet with handsets like
the Galaxy s5 and the upcoming HTC one
it's only gonna get harder one of the
weakest parts of the old Windows Phone
devices is now its strongest the screen
and the screen on the icon it looks
awesome it's true 1080 and 1920 by 1080
and hang those bright light and harsh
angles probably better than anything
else I've ever seen
of course you'd be able to browse a web
site send messages and look at pictures
with the Sun and bearing down not a
problem well it's not like you'd expect
to comfortably watch your favorite
episode of The Walking Dead at the beach
save that stuff for inside have pretty
reasonable expectations on the inside
the icon has specs indicative of today's
market Snapdragon 800 chip 2 gigs of ram
32 gigs internal storage NFC Bluetooth
4.0 the usual high-end affair you see
throughout most the market there's also
a pretty nice size 24 20 million power
battery with qi wireless charging
Windows Phone 8 GDR 3 Nokia Lumia black
update and a 20 megapixel PureView
camera with optical image stabilization
with a 5-inch 1080p OLED screen the
icons of a thicker than most handsets
and nine point nine millimeters but it
does support the sturdy polycarbonate
shell then the users absolutely going to
love it's not overly unwieldy but
certainly not the thinnest handset out
on the market so what are all those
specs combined what's the overall
experience they combined to make a
really snappy enjoyable time one that's
really typical of the Windows Phone
ecosystem Microsoft's and West has never
really needed the latest specs offer
smooth experience but the icon certainly
benefits from the boost the animations
and tiles flow super smoothly apps open
really quickly and they resume just as
fast as really any Lumia devices with
Windows Phones multitasking
functionality you're able to switch apps
without really much slowdown at all
making the whole thing feel really
really fluid and complete I'd say better
than most windows phone handsets out
there for the most part though Windows
Phone 8 on the
kind of just like using it on the 1020
or the 1520 with the same ecosystem and
familiar limitations there's some big
app Stallworth now available for Windows
Phone however but there are also still
some notable Athens's as well and that
matters to a lot of consumers sure
Windows Phone now is Instagram but none
of Google's official apps are they all
what you still won't be able to find the
latest app Cray is hiding in Windows
Phone Marketplace Apple's iOS is still
the mobile Kingdom to beat Windows Phone
might get there eventually but the
cami√≥n between Windows Phone compared to
iOS and Android is still very large if
you look evil or as crazy son Robbie's
gonna think about jumping it but some of
that slack is made up by Nokia's
ridiculously awesome ecosystem of camera
apps including Nokia camera Nokia
cinemagraph and Nokia refocuses which
are designed to give you more control
over the shooting experience so while
the icon doesn't quite have the
ridiculously awesome 41 megapixel sensor
stuffed in Lumia 1020 it still supports
a respectable 20 megapixel rear camera
the results produced by the icon are
pretty nice in low-light and in everyday
situations and the inclusion of optical
image stabilization definitely makes a
difference the icons pictures like all
Lumia handsets still have a tendency to
be slightly muted and perhaps on a
sharper eye popping as other camera
phones out there but they still my no
means look bad Brandon goes into much
much much more detail on the camera and
includes an extensive photo library over
on the written review again links in
great down below one big thing note
gifts dress in the icon was announced
and other Lumias was its automatch audio
recording the device according to nokia
comes equipped with four digital high
dynamic range microphone which allows
the icon to capture six times the sound
pressure level of a conventional
smartphone microphone without any
discernible distortion thanks to pretty
special Nokia algorithms the combination
from the for digital microphones allow
for the most high-quality stereo
recording while it can pinpoint specific
sound even really really loud situations
so that's a lot of tech talk but for my
experience the icons audio performance
seems to be a step above the competition
audio capture and recording sounded way
better from the competition and head
over heels better way to expect from a
comparable smartphone as you can
probably expect performance wise the
icon is top-notch and powerchute Windows
Phone 8 without any single issue at all
actually no surprise given to advice
Awards a pretty beastly Snapdragon 800
chip even with the more powerful
processor in high
display the icons battery actually holds
up really well surprisingly well I'd say
you have no problem getting through a
full day through my typical use I ended
the day with around 40% left answer the
email pulling down a lot of social
networking watching videos playing games
I would have two phone calls to have no
problem at all so combine all that but
the icons camera chops and audio
experience you're looking at probably
the best Lumia device out there we take

intercom free for seven days by visiting
lynda.com/tekzilla buffalo again that's
ly NDA comm site TechnoBuffalo back to
review so what's the final verdict on
the Lumia icon as you can tell I really
really like the phone the hardware is
absolute incredible the experience is
awesome
the typical knocks on windows phone are
still there that really comes down to
apps although if you rely on sort of the
core apps if you're looking for a
YouTube application networking for
Instagram experience a Twitter app
you're gonna be pretty much ok if you
like to venture serve out a little more
you're gonna find the waters to be a
little bit shallow but that isn't
improving day by day this is a really
enjoyable phone to use coupled with
Verizon's awesome servers in southern
california i really really like the
phone I could see myself switching back
to Windows Phone to use this the real
potential again will probably be
unlocked once we see win this one 8.1
but for right now as it stands this is
the best Windows Phone out there and
gets a really solid eight point five so
