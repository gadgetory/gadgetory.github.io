TechnoBuffalo I recently moved to
Southern California and since I'm in a
new place I want to make sure that my
apartment is safe and secure when I'm at
work and now and about luckily Ness
reached out about their new nest secure
security system and sponsored this video
and since I already use nest products
this seemed like the perfect opportunity
so in the box you'll get everything you
need to get up and running you have the
nest guard base station to detect motion
sensors and to nest tags for disabling
the alarm on the surface the whole
system isn't too different from a
traditional security system you have a
keypad to into your code you have
different arming modes for when you're
at home or when you're away has a
battery in case the power goes out and
the detect sensors stick on your door
window or on the wall
to detect motion in a room what makes
this different and better than those
traditional systems is the amount of
control you have and that starts with
the app this all connects to the same
nest app that you'd use for your
thermostat or for your camera or any
nest product and it connects easily by
scanning barcodes on the back of the
sensor and the base station and the tags
and you follow the on-screen
instructions it's pretty simple the
guard station connects to your Wi-Fi
network so you'll be connected and you
have the option for five dollars a month
or fifty dollars a year through t-mobile
to have cellular connectivity so you'll
never be offline like if the power goes
out and if you'd like you can subscribe
to professional 24/7 monitoring through
monie security just for that added
protection although neither of these
options are required to use the net
secure now in addition to the base
station you have the detect motion
sensors these can go on a door on a
window or they can attach to the wall to
detect motion in a room also they have a
light built-in so if you're walking
around in the middle of night so you
have to go to the bathroom or something
it will light up your path and you don't
have to turn on the light and disturb
someone else and the sensor has a button
built-in with a feature called quiet
open so say it's the middle of the night
and you just need to go outside for some
reason but your house is armed you don't
really want to turn off the alarm but
you still need to get outside you just
push that button it lets you open the
door and when you close it it gets armed
again now once all the hardware is
installed you can move to the
app here you can set your passcode it
can be whatever you'd like and you can
change it at any time as well and to arm
the system you just push the button on
the base station and they have different
modes for when you're at home or when
you're leaving in the app though you can
tailor each situation to your specific
needs so for instance when I have the
alarm set to a way I have motion
detection turned on but I can easily
turn that off and I have the alarm
countdown set for 3 minutes so I don't
have to be rushed to get out the door
it's gonna give me plenty of time and I
won't set off the alarm also most
importantly to me is that if I forget to
set the alarm which has happened a time
or two when I leave it'll ping me on my
phone and I can just set the alarm from
there now in the app is where you're
going to monitor everything that happens
so if your system detects motion or it
detects a door opening you're gonna get
pinged on your phone also if you have an
S cam it'll integrate seamlessly with
your system so if it detects motion
you'll also be able to watch what's
going on inside your house when
returning home the system comes with two
Ness tags these are little chips that
you can put on your keyring and instead
of entering your code you just tap this
on the base station and it'll disarm
your system now what's great about these
is you can give them to anyone so say
you have someone that needs to access
your house like a dog walker or a
cleaner you can give them one of these
tags and set a time for when they can
actually access your home so if the dog
walker needs to walk the dog at two
o'clock they can access your house at
two but at 2:30 the alarms gonna go off
now probably my biggest concern when I
unbox this is that I didn't think the
alarm was going to be very loud I mean
the base station is time but it's loud
so four five hundred dollars although
that's a bit on the higher side this is
a relatively full-featured system as the
system cysts now it will definitely
bring you some security that everything
at home is safe and if you already news
nest products like I do it integrates
seamlessly into the framework I'm
already used to but anyways I want to
thank you all so much for watching be
sure to let us know down below in the
comments what you think of the nest
secure system and if you want to pick
one up for yourself links are in the
description again I'm Matt Gonzalez with
TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
