technobuffalo and today I'm going to be
unboxing the HTC butterfly s so before
we begin I just want to thank our
friends over at negri electronics for
hooking us up with the HTC butterfly s
let's get right into the unboxing I'm
just going to slide this off right here
here's the phone itself just put this to
the side really quick and see what else
comes in the box all rights are coming
into the box you have your HTC removal
tool for the SIM card let's put those
aside as well as the user manuals and
here you get your earbuds let's pop
these out really quick see what they
look like and you actually get some
little adapters for them as well to put
on the part that goes in here so here's
the earbuds right here not much to do
with those little play and pause button
there as well with a microphone and here
you get your I think that's a European
adapter and then your little wall wart
and again this is not a American one so
that you get to pick up a different one
for that and then here is the USB
charging port to the charging cable
alright so let's check out the phone so
right here is slide this off and here is
the HTC butterfly s and this comes with
Android 4.2 point2 HTC Sense 5 and
blinkfeed this is actually the first HTC
phone to ship with Android 4.2 point2
has a plastic bag unlike the HTC One
which actually has a metal back so this
is a little bit heavier than the HTC One
because of the 3200 milliamp battery is
a pretty big batteries you're going to
be getting a lot of battery life out of
this device actually is about 160 grams
as well so this screen comes with a
5-inch full-hd 1080p 440 PPI and Gorilla
Glass 3 that's a beautiful display I've
seen it on the droid DNA as well as the
HTC One and it is just a 1080p looks
amazing on these devices it's a good
thing this comes with a 30 200 million
battery because this has a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 quad-core 1.9 gigahertz
processor and 2 gigs of RAM so this will
be able to run any any app that you're
that you're going to be installing on
this very very well and the battery is
going to last you a long time as well
the front facing camera is a 2.1
megapixel has wide angle lens with HDR
capability the back has an HTC for
ultrapixel camera and it has full HD two
EVP recording with HDR video as well on
the back of you see that it is plastic
this is unlike the HTC one which I have
right here this is metal and this over
here is a plastic back so it does look a
little bit different but I like both of
them as well this does have kind of a
fingerprint Magnus you if you don't like
that you might want to look for a
different phone over here actually if
they bring in the drawer DNA they are
kind of the same this has a matte black
finish to it and this as a shiny glossy
plastic finish to it as well but these
are just to show you guys the
differences between the HTC phones so
going around the phone underneath here
is the microUSB slot so you can just
charge the phone over here you got your
volume rockers up and down on top you
have the micro sim and the expandable
storage up to 64 gig SD card slot right
underneath that little tray right there
I got power power button right there and
the three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack there's not a movable
battery so you cannot actually take this
back off but it has that thirty two
hundred million battery so you probably
don't ever have to worry about that so
obviously this is not fully set up just
yet but that will be in our hands on
video coming and coming up in the future
so hope you guys like this video let me
