very shallowly there actually I think I
need to lay off the pastries the rest of
my time here in Spain this is all who
did that this is the t-mobile G slate
this is the LG tablet computer and as
you can tell it's 3d capable you can't
see the 3d now over the internet video
that I shot because I shot this video on
a non 3d camcorder but if I had shot it
with the slate which I did this clip
you're watching that is 3d so you can
watch it with glasses on the screen or
you can send the video out via HDMI to a
3d capable monitor an HD TV set what
have you you can also upload to YouTube
3d LG announced a partnership with
YouTube where you can send video from
their 3d devices to YouTube 3d and then
you can also watch YouTube 3d content on
the device so this is very similar to
the Optimus Pad which was also
introduced this morning at LG's press
conference but this is the t-mobile
branded version coming to the US shown
here right now in the multi media dock
which has an HDMI out USB for tethering
you can set it up as a clock thanks to
the disembodied hand here flying in and
doing all the things for me this
actually is great so you can see it's
got its Android through the honeycomb
it's pretty much stopped right now it's
got a 3d camcorder app the 3d player app
which are LDS app apps of course for the
3d functionality and then you can see
there's a t-mobile start up app and
there may be some more see mobile my
customizations but apps are other
add-ons before the device launches no
information yet on pricing or
availability in the US but it is coming
but basically it's stock Android now
what you get here is you get an 8.9 inch
display it's 1280 by 768 and the form
factor as LG talked about and I talked
about in my write-up from the press
conference the form factors design for 2
handed and one
and use and so the device actually works
quite well I found and using it one hand
and so far I'm able to two thumb type on
it easier than I can on some of the
other tablets that I've used that are a
little bit wider and then the long
aspect ratio is actually nice for
reading things
there's the camera app it's got a
front-facing 2-megapixel camera and then
if we flip it around Venna
on the backside we've got the
stereoscopic set up dual five megapixel
cameras LED flash it'll record and
playback 1080p video in 2d and then for
3d you can get 720p video and you can
see it's got the t-mobile branding on it
as well as the width Google branding and
the LG brand nice little kind of kind of
copper color here kind of copper Brown
with the silver accent looks pretty nice
and you know the device is nice it's
actually pretty lightweight for the size
it's 8.9 inches so not quite as unwieldy
as the 10-inch devices like bigger than
the seven-inch devices that LG was happy
to point out in their press conference
this morning but they didn't name names
who those devices are because you know
you just want to know that this one but
it is it feels good and it's easy to
hold in one hand you've got your
headphone jack you've got HDMI out
everything you need right there and on
t-mobile it will be 4G HSPA+ compatible
so you can do your video conferencing
with a front-facing app all that kind of
stuff you've got your e-reader app nice
animations go in there we can read a
little Alice in Wonderland
and the widgets and all the goodies that
people are excited about with honeycomb
so there you go again it's a first look
at the G slate the t-mobile G slate by
LG it is a 9 inch tablet computer with
4G connectivity
1080p video capture and playback and 3G
capabilities if you use the glasses
before if you send your video out to
another monitor V HDMI or you know up to
the web used to 3d yeah it probably is
pretty nice looks good from the LG booth
and what World Congress 2011 in
Barcelona I would turn the camera to
myself now but you already saw that
hitting his 3d image of me not that the
3d was bad it was just me looking at all
it really I got to hit the gym I'm Noah
from TechnoBuffalo much much more on all
the LG products are the other projects
at the show on TechnoBuffalo com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
