incredibly personal choice whether or
not you want the best camera you want
the best battery you want a combination
of all those features it's hard to come
out and say this is the best phone
because we're all individual people of
individual needs so in that vein I
picked six different categories I want
to give you the best phone in each of
those categories and hopefully one or
two or more of those or resonate with
you and that could help you decide which
phone is best for you we did one of
these videos earlier in the year it was
really helpful to people in fact we took
the comments from that video and we
added some new categories here so
consider this a wrap up of all the
phones that came out in 2016 so the
phone with the best camera goes to
suspense Q uma Thurman the pixel with a
runner-up of the iPhone 7 plus pixel
congratulation you're 12 odd megapixel
sensor is absolutely incredible
some the best low-light incredible and
normal light and for sensor that doesn't
give a camera hump you pixel should be
very proud there's a very close runner
up the camera on the iPhone 7 plus 2
lenses wide-angle portrait mode you
should feel proud not quite as proud but
still hold your head up high next
category we look at most when it comes
to smartphones could make or break the
entire experience the phone with the
best screen may have the envelope please
screen it's nerve-racking I can see
Motorola over there shaking Sam's like
an apple hoping to hear the names called
Galaxy s7 s7 edge also would have been
included but note 7 blew up the screen
on this wraps incredible Samsung makes I
think be best AMOLED panels the blacks
are incredibly black the colors really
rich some might say oversaturated but I
love the way screens look in fact
screens are so good they really just
look like stickers to me so Samsung
congratulations to you
so about making sure your phone's going
to keep having juice to phone with the
best battery this is a category that we
because you guys wanted to know really
important category so this is one that's
going to last the longest isn't taking
into account things like quick charge or
anything like that the phone that just
out of the box from a hundred cent
charge is going to last you the longest
I have the unload
perhaps a drumroll the phone the best
battery what do you guys think
predictions right up now in the comments
before I read it can't look and then
look moto Z force with your beastly
3,500 milliamp hour battery you're like
the Energizer Bunny and go for days days
days or at least probably a day and like
another half a day without need to be
recharged
not to mention moto mods lock in the
battery case on that if you need that's
in fact into the decision moto z-force
regulations to you software is the phone
that has the best software out of the
box from ease-of-use to ease of setup
picture everything just works wait
expected to do without having to go
through massive customization and the
winner for software iPhone 7 iPhone 7
plus the runner up being the pixel iOS
is still incredibly easy to use probably
has the best third-party app experience
simple its elegant might not have
changed much over here definitely gets
the job done and as it runner up with
Google has done of the pixel is really
nice as well you got a new redesigned
launcher we've got the Google assistant
built-in so don't be too disappointed
Android fans but if you want the best
software experience it's still hard to
beat the iPhone what about the best
durability maybe a little rough on your
phone ones you on the phone with
incredible build quality when that's
going to last you maybe your kids throw
your phone maybe just throw your phone
in your purse or gets lost in your Carl
time maybe you run it over maybe you
have a phone that you want to drop from
from 400 feet with the drone whatever it
might be you want is going to last for
durability the best phone money can buy
at the end of 2016 is this one should
not be surprised if you in some of our
videos earlier in the year the s7 active
we dropped this thing from a drone at a
hundreds and hundreds of feet we've been
dropped on concrete on softer surface
and this thing took a lickin and keep on
tickin
man is feeling me and whoever's and the
last category intangibles things don't
really fit into one category but a phone
that has a lot of little things that
make an awesome package and the winner
of intangibles is and the little please
our last and final category for 2016
smartphone awards galaxy s7 s7 edge
congratulations to you these phones
check off almost all the intangible
boxes Samsung pay
you've got wireless charging you got
fast charging you've got expandable
storage and you've got waterproofing
only box maybe doesn't check off is USB
see when it comes to phones can bring
you a ton of features it's hard to beat
with the s7 and the s7 edge bring to the
table so what guys think about our
