TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site i'm joined by the editor of the
gaming department joey davidson hello
everyone how are ya it's been a while
since we've had you on the show I know
it has been a while hasn't it yeah well
it's one of those situations you know
every so often somebody else where you
are and we have to explain to them how
long it takes to review a 60-hour game
takes it will take 60 hours yes that is
you know I know so many people tell me
oh man that must be so awesome like
think about it you have to sit down and
play 60 hours and you have to do it in a
very short window of time all right i
mean i love the job it's awesome it's
fun but it is not that easy so yeah yeah
i uh he poor guy haven't play all those
games oh don't don't try to make light
of my plate well so for this week you
know of course we'll throw it open to
questions later but this is probably
going to be Joey's only appearance prior
to III will have him on again post III
to go over his thoughts but uh so III is
coming up in about a month for people
that have never been to e3 I I know
pretty much everyone knows what III is
but is it the gaining paradise that so
many people think it is you know I'm not
really sure that I have a clear picture
of what other people think it is it it
didn't really line up with my
expectations going into it when i
attended my first one like 10 years ago
which is really depressing to think
about out loud uh-huh but it it back
then i kind of expected this like you
know very silly convention that was
basically just like a comic con but
slightly more professional it's not
quite like that um it's a bit more
professional in a comic con so so it is
i don't know it's it's totally work
while i'm there and but I know other
people who perceive it a little bit
differently i know our own eric
frederiksen actually
really really enjoys it as not just a
work thing but he quite likes like the
press conferences and stuff I personally
am I don't want to say I'm done with
them but the thrill is gone you know
what I mean um you just go you listen to
people talk a lot there's a lot of
talking man there's a lot of people
standing in front of you with basically
PowerPoint presentations and saying like
this this game's gonna be awesome let's
go let's run down the reasons why it's
gonna be so great in a really boring
fashion so there there was a time in the
comic book industry where every year I
would attend a retailer conference and
we were going through this period where
everything was supposed to be dark and
gritty sure and so you know they you you
would also go to one-on-one
presentations or like well in this book
you know it's going to be taking a look
at me go if you say dark and gritty uh
dark and gritty is is our
post-apocalyptic right yeah exactly
thing everything was dark and gritty so
yeah I'm sure you have the same sorts of
buzzwords that get thrown at you time
and time again well it also depends on
the year by year basis and that that's
one thing that Eric and I actually just
just heard an editorial on that's gonna
be going up on the site hopefully soon
ish um but it's already scheduled yet oh
ok so today probably um we talked about
some of the fads that come and go and 3d
was one of those fans like we couldn't
we couldn't go anywhere with me three
without getting like glasses thrown at
us Sony handed them out on the way into
their press conference a couple years
back that was the same year that I think
do you guys remember gosh what was his
name the like fake spokesperson Sony had
for a while he was like the VP of
Awesome and although i can't remember
his name but they got in trouble for
appearing in the head with a nintendo
that bridgestone tire commercial yeah
giving away Wii U or a weird yeah
actually got a camera his name anyway
that was the year that he showed up at
e3 and like gave part of their
convention um so it I don't know I like
it I like to show a lot it's fun um but
maybe this will tell you I'm more
excited about like going out to eat
tonight girls I think that's just me i
don't know kind
no well you do a food person so just so
long as Aisha Tyler shows up and makes
awkward jokes you know during that
rather aft I'd rather her than mr.
caffeine dude oh good gravy so I I think
for me the big question about III this
year has so much of what was announced
last year which was supposed to be
coming this year has now been pushed
back to 2016 so do you think that we're
going to see them talk about those
titles again almost exclusively or are
they also going to add new titles on top
of those can you give me an example one
of these games that you're thinking I'm
just trying to uh you know I was trying
to think of it before the show I know
bunch of games have been pushed back to
2016 so to take your pick of any one of
them um by me we're going to this big
delay cycle and so I'm just wondering at
the studios and the companies and
publishers and all that want to put even
more games on the plate when they've
already got so many that are delayed you
know I would imagine that the focus is
going to shift to the games that were
delayed but I think that that both Sony
and Microsoft are in a really weird
position right now where they have to
focus on what's coming this holiday
we've yet to see too much in the way of
exclusive like crazy balls to the wall
titles that just one console can get I
think each console maybe has one or two
of those games sony has blood borne on
the PlayStation 4 which which is doing
really really well and Microsoft I guess
maybe to even a lesser extent which is
unfortunate had sunset overdrive last
year was that earlier this year can't
even remember i think it was like last
it was late last year very cool game but
again there's there's not been anything
that's like oh my god we need I need to
buy an xbox one or I need to buy a
playstation 4 and I think that right now
um those console makers are going to be
beating the drum and trying to to make
sure that we know that this holiday is
going to be good and so many of the
delayed games have sort of put this
holiday into jeopardy but I still think
it's going to be a good holiday and I
still think that that what I'm most
excited
for it regarding like this end of the
year stuff are the extra press
conferences that we're having this year
so the square enix the Bethesda these
guys have never had their own shows
before and the fact that they're having
their own shows tells me that we're in
for some really really big stuff I'm
personally I would be almost surprised
if we didn't see or hear from fallout 4
so and that's that's one thing i don't
know if that's going to come out this
year or whatever but but i think that
that any void that we feel from the
console manufacturers is going to be
filled by these additional press
conferences well I and I'm sure somebody
will you all nouns half-life 3 yeah
right that's what happen no no I what I
want Square Enix to do is just come and
go we are holding this press conference
just to announce Dragon Quest 7 in
English for deer on the press conference
is gonna start dear ron dual it heard
your request we're translating Dragon
Quest 72 English it could be man I think
Ron I think Ron could expend less effort
just learning Japanese then then
requesting that square enix trance-like
translates this one single game I don't
if you don't get the joke I'd like a
square enix article can't run through
her site without Ron and Ron's not gonna
listen to this he's not gonna see this
Ron always inserts a dragon quest seven
joke so if you see some article by Ron
about square enix click into it and read
it and leave them a comment just say
it's not gonna happen Ron stop asking
it's become joys of my own private game
of how many times per week Ron will
bring up dragon cost seven in English
yeah yeah well it's it's a great time
but up so we've got a lot of questions
here I think one that we have to get to
before we get to some of the others
because this one kind of uh Kevin Butler
that was the PlayStation guys name thank
you section oh cool let me see if I can
find it here okay it's firm such a Mahal
and why do you guys like red dead wood
ocean some why don't you like red dead
redemption at all oh man ah I'll take it
I guess could I think that we like right
dead for very similar reasons I think so
Sean and I are both film nerds um and a
lot of that is is just like cinemas like
kind of an aesthetic thing and I think
that you hear the word cinematic a lot
when people talk about games and I know
it means a lot of different stuff to a
lot of different people cinematic gaming
to me has nothing to do with frame rate
or anything like that it has to do with
composition of the game itself and red
dead redemption is one of the best and
most cinematic games I've ever played in
my entire life it's everything from the
music the art design the characters I
mean everything in that game is pitch
perfect there there really aren't I mean
sure there was some glitches but like
even those added to the charm of the
game itself um I just there are very few
games that I wish I could erase from my
memory and play again from scratch and
red dead is one of them totally loudly I
mean I am NOT with the exception of very
few westerns I'm not a western sky and I
went into red dead with a lot of
trepidation I was like I picked it up
super cheap I was like add you know what
the heck I'll give it a try I was hooked
so fast I remember you you hadn't beaten
it and I was this is like when I first
started working mm-hmm here and I was
like Sean just just beat the game just
go play the game and you're like I don't
know and then like I just remember there
is one a couple days where you messaged
me and you were like oh my god I'm so
into this like I I've never been sadder
to reach the end of the game yeah yeah
one and it keeps going which i think is
awesome too and yeah and it's a little
bit of a letdown because jack is kind of
annoying but things like you taught me
Paul just like you taught me about yeah
exactly uh that's such a good I mean
it's such a good games if you haven't
played it yet man you can get it for
stupid cheap
they're never going to pour it over to
the PC people talk about that a lot it's
just not going to happen you should get
it because it holds up i played it three
months ago i played through it again
three months ago and it holds up really
well so I didn't know you just played
through it again oh I'm so tempted to
sit down and do it again it holds up and
I you know what I played it right on the
heels of playing something on the
PlayStation 4 that was open world I
can't remember and I was like red dead
looks better like what why is it that
red dead looks better than this doesn't
make any sense like fine yeah that's the
thing red dead is also any for the time
and even now it is still a beautiful
game how many times did you just like
Sun was setting and so you just stopped
Oh constantly watched listen to the
music and then just kept going like
writing all the time I remember I got my
50 I started playing it on a 42 inch
television and did while I was playing
we got a 55 inch television and I just
happened one time I was writing at night
from the farm to the town yes I even
remember where I was I happen to look
down I could not believe there were
horse prints in the dirt oh yeah yeah I
was like that is so awesome that they I
mean is the most textured real world
feeling game i have ever played and yeah
I now that I finally cut the cord I you
know and the TV won't be commandeered so
much I'm gonna have to read again man
yeah yeah oh well that leads to such an
balls next question I wanted to get that
out of the way if Rockstar does
announced another red dead game what do
you think it'll be called and what are
you hoping to get out of it Joey and I
were just discussing like 48 hours ago
different scenarios of what it could be
called what the story line would be ill
I've always thought it's going to be red
dead revenge makes sense uh well and I
think that so much of red dead
redemption was about like the the West
dying basically was the den why was that
was the story in that game and I I think
we're dead revenge kind of makes sense i
mean you have jack already built into
the
and maybe he could take revenge on the
law that killed his father though there
was the actual actual end of the game I
don't know if you actually got to that
where you find the man yeah at the in
the in blue yeah at the stream and you
just shoot him in whatever um I think
that Jack could probably even like take
more revenge I want it personally I'd
like to see something like red dead
revival that that maybe you play someone
trying to start a new game our new gang
and like reclaim the Wild West in like a
town or something maybe it would be
really awesome to bring to bring
lawlessness to a town yeah and a cool
yeah cuz I I tried to play John very
very lawful you know because I I've
whined him to redeem himself yeah I
think that here's what I would like to
see we've both seen Deadwood I know we
both love Deadwood oh yeah Al Swearengen
in Deadwood was like the boss of the
town it was a lawless town but
Swearengen was kind of like this evil
empire type of person and when the new
sheriff moves in like it's all about
their story against one another I would
love to see a red dead revival where
where that takes a lot of leanings from
from Deadwood and so you might maybe
you'll have like a town that is lawless
but is in control by like a real
renegade jerk and so your job is to ride
in with new gang and so yes it's
lawlessness but like it's it's the type
of good lawlessness that that we liked
about john marston so much so I don't
know yeah and I think that's a great
example because swedgin as much as he
was evil he also wanted dead wood to be
more right with its with his Hoople
heads a mystery yeah watch deadwood and
you have a stomach for foul language
it's actually a pretty awesome show
Deadwood is one of the few shows i have
watched all the way through multiple
times yeah I I finished it I got my wife
to watch it I was like mega you should
try this she started it up and I was
like all right I guess I'll sit right
back down and do it again yeah wow that
was such an amazing show yeah I guess I
like westerns more than I thought
because i also love all the eastwood
spaghetti westerns
they're good yeah the man with no name
geology is so good but so you're going
in d3 what is it that you personally are
hoping to see outside of red dead
revenge is there anything that you're
just like man I hope ah well I did that
article about like games that that would
kind of take me by complete surprise
which i guess is sort of not fair
because they've already labeled him as
the games that would surprise me so
they're no longer going to be surprised
as I don't know I really want to see I
think I'm cautiously optimistic about
Microsoft this year because phil spencer
has been promising a lot of things he's
been promising this is going to be a
really big return to gamers if i look at
the xbox that was held by don mattrick a
couple years ago that was the which was
basically the TV machine that also
played games and the one that Phil
Spencer has been piloting right now I'm
really excited about what's on on the
docket for the xbox one I think that
Spencer if he can live up to his
personality could this could be one of
their best e3's and I'm really hopeful
that it is I'm hopeful for the wii u too
i know that that zelda was delayed out
of 2015 which is kind of a bummer and
that looks like a fantastic game but i'm
sure they're going to bring something
for that i'm also sure that they're
going to bring something for starfox as
well and play I feel like Sony's is
there there one or two exclusives from
from easily having the best open to this
generation I mean they already got that
the sales and everything like that but
I'm still not convinced as to console
you must own at least not yet so I'm
hopeful that they'll try it out some new
ip's that kind of blow our minds or you
know the new uncharted is is set to do
big things too so a very interesting
question here from cursor for miles do
any of sony or microsoft's games besides
maybe littlebigplanet successfully
emulate Nintendo's quote family unquote
fun factor and do you think they need
more games on the fund rather than
serious side
okay um well I guess to the second part
of that question yes I do I think that
there need to be there needs to be games
that are less murderous quite frankly my
purse that would like to see a banjo
kazooie revival and on the playstation
front I'd love to see something like jak
and Daxter Ratchet and Clank make a
really big return as well I don't know
if they need to go as far into that
spectrum as Nintendo is I mean
Nintendo's always positioned itself as
the family friendly console but at the
same time they do deliver experiences
that people like you and me Sean enjoy
um I don't know that's an interesting
question as as for what they have out
right now I can't think of any first
party games that really meet that that
demand that there's the kinect stuff but
third-party publishers are meeting and
exceeding it with stuff like disney
infinity and Skylanders and everything
else tho those are your kid focus games
the lego games so I feel like for for
Sony and Microsoft maybe they don't bank
on that third party support quite like
Nintendo does in the way if they are
excuse me first party support quite like
Nintendo does in the way of
family-centric games they rely on
third-party support to fill that void
for them and I think it's working so far
well I like to see less serious games
from them yes but I don't necessarily
think it's a given no I think you've got
a good point there especially with
skylanders and infinity being
essentially platform agnostic do yes you
have to buy the one specific to your
console but it's available for
everything mm-hmm you know I think maybe
that is a good point you know why should
we put our first party dollars and do it
when we've got third parties making such
successful right minecraft is on
everything and and except for the wii u
oddly enough and granted that is a
microsoft-owned IP now but it wasn't
when it made the chunk to all those
platforms and I feel like the executives
that Sony and Microsoft might think
we've already got those bases covered
with third-party support so we don't
need to push first-party dollars into
that and this leads into a question from
such an Mahal
d like any of the games like Disney
infinity or Skylanders or any other
figure based games and there you have a
post that's coming up later today I that
blew my mind about how many people are
aware of these yeah I think that was
from Eric yeah Eric wrote it man what do
you think about this this move into the
figure realm I think okay I think that
it personally um I'm not too drawn into
it and not as much as I thought I would
be when I first started playing with
these games I think that there's some
fun to be had with stuff like Disney
infinity and Skylanders and I know if my
son who's like approaching for was
actually closer to gaming age I would
probably support him if he wanted to
play with these games because they do
especially disney infinity there is a
really big creative back side to things
like he could make his own games within
the games which I'm totally down with
and it's less mindless than other things
and we have lego about to come out with
one as well and and when Lego happens i
think that the mindshare for it is going
to get even more ridiculous like people
everyone's gonna know about it and i
have a feeling that you i don't know if
any of you guys listening have a lego
store in relative proximity to your home
but if you're ever near one there's one
in the mall maybe 15 minutes from my
house and you go in and there are kids
in the lego stores but then there's like
old ass adults in the lego stores do
like it it's like shopping which i think
is awesome so those people i look at
this in the same way I'm looking at
Legos I think that it has a lot of cross
generational appeal because you get the
people that want to collect the figures
you get the people who buy into these
things because they happen to like and
in the case of Disney they happen to
like Marvel's Disney starts producing
Marvel figures and and collectors are
going to get them I know Sean you're a
collector yep you know and and these
figure based games Strike a really weird
note that's both collection and
consumption I think there was a special
on one of PVCs or PVCs PBS is gaming
about this it's a collectible but most
of the time collectibles go unusable
like when you when you buy sended to
collect the whole point of it is to like
display it on a shelf but they're also
usable so there-there consumption-driven
items so I mean I think that that just
the whole idea here is super-smart and
Activision with their Skylanders line
really is what put it all on the map and
that I don't personally buy into it but
got it they're all cash cows as long as
you tie them two franchises people like
they're gonna pump out cash well to me
the most evil thing I I'm not only am I
collector I'm a completist yeah and so I
play some infinity but I cannot allow
myself not to have the power discs
that's crazy man these things to me are
the most evil ingenious part and notice
that they were right at hand what it
don't do is like give you like upgrades
and stuff like that they give you
upgrades or new vehicles or they change
the landscape you know all that sort of
stuff yeah the fingers aren't even to me
the most evil part of the whole system
it's the discs because you're like oh
well if I had that disc but then I gotta
hunt for a disc oh why don't I just go
on ebay and buy a complete set yeah yeah
no I the disc ah but yeah uh this is a
question I know will make Joey's head
explode from brazen Franco with
publishers making game budgets bigger
and bigger and expecting Salem members
to compensate for it will the gaming
industry ever faced a crash I think the
days of a crash are behind us I think
that sectors of the gaming industry will
crash I think we're witnessing right fun
right now and that's the android-based
micro console I mean talk about dead in
the water every company that comes out
with an android-based micro console is
basically facing 022 like very little
sales and I'm talking about stuff like
the oyea and and the Amazon TV and all
that other stuff there's just no there's
no drive for it there's
a lot of people on TechnoBuffalo
especially or throughout the years who
said things like you know smartphones
are replacing game consoles to me and I
think that they are replacing the need
for micro consoles but I don't
necessarily think that they're replacing
the need for game consoles and I think
that just the gap might close between
the two platforms but we're just talking
about two very different experiences so
no I don't think that we're going to see
a mass gaming crash like we saw in the
90s and late 80s but I think that we're
going to see less and less in the way of
experimental games we're going to see
even more sequels we are going to see
even more safe bets companies really
aren't willing to take risks anymore and
that's because of the the budgets and I
think that breast in your ear right man
it's it's the budgets are getting
ridiculous I can't remember the numbers
right now but tomb raider the reboot
before it made the jump to PlayStation 4
and Xbox one like just that full year
that was out on the 360 ps3 and pc it
sold what we would think was well right
like we thought it did well and then
square enix came out and said that
thanks to the budget the sales numbers
were disappointing that's not going to
go away that problem is going to persist
and unfortunately for us it just means
that we're going to get less and less in
the way of creative games but that's
where the indie Cindy stuff steps up
that's where Nintendo steps up luckily
Nintendo sort of sees that and they just
say well we don't care we're playing the
long game here so that's fine so it's
fine i'm cool with the big budget games
but i also need my indie stuff too so
you know you you mentioned how people
are saying that phones are killing off
you know this and that and the thing i
hear the most is killing off portable
gaming but i would beg to differ I mean
I whenever I fly I tend to fly through
dallas fort worth airport a lot like way
too much and from the time i get off my
plane get to the sky tram and get to the
station at the next one i'll have ten
street passes on my 3ds
I'll run through those real quick my
time I get to my gate i'll have ten more
yeah and by the time I get on the plane
i'll have three to four more yeah you
know and i'm sure i've missed people
because when you hit the ten you can't
get any more yeah you know now you could
say like a Comic Con last year I
couldn't go through them fast enough
they know I was picking up something to
be expected really yeah but when you're
speaking about some place like dallas
fort worth airport that is not a gaming
hotspot although although there is
somebody that works there that I
streetpass him every single time I'm in
the airport awesome I kind of narrowed
it down to where he works but every time
I'm in that airport I streetpass him
it's awesome but yeah I mean that to me
alone you know that it's anecdotal
evidence but it happens in every Airport
I'm in yeah you know even when I go to
Disneyland I take it with me and I'll
StreetPass tons right there comic-con
fine i understand but to say that mobile
gaming is dying off i think is ignoring
the fact that i wouldn't street past
that many people in an airport if it was
dying off I agree yeah I'm not quite
sure why everyone keeps saying oh well
you know everything has to kill
something I've never understood that I I
think that's going on in gaming as well
right now you know smartphones are gonna
kill off get yo gaming no it's not you
know I just I don't get it but we shall
see although I mean the idea of Konami
going almost exclusively mobile is a
frightening one to me well what's so
frightening it sucks but what's so
frightening about it what are we missing
that's true you know konami's not quite
the publisher they were ten years ago I
mean that a lot of their IP have sort of
tried out not to say bad things about
Metal Gear because i love that franchise
but you know castlevania is not what it
once was
is a lot of their horror games not what
they once were so you know it sucks that
they're going mobile I hope it's not a
sign of things to come but konami has so
much money in other departments been
there pachinko division brought in so
much revenue last year it's scary I will
never understand pachinko uh you're not
an addicted Japanese person so I've got
it pachinko parlors when I've been over
there I'm just like I don't get this so
loud ah it's so incredibly loud from
Christopher miles do you think Disney
would give EA the green light for our
star wars game along the lines of the
tragically taken 13 13 given the war is
dark tone of Star Wars rogue which is
actually Star Wars robe one for anyone
that's curious what we're discussing I
hope 13 13 s not dead um that was that
was one of the most surprising things
I'd seen a couple e3's ago he was even
three years ago it it just looks so good
um I know that they were going to shop
it around there was an update about a
year or two ago where they were going to
shop it around and see what was what was
going to happen with it and I think that
there was a lot of tech there that
Disney would be sort of wasting if they
didn't at least look into the potential
of it I don't think that Disney's fear
is the darkness of it I think that
they're totally fine with that I think
that they're more concerned with will it
sell and you know the star wars
franchise has always been very iffy in
the gaming space and it seems like
Disney right now is only willing to do
shore things with the license um I think
if he is being kind when it comes to the
Star Wars gaming history yeah that has
had some awesome games and then it has
said some games that were kind of pretty
much terrible um so depends I don't know
I think that it's totally possible
possible not probable but possible yep I
hear either from brazen Franco do you
think games will still release broken
this year starting to avoid
every that releases more than three ads
slept on every popular website and TV
channels I can see where he's coming
from I if I was a standard consumer and
when I am a consumer for video games I
do not pre-order and you should not
pre-order don't do it just don't do it
it's stupid it is a waste of your money
and it is a waste of your time just wait
that said our games can still be broken
yeah there's no doubt in my mind the
only publisher out there that's really
delivering consistently not broken games
is Nintendo but you can't one cannot
live on Nintendo alone hum Nancy I I've
adopted the the no more pre-ordering
thing except for a Arkham City I'm sorry
I've already pre-ordered look I love
Batman do you know I love Batman okay i
just i'm not doing it i'm not i'm sorry
i'm sorry w be eloquent tell me what do
you'll see i'll get it on the the year
the game of the year edition if I really
need it it's just not gonna happen man
I'm gonna wait hello hello hello I
forgot to unplug my phone uh yeah in
general I agree to Joey it's it is a
dice roll anymore and I'm definitely
ninety-five percent off of the pre-order
wagon just stop now alright well I even
remember before I wrote protecting a
buffalo I remember when Red Dead was
being solicited and there were all these
pre-order bonuses and in that particular
case that was a situation where you know
it said oh you could get a better horse
or you could get a better gun I was like
you have no idea what these things are
going to do in the game if they're
actually important right now it is a is
the speed of a horse actually going to
make that much difference it didn't it
didn't I mean it was nice but it didn't
make that big of a difference yeah I so
yeah I it's it's definitely a role that
I said it's not always
one from Christopher miles how do you
think a post kijima metal gear would
look well I don't know how's that for an
answer I don't know no not not to knock
Kojima here but maybe less convoluted
the man likes his complex storylines and
I think that that's putting it lightly
how many times if we SAT through a metal
gear cutscene just kind of went what
yeah what are you doing right now and
like I love it cuz like I like Metal
Gear but like I don't love metal gear
like other people when you start getting
into discussion like solid snake liquid
snake big boss boss I'm just like your
kind of starting to lose me here like
I'm okay with it and then you start
talking about all the different
syndicates and like all the groups that
are involved and fox vs xof and just
like so no I I don't know if it's going
to be as good of a metal gear but it'll
certainly be less convoluted um which
might not be a good thing i know that
some fans like their metal gears really
complex because it's it's a lot more to
pour own to and and Kojima has a pretty
good history of making that all
rewarding and worth your time he's going
to be missed and I guarantee that if he
goes out and kick-starts a game as soon
as as metal gears is done and out the
door it's going to be crazy I think he's
going to get into developing licensed
properties like strawberry shortcake I I
really hope that him in del Toro make
their own horror game that's that's very
similar to it was gonna be or PT or
whatever I think that that's going to be
awesome that to me is the bazaars part
of this whole story which part is that
it the the fact that not only did they
cancel silent Hills they they basically
want to make it like that demo never
existed yeah del Toro called it their
scorched earth approach yeah and he's a
hundred percent right it's like they're
like salting crops is what they're doing
yeah it's just stupid day I don't think
but you know what like I've talked to
friends about this and everyone
I go F Kaname like they don't care and
I'm just like nope Kaname probably the
people making this decision are not on
Twitter like they don't care they're
looking at their portfolio of dude I
don't know if you know this about Kaname
but they have gyms like in Japan you
walk down the street there's like a
Konami gym they have real estate offices
like they sell houses in commercial real
estate and then pachinko parlors video
games unless they're on the mobile front
just really aren't making them as much
money as everything else and they're not
gonna care like it sucks for us that
silent Hills is getting cancelled and
that metal gear the phantom pain might
be the last like huge console hit in the
series but I don't think that the people
Konami just really care at all it's just
naughty it's not even a blip on the
radar ya know I tend to agree oh shoot
the I hate when the questions jump away
just as I'm going to click on them
because somebody voted on something as
soon as I find the person's name again
I'll go ahead and ask the question do
you think Nintendo NX is going to be a
home console yeah I've read the
prevailing theories that it's going to
be this weird mobile home console
portable mashup thing I it's impossible
to say I know that Nintendo is working
with that company that they partnered
with cheese what's their name it like
has a lower case in it somewhere yeah
it's a very odd name haha its escaping
me right now I'd look but I don't want
you guys to hear me Thunder type my way
through a browser dina DNA de nada
that's what it is okay so uh i know that
they're working with them for their
online infrastructure and i know that
they're trying to tie the accounts
between like their mobile and portable
and home gaming experience they're not
going to talk about it at e3 they said
that the students that will hear about
it is in 2016 that said I know that
we're going to have some leaks do I
think it will be a home console yes
nintendo is going to stick with the
television they're not going to get away
from it they show us what the wii u that
they're ready to relinquish the TV from
time to time with gamepad play but
you're still going to be able to play on
your TV so i think it is
to be a home console in that sense maybe
it'll NFC connect and and you'll be able
to take it on the go with its little
screen and then you'll be able to get
home and set it down on top of a base
unit and get it into the TV that might
be cool but I don't really know when
that question came from brazen Franco I
finally found it from I nicked aureus
excited for Windows 10 integration with
Xbox one do you think Cortana will be
included in the mix whether it is
through smart glass or on the console
itself linking with this will edge
replace Internet Explorer on xbox and
possibly possible removal Bing well
there's no way they're going to remove
bang no it's too much money into that
yeah way too much money if we assume
that Microsoft's going to continue the
trend that they've had with pc and
mobile and that everything is going to
be more unified I think that guess
Cortana will probably be on the Xbox one
it seems to me that Microsoft has taken
a really big cue from what Apple's done
with their their marketplace and they're
like ecosystem like once you're on an
Apple device like this is not me saying
it's a good thing or bad thing I'm just
saying that what they want consumers to
think oh I own an iPad so the iphone is
a much easier transition for me I think
that Microsoft probably wants that same
mentality in line with their devices
that said you want everything across all
platforms to be feature compatible and
that means that if if Cortana is on I'm
average Joe consumer this is a Microsoft
product Cortana's on my surface
Cortana's on my windows phone why don't
i have court on on my xbox one Yeah
right so it'll it'll be there it has to
I mean it just makes sense the direction
that their that they're pointing towards
so it all unification is going to match
up on everything and and so to answer
that question about edge yeah I think I
just going to push it out as well so
very interesting question here from
Christopher miles do you think Sony will
try to push the Vita beyond the JRPG and
indie gaming machine it's going to
become or will embrace the consoles
current niche mm yeah
but I don't know I mean that seriously
I'm someone who adopted the PlayStation
Vita right away I still like it for what
it is I also wanted to like it for what
I thought it was going to be I thought
that uncharted was really promising it
was kind of a mess of a game but it was
still promising and then we had gravity
rush as well which i think was gravity
days in Europe um that's a good question
i don't i don't know i think about it a
lot too i don't know what their plan is
for the vita and sometimes it seems like
they've abandoned it almost sometimes I
look there there are days and weeks
where I'm like why isn't Sony pushing
this machine like it so it's a really
good portable it had some missteps that
have really heard it I think part of
that is the memory card expense people
are looking at the cost of the PS Vita
and the memory cards got in the way well
okay so now the memory cards are still
the same price that they were at launch
and the games that are coming out for it
just aren't attracted to everyday users
I love my PS Vita and I've racked up
like 120 hours in the persona 4 golden
and was really happy with that and
that's after I played it once through on
the ps2 so it's hitting all the right
notes for me but I'm not your average
consumer I don't think so gosh I hope
they do something about it Christopher
but i'm not sure what what that'll be I
you know for me I do own a Vita and I
own a 3ds but like for when I travel I
just you don't even ponder the Vita and
a lot of it is because of the 3ds is
clamshell designing I know that the
buttons are protected the screen is
protected you know AII no that's not
really what was being asked here but I
do find that I'm just not I don't
gravitate as much towards the Vita
because of possibility of damage I think
see you on the flip side of that this
makes me sound like a terrible
electronics user but I talked the PS
Vita and my 3ds in the same bag with no
padding and I'm not I just don't worry
about it and I don't even have a single
scratch on my PS Vita so like it but i
think it was built with that in mind
like it's a tough it's a tough device
should you take keys to it probably not
i was just going to pick up
he's go do that just do that yeah
obviously because I mean you just told
me how tough it is so immediately I have
tells you you have the space and you
have games to play I wouldn't let
portability get in your way because it
can take a beating inside a bag it's
fine and this will probably be the last
question of the day from such a Mahal
what kind of games do each of you guys
like I've been that questions been here
since the show started I've been
thinking on it I really I personally
don't have specific genres mmm well I
play everything yeah i I'm I'm kind of
the same way yo from platformers touché
mumps to what is mumps are those like
the mumps but that's how I say it I
don't most shmups whatever mumps bullet
hell mom I can't go to school today I
got the smokes the weirdest thing it's
terrible now I remember why I wasn't sad
when you stopped hosting that's good but
no I I'm very I'm kind of all over the
board when it comes to John Rose yeah
yeah same here right now just just to
give you a nice look at what I'm right
now I'm playing through splatoon Witcher
3 i'm replaying mario golf because it's
like golf season here in Delaware so
that's that's really starting to kick
off and I'm back into hearthstone
because of the the port to mobile that
didn't happen too long ago and that's
pretty much every genre ever so I'm all
over the place I think that stuff I prob
well I guess maybe an unexpected honor
for me I really like sim building games
like a Sim City or something but that's
not that weird anymore that used to be
kind of weird people used to look at me
like man you know like city builders and
I'm like yet can sink basin to those
things mmm but too bad SimCity so go get
city skylines cuz it's really good
I've nerd it out very hard on that one
and the fact that you have mods oh my
gosh the mods and city skylines are so
good anyway that's me I play everything
yeah i just i I've never been able to
lock down to any one type of game I mean
going back to like the original Nintendo
you i might play contract for a half
hour and then i'd play zelda for an hour
you know it just bounced all over the
place heck yes I agree ok I i think if
you get you know but like people that
lock themselves into you know a certain
genre they're just they're missing out
on too many great experiences chairs
they won't open their horizons sure i
don't think they're that many people
left to do just that anymore i think if
you talk to most people they like a wide
swath of games so yeah yeah I think
you're right hey if you walk into stores
ESU their dominated by first-person
shooters but there's enough other stuff
there yeah definitely get your interest
well I believe that is going to bring
this episode to a close as I said we
will have Joey on again after e3 to
