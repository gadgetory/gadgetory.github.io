technobuffalo so it's been several
months with the asus UL 30 VT laptop we
talked about this laptop being a very
good value for people who want something
thin and light something powerful and
something that has really good battery
life with its switchable graphics cards
and then we also talked about installing
an intel SSD in the back of this to
really increase performance and also get
a little bit better battery level so
it's been a couple of months and i'm
going to give you a sort of long-term
update on the UL 30 BTW and how it's
been faring as sort of my day-to-day
laptop i've used this a lot i've taken
it to Vegas to CES I've taken it all
around and I've got a lot of comments
about it let's start with the hardware
itself and how the hardware is holding
up now I didn't claim the laptop before
filming the video on purpose I wanted
you to see what it looked like after
some use you know some laptops are
better than others with staying clean
like the macbook stay clean very well
thanks to the aluminum design the UL 30
VT from asus not so much as you can see
the the lid here which is actually a
nice brushed metal look becomes a very
fingerprint covered you can take a
little bit of Windex and just wipe this
down and get it clean again but you have
to do that quite often in order to get
it to stay clean in terms of the
hardware itself the the the thickness of
the laptop and the weight it is
fantastic and a lot of people that pick
up this laptop say wow this really feels
quite thin and light I love the
wedge-shaped design here it's very thin
in the front which means that it slips
right into a bag or a laptop case
without much fumbling let's open up the
laptop here and take a look at some of
the hardware features and I want to
point out some things that have been
bothering me when I first went to buy
this device I checked out reviews and
for many devices like this and also for
this particular unit and people said you
know the asus laptops are great value
but the build quality is not that great
I have to say that I kind of agree for a
few reasons first of all the arm rests
here or the palm rests now make a
creaking sound listen it may be
difficult to hear but after a few
minutes of
and resting palms on here they start to
creak additionally the keyboard seems to
give a little bit in the center it
almost is like a saggy mattress we're
right in the center you can kind of feel
the keys go down a little bit further
than they should these things aren't
bothering me too much because the speed
of the laptop the battery life is all
really fantastic and I'm having a lot of
fun using it another problem with this
laptop is that the glossy screen really
gets annoying some people can can
tolerate glossy screens better than
others but for me it's just it's just
too much and it's difficult to see if
I'm sitting in the reflection or near a
window or something like that I love the
keyboard i love the clicky chiclet style
keyboard it's got a very macbook like
feel and you can see it just turned on
there and we're going to talk a little
bit about performance and battery life
in a second but want to finish some
other comments on the hardware i
formatted this laptop right out of the
box because it had a lot of bloatware on
it that i really didn't want it was
running windows 7 home premium 64-bit
edition I put windows 7 32-bit a home
premium on here which means that I got a
little bit less ram but it also means
that I removed all of that bloatware
that was causing the laptop to be a
little bit slow out of the box it also
means that this button on the left which
is supposed to let you switch graphics
on the fly is now dead it doesn't do
anything but that's okay because what
I've said it to do is to switch into
that hybrid graphics mode where the
performance increases when you plug it
in and then when it's not plugged in its
using the Intel graphics card and then
you're getting better battery life so
we're going to talk about using the
touchpad with the multi-touch we're also
going to talk about performance let's
move up on the screen okay the first
thing I want to talk about this
performance thanks to the solid-state
drive an Intel ultra low voltage
processor I think performs quite well
this laptop is fast when im using this I
don't feel like it's lagging I don't
feel like it's taking time to load
things about Photoshop open down here it
opens up instantly and that's thanks to
the solid state hard drive I think which
makes a big difference in bringing up
programs that are stored into
rammus to transfer the programs or the
hard drive us to transfer programs from
the disc to the RAM to get it sort of
loaded and this process makes it much
faster so I'm going to go over here and
open up chrome and Chrome opens up
within seconds and that same applies
with any other browser that I'm using
down here we've got Microsoft Word 2010
beta look how fast it opens extremely
fast very good performance let's take a
look at the performance benchmark built
into Windows 7 okay I'm going to zoom in
a little bit here and we're going to go
down the list so what we have here for
the processor is a four point eight
which is very solid memory is five point
four which is great anything really over
4.5 is really great and then for
graphics a 4.9 and 5.9 for the desktop
performance for Windows Aero and also
for 3d business and gaming graphics and
well look at the rating for primary hard
drive disk transfer speed 7.8 out a 7.9
the intel solid-state drive absolutely
screams if you can afford the upgrade
get it it's worth every penny and the
prices are coming down all the time so
I'm going to zoom back out I have tried
rendering HD video with this by the way
it does okay you know HD video rendering
a lot of the time comes down to the
processor power and with the ultra low
voltage processor it's kind of clocked
low at about one point three gigahertz
so it's not really tuned well for
rendering HD video but doing everything
else running Photoshop an Internet and
going to and watching even youtube HD
video let's pull some of that up real
quick just so you can see how smooth
that is even when we're on the Intel
graphics so we'll go to John for lakers
here and let's bump this up to HD
and there it goes and it loaded up
pretty fast and let's see how smooth it
is we'll go fullscreen this watch ribbon
so perfect perfect playback of youtube
HD perfect playback of Hulu or any other
video streaming content it works really
well now while we're on the internet
again I want to talk about the
multi-touch trackpad it's a synaptics
trackpad so you can get the program that
allows you to do to do the multi-touch
gestures so what I can do here I'm going
to try to do this may be difficult to
show but I'm going to swipe two fingers
downward to get it to scroll down like
you would do on the macbook so we have
two fingers and I'm inching down works
very well I use the multi-touch all the
time it's very convenient to use and
finally one last note I'm going to talk
about battery life asus claims that the
UL 30 BTW thanks to the ultra low
voltage processor thanks to the hybrid
graphics can get up to 12 hours of
battery life obviously that's not true
in the first month of using this I could
get about 9 hours of battery life with
some optimizations even and with the
solid state drive now I'm about down to
5 battery technology still hasn't
evolved to where the battery life
doesn't decrease over time so i'm at
about five hours now which is still
quite a remarkable for any sort of
laptop and i'm really enjoying being
able to run the asus UL 30 feet without
having to charge it so often and zune
software which is particularly resource
intensive works very well so i'm going
to bring up real quick some of the fancy
graphics here and it works very well so
guys I was an update on the asus UL 30
VT i highly recommend this laptop it's
coming down a lot in price since i
filmed the first video about this now
749 dollars tack on an intel SSD onto
that you're about talking 950 or a
thousand dollars or you can keep it in
its standard configuration asus has new
models of this coming out this year so
you may want to watch out for that but
of course they're going to start at
higher price points this model the UL 30
VT may be a good bargain come two or
three months from
right before the new models hit so
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
