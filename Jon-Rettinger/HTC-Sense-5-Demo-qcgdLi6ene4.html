TechnoBuffalo here and I am sitting with
the HTC one I wanted to give you guys a
tour of HTC Sense 5.0 this brings a lot
of new stuff to the table and brings a
totally redesigned user experience to
Android HTC devices let's go ahead and
get started so let's begin with the
lockscreen here things are the same yet
different so you've got the same ribbon
down below if you want to launch an icon
or launch an application all you got to
do is just drag it up and you can launch
it you've got a brand new weather widget
that shows up there you can do some
customization if there's you guys that
were wondering what it looks like in the
previous version of sense 4.0 we've got
that right here you got those icons if
you wanted to launch one you just drag
it down and you can go ahead and quick
launch it very simple so here on the HTC
one we'll go ahead and unlock the phone
by its wiping up and we'll run into
settings and I can show you some of the
personalization options you can do with
the lockscreen
and go up to the top we've got
personalized right there and this is
where customized home screen and
lockscreen style are going to live so go
ahead and check out the lockscreen style
so you can pick the wallpaper and this
is one we currently have it'll give you
a sort of a streamlined view we've got
the weather you've got the time and then
your icons down below you can have
productivity you can keep track of all
your calendar items here photo albums
want to view your pictures music you
want access that or no lockscreen
whatsoever I'll go ahead and go home and
this is where things start to get
totally different what we're looking at
right now is blinkfeed think of it as
sort of like Flipboard for your home
screen so you've got this giant icon at
the top for your weather and certainly
you can move and customize all that
stuff if you want this is a default
configuration so to show you news from a
ton of different feeds if you scroll
down and keep showing more if you want
to select it go ahead and tap it and you
can see featured headline we've got all
kinds of different choices here and
TechnoBuffalo should be here actually
very soon I can go ahead and pick
different ones that you like in the
content will show up so let's go ahead
and check MTV if you scroll over
there'll be service as an app so you can
show your Facebook feed Flickr if you
have a connected and Linkedin a twit
Calendar Zoe share it's sort of HTC's
version of violet will make three second
gifts for you so your pictures come to
life they say so we'll go back there's a
ton of different categories here as well
you can choose from HTC has said though
that more will be coming so your sports
guy like me you can go ahead and have
ESPN if you wanted to see just stuff
from the NBA show up or whatever sport
you might be interested in you can do
that so we selected all that well go
ahead and go home stuff will start to
refresh and look at that got a article
about the Lakers game last night and you
can see all the different stuff that
starts to show and the more you add the
more you can scroll and Serpa shows up
kind of like live tiles here you get all
the information this article you want to
read like let's say that one I would go
ahead and launch the article and doesn't
launch inside of a browser it launches
it inside of blinkfeed so it's pretty
quick really a very neat design you can
have that be your home screen if you
choose do some other tweaks here it's go
ahead and jump into the app drawer and
things here look kind of different so
first you'll see that same weather
widget you can view things in
alphabetical order custom or most recent
so if you go into custom you can move
things around if you want stuff in a
certain area or you want there to be a
folder personally though I like to see
how stuff alphabetical order it's what
I'm used to you can also change how this
grid is going to be viewed so go ahead
and it settings right there grid size if
you want to view 4 by 5 or 3 by 4 I like
to see more on the screen so I'll keep
it that way you can go ahead and launch
right into Google Play and then here are
the rest of the apps that are going to
be shipping also you'll notice that the
drawer right there that usually would
click to launch the app tray changes a
little bit so go ahead and go back home
HTC and since 4.0 changed away you
multitask so let me go ahead and show
you what that looked like here on the
droid DNA there was a dedicated button
for multitasking it lived right down
there if you tapped it you had sort of a
carousel you can view different things
if you wanted to launch an app you could
just select it otherwise wanted to close
something you could swipe it off you
couldn't see that many things right
there's one of the things I really
didn't like actually about sense 4 well
HTC has made that totally different here
with it sense 5 well they have two
buttons we have a back button and a home
button we don't have that multitasking
button so if you want to access it you
just double tap home and you get now
this whole
and grid rather of applications that
you've got open so you can see a ton
more than you could on really any skin
of Android even native version of
Android if you want to close something
you can swipe it up and if you want to
launch into it and go ahead and just tap
it it's actually pretty neat it is kind
of difficult to make sure you tap that
button twice and not hit what might be
above it on the screen we'll go ahead
and go back home
widgets here are also redone and HTC tap
to go ahead and long press we can view
the widgets here there's that weather
clock i was talking about i love the HTC
weather stuff i've always really enjoyed
it you want to scroll through widgets
now you go up and down to do it so you
can see all the custom ones those are
the classic HTC the default android ones
are all here and a lot of other sort of
custom sent tweaks what's not here
though is any sort of blinkfeed icons I
thought blinkfeed might be a widget you
could add different home screens but
that does not appear to be the case
it looks like it's either that one home
screen or nothing at all so I'll go
ahead and go back home here also sort of
the same is this button ribbon across
the bottom you can control what's there
we have custom HTC widgets it looks very
similar to what we see in sense 4 so you
can quickly whatever you like you want
to go to phone you can go ahead and go
to phone you can see since the skin goes
pretty deep here a dialer has been
customized as well one thing we don't
have if we pull this down don't have any
sort of quick launch icons there which I
always like to see if you want to turn
off Bluetooth there turn off Wi-Fi
whatever it might be I know you can go
through and add those certainly it's
Android so you get a ton of
customization options here there's a lot
more that sense 5 does I want to give
you guys an overview of some of the most
important stuff and some of the big
stuff that I saw that was different as
opposed to the previous version sense
for point you know whatever it might be
on the phone that you were using so
anything else you guys want to see on
the HTC one be sure to let us know of a
ton of coverage coming up please give
this video a thumbs up it definitely
helps us out and check out TechnoBuffalo
comm for ladies and greatest tech news I
am John Rhett enger' I'll see you next
