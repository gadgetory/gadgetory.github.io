I'll just play a quick game
how many months ago do you think the
iPhone 8 and the A+ came out the answers
are very surprising at least for me four
months ago I had to look it up September
22nd Apple released the eighth-inning
plus we've had a lot of time to look at
it now a lot of my testing time has been
spent admittedly checking out the iPhone
10 but I went back and looked at the 8
in the A+ to revisit it see if it's
still the phone but I know a lot of you
guys are considering buying is you look
at the iPhone 10 and you're like so my
initial review was that the phones
really surprised me I wasn't expecting
that much from the 8 and the 8 plus and
that's kind of changed a little bit
because I started using it then I
started expecting a lot from it the
performance on the phone is absolutely
credible I never thought that most
modern release iPhones were ever slow
they're always behind you but it came to
raw horsepower but iOS was optimized for
the hardware the phone here still feels
incredibly fast with iOS 11 boot up is
insanely fast as fast of course you get
with things like the iPhone 10 games
look incredibly quick third-party apps
load fast you can throw deep bench
scores all you want but end user
experiences what matters the phone still
feels extremely fast the big difference
for me coming back to the 8 plus I spend
a lot of my time testing with from the
10 was getting used to touch ID again
I'm so used to not having a home button
and got using gestures that was
definitely a learning curve wait for
coming from an iPhone that wasn't the
iPhone 10 we're gonna be right at home
with this experience touch ID here still
working very well in fact it looks
better for me more accurately than Faye
said he does but certainly you have to
you know use your thumb to do it it was
a bit hard to get used to not having
gestures again but after two days it
really wasn't an issue this multitasking
very quickly at least how Apple allows
you to multitask
with giant air quotes battery life is
also another area where I became
extremely impressed with the phone I've
been super disappointed battery life on
the iPhone 10 on the eighth plus I can
almost write this thing out to two days
with normal usage and auto brightness
turned on battery life is damn
incredible when it comes to the iPhone
A+ and I mentioned battery life before I
got the screen because I'm probably
gonna seem like a bit of a hypocrite
here and I'm totally aware of that
it's a 1080p screen and you can take
that for what you want it's no longer a
best-in-class screen that's like doesn't
work great it's still really solid
outdoors picture still a great text so
it's crisp not seeing any chunkiness
you're not see any pixels cuz it's still
more than the eye can see
but it certainly doesn't look as good as
a competition especially the equally
priced competition but of course the
trade-off you're getting awesome battery
life so again like I said I know it's
super critical to be like I want a
higher-risk green and awesome battery
life because you give you just clearly
can't have everything as you saw what
happens to the iPhone tends battery life
but I'd probably sacrifice like a tiny
bit of battery to maybe get a higher
resolution screen on it but if you're
coming from an older Jen Plus device
you're not gonna lose any difference
here on the screen at all it's similar
experience it works well it's true tone
display is nice actually I kept it on
here so it boils down to this green is
fine I really love the way the glass
back feel on this generation devices I
also really like the color I wish Apple
could decide what the heck color space
go actually was it's like six different
versions and eight different iterations
but I liked away Space Gray looks I
really liked her the eggshell white of
the silver
I loved it wireless charging is enabled
here the Space Gray is definitely
fingerprint magnet so if you go for that
color I definitely recommend putting on
a dbrand scale so you get a little bit
more grip on it well link to those down
below if you want to check them out my
issue with the 8 plus and this is a
minor issue than the design front it's
the fourth iteration of the same design
we saw this back from the iPhone 6 and
6-plus things haven't really changed
that much but if you like that design
you're still getting a really good phone
and that's kind of the moral of this
whole video you're still getting almost
everything that you get from the iPhone
10 and 3 exception certainly the
front-facing camera you're not getting
portrait mode you're getting close to
the same rear camera and of course the
same speed you
with the iPhone 10 gonna save some money
you want the latest Apple experience I'm
still really enjoying the iPhone 8 plus
but I will say the plus feels gigantic
in my hands so if you don't mind the
giant screen size you want to go back
something like the iPhone 8 which it's a
whole other discussion when it comes to
the screen on that phone that's the
decision up to you it's certainly a
better value you can save value when it
comes to an Apple flagship phone and
you're still getting close to what you
get with the iPhone 10 so let me know
what you guys picked up I know a lot of
you guys decided to go for the a to the
A+ over the 10 if you switch to Android
it all together and of course the
subscribe button and that little Bell
next to it you notify when new videos
are coming we got a ton more awesome
flagship vs. videos coming your way
that's all next time I'm John render
