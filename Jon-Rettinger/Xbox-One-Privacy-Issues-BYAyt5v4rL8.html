to the episode of Retton just rinse this
show where I pick a topic from the tech
world sometimes a little bit outside and
I get all red in the face and things
popping out in my neck mad of this week
I want to talk about the Xbox one and
how it kind of freaks me out this is
Rhett just rants
let's get Randy last week Microsoft took
the wraps off their new next-generation
console which I guess now is this
generation console called the Xbox one
it's called the one supposed to be the
one box I can do everything
play your game stream your media
takeover your cable box really just do
everything that you need from every
component in your cabinet so it sounds
awesome and it sounds awesome to me too
I love gaming on consoles like game on
the Xbox ps3 that's what I prefer to get
my gaming on but there's some things
about it that really creeped me out and
grind my gears so to speak so in order
for the Xbox one to work it's gonna
require Kinect and it's this fancy new
Kinect that sends some billion points on
your body it's a 1080p camera saw some
demonstrations of this thing working it
it was really really cool but also lived
on the creepy side so Xbox one has voice
commands so essentially you can turn on
your Xbox you could say Xbox all over
the command is it's gonna turn on so
what that means is the Xbox one and the
Kinect is always listening to you which
I'd probably be okay with but then they
said hey now it's connected to 300,000
servers which they claimed was the
computing power of the world in 1997 so
you take a console it's always listening
you combine it with 300,000 servers and
there's a little bit of potential for
some privacy concerns now I'm not a
crazy privacy guy I don't run around the
tinfoil hat on my head screaming that
the CIA put a chip in my brain usually I
just don't worry and they honest answer
is I don't have anything to hide so I
never really cared but I'm not worried
about Microsoft could do but I'm worried
about what hackers could do I certainly
saw anonymous take down Sony's Network
you know last year and the previous
years and they've had a
prolong going feud what happens when
hackers can potentially get access to
the camera at Sandy you're connect or
get access to the microphones in your
connect you know I brought up to a
question on Twitter everybody's bonded
with you know turn it around or put
something over it it's not gonna cover
the microphones people
here and that just really strikes me as
creepy and it sort of got me wondering
if we're starting to sacrifice privacy
for the betterment of Technology and
this is the first time I've really
actually thought about obviously I've
never had a reason to worry about it
I never cared and will sing to my
cellphone which I guess it's kind of the
same thing some reason the Xbox one that
Kinect just really rubbed me the wrong
way a little uh when it came to what it
could do in the capabilities and
certainly all beginning something to do
was great the back there's a console
that can always listen to everything I'm
saying could potentially be accessed by
Microsoft or a third party if there was
a subpoena to get access to it could be
just very very very disconcerting to me
now nothing I'm doing anything weird in
my office and I'm running around naked
Bryant eggs I know it was a very
specific example but it just sort of got
me thinking you know what are we
sacrificing as a population for the
answer to technologies worth it is it
not worth it I don't know I'm still
gonna buy an xbox one I'm looking up
Kinect so I can sit there right on my
counter maybe I'm a parrot that way but
I've just sort of started the price I
think I know what to have a dialogue
with you guys to see what you thought do
you care about the privacy concerns heed
Xbox one or any privacy concerns in my
booth the ps4 once we know more about
what it does presumably it's gonna have
a similar functionality but I read one
of you guys thoughts on it please leave
your comments down below it thank you
guys for watching episode of renter's
rants it's a bit of a melancholy rant so
to speak I got kind of cerebral about it
let's hear your thoughts again leave
them down below check us out at
TechnoBuffalo comm please give this
video a thumbs up we most definitely
appreciate it I'm done right into it
I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
