hanging from TechnoBuffalo and today
we'll be checking out five free games
we're playing right now on android
there's a lot of fun games out in the
market right now but these are the games
that were playing on a daily basis and
they can be very addicting the first one
on our list is the branch the branch is
a 3d endless runner game with a bit of a
twist to it it's not your typical
endless runner game where you have to
swipe across the screen to avoid
obstacles it's not like that at all the
game is actually very simple and your
main objective is to keep your character
on the branch for as long as you can by
avoiding the growing branches tapping
the screen once will rotate the world
and this is actually where the game can
be a bit tricky rotating the world could
either be a good thing or a bad thing
good because if you rotate the world at
the right time you can keep going bad
because getting the timing right can be
really tough it can be really addicting
and if you guys download this let me
know in the comments down below what
your highest score is I'm curious to
hear how you guys are doing the second
one on our list is bird climb now bird
climb is another endless game similar to
the branch but in a way that you're
going up a tower instead of running
through an endless branch controls are
fairly simple tap the screen to start
flying and the faster you tap the screen
the faster the bird will fly now
unfortunately you won't be able to
control what direction to bird is going
the bird will only change direction once
it hits the wall as you climb up the
tower and dodge obstacles you can
collect gems to spend on new birds and
modes later and speaking of which what
sense bird climb apart from other
endless games out in the market is the
multiplayer mode multiplayer mode will
record your gameplay and send that off
to a friend or a random stranger after
your bird dies overall burg climb is
really addicting especially when playing
multiplayer mode the best thing about it
is it's free the third one on our list
is current flow the goal of current flow
is to supply energy to light bulbs by
creating a complete circuit now in order
to complete a circuit you need to tap on
tiles to rotate the pipes once the pipes
create a complete circuit between the
power source and a bulb it will light up
now like a lot of the puzzle games that
are available in a Google Play Store the
first couple of stages are very easy you
can pretty much speed through the first
5 with ease but it gradually gets more
difficult as you play there are times
where it'll take a while to figure out
one stage but as you keep progressing
through the game the more addictive it
can get so the fourth one on our list is
freaking math now as the name suggests
the game revolves around math while some
games are hard and
some can be quite easy freaking math is
a game that somehow it can be super easy
and hard at the same time now the main
objective of this game is to choose if a
math equation is right or wrong and
that's about it the equations are always
simple addition and the goal is to get
as many correct in a row as you can now
what makes freaking math so addictive
and fun is the two seconds you get to
answer it's barely enough time to read
the equation let alone decide if what
you're choosing is the right answer it
may not be as cool looking as other
games such as the branch or bird climb
but the gameplay and simplicity is what
makes the game so fun and unique also
don't feel embarrassed if you thought
two plus two is five it happens to the
best of us so the last one in our list
is does not commute the gist of this
game is that you're essentially driving
an unstoppable car from point A to point
B and now as easy as that may sound it's
actually not once you drive one car you
then have to drive a completely
different car in the same time frame as
the first car and you have to avoid
crashing into that vehicle this keeps
going and going until you have a whole
chaotic pattern going on each car has
its own weight speed and handling so not
every car you'll be driving will be the
exact same if you crash into houses or
different obstacles you'll get slower
but you also have to look at how much
time you have left so you really have to
drive as carefully as possible the game
offers simple controls to play with tap
either sides of the screen to control
steering and that's it now the only
drawback I saw from this game is that if
you want to continue after a certain
checkpoint you have to pay a one-time
fee of 199 to continue other than that
it's a pretty addicting game that
straddles the balance between challenge
and frustration anyways thank you guys
so much for watching and if you guys
enjoy this video make sure to give it a
thumbs up and we will see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
