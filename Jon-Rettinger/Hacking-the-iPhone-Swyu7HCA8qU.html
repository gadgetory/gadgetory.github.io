you guys have been following my iphone
updates but i've been getting a little
border that i know i'm not the only one
from some of the comments I received so
today the beautiful hackers out there
released a web app of their apt app
installer that doesn't unlock the phone
or anything but it does open it up to a
third party programs and if you don't
like it you can restore your iphone to
its original state for software upgrades
or whatever so there really was no risk
anymore so today i officially you can
see that hacked my iphone to the
background kind of hard angle to see
there but the background is different I
have always a new icons now there if you
can see in the upper left and now says
verizon wireless instead of AT&amp;amp;T I
thought it was funny actually I went to
a verizon wireless store and ask someone
they were getting their iPhones because
I had mine they're very confused um so
you can see some of the programs that i
have on there sort of I a stalled Apollo
IM which is a really really good IM
client surprising people say anything
from beejive or any of those there's a
finder on there but also they put on
their blackjack game and navizon which
is virtual gps and some preferences to
change background images and a
customization thing there to change the
custom settings i can change the that
little logo of their i can change all
the logos the edge icons anything I want
it's actually a really a really cool
feature but my favorite thing actually
now makes me want to keep my iphone is
right there right there any s so I was
betting for that little NES guy right
there so let me show you what that does
so click on NES and hit rom list and
these are all the roms i insult it's a
little pain the butt to install roms out
here but I actually searched YouTube and
I found some attractions how to do it I
am not condoning installing roms
only download them if you own the game a
simple google search will tell you how
to get them i cannot tell you how to do
that but but say i want to play my
finger taps metroid starting a game
and there's Metroid turn sideways thing
goes sideways sideways you can see the
buttons right there just like the old
NES controllers back up it's pretty cool
music and everything so so far if you
had a good time hack in the iphone it's
been pretty enjoyable there's a million
things out that you can do and I haven't
begun to scratch the surface air as what
I got there you can see a little leopard
theme another cool thing I want to show
you guys is if you check right there
this in the bottom right hand corner if
I hit that hard to do it backwards here
guys all right let me try it looking at
here there you go see that the wave
application that shows up right there I
could choose which one I want just by
school I my finger through there pretty
cool so sorry this was a little
disjointed here guys but I got excited I
want to show you guys the new
applications that I had on the iphone so
that's it so far everything else works
haven't had any issues with phone calls
being dropped or internet not working
everything works wait did before but
I've got all these really nice new
programs I want to say again these these
hackers did an amazing job this Apollo
IM client is really solid highly
recommended so anyway guys if you do
decide you want to hack your iphone that
was a really good time to do it there's
really no risk you're not unlocking it
you can just restore it to the way it
was all the stuff also works with the
ipod touch i think echo fish actually
get his with the ipod touch we're
talking today a little bit about it as
well so ipod touch question shoot his
way but i think he managed to get all
the iphone apps on there like google
maps and and that stuff so it's
something to check out i'm looking here
in the screen my hair looks crazy i just
got back in the beach I can see the sand
falling out of it um so that's it guys
thanks for watching thank for
subscribing sorry this video is a little
more in for you but wanted to share so I
can't give you instructions how to hack
your iphone but you can search for it
if if you are but I don't know anything
about hacking and it was very easy for
him so it's something to look into all
right guys have a good night or day
wherever you are dr. guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
