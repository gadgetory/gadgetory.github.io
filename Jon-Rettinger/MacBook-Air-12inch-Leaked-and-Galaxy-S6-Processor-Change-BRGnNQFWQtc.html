to you by Linda calm what's going on
guys a mark and sanger from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's episode of
rumor roundup we've got leaked images of
the HTC One m9 more details about the
galaxy s6 and finally we also have
leaked images of the rumor 12-inch
MacBook Air is it real is it not this is
rumor roundup let's start rounding those
rumors up so if you guys remember last
week's episode of rumor roundup when we
showed you guys the first alleged render
of apples 12-inch MacBook Air well today
we may be looking at the real thing now
a fresh batch of photos from Chinese
vlog I fan our shows a 12-inch MacBook
Air alongside the current macbooks and
iPads for comparison now the site also
claims that the 12-inch MacBook Air
offers a Retina caliber display however
they can't reveal specific resolutions
just yet and the new macbook air is
allegedly in mass production already and
is set to launch in time for the chinese
new year on februari 19 if you guys have
been looking closely at the leaked
images you won't find a backlit apple
logo but instead you'll find a metal
apple logo similar to what you'll find
on current iphones and ipads now i
personally don't like that i would
rather have the backlight apple logo
just because it looks cooler I don't
know what do you guys think now HTC's
upcoming flagship may be one of the most
sleek handsets we've seen in a while the
One m9 already popped up a couple of
times this week and new photos can help
clear up one more mystery for the
upcoming device the latest leak picture
of the HTC One m9 offers our best look
yet at the back of the device
specifically seeing the new rear camera
revealing two important details for the
ledge 20 megapixel shooter one its
massive at least compared to previous
HTC phones and second no dual camera
setup now the One m9 is also expected to
pack a 5-inch display if so I think
that'll be the perfect size and the
Snapdragon 810 processor a decent sized
2840 milliamp battery and an ultra pixel
front facing camera now it should also
run android 5.0 out of the box along
with HTC's upcoming sense 7.0 you I of
course the rumors can be way off but
with HTC's big press event getting
closer and closer we'll know soon enough
if the rumors are true or now let me
stop this video for just a quick second

but not least let's talk a bit about the
galaxy s6 reports were claiming that
Samsung might go buck wild with a galaxy
s6 and new reports have allegedly
confirmed one of the juiciest rumors
that an iteration of Samsung's upcoming
flagship will sport double edge display
now think of the note edge but you know
more mind-blowing than ever sammobile
confirm with an anonymous source that
Samsung is indeed developing a galaxy s6
would do ledge displays but that's not
all there will be a regular galaxy s6
and the galaxy s6 edge will be Samsung's
more daring model the note edge was one
of last year's more innovative phones
and even though the edge display wasn't
fully tap Samsung will try to take
advantage of the double slope edges
Samsung is reportedly working on new
software features improved a dual edged
functionality one depending on your
dominant hand you can activate the main
edge display and there will also be a
feature called glanced lighting which
will essentially line up the edge of the
screen for notifications when bs6 edges
face down now in terms of processor it
might disappoint some of you maybe all
of you the rumor galaxy s6 might ditch
Qualcomm's latest snapdragon 810
processor because of overheating issues
during internal testing now that's not
the first time we've heard of it but
there are devices like the LG G flex
tube that were already announced that
came with the Snapdragon 810 processor
ditching Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
processors could also be a part of
Samsung strategy to boost its own
processor which is the X in 07 chip and
packs a coors that could be a big step
before the Galaxy S series anyways it's
it for this episode of rumor roundup
