technobuffalo here at that unboxing for
you of the Motorola Atrix 2 this is a
follow-up to the original atrix which
was the first dual core phone offered on
e TNT's network let's go ahead and see
if this guy is going to be worth the
hundred-dollar asking price I had a
chance take a look at the atrix 2 at
ctia and came away relatively impressed
in just my few minutes of playing with
it so let's go and take a look at the
box there is the atrix 2 smart meets
life Jon meets phone so there is the
device on the front got all kinds
information on there and some specs on
the back and of course we'll run through
all these in just a minute but 4G that's
hspa+ variety capable of 21 megabits per
second down or these max 21 megabits per
second down it's got a really nice 4.3
inch high resolution display talk about
that a little bit I grew point 3 inches
over the original atrix dual-core
processor 8 megapixel camera with 1080p
video and of course powered by Android
but enough of me jibber jabbering let's
go ahead and open it up quick start
guide awesome here is the phone texting
and driving it can wait that is pretty
good advice push it off to the side it's
missing a battery see what else we're
going to get in the box and of course is
capable with the dock accessories as
well we've got a pretty giant Motorola
battery let's do the size of this guy it
is of size 1735 milliamp hours just a
pretty powerful battery should give you
enough juice to easily get through a
full day we've got the charging cable so
that's microUSB to USB the wall adapter
and of course the back cover because
don't you need a back cover so I'll put
all this off to the side and let's build
this phone and I'll talk about the specs
a little bit more as we go through so
rip out the plastic here and the back
does appear to be plastic similar to the
original matrix which I'll bring in make
a cameo it to its big brother in just a
minute to remove battery door started
some instructions battery meet phone not
going to pop a sim card in there now
actually you know what I will pop a sim
card in there now I just lied to you go
ahead and do that off-camera because of
phone numbers on it all right so sim
card is in the phone put in the battery
get the door back on boom will peel this
off today you guys hate that I will
power it on and we can talk about the
specs oh but it's got enough juice all
right there we go all right so let me
know that it is dual court all right so
this guy is available now for a pretty
reasonable hundred bucks on contractors
you want to get an off-contract it's
going to cost you four hundred and fifty
dollars android 2.3 gingerbread it's
being powered by a TI OMAP 1 gigahertz
dual-core processor so that's one get on
each cord it's got one gig of ram 4.3
inch qhd display and get that at a
reflection there is a really high
resolution of 540 x 960 display on the
back we've got an 8 megapixel camera
with LED flash capable of shooting full
1080p video but that's not the only
camera on this guy it's got a
front-facing vga job as well so you can
take pictures of yourself or video chat
or other dirty things you guys might
want to do with it as I mentioned hspa+
compatible so that's 21 megabits per
second that's 1785 milliamp hour battery
you got webtop support for the HD
docking station or the laptop dock and
all kinds of other goodness so let's run
through the device go ahead and turn it
back on there there's the android guy
welcome to mb865 thank you alright so on
the left hand side there is hdmi out and
the charging port nothing else lives
there on the right hand side you've got
a hard button for the camera and that's
a physical but not actually hard
although it is hard it's plastic a
volume rocker up and down 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and gone is that awfully
annoying biometric scanner of the
original matrix 4G we now have a
physical lock and power button the back
is sort of a soft touch almost
we feel to it but it is plastic as we
saw earlier speaker grill down at the
bottom and of course the camera and then
the motor role of branding AT&amp;amp;T branding
on the bottom so we mentioned the
original atrix let me go ahead and bring
that guy in for some comparison purposes
here's its smaller younger brother and
some big differences here so the
original matrix was a pretty powerful
phone when the first launched but one of
my big Greg's with it was this thing
that is a biometric fingerprint scanner
to unlock the phone it's also a button I
have pretty big thumb so I try and
pushed it I couldn't get it to push I'd
actually stick my finger in to get it to
work so I'm quite happy that Motorola
got rid of that guy you can see the
screen size 4 inch versus 4.3 go ahead
and unlock this one more time there we
go all rights i'm going to go ahead and
get into the phone and i'll walk you
through it very quickly all right so
here is that qhd display we just talked
about with its 540 x 960 resolution
let's take a look at some of the apps
that we're going to have we've got the
not called motoblur motorola skin on
this guy so we've got some typical
motorola editions here some icons are
changed you scroll horizontally to get
through applications you get a little
bit of a 3d effect though as you go
through it it's not a 3d screen we get a
3d effect I always want to clarify that
let's take a look at some of the widgets
that we're going to have in here let's
go to a blank screen or a close to blank
screen there we go well hold that down
jump into widgets and you can see what
the choices are here motorola hasn't
said much about the upgrade of this guy
to ice cream sandwich you don't time
they've mentioned ice cream sandwich is
that the just-announced droid razr will
be getting it this is a top tier phone
so presumably at some point Ice Cream
Sandwich will be coming to this phone as
well although for now it is running
Gingerbread but don't take my word for
let's go ahead and check that out to
jump with the settings you can find
about phone living down at the bottom we
can see what version of Android we're
running here two point three point five
with an unknown baseband version not
going to be so good to the hackers out
there i'm not sure if the baseband is
unlocked on this phone so let's take a
quick look at the web browser to run a
quick test see if i can find the web
browser on
it's always kind of tough always said a
shortcut to that on my home screen
browser there we go eighteen t browser
why not we're looking for but we'll go
ahead and watch that guy let's try
technobuffalo i'm going to try speaking
to a techno Buffalo technobuffalo calm
technobuffalo calm verdict go ahead and
launch that and you can see what the
screen looks like on a web page see what
scrolling is pretty smoothly to expect
that to be as smooth with a gig of ram
and a dual-core processor pinch-to-zoom
is pretty quick we don't have any flash
on the mobile version here but things
just load very fast so I'll cover a lot
more about the atrix 2 in the full
review it looks to be a really well
SPECT option for that hundred dollar
price point so if you're looking for a
smartphone or an android phone and
you're a little bit budget-conscious but
still want top to your specs it looks
like the atrix 2 is probably going to be
a pretty awesome choice for you and they
also have the laptop dock accessory and
the HD dock as well sort of augment what
the device can do so i'm jon rettinger
technobuffalo with an unboxing of the
atrix 2 i'm sure to check out
technobuffalo for all your tech news i
will see you guys in the next video bye
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
