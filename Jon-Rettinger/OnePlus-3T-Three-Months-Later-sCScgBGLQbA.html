saying that was a really bad time to buy
a phone wait for what's coming out at
Mobile World Congress and the comments
mostly agree but there's a large
contingency of people who are like John
1 + 3 1 + 3 T buy it anytime we got kind
of touchy in the office 1 plus the 1 + 3
T kind of has like a Apple reality
distortion field vibe like circa 2010
going on it could do no wrong so I've
learned that you guys love the 1 + 3 T
so I went back and revisit it and I saw
that trend again we're talking about the
huawei mate 9 being one of our favorite
phones
everybody's like 1 + 3 T so I'm back and
started playing with the 1 + 3 T again
and I see why you guys like it so much
there's a ton of stuff to like about the
device so consider this like a revisited
and today you guys are going to buy the
phone anyway I'll give you some updates
on which changed since our review first
incredible value for the dollar we also
did a video while back talking about
Technic and save you money one of things
that can save you money is buying on
lost phone if you want to buy it on much
phone this is a really good way to go
you're getting six gigs of ram we're
getting a Snapdragon 820 one you can up
the storage up to 128 gigs internal
getting a pretty awesome camera you're
getting dual SIM you're getting fast
charge USBC you're getting kind of
everything you would want from a
flagship with a few emissions least a
few that are decent for me wireless
charging can live without it it'd be
nice to have really any sort of
waterproofing would be nice to have here
as well but that's kind of it the screen
is really nice you know certainly some
people would want a 2k screen it's 1080
but you get incredible battery life at
thirty four hundred million power
batteries have to trade off I'm willing
to make for a phone like this I wasn't
the biggest fan of oxygen OS when I
initially did the review the one plus
three and a three-team it's gotten
infinitely better running the latest
version which is now based on 7.0 nougat
and you get all the new giddy
I mean deliciousness can be go those
delicious nougat that you get from a
pixel or any other device that's running
the software and then knock out on the
phone is that it got really warm under
heavy loads so watching you know HD
videos a phone gun
really noticeably hot oneplus seems to
fix that it's no longer an issue that's
guys so it gets so it gets a little bit
warm but it's not gonna like burn a hole
in your pocket follow through on the
floor and like burn a hole the floor
down to the floor below and then just
like all the way out stopping
exaggeration doesn't get warm anymore
the cameras also gotten much better the
speed that you can take snaps got much
improved the way captures colors a lot
better the way captures black sitting a
lot better they've done a really nice
job at the phone
I kind of consider this maybe isn't the
best analogy but kind of like a like a
Tesla software updates come really
frequently here now with the one plus 3t
and they're always big improvements and
they listen to the consumer there are
things that you want you can reach out
to one plus you reach out to the CEO
they listen and the phones keep getting
better a - charging is still really fast
I can get like 80% of battery life in
like 20 minutes which is real quick plug
in and you're gonna kind of mitigates
wireless charging for me but the point
of this video is I get the one plus the
Ricci love and even though I told you
now is a bad time to buy a phone even
though I told you that one of our
favorite phones right now is a mate 9
you guys still love one plus two routine
and I get it I get I love the one plus
3t it's like the plucky upstarts smaller
company try to make the name in the
world you get almost everything you get
flagship phone at a less-than flagship
price you can pretty much buy two of
these for what it cost to buy a galaxy
s7 and presumably I'm guessing like two
and a half for what the galaxy has a
it's gonna end up costing so incredible
value powerful phone the latest specs
for a really affordable price so I
understand it I want to take off feely I
believe come into my own video be like
John I'm buying the one plus 3t that was
a great guide to buy a phone
your basic dome and the comments of the
day appropriately comes from trolling
videos and it was on our blog way mate 9
video settings one of our favourite
phones he wrote one plus three users hit
like fire Bell Anil
people love the one plus three T it's
got the Karl pay reality distortion
field happening if you want to check him
out way to him down below and show me
featuring a comment to the day it's
pretty obvious leave a comment and we
will
teacher you can get more subscribers if
you can know you and your mom or dad can
give you some more attention cook y'all
y'all could use an extra hug I'm filming
this video on Valentine's Day happy
Valentine's video happy day after
Valentine's Day happy three months past
Valentine's Day interview watch this hug
the ones you love I'm John Ranger
