technobuffalo who they for review of
this guy this is the Android wear
powered Samsung gear live let's go talk
about how it works how it performs and
give it a final score and see if
deserves a spot on your wrist as I do
with all my reviews let me give a
disclaimer i use this is my daily
SmartWatch for five days so this is not
a full demo of Android wear I'm mark did
a full demonstration on how it works put
that link down below if you want to sort
of get in more detail about how to
actually go through the OS I'm gonna
break this review up into two parts what
I like what I don't like and then give
it a final score because I'm a positive
person let's start with likes first
Android being an open platform is lent
itself to crazy fragmentation you got
skins custom roms it just other fork
versions like what Amazon's done and all
kind of creates potentially totally
different user experiences depending on
what device you are using you use HTC or
Samsung it could look totally different
not so with Android wear no
fragmentation is always going to look
the same they're different API is
manufacturers can get access to like
heart rate monitor things like that the
core OS is always going to look the same
and I really really like that no matter
what Android wear device you pick up
it's gonna be the exact same experience
all the way across it so I think Samsung
makes some of the best screens going and
their ml of technology is totally top
industry and I'm really happy to see it
here as well the 320 x 320 resolution on
its 1.63 and screen never felt small I
think that it really looked great
indoors the button on the side I thought
was really really helpful long-pressing
it brings up settings and short press it
din screens and I know what you're
saying sides say it too dude talking
about a button and ordinarily I wouldn't
but the G watch doesn't have a button
which means if you want to power that
sucker on you gotta plug into the
charger and its really really annoying
so button thumbs up I liked it as ip67
dust and water resistance that was kind
of nice my son is teething like crazy
and then survived like some serious just
gum rubbing that any issue I didn't take
it in the shower but washing my hands
that guy that never any issue at all the
mic on this too and subsequently google
now was super accurate and it got my
voice right almost every single time
ambient noise in background that made me
screaming with people talking to me I
got really everything almost all the
time I was worried was gonna feel a
little bit heavy but it felt really nice
on my wrists kind of a perfect weight I
think coming at 59 grams I was worried
it also might feel a bit underpowered
but never fit under power at all
everything throughout it handled great
never lagged at all so don't worry about
power with it sort of 1.2 1.2 gig rich
processor inside if it seems like I'm
reaching for positives you're talking
about buttons and that kind of stuff
there's definitely a reason for that
let's get to the list of dislikes now so
I feel like Android wear devices should
have gone the same way as Google glass
and had a public beta tag associated
with them this in a lot of ways feels
like a very public beta and as they
stand right now it's really hard to see
the utility on Android wear before
everybody jumps down my throat I get the
apt report isn't there yet and what it
is the device is gonna do way more but
right now about a week or so after
launch it's really hard to recommend so
let's start what it's supposed to do
great Google now so you just wanted to
view cards and emails it works if that's
what you're looking for that's all you
want from a SmartWatch jump in no
problem at all it's gonna do exactly
what you need when it comes to
interacting with Google now getting more
info it's a totally different story
asking you to do a search for you
prompts you to open results on your
phone through aren't setting an alarm or
reminder it's mostly just go and ask you
to take out your phone anyway and that's
kind of the whole point of this make you
not have to take out your phone battery
life on it's 300 million power battery
is about we get expect the gate through
a whole day but you're gonna have to
charge a thing about every 24 hours and
don't think like I did you can charge it
from regular USB port be fine it is
going to be painfully slow you have to
plug it into actually a while to get
fully charged less than three hours and
speaking of charging I don't know what
Simpson was thinking with this little
charging do dad you gotta plug into it
it is absolutely awful it's plastic it's
flimsy the little pins that hold it to
the side for they're gonna break all the
time they really did a poor job design
that does work but it looks way that's
elegant that when LG is done it's cool
sort of magnetic build a box of the
device falls into so since this is a
watch you're probably going to want to
look at it outside and if you do you
might as well just ache you're going on
your bog because essentially it's a
pretty piece of jewelry that Sun is out
you can't see the screen at all in fact
made a whole video on visibility on the
devices so if you want to check that I
hit the link down
below so a watchband but you can do it
to watch you're going to put it on in
the morning take it off put it on it's
got to be easy thing to do samsung
instead of glowing is a regular watch
band went with this weird sort of watch
band we got to push it inside of these
holes to get it to work which is fine
with two hands when you're putting it on
one-handed it is really hard to sort of
line up to where you want it to be then
you find out where you want it to be to
sort of push it inside of those holes it
is I mean it's a mess and I've gotten
better at it now but it is not an easy
experience I don't know why they went
with that first thing I would do is put
on a totally different band on the back
of it though it's also got a heart rate
monitor which works but it's only good
when you're standing still which kind of
fits a purpose of power rate monitor if
you want to be on the treadmill to your
heart rate you know while you're jumping
up and down it's not really gonna work
for you so keep that in mind so the big
thing for me is when you can say a
device like the gear 2 has more
practical applications right now you
know you've got a problem in the tech
world is the words of two hundred bucks
for me not right now but if you believe
that will have developer support or you
want Google notifications on your wrist
then go for it just know what you're
getting into going into it if you're
expecting more than what you get with
the pebble as it stands now I think
you're going to be disappointed so this
gets on a technobuffalo score a rather
disappointing 5.5 it's got a ton of
potential but from I think can do a lot
much like Google glass but it doesn't do
a lot right now if something happens new
apps come out we'll update our review
but as this stands in sort of middle of
July 2014 samsung gear lab gets a 5.5
and rather disappointing score I'm
hopeful that more things are going to
come excited if you dealt Android wear
is going to do but man it's going to go
back in the drawer for a while thank you
guys for watching please subscribe right
here be the first ones to know whenever
new videos get uploaded we got a ton of
stuff we do phones tablets cars anything
has to do a consumer electronics that's
to be plugged in or uses batteries we
