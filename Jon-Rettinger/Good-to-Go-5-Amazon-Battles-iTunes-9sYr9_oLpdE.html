Thursday happy opening day of Major
League Baseball happy almost final for a
weekend i'm wearing my my old year 2000
Final Four shirt here I'm Noah crowds
from TechnoBuffalo now I'm James
Kendrick from ZDNet mobile news welcome
to good to go where we get together once
a week we've been doing this for at
least a month now so I guess it's a
regular thing congrats to ah it's real
it's real it's real James and I get
together and you know just talk mobile
tech what's going on in the world of
mobile tech so thanks for tuning in last
week I was worried about my basement
flooding today it's about 81 and sunny
here in Oakland so I don't spring is
sprung or the globe is warming or what
but but I'll take it hey dude dance
what's going on down there in Houston no
just keeping busy as always and getting
ready for the big April first tomorrow
of course who knows what that will bring
to the Internet the internet it will not
be a safe place tomorrow no I think that
everyone stay off the everyone stay off
the internet all day except for ZDNet
mobile news there you go there you go
I'm supposed to say an technobuffalo now
yeah yeah yeah you were you were you
were as yeah I'm a little celebrated the
weather's got me got me feel is a coffee
speaking of coffee if you would like to
sponsor good to get now I'm not gonna
throw that in there but you know would
you know where to find us yo um we were
saying before we came on the air let's
talk about Amazon let's talk about
Amazon the App Store the cloud player I
was speculating on on our site week or
so ago that I think they're really well
suited I think they're better suited
than anybody possibly to take on Apple
in terms of the the tablet market and
just the whole mobile device market
which which might sound strange but
androids there to be used amazon has the
experience the infrastructure
the digital content you know movies
books music TV shows it's an interesting
position they're in and they're making
these little moves that you know if they
never put the pieces together so to
speak into anything larger they're still
big time moves they're still you know
the app store almost arguably beating
Google at their own game in terms of an
android market now the cloud player you
know that they've been doing a lot I
before we came on the air jam to use the
word disrupter is that a word you want
to use on the air here yeah sure I I
think that Amazon is deliberately in a
position to disrupt the mobile space
because I don't think the other
companies that play in the mobile space
expected this because we've seen some
knee-jerk reactions from several things
that they've done the App Store you
mentioned the cloud drive and and I the
cloud drive that was released this week
in conjunction with the cloud player you
mentioned is significant because it it
really legitimizes their ecosystem for
Android and that's that that's something
for somebody who's not even playing in
the Android space not outside of the app
store yeah but they have the whole
ecosystem there I think they're ready to
take apple on head head to head and I
think they they can you think they're
going to do it with a piece of hardware
I do I I have speculated for a long time
that they're probably going to release
some kind of tablet now that tablets are
hot mm-hmm and I think that Billy
eventually even get into smartphones
because I tell you what with mainstream
consumer we always on the our show talk
about mainstream consumers are the only
ones with enough dollars to make a
difference right all right I tell you
what the Amazon tablet yeah yeah mazon
thumb that's already got street cred
yeah I mean just as soon as it's
released that it's out there with Emma
I haven't been on amazon in a few days
but they were I something I still are
you know advertising kindle is their
all-time most sold product yeah and
barnes and noble some figure just came
out that they sold an estimated three
million colors so that's you know three
million devices isn't on the volume of
an iphone or you know what Samsung's
doing but that's a good chunk for you
know an e-reader marketed by you know
barnes and noble the number two online
bookseller so imagine like you said
imagine what amazon could do if they you
know and they could bundle in all sorts
of things i mean it's not just limited
the thing that that's interesting and
trying to read the tea leaves and
thinking about this one of the things
interesting to me is there video service
the the instant video you know it's not
on a netflix level center and itunes
level but it's interesting start and
they're bundling it for free with prime
and so you know prymaat my family
subscribes to prime and we use it all
the time it there's a jingle in there i
just started to write about using prime
at the time I don't know but you know
it's to get that two day shipping
there's so many things amazon sells etc
etc and then you throw in the streaming
media with it but if you look at it from
the other way you know they can
advertise to somebody hey you can have
all the the instant media you want sent
to your amazon tablet and as a bonus you
get you know free two-day shipping all
year and just look at all the other
stuff we have to sell you and they're
really in this this interesting position
where they've got the digital content of
infrastructure where with all the
challenge these other players but then
they've got stuff that nobody else has
which is you know they sell toilet paper
or you know cat food or whatever it is
it's really i kind of makes my head spin
a little bit oh I see them wrapping
their entire business up in to a an
Amazon tablet if you if you will I mean
it's all going to be timely integrated
back when they first
announced or or it there android app
store was a rumor way back when I said
boy they're going to just take over
because they're going to do it like they
do their mp3s they're going to do a free
app a day I mean they're gonna they're
gonna suck you in because they're their
masters at retail online retailers their
their business and their and they are
doing it I mean exactly and they sucked
us in already with the cloud drive I
mean they said do you get you get five
gig of free storage all you have to do
is get our free mp3 of the day right
right and you have an account right and
it's free yep it's like all right you're
already in yeah I know Amazon customers
are already in and it's going to all be
wrapped up into an Android device of
some kind which I think will be a tablet
and it's going to be it's going to be
full-featured android tablet like all
the millions of them others that are
coming along but it's going to have all
of the tight integrated amazon stuff
right yeah and and they're gonna they're
gonna pitch it and they're going to get
us to use it because they're gonna say
you know what if you uh any order made
off of our amazon tablet will get red
bumps better shipping right right you
know that that's what they do yep and
and you're gonna say well i should give
me a tablet because i buy retin up from
amazon every year that's going to be
free i do that i do that math all the
time to jump to buy my own you know
gadget purpose they're guilty pleasure
purchases right and like oh it's a
three-hundred-dollar tablet and if i
spend four bucks on shipping all i have
to do is you know by one thing a week
and then my tab will only cost me fifty
bucks and okay the next thing i know you
know my house is full of uh you know
giant boxes of Mike and Ikes yes I waste
through the right here but that makes my
dentist happy to so you know it's and
that's how they're going to get people
who baby don't particularly care for
android right
they don't even have to decide it's not
going to really be Android it's gonna be
the Amazon God amazon it's almost like
you know the google phone that whole
thing about there's going to be a google
phone there's going to be a google phone
and there wasn't a google phone there's
a Google ecosystem there's a google you
know platform and it's almost like oh
well maybe this is really the google
phone but it's not the google phone it's
the amazon phone i don't know i'm just
getting that sort of DejaVu and and it
but it but it sort of makes much more
sense because Google's not a retail
company you know amazon amazon is
Amazon's got a lock on this whole thing
and i really think they'll end up giving
apple a run for their money yeah and I
mean forget other Android players
because they're going to want they're
going to win that battle when they enter
the the game because they're there
already bigger than they are right and
all the rest of those so this case is
it's an interesting time to be covering
the Mobile's it isn't in my opinion
maybe if they were this one will I know
it we have to sort of had to go from
being you know mobile people to then
being you know sort of de facto music
player and camera experts when you know
multifunctional smartphones came out now
we're like you know fake business guys
or at least I feel sort of like yeah
analyze nothing maybe we'll see a Barnes
&amp;amp; Noble ebay group on tablet next you
know if the amazon thing takes up I
don't think they could compete all right
before before we wrap this up I'm
putting you on the spot here but final
four in your town this weekend any
predict us um and I'd like to see VCU do
something sure being just being the
Cinderella team but no I don't know it's
it's tough but this has been a weird
year it really has i MA I'm with you
like everybody else i'm on the
Cinderella bandwagon i'm pulling for VCU
I think UConn's gonna do it though yeah
you get a you get a hot guard like
Walker and you can win the tournament
and you know anyway whoever hits the
threes right yeah Wow gonna walk away
with James enjoy your weekend I will be
watching from up here in Oakland myself

stood sounds good alright till next time
