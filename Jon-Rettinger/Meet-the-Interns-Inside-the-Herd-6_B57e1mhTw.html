technobuffalo here and I have two very
special guests I want you to meet our
inaugural class of interns we've got two
awesome folks here that can be helping
us for the summer doing all kinds of
crazy things from writing to making
videos the video production everything
in between so I'm going to shut up and
let you guys meet our two interns so
let's start with the guy to my right he
might be a familiar face to you it's mr.
David Taylor I was the contest winner
from back in January when I got to go to
CES with them and making videos you know
periodically since then and then they
offered to bring me out here for an
internship so that's why I'm not here
now so David what kind of stuff are you
gonna be doing for us here at
technobuffalo i'll be doing some video
production things behind the scenes
stuff as well as you know inventory that
kind of things and i'll be doing a
weekly video series as well excellent so
as David mentioned he joined us with one
of the winners of our CES contest or his
the winner I thought I did a tremendous
job and wanted to see him grow and
improve so he got to be one of our
inaugural interns and joining him to his
right in the purple hoodie is mr.
Braverman Braden say hello tell us a
little bit about yourself and what
you're gonna be doing here for the
summer I'm on Braden I'm doing behind
the scene video production and intern
stuff with David so what kind of things
you guys want to do professionally and
what are you open to get out of the
internships well I've always wanted to
learn more about the technical side
because I don't know that much about it
and in the future I want to do more
video production I love doing it and so
it's not working so behind the scenes
setting up the camera doing the
post-production editing and that kind of
thing I hate being a probably camera bad
for me right now yeah I'm down inside to
the up so i won't be in front of the
camera want to be able to you know more
of the business side of this kind of
thing and
you know show or learn how you guys are
wrong technobuffalo and I'll be able to
do that for myself okay so what's one
thing about yourselves that people never
know that you want to share it right
here on camera I guess the biggest form
you probably be uh I love playing
Dungeons and Dragons really I play that
every now and then so let's phone bread
I taught him how to play donors in like
this I got him to play we're actually
really big gamers too so so for those
you out that might be interested
internships coming up it's something
we're going to explore this very first
year in see how it goes and if it goes
well I will open it up again to a one to
two people next summer and as you know
that gets closer will give more
information so no need to email asking
how can I be an intern I want to come
work for you guys anyway you will see a
lot of David and you will see a lot of
brains work over the coming four or five
weeks so welcome guys welcome to the
family you'll see these two talking and
sharing your experiences about what it's
like being interned anything that you
want to see in particular them share
information or stories that it's like
