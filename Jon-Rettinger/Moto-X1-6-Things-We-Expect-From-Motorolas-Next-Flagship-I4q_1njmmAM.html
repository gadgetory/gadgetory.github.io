from technobuffalo and today we'll be
talking about the Moto X plus one and
see what we can expect from Motorola's
new flagship device so let's get on with
the video to start things off of you
guys Motorola just sent out a massive
email invitation yesterday announcing
that it will be hosting an event in
September fourth and the email links to
an animated website that briefly shows
icons clearly representing the Moto X
the Moto G SmartWatch and a bluetooth
earpiece so what can we expect from
Motorola's new Moto X device I think
we'll still see a customizable device
like the first moto x and a bigger
screen maybe a screen size around five
to five point two inches in a full HD
screen which will be a nice upgrade from
the Moto X's 720p display of course
we're not expecting to absolute latest
and most powerful hardware but we're
expecting to either run a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor or the
Snapdragon 801 processor inside
software-wise we're looking at android
4.4 kitkat and motorola already
confirmed that when android l's release
it's making its way to the Moto X and
the Moto G and we're expecting the same
will happen for the Moto X plus one now
when the Moto X was first released
suspect wasn't the beefiest compared to
something like the galaxy s4 and iphone
5 but I love that it came with an almost
stock Android experience sort of what
you'll find on a Nexus device or Google
Play edition phone the unique feature
that came with the phone like active
display and touchless control is great
too activating Google now or reading
your notifications out loud to you
without touching your smartphone is
something we've never really seen before
in any other smartphones and I think
that's what Motorola was aiming for
innovating and changing the way we use
our smartphones and when a Moto X plus 1
is announced we expect Motorola to
improve the features that were
introduced for the Moto X in terms of
camera we're also expecting a 12
megapixel camera in the back hopefully
equip adopt achill image stabilization
and from looking at the leaked images
out on the web there's also two LED
flash in the back surrounding the camera
lens which we don't know what that will
do in terms of photo quality but we're
excited to find out what it's all about
we're also expecting the Moto X plus one
to come with two gigabytes of RAM a
bigger two thousand nine hundred million
battery that should last you a full day
especially with active display and we're
hoping for a standard 32 gigabytes of
storage with microSD support for up to
128 gigabytes when it comes to pricing
de moto x + 1 could be around five
hundred dollars off contract and if
that's right that's a fairly decent
price especially for a device that's
coming
Motorola for now we're in the dark in
terms of pricing but we'll find out
during the September fourth event which
will be covering live on TechnoBuffalo
calm so far these are just some of the
few things we think we know about the
Moto X plus one there's a chance that
Motorola can surprises with some new
software features that hasn't been
leaked yet and we're hoping that when
motor oil unveils a moto x plus one we
can see something like wireless charging
from the Nexus 5 a fingerprint scanner
like the iPhone 5s and or maybe unique
integration with the Moto 360 anyways
that's it for this video guys what do
you think we'll see what the new Moto X
plus one let us know in the comments
down below and as always a mark lanegan
from TechnoBuffalo I'll see you guys in
the next video hey thanks for watching
