unboxing the Sonos play:1 this is the
newest most wallet-friendly so no
speaker yet so uh let's check out the
box and see what's inside okay so here
it is the play 1 this is the box it's
surprisingly heavy for how big the
speakers are how small it is I should
say this is the newest a speaker in the
Sonos lineup the play one joins the play
3 am the play 5 and also the play bar
and the sono sub in their lineup of
networked wireless speakers so let's
check out what's inside if you're
curious about the Sonos play:1 it
actually is on sale today like the day
they announced it which is kind of cool
and this is also the most affordable so
no speaker so this is $1.99 and comes to
the bridge so first thing you see we've
got some some literature that I somehow
cannot get out of this pouch there we go
alright so we've got some product info a
little user guide wireless hi-fi so play
three all the play 5 we're just going to
show off all their other products in
here which is great as a user the play
bar in our review we really really
enjoyed the play bar and a lot of good
products sona's has going on but it's
always been real difficult for people to
get into Sonos because of the price
point it's you know can get really
expensive so we are really excited to
see this 199 speaker that comes with a
bridge alright looks like we have the
white version and what else is in here
I'll get to this in a second some more
cardboard and here we go I've got a
couple of cables get your networking
cable if you need it and also your power
cable looks like a nice little 90 degree
power cable here alright so here it is
here's the bag it comes in let's get
this opened up and see what she looks
like
it's one of the nice things about the
play one is it's really beautifully
machined I really like this aluminum
there's no seaming this is really really
cool
if you want to mount it you can really
nice definitely the smallest of all the
sono speakers on top you have some quick
play options here so now instead of
instead of having a bridge here you're
actually able to pause and play from
here which is kind of cool I use walk-up
you hit play and whatever was playing
before on your Sona system you can play
in a particular room and then stop it as
you leave so here is everything looks
really similar to what we saw in the FCC
filing last month
obviously the plug this is kind of a
nice design decision for to them they
decided to go ahead and make this go in
flush just pretty good and then voila
you don't have to worry about weird
cables or anything like that making it
uneven when you set it down so here it
is this is what it looks like it's very
beautiful we're going to be putting it
through its paces we've got a play bar
ready to set this up too you can use
these as stereo so if you buy two of
them you can set them up as a stereo
system with either play bar or by
themselves or with a sub one of our
favorite things about Sonos products is
you're actually able to sort of
modularly add and subtract them from
your audio setup so we will be putting
this thing through its paces leave your
