from TechnoBuffalo here at the box thing
I'm really looking forward to this is
one of the newest latest and greatest
contenders to the tablet crown this is
HP's own touchpad running the newest
version of web OS 3.0 that further ado
let's go ahead and dig in
so here is the Box pretty standard
tablet affair you got a picture of the
device on the front HP branding on the
side you will not see palm mentioned
anywhere on here at all they have been
completely swallowed up interestingly
enough though you do have mentioned of
Beats Audio excuse me are you John Rhett
injure from TechnoBuffalo I I am I am is
that the new iPad it's it's like an iPad
okay thanks man I love your show I
thought it's go ahead and open the box
up almost feels vacuum sealed in there
alright let's slide on that business off
to the side here is the HP TouchPad
first time we've actually held one of
these at the HP event up in San
Francisco they wouldn't let us touch it
so we'll go ahead and push that off to
the side
so you also going to get in the box now
comes the fun part HP is certainly
hoping so we're gonna get books HP
TouchPad getting started legal stuff all
that business no one's ever gonna read
let's go ahead and see what else we got
I will destroy this box I'm sorry is
John Q here too
we're gonna have an awesome we do love
some John Q so you're gonna have your
wall charger with the USB port and then
the micro USB port for charging which it
uses awesome great not while you're here
let's go and take a look at the touchpad
so here is the HP TouchPad and I know
you guys love absolutely love when I
leave the plastic on in my unboxings so
we're gonna go in just leave the plastic
on here taunting you so let's go ahead
and run through the specs for this guy
just kidding so this is probably time
we're ever gonna see this without
fingerprints just pull all that stuff
off you guys have been following my
videos for a while you know I'm actually
a big fan of webOS I really liked the
original pre when it first came out and
I was a big fan of the pre 2 and the pre
pumphrey plus and I even like to be
pixie the veer a little sketchy on all
right so what are we looking at here
we're looking at a nine point seven inch
and of course it's always measured
diagonal screen with
resolution of 768 by 1024 it is running
web OS 3.0 the newest version of webOS
I'll go ahead power this on while I'm
talking using the power button there in
the upper right hand corner that Noah
guy said he liked the pixie I don't
think that guy knows what he's talking
about so we'll let this power out
hopefully you guys can see see the
screen it's being powered by one of the
newest Qualcomm built Snapdragon
processors clocking in at 1.2 gigahertz
and that is dual-core the only camera on
this guy lives on the front that is a
1.3 megapixel shooter which doesn't take
pictures only used for video calling
what I understand there is not a picture
photo taking application on here kind of
fun I guess
it's got 802 11 B G and n it's weighing
in at 261 I'm sorry 26.1 ounces or 740
grams the iPad 2 for comparison is 601
grams so this guy's a bit heavier it's
gonna be juiced up by a 6300 milliamp
hour battery from a pricing standpoint
you're looking at $4.99 for the 16 gig
model or $5.99 for the 32 gig model and
you're also going to have some other
ways to give HP your money I've got
something like this we've got the
touchstone wireless charging dock which
is kind of neat you guys are familiar
with how the touchstone technology works
essentially it's wireless charging so
this has going to dig in here this thing
plugs into the wall
and your touchpad just sits on it and
charges kind of neat and if you like
you're charging wirelessly can pick up
one of those for 80 bucks there's a
Bluetooth keyboard is that Apple Magic
Trackpad it is not there's a Bluetooth
keyboard for for 60 bucks and a few
other accessories you can get with your
shiny shiny new tablet toy so let's take
a look at what the touchpad is gonna do
and still booting up one knock I had on
webOS II when I first use it was a boot
up time is really long so first boot up
time purely looking at a few minutes so
on the top of the device you're gonna
have a 3.5 millimeter headset jack gods
looks like it's doing something
there you go picking languages I've got
your power and lock button the upper
right hand side on the left you've got
two speaker grilles actually so one up
top one down below
we're all that beatsaudio goodness is
going to come from on the bottom of
advice there is your micro USB charging
port and on the right you've got a
volume rocker up and down on the front
there's where the camera button lives
and we have a physical home button here
on the touchpad interestingly enough so
we'll go ahead and do a quick setup if
you guys can see this been an outdoors
unboxing I'm in the US and confirm
English and we'll let it do some setup
so of course they - - TechnoBuffalo for
all of our touchpad coverage we'll be
showing all the new features and showing
tours of webOS and how video-calling
works and everything else touchpad and
multitasking related I am John rhett
endure from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see
you guys next video is anything that you
want to see from the touch pad or web OS
3.0 particular be sure to let us know in
the comments and of course be doing
comparisons with all of the latest
tablets I think that's white coming from
out in the woods oh let me do before I
run away from you guys let me do a real
quick size comparison with some of the
other tablets on the market that you
might be considering I fear is the
BlackBerry PlayBook
which looks downright tiny go ahead and
see the thickness of these two and let's
bring in a tablet that you guys might
know and either love or love to hate the
iPad 2 can go ahead and see you even
taking a stand point there the touchpad
is definitely a little bit small and
addy chubbier side so hopefully you guys
enjoyed the unboxing John Breton German
TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
