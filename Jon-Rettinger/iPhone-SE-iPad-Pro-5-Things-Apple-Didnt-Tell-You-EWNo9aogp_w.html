TechnoBuffalo in this last week we've
had a lot going on with Apple we got the
iPhone SC in the new iPad pro our videos
for them are linked above but what I
wanted to do was make a video with the
top five things that Apple didn't tell
you about their new launch
let's go ed and get started so starting
off with the iPad pro when Apple
announced this the new one the smaller
one we all just thought it was a smaller
iPad pro this is actually not the case
there are some differences in terms of
specs instead of four you're coming in
with two gigs of ram the processor is
clocked in a two point one six eight so
that's a little bit slower graphics is
also slower overall the whole thing is
just slower
this is especially disappointing because
Apple is taking shots as the sort of
Windows market saying that people with
pcs five years or older could use this
as a replacement I'm not so sure about
that with only 2 gigs of RAM one more
thing Apple neglected to mention was
that it's actually running on USB 2.0
with the Lightning port so this is
especially bad for those of you who want
to use SD card attachment they're
pitching this as a pro product but if
you're gonna be transferring photos or
video clips to edit it or to whatever
organize its gonna take forever to
transfer because it's not USB 3 speed so
it's gonna be slow at moving onto the
iPhone se at first I think everyone
thought that this was an iPhone 6s and
an iPhone 5s body I even thought that
but once you do a deeper dive you notice
it's lacking a couple of things one of
which is the newest fingerprint sensor
it's actually running first gen touch ID
not really deal-breaker but something
definitely to note continuing with that
theme on the iPhone se we actually would
downgraded front-facing camera as well
coming in at only one point two
megapixels done you might be like oh
it's the same as a 6 and 6-plus it's
actually a little bit worse it's an f2
point for aperture instead of an f2
point - so not the greatest front facing
camera to say the least and last but not
least we have the battery life on the
iPhone se so Apple didn't really talk
about this I think because they didn't
want to cannibalize their 6s line but in
some categories on their sort of
comparison chart it says that the iPhone
se will get longer battery life on like
video playback or a couple different
things definitely has a bigger battery
than the iPhone 5s so that's a good
thing this isn't really a knock it's
just something they didn't talk about so
let me know what you guys think in the
comments below about the new iPhone and
the new iPad or you guys excited do you
guys not really care
I'm kind of on the math side of things
believe it's comment below we love
talking with you guys give us a thumbs
up if you like this video hit subscribe
for more content like this and let us
know more you guys want to see thanks so
much for watching I'll see you in the
next one you small you loyal you greatly
appreciate that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
