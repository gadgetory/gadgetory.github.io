TechnoBuffalo show I'm lime your three
hubs for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of TechnoBuffalo I'm joined by executive
editor mobile Todd Hazleton everyone and
executive editor of gaming joey davidson
hello first off yes everyone were very
sorry that there was no show yesterday
Microsoft yeah they didn't check with
our schedule and they decide to have a
press conference at the same time the
show happens you know and we called them
and they said first who are you and
second how did you get this number yeah
we already have the room booked so yeah
they just they they went back down they
think we're bigger than you we're bigger
than you yeah so sorry folks so yes
here's the show today Wednesday's are
still our normal day but Microsoft and
Amazon had other opinions apparently and
my color is all messed up so good oh
thank you alrighty that so on this
week's show we're going to be discussing
the Amazon fire TV and Windows 8 Phone
8.1 update I don't know why I always
want to say windows 8.1 phone updater
Wow I don't know why I just it doesn't
roll off my tongue easily that's weird
it is weird so Todd let's start with you
windows phone 8.1 is finally here we saw
you wanted um yeah it's what we wanted
there's a lot of great features i think
the notifications coming through it
looks pretty robust that'll look really
great and then also cortana the voice
assistant but and i'm going to try to
write an opinion on this later today
we're going through our comments and
it's very true that this is a game of
catch up in a lot of ways right like
Microsoft didn't have even like the most
basic notification shade before and now
they do and it didn't have a voice
assist and now they do although court
and looks pretty cool you can actually
customize it like add in let's say you
like sports teams and specific news
topics that she'll learn from that so it
could be better than what we've seen
before from google now and stuff i'm
excited i signed up for the developer
preview
which i think is rolling out before the
end up next week so we'll be playing
around with it well the weather Lumia
920 line beginning it yep yes yeah it
goes all the way back to I think olive
they said all those reasons name is yeah
all right want to apply it but I don't
know if it's enough to get me to switch
back yeah well they said it's gonna roll
out in the next couple of months through
carrier testing and all that but if you
sign up for a developer and I think it's
like 19 bucks to be a windows phone
developer and download this preview app
you can get it by the way so to be as
stable as everybody was I mean that was
on windows phone for over a year before
I just couldn't take it anymore and my
issues came to fold they didn't they
didn't support the software with enough
frequent updates now that that's finally
here it's nearly it's nearly what two
knit two years two and a half years well
yeah and I don't know how frequent it's
gonna be moving forward either I mean
this is sort of ketchup and here they
are now what you know so right well and
I mean as compelling as some of the new
features are you know for me the the
fact that there's three columns of icons
instead of two isn't really the slam
dunk but he did like that wasn't that
wasn't like the game changer for me as
someone who is in that that marketplace
for so long the application support was
horrendous mm-hmm and then it still is
sort of i mean you get the good stuff
like Instagram and all that in there but
the story is still loaded just well I
think that's where my my perspective
differs with with jon rettinger Zack
chua Lee cuz he basically told me and a
lot of our users that like the basic
apps that you need to function are there
um and I know that he believes that and
that's fine but for me I couldn't that
wasn't true a lot of people were using
things you know by the time windows
phone got vine vine wasn't really cool
anymore okay guys right and like we're
still waiting on snapchat I mean that's
a party one but I mean there are some
third party ones and sometimes the third
party ones are amazing almost better
than the first party applications but by
and large it's it's just a mixed bag
of weird minecraft knockoffs and like
yes waiting for first party developers
to come to and I don't understand what
the problem is like it's you're leaving
money on the table when you don't
develop for the platform but yeah I
guess its development costs but you look
at like you know there's no official
pebble app I don't think the Fitbit one
is on there I don't you know all these
wearables now on the market aren't
necessarily on windows phone either so
there's a lot that's were left out and
they actually prob was kind of weird
they didn't announce like a bunch of new
apps yesterday I don't know what they
could have announced with it you know
there's popular the app store is a mess
on the windows phone marketplace it's a
mess and I redid it but beautiful OS
amazing hardware but man now I asked
Todd since he signed up for developers
credentials what he'd be developing and
he actually didn't say shun without
hesitation told me that we will soon be
enjoying toddy bird toddy now yesterday
they have so Microsoft has this really
basic web developer platform where you
can like make it you're going custom app
for whatever and just put RSS these I
made one yesterday called like Tata Tata
yeah can I get this right now I can just
go there and no i didn't publish it or
anything I just probably better than
ninety five percent of the applications
mark emplaced anyway Toby supports it
with microtransactions yeah all that in
there every 4 99 cents you get a daily
photo of todd when he wakes up in the
corner oh yeah you're out a way to do
that it's just a daily picture of him
with bed air woke up like this hey and
here's the picture for neutral third ya
know I am really excited I can't wait to
try it yeah it looks cool and as cheesy
as it sounds like the dynamic background
sing like where you can see the
wallpaper through the icons yeah well
that's pretty dope so and deemed lock
screen and stuff like that right yeah
yeah well it was time it came
long you know will it change Windows
Phones fate we'll have to wait and see
marker chairs increasing so yeah it is
increasing but it's I've seen glaciers
that have moved faster glacial increase
is better than you know Titanic collapse
so I don't think yeah so known as
pulling a blackberry haha say no yes yes
I went there thank you well the the
other major announcement yesterday from
the microsoft event was of course that
hey look we brought back the start
button in Windows is so funny and and
they're adding all this new support for
keyboard and mouse users all of us who
have been here since you know forever
like why wasn't that the priority the
first time and then worked on the
touchscreen stuff I think that they trot
they tried to jump onto the touchscreen
mayhem I mean they wanted a operating
system that made their their tablet
devices as dynamic and useful as
possible and they did it's just that
their tablet devices didn't catch like
wildfire so yeah oh and then if the
stars pro took off and sold like
absolutely gangbusters we probably have
a very different opinion as of Windows 8
but yeah and we might see you know a lot
a lot of new tablets under nine inch
range because they drop down the
licensing yes really to use it now which
a commenter yesterday had said why
didn't you I mean obviously it's not top
five future so I didn't mention it in my
article but I also while it's compelling
news it doesn't mean that every partner
who's already building Android devices
going to do a total 180 and start just
going nuts with Windows I mean there
also has to be demand for these products
right so while there's do you know save
money on it I think right climbing a
tell if that's big I will say the geek
of me is slightly joyful at the fact
that they decide to name their digital
assistant Cortana yes yeah it is cute
you know and it does no harm for those
people that don't know what it means but
ill
for those of those that played halo it's
pretty funny but as for the new phones
that were announced Todd was there any
in the three new Lumias that were
announced that stood out to you um the
630 and 635 are going to be on you know
the low end the 630 is just 3g 35 has
his 4G LTE support and then the 930 is
cool but we've already had it in the US
it's basically the icon with the
European radio set to the icon sort of
falls back on to verizon's 3g network
which is still evdo so the 930 is kind
of one little hspa+ but i think it's
compelling it's going to come in
different colors and stuff like that and
launched with Windows Phone 8.1 so still
a great device so since we're discussing
operating systems and all that regular
contributor Sasha Mahal asks what is
each of your daily driver the wing that
you use personally not just a review
unit every day you wanna go right now
i'm still using the iphone 5s but i had
15 20 and the HTC One m8 right here too
so I have two phone lines I stick with
the iphone mostly because I Tritt up I
use iMessage with my friends all the
time so it's just kind of convenience
but I always have a second sim in
another device Joey yours i'm using the
HTC one mini um a good phone but I
picked it up because you guys gave it to
me after I stopped complaining about the
Windows Phone so yes we should only take
this yeah here are thrown a fall throw
my father no i get i get the unwanted
scraps the stuff that you're all done
with but we don't need that anymore send
it to Joey oh and i'm using a iphone 5s
and an LG g2 like todd i have two phone
lines and this way I can keep up with
the two major OS is at the drop of a hat
which comes in very handy in our line of
work so it's my very reason I I don't
switch very often like my 5s is on
sprint since it's not some
card base I just I stick with the 5s and
as for the for the g2 that one that you
know I switch out from time to time
depending on although I really do like
the g2 I think it's a really nice phone
i love the battery life on it yeah maybe
so the other big thing yesterday was
amazon announcing the fire TV which it's
very easy at first glance to go oh it's
just another streaming box like the roku
or the Apple TV or the chromecast but
after a lot of thought it's feeling a
little bit different Joey why don't you
dive into what you and I were discussing
this morning yeah the will this morning
we kind of started our chat by just
saying like I think that we
miscalculated what Amazon exactly was
going to show off yesterday I think we
were kind of expecting a Roku mixed with
the oh yeah which-which sort of is what
we got but what I think it's interesting
about the Amazon fire TV and what I
think is the most compelling piece of
this puzzle for gaming is the Amazon
game studios I wrote forever ago and
this is what i was talking Li Shan about
why i think that android and iOS will
never compete with the likes of Nintendo
and Sony Microsoft for gaming because
they don't have a first-party studio so
there's no standardization there for
their game creation there's no there's
no one that's kind of setting the bar
and saying your games must be this good
so those marketplaces have kind of
become racist to the bottom you know
whoever can make the crappiest cheapest
app that happens to also be a fad wins
and that that that's proven true time
and time again look at the success of
stuff like Angry Birds I'm flappy bird
stuff like that I mean they're they're
all not very compelling or interesting
titles but they do very very well as
it's cheap or free Amazon Game Studios
is doing kind of the opposite they are
actually recruiting top to your talent
they got Kim Swift the designer of
portal and they got the guy from far cry
2 and I think he did a couple Splinter
Cell Games and a bunch of games in valve
before that so they're going after top
to your talent and I think that the fire
TV will have that first party
standardization
alongside it do I think it's going to
stand toe-to-toe with the xbox one
playstation 4 or even the wii u not
necessarily but i do think that it's
going to be a compelling little machine
and one that that we're kind of debating
whether or not we want to cover and
review style that's what our
conversation was this morning Sean you
know should we be reviewing these games
well and now this just crossed my mind
as we're talking you know yes I I don't
think the fire TV can compete with the
three major consoles but do you think
Joey that there's ancient is that this
may be a let's dip our toe in the water
for something down the road no not
necessarily I think that Amazon's core
services are media streaming you know
that they're they're trying to rent
movies and and sell Prime memberships
with this thing I think the games are
just going to kind of be a tertiary
feature for the platform unless it takes
off I mean if it takes often yes Amazon
will probably want to bulk up and try to
do some new things but they kind of
showed what they're willing to do with
announcing the specs for the device and
it's essentially an android phone it is
interesting to note however that the
game controllers sold out right now is
it really what sold out I think that was
a case of demand not meeting supplies a
boy yeah so that's it's interesting it's
interesting that that that it's sold out
so quickly I think it's very telling
yeah it's a very tiny sliver of evidence
but it's intriguing nonetheless you also
have to figure probably early adopters
and you know like ourselves and
everything or probably well I want to
see what this console can do across the
board and not just right yeah because
like the irvine office ordered both i
ordered both you know I just but that we
are definitely not the typical use case
because we are who we are and that we
have to review everything right now as
for the streaming capabilities of it
mine's not here yet i'm i'm waiting on
the brown truck to pull up and at the
end of the day yes it's another row
who essentially you know if you've got a
roku already or if you have a lot of
apps built into your smart television
it's not necessarily something you're
going to need so that's where I'm going
to be intrigued you know what sets this
apart from the other ones but we'll see
you guys have a roku an apple TV smart
TV chromecast you can pump gas more than
anything I really like it especially
with apps like all cast where you can
stream whatever you want sort of up
there I mean not apps per se but movies
and stuff that I download elsewhere I
have an hdmi cable from my pc i can show
everything yeah exactly you know I find
these devices as interesting and
compelling as they are there a
convenience feature that I don't need
right you know when they show it i'm
just like cool but i already have like
nine other things that play games and
stream media to my television so right
why do i need this thing someone gave me
a chromecast a buddy of mine just handed
me his chromecast is like hey I don't
need this i'm like why don't you need it
and he was like well I have my pc hooked
up to my TV and rifles so I am like so
on my desk Apple TV because I airplay my
screen so i have a double screen from my
macbook and then my TV as the consoles
and then in my room i have the
chromecast like for when I'm in bed
stuff we have a TV man why do you need
more than one TV I don't know and I have
a very tiny apartment too yeah how many
see you have your TV's outnumber the
residents mmhmm yeah this is ridiculous
the TVs in my house also outnumber their
residents and unless you count my dogs
hey and so that I can play games and my
wife can watch TV those and you have an
extra TV yeah oh my god like a 19 years
TV ah
oh well you know what are you gonna do
with this joy word we're tech beans you
know it's yes who we are uh another
question from Sasha Mahal do you think
apple will try to convince the name is
on fire TV by adding gaming another app
support to apple TV I think they're
going to add app support I'm not so sure
about gaming Apple as always tend march
to the beat of its own drummer so but we
all saw it already has games with
airplay yeah all of them obviously but
it's up to developers at that point yeah
I don't know it's gonna be interesting
to see I there's definitely something
going on with the Apple TV where you
know we're not a hundred percent sure
what yet but I don't know I I don't
think they're going to go full-on gaming
I I just don't see that happening what
do you think Joey I mean I think from a
from a gaming writer perspective I think
that Apple has sort of missed the boat
here this ship has started to sail on
whatever they want to do with gaming
unless they show up and say hey check it
out we got game studios now but that's
not happening what can they do other
than create an iOS / app store for below
your TV and how compelling is that for
me it's not really that compelling at
all yeah so I I don't think that's where
Apple wants to go I I just don't think
that they want to jump in and they would
never set up a first-party gaming studio
I I don't feel they would at least yeah
yeah so it would just hungry hey I think
there's going to be a point where iOS
apps probably do make it to the apple
television and that will bring a lot
more gaming but I don't think it will
ever be and we've added gaming right and
that's weak I think you're writing that
will be a software strategy games kind
of go along with it exactly exactly we
have a question from Nathan gold guler
sanai aight guys i am sorry if I
mispronounced names i'm not the best
names what do you guys want to see in a
new chromecast
I would say a lot more apps I mean I
know the SDKs been out since februari
and each more go isn't on it yet yeah it
kinda sorta know it's on there pretty I
use it all time okay then yeah I
honestly I fall back I just unplugged my
chromecast for my television their day I
was like I need to ask you my part yeah
I would say we don't need you hardware
we just need more stuff to do with it
yeah exactly you know and for instance
ago when I want to get my computer on my
television I just airplay my macbook pro
to my apple TV so the chromecast was
kind of redundant for me yeah but for
thirty-five dollars you know it wasn't
horrible investment to give it a try as
for hardware though I really don't think
there's much they need to do to it you
know maybe make it smaller because my
hdmi ports are horizontal so it was
sticking way out of the back which makes
it difficult to put it against flat
surfaces mine spent already it wasn't
very sturdy like I noticed it's already
that's up cuz i push against the wall
exactly so yeah I think they need to
reduce its physical size if at all
possible so that you have more you know
choices into where you're going to place
the television but we'll see if that
happens going down the list here let's
see Thank You Nathan I I see your
pronunciation goo goo oh man I mean I in
Seoul look at Google Syrian thank you
thank you joey ok Google serene got it
Nathan thank you for proposing that okay
uh next question here let's see uh this
is a bit off topic but I'm sure this is
something across 'as a lot of people's
minds from mr. OSCE what do you want on
the next iPhone Todd this is stored in
your screen for me it's really about
battery life I needed more battery
life out of the iphone it's kind of a
pain in the bot that that thing's dead
by like dinnertime almost every day yeah
specially well since i I've got
bluetooth on all the time now to
likewise yeah de feed to my pebble and
it just it kills the battery and I know
that's my fault for having bluetooth on
all the time but yeah I anymore I have
to throw it on a charge around 4-430
since i get up at six thirty I couldn't
even tell you what the iPhone features
right now I have it is that one since
the force idea for a bigger screen but I
have to be honest like um HTC one to
five inches with this with that one m8
and you know I got be that guy like you
can't reach the far course with one hand
and I really do like that about the
iphone so if they go with the bigger
screen I would like to see them sort of
go without the bezels or make it still
in a small form factor so it's very one
hand friendly then i'm i'm not
complaining i love the note 3 i love the
1520 I love big screens I just you know
there's a time and place to use them and
am I the only one that's secretly not
secretly but that just doesn't like the
big screen hardware a lot of people
don't like it but i think you know
because i use two phones it's not that
big a deal i'll just use my other phone
at times when big screen doesn't make
sense but I look I mean for me and when
it comes to a phone over screen sizes is
performance you know right and which is
why I think Sony did something really
interesting with the Xperia Z compact or
z1 compact that it's still a powerhouse
but in a smaller body and I'd like to
see a lot of people still do that but
cut it how does stuff ahead of the
phablet's and stuff like that sell in
Japan do you guys have any idea not sure
about Japan but I know when I've met
with manufacturers they they create a
bigger phones for Asian markets in
general really more popular yeah HTC one
max is a good example of that that was
created because it's very popular in
Taiwan it was sold here on sprint but it
I don't think it did very well Taiwan
Korea and China are phablet nuts but
japan i assume is not I i have not
anything specific on
Japan but I Joey knowing Japan like you
do I I wouldn't suspect that they're big
on that side I mean I know the iPhone 5
is killing it there well I also I think
what I wanted yeah we should ask her
among women I think the experience are
very popular there can Japan in Asia I
don't know Asia specifically well uh
Rhonda well who is one of our gaming
writers lives in Japan so I could be
interesting we'll ask him to just you
know observe on the train does he see a
lot of phablets yeah and you know i I
just I have to say I like big screens
and I cannot lie terrible it was saying
there was low hanging fruit doesn't mean
i had a picket man it did it did I had
to reach out and grab it make the joke
ah you know guys I Sasha bohol thank you
because you're the entire QA q right now
ah hey Joey have you tried goat
simulator I have not not need to get the
ten dollars on a joke ah Brandon said
he's buying it today of course he is
I've heard that hilarious I've heard
that's more fun to watch them play I
from the people i've talked to they
basically just said watch view youtube
videos and you'll be good a trailer
killed me the the Dead Island knockoff
trailer bebegim a cop tree that was
amazing I I mean it's hilarious some of
the secrets are hilarious apparently you
can become a satanic code you can go to
space all that stuff sounds amazing to
me but I don't know I'm not really
wanting to spend ten bucks for a
punchline that might last me you know
like an hour how does a satanic go
differ from a normal good do they just
listen to like a lot Danzig and yeah
it's just the goat just likes metal yeah
he walks around and kiss makeup hate
that kind of metal Oh
metal the hair metal not your mother's
metal okay diamond makeup hey I used to
be a headbanger I can I can name them
all off for you but the white snake is
not metal no white snake has not metal I
fully agree with you having tawny kitaen
crawl around on a car does not qualify
not at all no and it sends me that I
remember Tony contains name yeah that is
sad that there's a little section of my
brain that could have been used for
something important but no I remember
the name of the woman in the white snake
videos yeah what are you gonna do all
right let's see here here's a question
from massage and ball also is
TechnoBuffalo doing anything for the
seventh anniversary at least for the
YouTube channel I you know John and I
discussed it briefly and I we haven't
settled anything hard and fast yet so
possibly I don't know yet you know at
seven years is a good benchmark to go
Wow we've been doing this a long time
now but you just have John eating at
eight oh no we'll do a cake unboxing
yeah there you go with cake the cake is
a lie right not see ya that one was for
you Joey but no problem uh-uh here Nate
nathan is back for you Joey he says goat
simulator really isn't fun to play not
worth the 10 bucks in my opinion there
you go ten bucks joke not I don't think
it's worth it man no it's not funny it's
awesome that it was made but it was just
I mean the guys at coffee stain studios
were screwing around and someone said
that they should sell it so they did you
know released on april first let's be
serious yeah alright so let's discuss
April first for just half a second worst
in use the worst day
to be someone that works on the internet
but I will say this year I think a lot
of companies got it and they made it a
lot more obvious what was jokes and what
wasn't yeah that's true the problem is
when sites try to get in on it like I
think one year and it's actually funny I
think two years ago I got tricked in
like there's a nokia phone running
android i think right and now like two
years later is truth but yeah I think he
was bought gamespot reviewed Shenmue III
like here's here's a Franchot like fans
have been begging for a third Shenmue II
for like decades so they just posted up
the review that was hilarious but no
Joey I have to ask did you catch all 150
Pokemon on google maps no I was stupid
it was just like for that I closed it
yeah I was well okay I I caught all 150
now did you really terrible were you
looking online where to find him when I
got down to like the last 50 or so I was
like okay I have no and some of them
there was one that was out in the middle
of an ocean yeah I'm talking about man
yeah you had to enter the
latitude/longitude to find it ridiculous
there any sort of eyes at the end like
and you got a graphic nice hey I I was
like I was really hoping they were like
going to mail out business cards yeah
something yeah we're outside you
download the Pokemon master business
card yeah yeah yeah I caught all 150 all
right I have no life I fully admit but i
have to say that joke made me laugh
pretty darn hard no it was good it was
funny joke definitely but like once i
got i knew it and started screwing
around I'm just like okay okay well I I
did like the fact that they even went so
far as if you clicked on the Pokemon you
got like their stats and stuff no going
far would have been including the roar
like like so that you could tap and hear
their calls like that would have been
going
but instead it was just a picture of it
and how many other Pokemon you caught
like I need to know like history genetic
disposition come on I i will tell you
sadly there was no vanillish that's just
the original 150 man I know but you know
I kept hoping that maybe he was hiding
an ice cream stand now yeah maybe he was
at every baskin-robbins well me Kyle
from Brazil likes good simulator yep so
yes that does not saying it doesn't have
its fans like it's obviously funny and
if if you get a lot of humor out of that
good for you like if ten bucks seems
like a good valuable purchase to you go
for it just for me I play a crapload of
games and drop in 10 bucks on something
that I'll Lowell at for 15 minutes
really isn't worth it so I cannot tell
you how excited I am ft l came out for
iOS dude dude i play da a one-round this
morning they included a hard difficulty
I've got an 11 hour flight to turkey
class buddy man you're gonna pilot so
many FTL ships I'm going to play a lot
after your complaining am I missing a
lot yes it's 520 so it just released for
ipad for 10 bucks yeah I saw so do you
know what it is Todd no no I don't know
anything of that so it's like a top down
um ship command simulator and basically
what you do is you move from one point
of the galaxy to the other in single
steps and every time you click on a new
step inside a sector a different
situation happens so it's a roguelike
have you ever heard of roguelikes before
nope no likes a random scenario like
randomly generated extreme difficulty
and permanent death so like once you die
you're done the average run maybe takes
30 minutes so you could beat the game in
30 minutes you just have to be super
lucky so I don't know how many hours
have you dumped into that Sean uh about
eight or so Oh get out already we do
just not on the desktop version tough
I worried eight hours today I like ya
know I I know I have I I'm horrible at
the game but I keep trying it's good
it's addicting it's really rewarding
when something awesome happens when
something bad happens like your whole
ship catches on fire it's so depressing
but awesome at the same time it's a
great game exactly well and speaking of
uh having apps for flights Raoul s wants
to know what are your favorite iOS apps
and Joey since you're not on iOS I guess
you can also say whatever your favorite
android apps are typically most android
apps are also an iOS so yeah yeah
exactly uh the the one I just started
playing and I'm fighting oddly addictive
is a Star Wars assault team ah kids are
such a nerd cut if it has star wars in
the title you're all over at are you
maybe I'll of threes that's like the
game I've been playing yes wait stuff I
was gonna recommend threes too and
someone just poured it over to iOS or
Android as well so yeah it's off but it
doesn't work very well on Andrew at
least for me on two phones i have
installed it on it's a little lag Lee
and it doesn't it doesn't like have
runtime support so if you close programs
in me it gets like real messed up um do
we lose Joey we may have Joey happen all
continuous thought what happens on
Three's is that it says it's no longer
installed when i go back to open it
again which is maybe what he was getting
to other he is hey guys hey hey you
froze her first thing um yeah i mean on
mine you know I I used to have a
horrible Magic the Gathering addiction
and then I sold all my cards for a
gigantic ridiculous sum of money made a
huge profit so now I play magic on the
iPad you know so I I still get my fix
without you know spending tons of money
like i used to buy like card packs and
stuff too right there's a couple games
that have something yeah yeah uh my
iPads not
exciting it's a lot of work-related
stuff Pandora a lot of video streaming
stuff Dropcam so I can check out my
dog's a lot of travel apps you know
hotel related stuff airplane related
stuff so I I'm not very exciting when it
comes to apps yeah my iPads like a
reddit machine that's pretty much yeah
Louie use a lot of reddit to uh but I i
guess my most used apps probably
RunKeeper so yep alright let's see here
we'll take one more question and just a
quick know we will be back on Wednesdays
next week folks it's just today was this
week there was just too much going on
unfortunately on Thursday Taj Mahal
again and this is always a a big
question do you think the apple TV set
set actually secretly exists yes I I
make a new one definitely there's
there's at least prototypes you know we
we have over the years never been able
to get to sources to corroborate the
story we have at technobuffalo gotten
one source at one time one source at
another time and the stories never quite
line up of people that tell us they've
seen it but it's never been concrete
enough for us to emphatically say yes
we've talked to people to have seen it
so at which of course I just said it but
I'm putting a lot of disclaimers around
it i did i do think they played with it
i think there are prototypes if we'll
ever see them publicly that's a
completely different question you guys
have any thoughts should Apple ever go
into this field I don't think they need
to I think it would be an expensive
endeavor when really what needs to be
fixed on Smart TVs is software an apple
already has really good software with
that I think they could build on that
with if the rumors are true if they're
talking to comcast about sort of
creating a cable guide sort of what you
see on an xbox one then they can sell
apple tv's to take over your set provide
all of their services at a much more
affordable price and probably larger
margins for that I really don't like the
idea of Apple teaming up with comcast on
anything yeah well I think I think it's
more of just like it they want if
comcast is providing the Cape say they
have a cable input sort of the way that
an Xbox that's right that they would
just work with them on the guide part I
mean I don't know why they would have to
Xbox didn't work with comcast on their
guide right I know I don't know that
just seems like an unholy union that no
one want any part of like I don't want
that comcast and time warner cable lowly
like now alright well guys do you have
any final thoughts for this week I do
completely unrelated okay first of all
go check out the mario kart 8 row that
just released because that thing is
awesome but also in wii u news if you
guys like tactical strategy games
Advance Wars just hit the virtual
console in the wii u todd i don't know
if you ever played that game before no i
didn't but i remember when it was
popular so is on the game boy advance
the original before dual strike on the
DS by it so that they know that people
want those games nice how much is it I
don't know it's like six dogs it's cheap
dodging gold simulator how about that
it's not my only final thoughts are stay
tuned for more windows phone 8.1 stuff
