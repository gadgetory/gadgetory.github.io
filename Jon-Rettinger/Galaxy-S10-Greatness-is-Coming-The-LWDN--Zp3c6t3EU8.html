lowdown I am Robert Rosenfeld and this
is the show that breaks down the top
stories the tech rolling gives you the
info you really need to know every
Tuesday and every Thursday and now that
the no 9 is out Samsung can move full
speed ahead and get to work on the
Galaxy S 10 and we've got some juicy
information some exclusive info on that
phone that you're not going to hear
anywhere else but right here so sit back
relax listen up and get excited for the
Galaxy S 10 here's the lowdown
according to our sources Samsung is
going to release three new Galaxy S ten
phones to spring followed with Apple and
adding a third lower price model to
their lineup and the three new phones
are codenamed beyond zero beyond one and
beyond two with zero being the budget
version beyond one being the standard
s10 and two the s10 plus and we're
hearing rumors right now that the lower
end model will have a five point eight
inch screen similar to the current size
of the s9 screen while the standard s
CAD will get a slight screen size bump
to somewhere between six and six point
one inches and the s10 plus model may
also get a bit bigger going from six
point two to six point four inches but
again these are subject to change
they're just rumors at this point but
some of the juiciest pieces of
information we have on the new Galaxy S
tens has to do with their cameras we're
learning that all three of these phones
will have the same two cameras a
wide-angle lens with a variable aperture
of f15 and f2 point for a super wide
angle under than F 1.9 aperture and the
larger s 10 Plus will be the only of the
three phones who have a triple camera
setup adding a third telephoto f2 point
for lens to the wide and super wide
angle lens and despite some recent
reports our source tells us that the new
trio of galaxy flagship phones may not
have an in display finger in reader
built in after all we're hearing it's
currently being tested on this new fleet
of phones but it may not be perfected
and ready to go in time for mass
production and the launch of the new
flagships it's also long been rumored
that we could see a true face ID
competitor from Samsung finally emerged
with special built-in hardware on the
phone but the details on this are still
very much unknown right now we haven't
seen any big leaks recently to give us
any credibility and it's all just kind
of rumors and speculation at this point
as far as design goes the new Galaxy S
1002 retains slim bezels they will not
have a notch and may look a little bit
more like the note 9 in terms of design
besides screen size we don't know much
else about that lower end s10 model we
don't know price we don't know if it
could have a smaller battery or maybe
it's missing some more premium features
the other models have but seeing that it
will most likely have the same camera
system as the regular size S 10 it looks
to be a very compelling option that
could come with a lower price tag
we don't have any additional information
regarding onboard storage or price or
anything like that but as soon as we get
it in we will let you guys know and one
last bit of information for you guys
today we're being told the next
generation of the note the note 10 is
codenamed DaVinci and development on it
started just two weeks ago so what do
you guys think of the Galaxy S 10 is the
addition of a lower-priced model to this
lineup issues in for you guys maybe you
would now consider the new s10 when you
couldn't consider the s9 before because
of the price also what do you think of
that triple camera set up on the s-pen
plus looks pretty cool leave a comment
down below and let us know and you could
be featured if you leave a comment in
the next episode of the lowdown and if
you missed our rumor roundup on the
oneplus 60 we went into all the details
on that phone and Joshua keys left a
highly-rated comment and said this
sounds weird for you to say that
traditional - camera setup crazy how
times change
Joshua first off thank you so much for
commenting and watching and secondly
yeah it sounded weird to even say that
we're seeing more and more phones on the
market right now with three cameras the
sn+ is probably gonna have three cameras
and as camera technology gets better and
we get more improvements on these smart
phones four or five maybe six cameras
are going to make their way onto flex
your smart phones who knows what's gonna
happen but for me the more cameras the
better alright guys it's all I've got
for the load on today thank you so much
