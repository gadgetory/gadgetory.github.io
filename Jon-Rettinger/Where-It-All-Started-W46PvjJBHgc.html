growing up I never really thought that
much about technology we're fortunate
enough to kind of always have it around
now I remember not having internet but
their member time before and then we got
an AOL and prodigy and it was it was
dial-up but it was opened up a whole
like new world for me but I was always
ingrained with technology the very first
video ever made of that Santa Rosa
MacBook Pro I didn't how think I've ever
talked about this on camera actually I
didn't have enough money to buy that
computer I actually asked my parents if
they would help me buy that computer so
I remember they gave me about three
hundred dollars towards it and then I
was able to cover the rest and I paid
them back a few months later but without
their help to buy that first computer
that kind of launched the John four
Lakers YouTube channel I don't know if
the channel would have ever like ever
taken off and probably like most people
watching these videos I'm family tech
support I'm who my parents call for
anything and that that goes back to the
early days here it was kind of my role
in the family and something that I loved
having that responsibility and I liked
that I had think that my parents could
ask me to help them with so my parents
have been over to to my house and I've
got smart doorbell
I've got cameras all over my house when
somebody rings my doorbell I get alerts
on my phone I have smart displays that
are showing up and they like that level
of security they want two cameras around
the house just they could keep an eye on
things when they're not around I set
them up a few years ago with a bunch of
echo devices so that's the ecosystem
that they're in they've got an echo show
in the kitchen I have a few others
around the house that sort of been what
they are used to so I really wasn't sure
you know what to get them so actually
reached out on Twitter to see what was
the best I got a ton of awesome
recommendations from inexpensive to
crazy expensive to closed-circuit
cameras had a lot of recreations for for
blink so I have a couple of their xt2
cameras that I'm going to set up around
my parents
my parents have an older house they
don't have plugs and outlets everywhere
these are pretty much Wireless they can
last for up to two years on two double-a
batteries which is really awesome my
parents aren't looking to spend a lot of
money for for cloud recording so
Amazon's actually gives not just them
but anybody who has an xtq camera two
hours of free recording that when he hit
that two hour mark util record something
else and will keep all the footage for a
year you can do a lot with the motion
it's detecting and the field of motion
and when it starts recording
it's got two-way communication it's
relatively reasonably priced willing to
a down below pricing is changing all the
time but it seemed like a perfect option
for them to make sure that you know
what's going on is secure and then have
proof and be able to see you know who is
outside alright so inside of the blink
x2 box I got a couple over here but it's
pretty simple we've got the blink extra
camera we've got two parts go together
formatting it's just two screws it's
made it really simple and then it also
comes with your two double-a batteries
for your up to two years of battery life
and then the mounting screws in the box
as well and that's really it's a pretty
pretty simple experience to get these to
work though you're also going to need
it's called the sync module so you got
to pick up one of these as well all
right so we got all the cameras and the
sync module in box it's time to get
setting up
and so we got the cameras all ready to
rock the setup was stupid easy download
the app scan the QR code on the back pop
in batteries and that's really it I got
everything all set up with the echo show
I just had to enable the blink scale on
her and then on the phone it was pretty
easy so I can show you show me front
door and there's a front door and I
could ask to show me any other cameras
that I named and they'll show me the app
is pretty easy to use by default the
cameras kind of aggressive with the
motion sensing so I turned that all the
way down I didn't want to use up my two
hours of a lot of recording right away
but you can pick where the things are so
for the cameras that are inside I turn
the motion detecting off for the one
that's outside I kept it on I figured
that made sense people are around the
house all the time but not often coming
to the front door you also get a lot of
other granular controls inside of the
app video quality how long you want the
clips to be how long you want them kept
for so everything is set up and most
importantly everything is working so now
my parents and check in on their house
who's at the front door whether they are
home and upstairs and here's something
maybe going on downstairs whether or not
they are away I didn't have to run any
wires which is pretty nice got to worry
about solar panels or anything like that
battery exposed they will last up to two
years so it's simple I feel safer my
parents here they feel a little more
comfortable and I kind of feel like a
good son for doing something good for my
family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
