network it's Buffalo bullets inside
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story we talked about on
the show check the description for links
or click on the graphics for each story
if you have annotations available and
toggled on i'm ashley sceva here your
top stories apple fans rejoice the
iphone 5s and 5c released today with
folks lining up around the country to
get their hands on the newest from
cupertino if i look tired today it's
because i was waiting in line last night
don't judge me at least i didn't sit
through this
yep those are Japanese folks waiting it
out through a typhoon to get their
iPhones that is dedication when
Microsoft bought Nokia earlier this
month rumors began swirling that
Microsoft made the purchase in part to
kill off a rumored android-powered
lluvia phone that Nokia was working on
that's a pretty big scoop of true and
now see tech is also confirming that
Nokia was in fact tinkering with a
mid-range android device before the
buyout the phone will now likely never
see the light of day but there is a
chance one of 10,000 rumored prototypes
might leak from Foxconn fingers caressed
everybody in gaming grand theft auto 5 s
released just made a ridiculous amount
of money over 800 million bucks in
single day sales crushing the previous
record of 500 million and a day held by
call of duty two black ops our very own
joey davidson is smack in the middle
overviewing GTA 5 and we'll have that
for you as soon as we can but until then
jeez eight hundred million dollars is a
lot of bank heists and murdered hookers
Nintendo also in the news this week as
they announced wii sports club for the
eShop coming november seventh wii sports
club offers five classic wii sports
games remastered for the wii u and
containing additional features like
regional clubs and online play the price
ten bucks for each sport which is pretty
steep all things considered but you can
also buy a day pass for two dollars that
unlocks all five sports for 24 hours oh
and only tennis and bowling will be
available on launch day it's kind of
weird right and our wild card for the
week is from our very own recently
hitched Todd Hazleton who spoke to 18
tees senior vice president of network
operations john donovan about various
topics from AT&amp;amp;T LTE rollout to dead
