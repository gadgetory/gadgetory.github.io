two-part tour for you of the AT&amp;amp;T tilt
to this part is going to cover mostly
the software so it's going to be windows
mobile or Windows Phone 6.5 and HTC's
own touchflo 3d the next part we're
going to cover some of the coolest
hardware things that this device
actually has let's go ahead and jump
right in this is going to run you to 99
after a fifty-dollar mail-in rebate on
of course a two-year contract with AT&amp;amp;T
but if you are in Europe or anywhere
else in the world this is going to be a
very similar experience what you're
going to get with a touch pro 2 whether
it's a locked or an unlocked device
based on your carrier so you're going to
see right here is a familiar touchflo 3d
interface it's not your typical windows
mobile thing that you may be used to
seeing so the main navigation is done
through this bar across the bottom
essentially the way this works it uses a
resistive touchscreen put your finger
down you can slide across and you can
see all the different options that are
there now one of the new additions to
this version touchflo 3d if you can
actually customize in the order of these
tabs which is quite nice one of the
knocks on windows mobile or Windows
Phone spin that it's hasn't been the
most finger-friendly of mobile operating
systems in the past and it's also not
the best-looking operating system in the
past it's certainly very functional for
professionals or those that are used to
or like the operating system but for
those that are maybe are new to it it
hasn't been the most intuitive so HTC
try to fix that and with their skin
touchflo 3d you most of the time we
never even have to get into typical
windows mobile let me show you some
examples of that right here from the
home screen this is the main screen
you'll see you've got calendar if we tap
calendar we're taken to a new completely
different skins calendar application
that we're used to sing for windows
mobile flick scrolling through each
month and if you want to add something
just give it a tap and you get a new
appointment window which is very
different than what you've had in
the past automatically jumps you over to
calendar down below you can view it by
month day or you know year even if you
like new appointment you select that and
now you're into windows mobile but to
get to that point you at least get some
skinned more finger friendly and some
would say dumb down view I find it just
easier to navigate and certainly a lot
simpler to use without a stylist let's
go back home we're going to go hit the
end key for that so one of the new
things that's found in the tilt two and
at least for the US market it's one of
the first phones that has windows mobile
6.5 or like I said they're now calling
it windows phone and the biggest change
it you're going to see in there is in
the start menu gone is sort of a grid
array start menu with a little scroll
bar on the side you've now got a
honeycomb finger friendly look so you
can access that in two ways either hit
the start at the top or the start button
right here we'll go ahead and hit it at
the top now you get a honeycomb sort of
you and you can scroll through into your
programs much easier now certainly it
has a resistive screen so you got to
push down to make contact but is a very
responsive resistive screen which is
quite nice if you can find one of the
things that you like you can actually
move at the top or drag it anywhere
you'd like so there it goes right to the
top you know people that really split on
whether or not they like this honeycomb
view I think it's a much easier way to
navigate and view all of your
applications personally I think it's a
nice easy way to go so one of the other
things that's new for windows mobile 6.5
and really one of the highlights is the
marketplace let me show you that very
quickly so go ahead open it up and I
should mention that it's not a thing
that's automatically installed when you
get a windows mobile 6.5 device it's
actually a dot cab file that you have to
download and install and then you get
this marketplace and most of the
programs right now are free and they're
tied to your windows live account so you
have to register a windows live account
if you want to download anything whether
free or not so it is a very nice looking
elegant interface I think it looks
relatively similar to the Android
Marketplace I think so you can scroll
through and see sort of what the most
popular are so we'll hit most popular
and you can view
what's in here now there aren't that man
you speak of right now certainly more
than the palm app catalog went when that
launched but certainly not as many as
say the iphone app store or blackberry
app world or even android marketplace
but there are quite a few in motifs
notice them are free but you get some
expensive ones so here Tetris is seven
dollars so when you click one let me
show you what happens go back up to the
top you know scrolling isn't necessarily
the smoothest in the world I'm just over
a typical 3g connection right now with
two bars so it gets a little bit laggy
but it's not bad certainly you can
navigate through so here's one called
took a free one so here's mobile manager
for Netflix so it loads certainly and
you get some information on it some
features reviews or screenshots and you
can see what it looks like you know it's
a what you'd expect from a mobile
marketplace you know there was mobile
market places on Windows Mobile long
before the App Store the hand dango
store for example one of the nice things
about Windows Mobile that you could
download files directly to the device in
a dot cab format and this sort of takes
that cab file format and puts it in a
better-looking package wow that's easier
to navigate and find things and if you
want to install it you just hit download
and it installs quite obviously let's go
back so this is again probably the
biggest change 6.5 at least from the end
user experience that you're going to see
is the honeycomb menu structure if we're
using a nun skin device so a windows
mobile device that's not using touchflo
3d you're going to see other sort of
finger friendly enhancements windows
mobile 6.5 seems to me to be a stop gap
in between now and what will be windows
mobile seven point 0 coming probably
sometime in 2010 let me show you some
other cool things that the device has
I'm not going to walk you through
everything down here because otherwise
this is going to get to be a 30 minute
video but some cool things that you can
see are let's say to go to internet this
takes advantage of opera mobile so it
uses opera
to use its web browsing as opposed to
pocket internet explorer which my
opinion not the best web browser in the
world we're going to get into web
browsing a little bit more in the next
part of the series when we cover some of
the hardware and also obviously internet
now what you can do here is actually add
push home pages what that does is at a
prescribed time automatically puts the
new version of a web page so if you
youtube.com slash John for lakers if you
check that say once a day you can set it
to every day at noon have it
automatically push the page there so
there is no lo time the web browser is
quite nice so hit no there go back well
launch the web browser so just a sort of
a standard web page this is the AT&amp;amp;T web
page you can view the site in one of two
ways so now it's going to load up or
give it a second to to queue so here we
are you can view it either in standard
portrait or you can view it in landscape
flat it up it automatically rotate the
zoom is done via the zoom bar down here
we'll talk about more in part to put the
backup role your finger across and it
zooms certainly there is no multi-touch
to be found but web browsing will be
covered more in depth in part 2 so in
the interest of brevity I'm going to cut
this video and we'll leave the rest of
the titillating details of the tilt two
for part two for exclusive content be
sure to check me out on twitter
twitter.com / john for lakers and to
learn more about TechnoBuffalo check out
TechnoBuffalo comm links to all those
will be up in the sidebar hope you guys
enjoyed and stay tuned for part 2 of the
ett tilts or the touch pro 2 and i'll
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
