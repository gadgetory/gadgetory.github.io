go further what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here live
from CES 2013 samsung's kia literally
just ended and they unveiled a ton of
stuff let's go ahead and run down we can
expect from Samsung in 2013 let's go
ahead and start with the computer side
of things you're looking for a new
laptop Samsung hopes they've got you
covered let's start the series 7 ultra
it's a windows 8-powered laptop eight
hours of battery life 17 millimeters
thin 13.3 inches with amazing viewing
angles intel core i5 or i7 processor
made of aluminium looking for sort of a
macbook air at replacement this is gonna
be a great windows option for you the
samsung galaxy note 10.1 is now gonna be
equipped with 4g LTE i'll be coming to
verizon wireless sometime next month
then things got a little bit interesting
samsung went to the refrigerators they
make a ton of home appliances
refrigerators and washer and dryer to
actually have a Samsung washer and dryer
and love it so then build the t nine
thousand smart fridge got an LCD screen
32 cubic feet of storage you can connect
the smartphone to it and share recipes
notes and more actually can double as a
baby monitor kind of cool to you can
configure how different compartments in
the fridge are if they want to be a
fridge or a freezer just hit a button
and it changes which sounds really cool
boys wonder way to do it the stuff
that's already in your freezer you have
to let it thaw door in the meantime and
I told me I was wondering what was going
on so next what gets all the good stuff
samsung unveiled a ton of TVs and
evolutions for their TVs so Samsung is
making their 2012 TVs even smarter
fulfilling the promise that they said
last year with their smart TV evolution
kit essentially it's taken last year's
TV and adding in quad core processor
it's very simple it just snaps right
into the back and something you can take
advantage of all the new features no
word donor these state we're pricing for
that the next set of TV Sam second
available is really their bread and
butter for 2013 the f8000 series of
televisions that's got a quad-core
processor the same processor that you're
gonna get and that smart evolution kit
it's got the bezel list almost bezel s
it measures under point 25 inches it
almost makes it look like it's floating
the experience is supposedly three times
faster than 2012 TV models which is
pretty incredible
support for voice commands movie
requests full support for full sentences
and language the pretty cool a ton of
the S features are making their way to
the televisions and then things got
super high-end the 84 inch 4k TV this
thing is an absolute stunner to see even
from all the way back of the convention
center room you can see how gorgeous
this TV actually was it's got a totally
floating design the model numbers want
to get all technical is the UN 85 s9
it's gonna land in March no idea on
pricing yet but don't expect that sucker
to come cheap it's got a 1.3 garrett's
quad-core a 15 processor it's got 120
12.2 speaker system built into the stand
I'm not sure if we can take it out of
the stand yet they did not say it did
make a very big deal of how it floats
inside of it and the speakers are built
in really impressive what we didn't see
those talks of new phones galaxy s4 or
note 3 supposedly willows will come at
Mobile World Congress Lisa galaxy s4
hopefully in the note 3 following a few
months later at IFA and Berlin over all
these TVs are extremely impressive and
TVs are really hard thing to report on
cuz doesn't do it justice is me talking
about a look at it behind me it actually
see them in person they really are
absolutely stunning this is a packed
house and Samsung really seemed to
deliver they brought a ton of oh so we
didn't talk about from monitors for
windows 8 and some other laptop options
but really those were the highlights
what do you guys think about him are you
excited not excited really courtesy with
that 85 inch TV looks like up close and
personal check out technobuffalo come
