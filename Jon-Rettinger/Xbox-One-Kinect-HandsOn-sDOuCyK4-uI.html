that are in green if you want but
sometimes it doesn't listen so sometimes
they'll say like snap and it will do
nothing xbox select snap Netflix stop
listening what does it need to stop
listening every time like it knows that
that's what you wanted xbox stop judging
I don't think that's I don't think
that's real I don't think it's a real
command John you know we can button that
can turn the camera around um I think
it's on the controller which would sort
of defeat the point of it um maybe it's
like Xbox switch no actually just didn't
listen to me at all didn't even hear
Xbox idea yeah Xbox switch Xbox switch
ah why does it always listen to you this
has been happening just so everyone
knows this has been happening the entire
time we've set this up like it does not
listen to me a lot of times I'd say 80%
of the time Xbox is like dogs
Xbox unsnap nothing Xbox unsnap this
video is extremely disobedient Xbox stop
listening see you listen to me when I
tell it to stop listening all right but
it doesn't do anything Xbox go home Xbox
go home trying to match your you know
you're in the cadence this is this is an
outrage I'm gonna write a letter to me
Nelson about this is trying to tell you
meals Xbox Netflix don't stop listening
let's try let's try one more Xbox Bing
Scarlett Johansson nothing you can do
Xbox and wait for to go Bing ok Xbox
Bing nothing Xbox and we've worked in be
but it didn't even start Xbox Xbox no
it's just a goner maybe it froze Xbox
Xbox unfreeze yourself nope it's still
not refrozen Xbox well no it just
doesn't most neither let's go ahead and
say Xbox sounds right there Xbox Xbox
whoa Xbox whoa
Xbox hello please Xbox Xbox please
excuse me mister Xbox perhaps we should
be kinder don't want to bother you
you're looking so fabulous today Xbox
Xbox Bing see it listens to you will not
listen to me Scarlett Johansson it is
her birthday today
Sam Co wait listen what did you see what
it said that about you said that look
what it's urgent
it did get that but did you see what if
I said was like saying something so
craziest Xbox go home
Xbox go home Xbox Bing TechnoBuffalo
oh that's depressing Microsoft about
that okay it's hard for me to go home
stop listening it always listens when I
say stuff illicit stop listening maybe
uh say with authority I'm gonna try I'm
gonna make my voice deeper Xbox I'm
gonna take my boys hired Xbox we sit
stop listening something okay turns it
off Xbox go home Xbox go home alright I
got it to work that time man
well that was quite a fun than fun
exercise I feel like you need to learn
our voices better I feel like maybe the
ladies should wait Microsoft should
patch it with the listening to women
patch women patch yeah that was really
disappointing yeah you guys didn't see
on count off before we filmed our that's
a whole bunch of tests of actually
saying it than me trying to say the
exact same cadence and it not
recognizing her voice that at all but
then it would totally pick up John so I
I don't know what the deal maybe it's
like a I mean obviously my voice is a
higher frequency so maybe I'll talk why
couldn't dog hear it
I just I don't have this many issues
with my 360 Kinect which is very strange
to me because I was really expecting
this to be super fast and responsive but
it doesn't actually seem that way not
not this far at least I mean these for
you for me it works great yeah well
you're a man
no I yeah it's just really I mean I'm
really surprised I will I will say that
I'm very not pleasantly surprised at all
actually
I'm truly unpleasantly improve with her
I should hope so
I'm sure there's the technologies in
there to really make it amazing he's a
technology in there for this Xbox to get
better it didn't
Xbox get better get better get better
snap party that's great so I think it
works selective listening just like
every other gamer I know do it if it was
just me using Xbox we didn't have the
experience with you hear that same works
fine right I mean it works as advertised
but then it didn't just been me I would
have been like this thing doesn't work
at all and I'm really annoyed so your
experience may vary yeah if you guys
have that same issue like please feel
free to drop it in the comments I'm
