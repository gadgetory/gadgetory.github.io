number i just want to take you through
sense 5 on the HTC one in that starts
with this blinkfeed front facing the
screen here so this is your home screen
that's part of sense 5 can also use this
home screen if you are also notice in
the applications you've got the weather
oezil top there and if you do this I
sort of pulled down you can customize
your applications alphabetical or most
recent hide or manage apps or change the
grid size even so say you want to
rewrite for of it that just sort of
gives you more space there with the
whole experience pull down the top and
you've got remote now what's that that's
part of their new software which is
based on appeal and so in the power
button there there's actually an IR
blaster so you could look at the TV and
we have on here
on demand it doesn't look like he wants
to show us watch on what's on TV we
could actually change the channels doing
this we've seen this in other products
from Samsung for example but not in
smartphone before it's a really nice
value added as part of sense 5 another
thing is Boone sound those are the
speakers here so the idea behind that is
great audio experience and they can take
in awesome quality audio so if you're at
a really loud show for example and I
just have this experience and you want
to play back the video you record it
often sounds really junky an HTC says
that this will actually provide a much
better experience beats audio of course
is again part of the sense 5 experience
and that comes with the enhanced 3.5
millimeter headphone jack it's got a
higher voltage less you get better sound
but also we have here
so there's the TV application that i was
talking about already well let's see if
it works again this time
nope it's not going to work for us okay
and lastly part of sense 5 one of the
big things is the Zoe camera and I have
a detailed video on that but basically
you can take pictures at any time in Zoe
mode here and say you snap a shot but
it's actually recording a three second
sample at the same time which then you
can use create a highlight reel and I
discussed that in the Zoe video that I
just shot any case this is Todd Hazleton
with TechnoBuffalo we're just taking a
look at sense 5 on the HTC one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
