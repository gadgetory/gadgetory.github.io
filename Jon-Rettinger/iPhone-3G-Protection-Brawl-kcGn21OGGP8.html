iphone is an expensive piece of
technology and as such we all want to
protect our investment some people use
full cases some you scratch protection
and in that scratch protection field
there are three major players first one
as I've demonstrated earlier is clear
coat the next invisible shield and
finally the third bodyguards and these
are very durable rough plastic s
substances that cover your phone in its
entirety that are protected in your
pocket from keys from scratches and
Nick's certainly not going to shield it
from drops or protects them from
everyday use so I'm going to try all
three of these and I'm going to show you
how to put them on and we're going to
see which one is the best from a price
standpoint from an installation
standpoint from a protection standpoint
then I guys stay tuned and I hope you
enjoy buh-bye so the first product we're
going to talk about is bodyguards this
will run you about 25 bucks and it does
come with what they're calling the two
advantage gives you lifetime
replacements and it gives you to
complete bodyguards in the box it's
actually quite nice let's go ahead and
open this up and I'll show you what
comes inside you off the plastic the
boxing these things relatively
unimpressive and I assume that they'll
all look relatively similar inside open
it up bodyguards got you covered little
plastic card and we have a pen which is
traditionally the application that goes
on to the phone and say liquid sort of
glue but doesn't do any permanent damage
to the phone and it's of course
removable let's see what else we have
installation instructions are right on
the side and I'm going to install this
live on camera so you'll see that and
here are the bodyguards themselves apple
iphone 3g layout and that's it big box
not much in it let's see we can find
anything else they got hidden in here
usually they include some sir
squeegee but that does not appear to be
the case unless it's hiding in there
which it's not so I'm going to assume
that this plastic piece is actually a
squeegee that you use to slide it down
and get rid of air bubbles so let's go
ahead and start with the installation so
I lay on a towel here because these
installations can get a little bit hairy
you're spraying this liquid stuff all
over you and oftentimes you have to
spray them all over your hands so you
don't want to get your table or desk
dirty so let's go ahead take a look at
the directions step 1 what your hand to
the application solution and keep them
wet whenever you're handling the film
fair enough be careful not to drop or
cut out make sure you spray the back of
the film nice and easy lay the piece
onto the device getting its close the
final position as possible all right
squeeze you the middle using overlapping
strokes don't push too hard make sure to
squeegee out all the moisture and soap
if you do not have a haze will slowly
appear under the film making the vice
look foggy don't panic this moisture
will dry out over 12 24 hour period okay
and give you some hints as well no big
deal let's go ahead and get cracking so
step one is to spray my hands at the
solution so make sure I do let me say
whenever you're touching any of the film
to make sure your hand is wet the
solution so I'll go ahead and do that
just feels like water no no burns times
good alright so my hands are covered
with the solution I will now take piece
of it off go ahead and remove it and I
have to spray the sticky side so i will
do that right now so make sure it's
pretty well covered so i'm going to do
that appears to be pretty well covered
now they say take it and lay it on top
of the device now putting something wet
on top of my iphone there's a little bit
nerve-wracking for me but i have using
the past and i know that this is just
standard procedure and they do work so
i'll go ahead and slide it where it
needs to be should slide relatively
easily
there we go put it over the button right
there looks pretty good so I laid it out
of the device and next thing i want to
do squeegee from the middle on outward
so i'll take that plastic piece from
earlier you can see there are some
massive bubbles there i'll kind of hold
my finger in the middle and i'll start
to squeegee outwards we see those bubble
stuff to go away this around go the
other side now they say let this sit for
about 10 to 20 minutes for it to settle
so I'm going to go ahead and leave this
here for 10 to 20 minutes and I'll turn
the camera back on in a few the screen
protector is on actually it's on so nice
and clearly you can't even see that it's
on there a little bit dirty needs to be
cleaned there's also excess liquid on
the front but nothing a quick breath and
rub on your shirt won't get off and
really you can't even see that it's
there let's go ahead and move on to the
back of the device this is a much bigger
piece and we're going to go ahead and
follow the same steps I will wet my
hands just a little bit weird to have to
do but listen require that you do do
this say it's ticking okay so my hands
are nice and wet and we will go ahead
and peel this off this is a much bigger
piece and it takes out the entire back
of the device I want to break it as I'm
pulling it off in just feel like putting
a real big sticker on your phone I guess
it's kind of what it is even though it
is a protective sticker and look at that
as we pulled it off the bottom part that
covers the port on the bottom actually
broke off and I wasn't applying any
excessive pressure so I'm gonna have to
pull off the other side of that and
install and actually maybe this is
reason that they give you two let's go
ahead and truck this one and we'll go
ahead and move on to the
one so I thought maybe they are giving
you two just so you have an extra one or
give to a friend I ventilated giving you
two because they're pretty easy to break
alright so here is take two now we'll
try and be a little bit more careful I
don't know if that was my air or just
these are a little bit more delicate
than I anticipated but we will go ahead
and try it nonetheless I'll peel this
top part off on its own there are a lot
of corner pieces here that make a little
bit difficult to peel this all off in
just one shot there we go no look at
that broke off again so I guess that is
a big big big big negative for
bodyguards but i'll go ahead and try and
put this on anyway actually the bottom
part stuck to the top which is a little
bit annoying we'll go ahead and try and
put this on and see if it can work even
with a broken bottom piece because if I
broke too odds are you may break yours
as well we're going to spray this with
all the business looks nice and soaked
and it is and we'll go ahead and place
it on the iphone so easy to tell what
goes where just by that little camera
hole so place it right on top of the
camera hole I'm kind of bend it and fold
it appropriately make sure it covers
everything so this top part here is
close to cover
that it got stuck again and broke off
just putting it on I'm not even going to
try to finish putting us on two pieces
have broken on two separate films so
moral of the story is bodyguards great
for the front of your device not so good
for the back that have been to that have
broken that was very careful with each
so can't recommend the bodyguards as a
first shot let's go ahead and move on to
another all right guys next up we have
clear coat or product actually reviewed
about a month or so back and a product
that I use on my iPhone on a regular
basis so I can vouch for it is actually
very good but can be little bit
difficult to install there's a box clear
coat scratch protection for your
electronics how it works scratch proof
lifetime guarantee and installation
guarantee don't worry if you mess up
installation will give you another clear
code to try again so that's nice so the
recognizing that is a little bit
difficult to install but they are stand
behind the product once you get it
installed doesn't open up the box this
will look pretty similar to last one
you've got sort of the Griffin with the
installation guy to take a look at that
in a minute here is the front of the
iphone sticker and here's the back of
the iphone sticker why should we call
them sticker it's a very thick sort of
plasticky material we've got the liquid
stuff that you spray on your hands and
the device and a little rubber squeegee
and that's about it so let's go ahead
and get to the installation so the
installation instructions here are
pretty similar to the last 16 and spray
your fingers with the spray so we'll do
that fingers are good we'll take the
phone we'll start with the front peel it
off
and want to spray the entire sticky side
of the plastic so I will do that plugs
better to err on the side of caution
here and keep spraying if we're not sure
you got everywhere even if it's dripping
off you know that's okay and keep
spraying your fingers to make sure that
they're they're wet and don't get stuck
to the cover so here we go go ahead and
place that right on top I know it looks
really weird to put something so wet on
your iPhone but it does work so again
place it right where it looks like it
belongs so not covering the button and
with enough room for the speaker grill
okay so the next step is keeping this
firmly in place take the squeegee and
shoot out any bubbles or excess fluid
that might be in there can be a little
bit difficult because it keeps moving
around I recommend letting it sit
actually for maybe a minute to two
minutes before you start squeegee as you
can see it still kind of flailing around
a little bit alright so it's a bit more
stable but still moving around but
that's not a problem we'll just start
squeegeeing out all the air bubbles from
underneath there pretty simple go to the
top besides really don't see any left it
looks like all the air bubbles are
taking out it's pretty a simple process
but it can be a little time consuming to
make sure you got everything right so
when you're done it should not look like
anything should look like just the front
of your iPhone you shouldn't be able to
see it bubbles or wrinkles at all
alright the next step this is where
clear coat is unique they're saying wet
the top of the squeegee now and continue
to wipe out the bubbles so we'll do that
spray it as greedy and we will keep
wiping out the bowls it's almost like
painting it on there you kind of want to
make sure that you get everywhere i'm
not sure why this step is necessary but
I did it when I installed the clear coat
the last time
came out very nice so definitely go
ahead and follow the instructions make
sure you get the corners and don't
forget there we go looks like we got the
entire thing so the screen protector is
on and working pretty well and I should
mention make sure your device is awful
you're doing this so we're going to move
on to the much more difficult back of
the device this one is a little bit
tricky and I'll show you why I will
follow the same steps that we did
previously with the clear coat so first
I will wet down my fingers awesome wet
down we'll go ahead and peel this off
and see if we cannot break it like we
did the last one these are a little bit
more durable it looks like there we go
we got it off in one piece so we're
already a step ahead we will wet it down
that's one you really want to make sure
you use a lot it's still weird to me to
keep putting something soaking wet onto
your device but that's just the way it
works so here is the iphone powered off
here is the clear coat go ahead and kind
of wrap it on this one's definitely more
difficult because the corners never seem
like they're going down and actually
tell you that it's okay at the corner
seem like they're peeling up just keep
pushing them back down could take a good
sometimes even three hours to get
everything to stick right it's a little
bit weird you never quite feel like you
have it right I know when I put on the
first time I never felt like I had this
same working like it was right and then
a couple hours later it dried and it
looked perfect so you can see the edges
are totally sticking up everywhere thing
is sliding around but we'll go ahead and
follow the steps anyway and we will
start squeegeeing so about five minutes
have passed and i'm still kind of
pushing this down I'm still struggling
with it but it's starting to stick down
just a little bit more not much but a
little bit so I'm going to wet down the
squeegee here like they say and I'm
going to keep on squeezing make sure you
get the sides here make sure you're
putting everything down so I'm going to
turn the camera
off you guys and have to watch me play
it this for a while but I will tell you
how many minutes have passed and what's
look like looking like so you can see
what you expect if you want to try
putting one of these on yourself alright
so about 30 minutes have passed and it's
pretty much down all the way corners are
still coming up a little bit i'm still
working with them but as you can see it
doesn't even look like there is a
protector on the iphone just looks a
little bit shiny still a tiny little air
bubble but not bad I'm going to keep
pressing it down but it's almost done
gotta let it sit maybe for an hour just
kind of on its back so you're looking at
a good let's say maybe from start to
finish probably one to two hours they
say possibly three this is pretty much
done clear coat looks good it's solid
and I'm comfortable with it I feel like
it was not going to break and it's going
to protect my phone nicely i'm a big fan
actually of the clear coat alright so
we're going to move on to the invisible
shields which will also run you $25 by
zagg it's probably the most well-known
and it does the same thing as the other
two let's see if it does it as well so
full body protection million sold there
are some quotes on it Wow scratch-proof
completely wraps around the digital
device by the New York Times that that's
like saying critics agree it's
see-through that's a ridiculous quote I
knew him let's go ahead and open it up
and see what we got ter here
alright it's been torn the sleeve
installation diagram take a look at that
in a minute let's see what we got in the
Box I'm guessing it's going to look
relatively similar fat looks almost
identically similar got your fluid got
your install squeegee here are some
application instructions and here is the
invisible shield itself let's take a
look at the instructions wash your hands
spray your fingertip just holding
visible shield in your hand adhesive
side up lightly spray the front and back
of invisible shield apply it using
include squeegee so steps are exactly
the same as the previous so for starters
here let's focus on the back of the
device since the front seems to be
pretty standard so we will go ahead and
follow installation instructions open up
the plastic here now so these invisible
shields are really well protected in the
plastic go and take them out back then
almost appear melted to the plastic they
can take him out without ripping I gotta
leave that it's actually ripping as I'm
pulling it out of the plastic and I was
actually very gentle pulling it out so
even taking the invisible shield out of
plastic it's actually when they put it
in there it was stuck to the plastic
itself let me show you see that it's
actually adhered already to the plastic
and they have melted or something in the
heat but even putting it on the back on
now it's impossible it's actually
physically adhered melted right right to
the plastic interesting so it's a little
bit difficult to even review the
invisible shield I was actually looking
forward to
reviewing this but seeing as they came
broken and stuck to the device I can't
even do a review i came and pretend to
put on the back of this thing so i'm
going to assume that it's good and
assuming that you don't want to keep
yours any sort of heat I don't know how
this was stored before it got to me but
if I had bought in this I would have run
it right back to the store and insisted
on a refund so unfortunately i can't
really great each uninstallation the
best grade i can give on on any of these
is not being broken and the clear winner
guys is clear coat wasn't broken was
relatively easy to install although it
did take some time and it works i can
vouch what i've been using it i would
have liked to try the other two but not
really an option seeing as the back is
the hard part the front is pretty
standard amongst them all so if you have
to pick one of the three and i'll put
links to all three products in the
sidebar guys I gotta recommend clear
coat I've used it and I think it's the
best and also it's going to come teen
one piece not to ripped apart so guys
hope you enjoyed for exclusive content
