go further GT is making waves today at
CES 2013 in Las Vegas Nevada how's it
going guys I'm Aaron Baker at
TechnoBuffalo you can see the show is
going on it's day one and here's the ZTE
grand ass this thing was announced just
a few hours ago and specs wise it's
going toe-to-toe or head-to-head
depending on how you say it against the
HTC droid DNA and the samsung galaxy
note 2 just to give you a quick rundown
aspects it's got a 5-inch 1920 x 1080p
full HD display so as you can tell by
this one and a couple of the devices
we've seen in CES 1080p is the name of
the game right now so mimics the droid
DNA in a lot of ways and we're seeing
that become the buzz word if you go to
buzz feature maybe 2013 you also get two
gigabytes of RAM it's got a Snapdragon
s4 pro 1.7 gigahertz quad-core processor
a 13 megapixel camera on the back with
1080p HD video recording sheet gets you
right there and a really thin light
sleek form factor with a volume rocker
on the right side microSD card slot over
here a sim card slot 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack up top along with your
power button and then physical buttons
down here just below the 4.7 inch
display let's take a look at a pan icon
to use it let's just go through the menu
looks like some customizations thanks to
ZTE pinch in the back
mio SI there we go that works and we can
run it just like that so you can see
some customizations based on ZTE s look
and feel here you can see a little bit
of a difference with the bottom part
here the menu area you can see the
notifications bar very different all
around with a green color scheme control
switches up top favorite applications
and the notifications up here at the top
as well settings clear of course I can
clear it out cuz it is running a later
version and Android let's actually check
and see it should be running 4.1 if i
recall below double check yeah 4.1
point2 and you can really see that they
customize the look and feel in a lot of
ways of android composing here so you
get to the keyboard looks like but
overall relatively fluid thanks to that
quad core 1.7 gigahertz processor but
definitely some customizations has a
love-hate thing unfortunately we're
likely not going to see this on any of
the major carriers Never Say Never right
hey justin bieber reference but never
say never but you know we probably won't
see a verizon spread on ATT where we
will see it perhaps is on if you need
carrier nationwide t-mobile perhaps a
prepaid carrier if they can get the
price point down low enough to make it
worthwhile for prepaid customers it's a
nice device all around it's great to see
ZTE get up to speed but again it's all
about carrier distribution agreement
that's the name of the game in 2013 the
more carriers you can get on the better
we've seen great success from Apple
Samsung in the past because of their
ability to market and get it available
on a bunch of different carriers that's
what we're seeing right here keep it
locked in the cyber continuing coverage
i'm on twitter aaron c baker the
company's on twitter as well
technobuffalo and on facebook at
facebook.com slash technobuffalo more
coverage to come from CES 2013 and lots
of vegas nevada it's a wild show stay
