has gotten a little bit boring they
haven't seen major updates to the design
since about 2012 saved for just spec
bumps but it looks like apples got
gigantic surprises up their sleeves
that's the good news the bad news is
we're probably not gonna see him until
q4 of this year the story originated
from KGI securities and was backed up by
mark Berman from 9 to 5 Mac here's just
the the juiciest bit on top of that
QWERTY keyboard above the number key
where the function keys ordinarily go
you're going to have an OLED strip and
onset OLED strip be able to customize
whatever you want to be therefore using
an editing app for example you have
shortcuts up there it'll be touch
sensitive so you can customize your
keyboard for whatever you want it
through the potential there's our really
awesome now beyond that this should also
feature touch ID from locking a computer
and also buying things Apple loves to
make buying things from their App Store
easier to hopefully that'll work with
third-party apps as well the keyboard is
gonna go with the butterfly switches
from the current gen MacBook so shorter
throw that she'll so lend itself to its
thinner lighter computer on the outside
no surprise we're gonna see USB seaports
and Thunderbolt Thrace for that combo
port of the same size we don't know if
that's gonna be the only porch of one I
have presumably will have more than one
smart mind those are being reports
hopefully at least one legacy USB port
hoping they don't get rid of the SD card
slot but I probably look for that to go
to remember we don't know if the
resolution the screen is gonna be but I
expect a resolution on the retinas blade
to stay the same so if you're holding
out hopes the WWDC is when we're going
to see it as brand new bad boy unveiled
you're gonna be disappointed again
q4 same sizes should come into play a 13
to 15 inch the French sight nowhere else
debuted pictures of it looks to be an
iPhone 7 chassis and it looks like we've
been saying for a while
looks like an iPhone 6 6s the antenna
bands moved a little bit but what is new
is you're gonna have four speakers
evidently other things you could expect
you can say goodbye to 3.5 milimeter
headset jack that is going to be gone
replaced with lightning port that's just
that just gonna do everything one rumor
that looks to be really substantiated
our new camera
sensors dual cameras what it's gonna be
called the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 7 plus
Pro we don't know yet but there will be
dual cameras on the flagship model also
rumors are saying the 4.7 inch iPhone 7
just to get optical image stabilization
that are in reserved for the bigger
model so all kinds of nice updates there
as well it's witty guys take Apple
rumors you excited for the MacBook Pro
for the iPhone 7 I want to hear your
thoughts on it we should see the iPhone
7 and the august/september time frames
too not that long to wait so next time
Jon render from TechnoBuffalo give the
