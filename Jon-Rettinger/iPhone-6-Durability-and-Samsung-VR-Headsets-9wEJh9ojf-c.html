to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of rumor roundup
I am your host John Rogers to show where
we take all the tech rumors from the
week and there was a whole bunch room
this week and I think the three before I
think they're the most interesting most
thought-provoking and sometimes the
craziest and I share them with you in
one video of this week it looks like
Samsung is getting to virtual reality
how durable will the iPhone 6 actually
be and once it does last or not lasts
how long is it gonna give you on a
single charge from around up let's start
just rounding things up go ahead and
start with a virtual reality side of
things so back in May if you remember
correctly we learned Samsung was
developing its own VR headset even
working directly to folks at oculus to
develop the software for it now a report
from Sam mobiles and pre liable in the
past it's reading a bit more light on a
device which it claims will be called
not unexpectedly the gear VR headset did
fall somewhere between through the
oculus rift project Morpheus and Google
cardboard offering a high tech design
that still requires a smartphone to
function for the fully the gear VR will
apparently work with Samsung handsets
and won't law no surprise there and only
Samsung has handsets
they will slide into the front and
connect via USB 3.0 the device should
then work by tracking your head movement
with a built-in accelerometer and
gyroscope to create a VR experience so
kind of similar to Google cardboard like
I mentioned or the touchpad on the side
and the exterior camera that can stream
the real world so I rented reality
experience this is crazy to me you're
streaming the real world through AI just
look at the real world if you're missing
a lot of beautiful things you know you
might not be able to see what
restaurants eight blocks away with
augmented reality but you might miss the
gorgeous flowers to your right
the design also includes an elastic
headband and pad at Kristen's for added
comfort so the rubber bands it's just
elastic the gear VR reportedly launched
this September at IFA which we will be
at what happens in Berlin where Samsung
expected to also unveil the Galaxy Note
this many there's still no word on
pricing but we're guessing this first
generation of your handset won't come
cheap so VR
like it's here I don't know what the
useless thing is to play want Angry
Birds with dirt and maybe I'm gonna look
back this video in a year and be like
well John you totally missed the point
I'm just saying the art using your phone
as a screen doesn't make sense the
oculus and you can play games this
you're still stuck with the end I don't
know maybe I'm wrong if there's
something cool you do the VR leave in
the comments because I would love to be
proven wrong on this one
and what would rumor roundup be without
iPhone this for you it's probably this
this many we've seen quite a few
pictures revealing the iPhone 6 alleged
curb screen and now we're getting a
super in-depth look at just how strong
that screen gonna be fitted with
sapphire crystals our good friend
marques Brownlee at mkbhd shows off what
he says apart straight from Apple's
assembly line and holy crap is this
thing durable like whole style of strong
so sure it looks pretty much the same as
current iPhones just bigger and that's
sort of not enough it's also super
indestructible as a video kind of shows
Apple fans are gonna have a pretty big
reason I think to want to upgrade this
fall the putty speculation surrounding
how Apple is gonna use Sapphira through
ports saying only the big daddy 5.5 inch
model is going to use that strong
material but given this leak and the
previous leaks past and the video that
we've seen it appears Apple will indeed
you sapphire in both its iPhones this
fall and probably in the iWatch too
Apple has previously used sapphire
crystal in the home button and camera
lens on the iPhone 5s but this new
design will bring it to crazy new levels
if indeed the part that marques is
showing on the video is indeed sapphire
or hopeful the iPhone 6 is gonna be
pretty much impervious to wear and tear
and my infant he like to try and eat my
phone and for those clumsier of you
might even be able to withstand drops
which has been the bane of every
smartphone or existence for a very long
time especially the iPhone 4 or 4s with
glass back just shatter I never to test
of how durable the supposed 4.7 inch
iPhone 6 panel is mkbhd puts it through
some serious gruesome tests by just
chilling it with a knife and then the
set of keys he goes at it pretty hard to
it harder than your average phone would
you know see on a daily use just sort of
in your pocket and the panel is
essentially left totally unscathed even
the sharp knife is no match for that
burly sapphire crystal
getting essentially zero damage it's
really really impressive so they go out
screen protectors once and for all I'm
gonna be like your kid brother and

back to the rumors alright so we think
we know your iPhone 6 is gonna be super
durable but how long is that suckers
gonna last you on a charged battery life
is definitely one of the biggest issues
I think plaguing smartphone industry
screens and process have gotten way
faster batteries kind of stayed the same
an apples iPhone lineup is definitely no
exemption exception you might have
thought though that the bigger 4.7 and
5.5 inch model is launching this year
would leave room for a larger battery
but it might be wrong according to the
report out of China the upcoming handset
may not offer much of an improvement
when it comes to battery power this is a
sad face spotted by g4 games earlier in
the week every port claims a 4.7 inch
iPhone 6 will potentially offer an
eighteen hundred million power battery
while the larger 5.5 one which will be
named the iPhone airs a separate rumor
will support a twenty five hundred
million power battery and the salt
increase from the 1570 milliamp hour on
the 5s hopefully it'll mean longer
battery life though it could just be
enough power to support those friggin
larger displays without adding any extra
juice again
those rumors new try out to be true
though the iPhone 6 still won't come
close to Android competition it comes to
battery size Samsung's 5.1 inch Galaxy
s5 sports a twenty eight hundred million
power battery the g3 has got a three
thousand milliamp hour battery then
again Apple's always had a nice knack
for getting most out of its hardware cuz
they do control the software side too so
I wouldn't rule out its or a better
battery life from a iPhone 6 quite yet
I then activated to unveil the iPhone 6
till September the company
rarely reveals any battery size
information at all so kind of to open it
up and just look at it that means it
could be quite a while before anyone
cracked open this new phone and reveals
all of its glorious secrets inside but
I'm hopeful that we'll get better
battery life fingers crossed
is battery life on the iPhone 5s is kind
of average what do you guys think
sapphire iPhone small batteries Samsung
