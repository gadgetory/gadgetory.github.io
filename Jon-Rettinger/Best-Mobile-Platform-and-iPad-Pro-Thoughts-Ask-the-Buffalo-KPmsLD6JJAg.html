technobuffalo here and welcome friends
to another episode of ask the Buffalo
this is my favorite show that I get to
every week where if you like we get a
chance to talk I get into your questions
in the world of tech I'm just back from
the apple event we're gonna talk a lot
about that some personal stuff and some
gigantic tablets go ahead and jump right
in first question comes from Matt hit 27
who asks at John for lakers what are you
most excited about they came from the
apple event OS hardware etc hashtag
asked to Buffalo I'm gonna leave the
ipad pro part of that till the end of
this we took someone to talk about that
on its own I'm not that excited at least
about the aisle and success and the
success plus i think the s upgrades are
always a little bit on the boring side
if you're not getting any new firm
aesthetically new the phone look exactly
the same save for rose gold which for
everybody asking it looks pink it's a
pink foam like it looks pink in person
it's a shiny pink phone I've had a lot
of people asking about it how it looks
and they should consider getting it want
to get a pink foam you'll love rose gold
if you don't want a pink phone I would
not look at rose gold forced touch or 3d
touch works well and it works as
advertised I don't know how often I'd
use it though I'm not sure if it would
go the way like the S Pen in the notes
series of phones you just use it well
for the first couple weeks and you
forget that it's there it's a nice
feature I don't know if it's a reason to
upgrade I think if you have a current
iphone 6 or 6 plus I would hold out for
the iphone 17 if you got a 5s or older
than yes upgrade it's going to be a huge
difference bigger screens they will look
much nicer for you 4k is a nice addition
but not honesty bed 4k for a while and I
get that I might be like Jaden now I'm
testing all these phones but I've been
testing phones with 4k for a year and a
half almost two years so try to get that
excited when it comes to an apple
product so yeah it's there but you know
I probably should have been there for a
while ago I am concerned though how much
storage is going to take up for K you
really got to evaluate what phone and
what size option you get now with the
live pictures options taking up double
the size of a normal picture you have to
reevaluate how you
George Apple TV was neat I mean I don't
know how often I'm going to talk to my
remote I use the universal remote for
everything anyway so i wouldn't take
event in those features for me the best
feature was the universal search but
Roku and fire TV have that also for me
that I do on my streaming through my
xbox one and I'll probably keep doing
next question comes from a mr. and Nick
who asked at Sean for lakers what's your
personal mobile and desktop platform of
choice and why right now in my pocket I
am testing the Moto X so that's what i'm
using generally I've got a phone that
I'm testing and then another phone so
I'm testing a Apple device will have
android device with me i'm usually
carrying two phones one of each before i
started testing this thought i was
carrying in my pocket just by choice the
galaxy s6 edge+ and an iphone 6 i carry
both for a few reasons first their apps
that i only available on android that i
need naps only build my iOS that I need
my family they have iOS devices being
able to add pictures to a shared gallery
for them is really nice from iOS but i
love that the new google photos now can
stick all my pictures no matter what i'm
using so i guess you that as my
dedicated photo viewer but usually i'm
carrying both for right now if i had to
pick a phone i know i went back what i
said i said i would get the note 5 but
i've been using the galaxy s6 edge+ like
i said i really like that the screen is
gorgeous i really like that phone i
think that would probably be the one I
would pick right now but we're on the
precipice of new iPhones coming and your
Nexus device coming and who knows maybe
this guy will and personally as I
continue testing it anyway that's what I
carry as far as desktops at the office I
have a 4k imac that i use and at home
I've got one of the new thin macbook
said i use as well as a surface pro 3 if
i need a tablet i'll pick up the surface
pro if I just sitting at my desk and
i'll use the mac i promise to talk about
the ipad pro add pradesh underscore PS
asks at john for lakers what's the point
of the ipad pro two regular consumers
who needs a big ipad and we have a 9.7
inch want hashtag asta buffalo that's
the question
that I've been asking myself to I don't
know the recluse at a position to
graphic designers with the pencil but I
spoke to a few graphic designer
colleagues and they were really adamant
they prefer to use at least they're
going to use a pencil s product on
something like a Wacom tablet which is
much more advanced as already has
existing support so I'm not sure to the
target demographic is maybe students who
want to use it with the keyboard dock it
just use it as a computer I don't know
it's a big iPad like there's nothing
like you pick it up it's very familiar
it's a big it's a jumping a big iPad I
don't know how you travel with that how
you put water use it on an airplane I'm
I wouldn't imagine apples gonna sell out
of these let's just leave it at that and
our last question I picked this one
because I thought the name was funny at
intense friction desks at John for
lakers with a lakers break 500 hashtag
ass to be man I hope they just went 30
games 30 games would be a success they
get to 500 I will be probably pooping my
pants and doing a happy dance but we'll
see you soon enough season starts in
just about a month and I think you guys
for watching episode of ask the Buffalo
hope you enjoyed I love making these
videos keep the questions coming until
next time jon rettinger i'll see you
guys next one way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
