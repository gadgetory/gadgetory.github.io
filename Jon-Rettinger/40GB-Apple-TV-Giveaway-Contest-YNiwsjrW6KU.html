I've said this in the past but it
certainly merits reiterating again I
feel so lucky to be able to be a
technology of your it's what I love it's
what I'm passionate about in the fact
and I get a share of my thoughts and
opinions with you guys and have these
products review these unique opportunity
one that I do not take for granted even
for a second and I like to thank you
guys for helping support me by doing the
occasional giveaway I don't do them all
that often but when I do I like to have
them count i'm giving away a flip meadow
which i shipped to the UK I've given
away an LG vue cell phone i just
recently gave away a nintendo dsi i'd
like to continue that trend with
giveaways that matter with a brand new
still sealed in the box 40 gig Apple TV
let's go packaging but rest assured is a
brand new Apple TV all wrapped in
plastic I love the apple TV I use it all
the time for downloading movies
downloading TV shows you can download
them both in HD which is kind of cool
you can stream your content from your
computer pc or mac to your television
all you need is just a widescreen TV and
the Apple TV will hook up and work it's
got built in Wi-Fi where you can hook in
with ethernet uses 802 11 n so it's fast
it's awesome i love my apple TV I don't
know why it never really took off that
well for Apple but I love it and I
thought maybe you guys would love it too
so I don't really have a milestone for
this giveaway time and hit 30,000
subscribers or certain amount of views I
just want to give it away to say thank
you you know I that's really it I just
want to say thank you to you guys so i
used some rules for the intendo dsi
giveaway it's been about month ago I
thought that that set of rules really
worked well so I'm going to use the same
for the Apple TV content and if you
entered to win the dsi you'll know what
to do if you're new no problem I'll tell
you what you need to do right now i'll
put a link to all this up in the sidebar
so you can just copy and paste first
thing you need to be subscribed to me on
youtube and twitter nice and easy my
twitter address is twitter.com / john
for lakers and they'll of course feel
link to that in the sidebar next thing
to do is leave a comment to this video
with the @ symbol and your twitter name
so I know who you are whatever sometimes
the names are no it is the same so if I
was leaving a comment and i want to
Hector it would be at sign John for
lakers and then whatever method you want
hey John hope I win the apple TV the
next thing you need to do is just go to
your Twitter account and retweet this
message it just says enter for a chance
to win an apple TV from at John for
lakers simply follow and sub John then
retweet this message and that's it you
can 1 comment on the YouTube channel and
one retweet equals one entry and you
guys can enter as many times as you want
there's no limit on how many times you
want to keep it fun you can do 10 20 30
whatever it is time today that you guys
want mostly because it's next to
impossible to really check how many
times people are doing it to make sure
they're just doing it once so more time
to do with the better I'm going to let
this run for just about 10 days and
let's say it'll run until Thursday july
nine so you have until midnight Thursday
July ninth to submit your entries and
again one comments and one Twitter post
equal one entry and you can enter as
many times as you want and on Friday
July tenth how about a livestream to
announce the winner and you can be on
the stream if you win if you're not
there so ok and you can be anywhere in
the world to enter this you can be in
the UK you can be in Brazil you can be
in Australia anywhere you are I will
ship this to you at my expense this is a
global contest because I have viewers
all over the world so wherever you are
feel free to enter it's not region loft
it'll work wherever you guys might be so
I hope you guys win I hope you enjoy the
contest and again guys honestly just
from the bottom of my heart thank you
for your continued support it really
really just means a lot to me and this
is just another way to say thank you so
