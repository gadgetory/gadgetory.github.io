to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone John Reggie from TechnoBuffalo
here a few weeks ago we ran the review
of the oneplus but I can do it mark and
Brandon did a combo of the video and
they're written side of it obviously the
device for about two and a half oops
thought I'd share my impressions of the
oneplus one their brand didn't work
we're really excited when the device
came in they've heard a lot about it
wanted to use it obviously the review is
pretty gushing if you want to see the
full video reviewing the full written
review as well as pictures and stuff
from the gallery and the camera then we
down below to go and check that out it's
not gonna be a for review just my
general ramblings and impressions on the
oneplus one so the first thing about the
phone
I bought this this isn't a press unit
it's not a demo unit I really wanted to
try it so I picked up the device in
order to pick up the device though you
got to get an invoice and that's sort of
the first problem with the phone the
invite system is ridiculous no problem
telephone limited quantities make it
hard to find but the invite system just
makes it seem silly and elitist and
unnecessary people that want to give the
company their money it should be in wide
release know sometime next month so you
know waiting for it you know you might
be rewarded in just a few weeks time I
like the phones always gone on record
saying I love my giant phones the 5.5
inch screen which is 401 PPI is really
really awesome it is really good indoors
as well but it is borderline useless
outdoors and I keep my brightness up
pretty high usually about 80% I got
almost put up 200% to really see it burn
direct sunlight good luck seeing the
phone also it's got some cool technology
that makes the touch sensitive part of
the screen close to the glass it also
has an oleophobic coating on it which is
supposed to get the oils away this thing
is a fingerprint freakin magnet on the
front but all phones kinda are just one
just seems to be worse but I always
think that what I'm using is the worst
of all so I don't think that's just me
the back of the phone's one we have is a
64 gig it's sandstone black it's not
necessarily the color that I like the
texture the back of this phone feels
really awesome to hold it's got the
right amount of grip right amount of
slide it just probably one of the best
feeling backs to devices that I've ever
used
I always loved metal phones but I don't
miss a metal phone at all with this guy
I should say though well the front is
fingerprint II the back though not so
much the best thing I think about this
phone you get sort of super phone specs
for a $349 price for 64 gigabyte model
which is ridiculously cheap you could
probably use this phone for a year and
then sell it in you know Salib a year
later and probably sell it for 200 bucks
so you use the phone for you of cost
$150 it is really impressive but
probably the most impressive thing about
the phone for me is the battery it's got
a pretty big 130 100 million powers but
this thing lasts for ever I test a lot
of phones so I've got a pretty sort of
wide sample of battery life I can say I
think it's a good degree of confidence
we just lost my memory shot that this is
the best battery I have ever used on a
phone I always charge my phone every
single night I use my phones pretty hard
I use this for two days without charging
time I plugged in on the second day so I
had about 15 percent battery life left
which is awesome I'm pretty heavy on my
phones
couple hours of phone calls emails being
pulled down every five minutes
social media pictures video a lot of
Instagram way more than I probably
should and this battery life is
ridiculous so if you're a heavy user you
travel a lot I ain't have that much time
to plug your phone in or you always
forget really good phone to consider it
stopped my oneplus talk for a quick sec
to thank the good peeps at the Dollar
Shave Club
if your dude then you grow dude facial
hair probably if you don't my apologies
and it sucks to shave if you can tell
it's not my favorite thing in the world
I don't have that much free time I hate
going to the store shout out 20 bucks
for some stupid shave tech that I don't
use it all but fortunately there's a
company that's making it we we easier
it's called Dollar Shave Club obviously
they make it super simple which is good
for me for a few bucks a month the folks
Dollar Shave Club shipped pretty awesome
quality razors and other bathroom things
right to your house so you can get it
while you're still in your pajamas which
is super have you the razors are just as
good as a big shave companies are just a
fraction of the price I've got all kinds
of other stuff too like dr. Carver's
easy shave butter to make your shave
even more buttery smooth if you want to
shave that cool a chinstrap goatee you
can
that use it and make it look or girl
like a badass neckbeard and shade
everything else you should shave time
shave money join now at
dollarshaveclub.com slash TechnoBuffalo
do it you won't regret it
so before I use this one I was using the
Nexus 5 and I loved the Nexus 5 but my
Knock that device was the camera
this guy's got a 13 megapixel sensor
which doesn't really matter all that
much size and megapixels aren't that big
a deal but the camera color is actually
really good I've really enjoyed using it
at pictures look great
Evan blown anything up yeah it when I
look at it on Facebook or ever I'm doing
social media they always look really
nice
I love the OS here with CyanogenMod 11
sort of like tweets small changes made
just for the oneplus one it is
absolutely incredible usually when I
review devices I'm measuring it the way
they come from the stores haven't played
a CyanogenMod all that much but I have
absolutely loved the customization
options I love the themes make your
phone feel totally different for one day
to the next one day make it look like a
galaxy s5 next day LG g3 the next day
you can look like Android L it is
awesome a little tweaks they've done a
really cool things like the motion
gestures on the screen a little circle
turn on the phone or a V to do the
camera it just makes the phone seems so
nice sort of the little things I think
make the experience really good on
cyanogen I've always loved stock Android
through my favorite version of Android I
gotta say it's a antigen now is my
favorite version of Android phones been
plenty plenty fast got three freaking
gigs are a minute that's clocked at 2.5
gigahertz got a Snapdragon 801 seems an
absolute beast and for the price it is
insane which I guess probably goes to
show you the ridiculous markups on these
phones and you buy them unsubsidized
they're making a lot of money on these
phones
I do wish the speaker was a little bit
louder speak your phone is really not
that good on it but oddly when the
speakerphone volume is turned up not
very good listening to music though via
the speaker's the volume turned all the
way up
sounds pretty decent so I don't know go
figure I wish that was a little bit on
the lighter side
I've had some Bluetooth disconnecting
issues here it's a nice jobs for my car
but it's not all that common overall I
really like advice of the design how
screen looks like it's floating around
sort of that kind of fake metal band I
was gonna review this device I probably
would have stuck with that
eight-point-five review that Mark and
Wren gave it or maybe even a nine that's
pretty close to a perfect phone the
price makes it absolutely awesome but
