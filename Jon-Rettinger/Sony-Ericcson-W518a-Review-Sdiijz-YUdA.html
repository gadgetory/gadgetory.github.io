from TechnoBuffalo here with a review
for you of the sony ericsson w580i
feature phone for 18 t wireless this
suckers gonna run you $49.99 after a $50
mail-in rebate and a two-year contract
as they might begin the unboxing I don't
generally do that many feature phone
reviews this one actually I got by
popular request let's go ahead and get
started before we get to the features
it's a phone and it's got to make good
phone calls it actually does that quite
well picked advantage of 18 T's 3G HSDPA
Network and takes advantage of it
actually quite well phone calls were
clear people on the other end of the
call of heard no white noise and it
sounded nice and crystal clear on my end
so kudos to Sony Ericsson for putting a
nice radio in the phone let's go ahead
and talk about some of the features of
this thing it's got a pretty slim design
as you guys can see and it's got three
buttons on the front and an external
display let me show you what the next
year on this plate does if you go ahead
and open up the phone so you close it
you get the time your signal strength if
you have any new messages battery and
even what network you're on the H
signals HSDPA these three buttons here
obviously take advantage of the Walkman
features into the sony ericsson phone if
i go ahead and hold down play for
example they are touch sensitive buttons
by the way as well it'll start to play a
song and actually got a really loud
speaker as well move in stop that before
i get into any sort of music violation
but it does function as advertised you
can scroll from next song to left and
right hey I could do that quite easily
and this thing will play mp3 WMA AAC
aac+ and e AAC as long as they're not
copy written or they don't have any sort
of encryption on them like if you
download a song from itunes for example
and you get it with the DRM it's not
gonna play but if it's just a sand
np3 love no problem playing them so this
one of the nice things about this - it's
got a 3.2 megapixel camera which
actually does a quite nice job take some
really stellar pictures it's not your
standard kind of features you'd expect
it's got HSDPA like I mentioned it has
assisted GPS meaning it'll use the cell
network and its internal GPS antenna to
get you a good location so you can take
advantage of navigation software on the
phone it really does a lot of thing that
does a lot of things quite well so I'm
picking Singh in that as you guys know
and this does have a web browser
although it's a little bit gimped
because it is just a feature phone and I
say just a feature phone if you're
looking forward just as same to
telephone that you can send a few texts
you can answer calls and you can make
calls you know this is a pretty decent
option let me show you what this web
browser looks like go ahead and hit this
button right here and those ins got
Facebook I'll talk about that in just a
moment
and we'll go to Medianet and it connects
using the mobile network and you get
that sort of option this is claimed to
be an HTML capable browser my experience
it wasn't quite so HTML capable but it
definitely did work so you can scroll
kind of using your finger and get a sort
of mouse like cursor it's a very
rudimentary browser but it's also very
functional if you want to check some
scores of the game you want to check
some stocks you want to do some simple
web cast this is actually gonna work out
quite well for you so one of the big
things about this is actually 18t is
launching a Facebook app on their phone
you can actually launch again using that
same quick launch button right below the
send key and you saw it right there
under running apps actually will run jar
applications so we'll go ahead and open
up Facebook and you'll see you get a
simple login screen you get a relatively
nice Facebook application I'm gonna show
you guys here cuz they're gonna have to
go through my whole profile with you for
taking my word for it the Facebook
application does work quite well the
buttons on the phone are a little bit
different they kind of got these circles
which I thought I wasn't gonna lie
but you actually get used to the circles
around them actually make sure you're
not pressing the wrong one there's a
pretty decent amount of space between
them I found the keys were actually
relatively easy to type in texting was
fine it was your standard texting
experience using t9 or multi-tap on a
really a set 9 key keyboard but it
worked and it does kind of wait expected
to do so if I have to rank this phone on
a 1 to 5 I'd give it a really solid 4 it
works well it works as advertised I
would have had a few more smart phone
esque features like a better calendaring
system and possibly some more alerting
options but it does work very well and
if you're looking for just a feature
phone that will make phone calls this is
quite a decent way to go so the last
thing I want to mention guys is
something called AT&amp;amp;T share and I want
to give you full disclosure this is
something that AT&amp;amp;T when they send me to
this device to review they actually
asked me to mention so to be nice I'm
going to mention it to you guys as well
and actually this kind of quite neat
it's AT&amp;amp;T shares Facebook application
essentially what that does is it lets
you kind of use AT&amp;amp;T Facebook
application I just showed you and it
kind of lets you earn points we can be
happy to become a fan of AT&amp;amp;T freedom of
choice on Facebook if you haven't
already I'll put a link to it in the
sidebar essentially you kind of create
document you share your unique 18
t-mobile phone experience for others and
you can make points and you earn these
points and you can use them for tickets
to concerts and all kinds of other stuff
it actually is a pretty neat program
wanted to let you guys know about it
again full disclosure or something that
AT&amp;amp;T asked me to mention so guys that
was it just a relatively short review
