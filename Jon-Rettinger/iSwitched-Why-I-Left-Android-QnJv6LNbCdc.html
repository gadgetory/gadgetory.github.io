TechnoBuffalo and I did it I finally
switched back to my iphone now I was
using a note 5 before this if you guys
have been following and before that I
was on my iPhone before that I started
off my whole smartphone life on a
Samsung Captivate way back in the day
obviously there's been more phones in
between that but today I wanted to share
with you guys a couple reasons why I've
been switching back and forth why most
recently I've switched back to my iPhone
what I like what I don't like I'm gonna
miss about Android and all that good
stuff let's go ahead and get started
so first thing I want you guys to take
with a grain of salt is everything I say
is based purely on my usage so I use my
phone for calling texting emailing some
social media apps here and there
Washington YouTube videos and that's
kind of it nothing more than that so
first we have iMessage I really missed
having this because I was using the text
messaging app within the note 5 now I
know there's a ton of workarounds on
Android but I message is just so simple
and it works really well for me because
I use a Mac desktop I use a MacBook Pro
and an iMac we use the windows editing
rig but I don't use that for personal
stuff so I like having iMessage I like
having that continuity so that's nice to
have that back next we have early apps
an example of this is something like
peach we saw this on Instagram a couple
years ago iOS tend to get apps before
Android does and over my span of two to
three months of using my note 5 I really
did miss out on trying some new apps
that I wanted to give a shot so I'm not
a huge deal but it's very nice to have
that back and get sort of first dibs on
everything that comes out and finally we
have mail I really like Apple's mail
client I understand Gmail is great it
does some weird stuff where it will
reverse the threat of a conversation so
to put the most recent email at the
bottom so to scroll down to that it also
really struggles to delete draft so I
don't understand why it does that
either I know there's a lot of great
email clients out there for Android I
like having apples first party mail
client it's very very good with that
being said I am going to miss her in
things on Android though number one
being widgets and the app drawer it
helps me really organize my phone so on
the note 5 I was down to about two pages
the Evernote widget really being sort of
on my home screens allowed me to look at
my to-do list and that kind of stuff I
love having that functionality not
having to open up apps on iOS I'm on
like six pages so being able to put my
non-primary apps in the app drawer is a
great luxury and I'm going to be missing
that next we have device versatility now
I was using a note 5 and so for things
like snapchat having the stylus was
awesome they got to scribble draw write
all over my pictures it's great and then
let's say you're a mobile photographer
only you can go buy a phone that has the
greatest camera if you don't care about
any other features having that
fertility to get a phone that is
tailored for you is a great luxury that
I'm going to miss on iOS because you're
obviously forced to just get an iPhone
last but not least we have Google now
I'm aware that it's on iOS but it's not
quite as well integrated as it is on
Android so I was using my note 5 these
last two weeks when I was traveling I
flew to Minneapolis and then the
following day flew to Miami in both
cases without me having to enter any
information Google now knew where I was
flying and gave me traffic updates it
gave me weather updates of where I was
going so I could pack accordingly again
all without me entering any information
a little bit creepy but very very useful
and so that's pretty much it there
wasn't really one feature that put me
over the edge and switched me from iOS
to Android or Android to iOS it's just
the small feature small things like
iMessage and widgets that switch me back
and forth so I don't know how long I'll
be on iOS 4 but I'm enjoying it as of
now let me know if you guys think in the
comments down below what is the feature
that could switch you from iOS to
Android or vice versa depending on what
you're using very curious to hear gives
a thumbs up if you liked the video hit
subscribe I'll see you as the next one
thanks so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
