TechnoBuffalo here at the ATM t holiday
buying guide event with a first look at
the HTC status which was the HTC chacha
in the unlocked world folks 18d when I
stands looked me up with a review unit
I'm going to do a one-handed unboxing on
my lap you got to deal with my legs and
hopefully we won't get to adult content
only if I don't move this camera down so
let me go ahead and run through the
specs very quickly I should be here on
the box hopefully so social networking
got that Facebook button touchscreen
qwerty Android it is android 2.3
gingerbread so awesomeness there but of
course they don't have the specs on the
ball so I'm going to see how good mom
memory is two point six inch that's
measured diagonally that the resolution
of 480 x 320 1215 milliamp hour battery
not too bad and of course that full
qwerty keyboard again Ellis information
quick start guide and all that what
heavy stuff that's being powered by an
800 megahertz processor on the back
you've got a 5 megapixel camera with LED
flash also appears there's a
front-facing camera on here as well so
you can get your video chat on that is a
point three megapixel resolution so that
is vga really nice a build quality here
it's actually look if you remember the
reference phone when Android is first
announced what it looked like this is
what it looks like it sort of full-time
a portrait orientation i'll go ahead and
power this on this is running HTC Sense
the customized version of HTC Sense I
believe of the 2.3 variety but it has
some HTC Sense three-point open in there
there's going to be a charge in the
battery or not does it look like there
is but you are going to get the ability
to take that ring and drag it to all the
icons maybe there's a battery in the box
you're so let's do it also were going to
get we are going to get
got a charger oh that's why it's not
working here's a battery and we've got
the micro USB charging port all that
exciting business so I'm gonna go ahead
and try and shuffle this sucker out of
the bag I'm not even going to try and
open this phone up with one hand because
that's going to be a disaster so imma
grand open it up will power it on was
your quick tour of the device alright so
we get to get the device powered on the
back part here the bottom just slides
right off and three pawns in the battery
it's going to come with a two gig micro
SD card in there as well so you got
plastic on the top and plugs are going
to talk wipe it on the bottom I do know
my up and down and they've got the nice
sort of metal in the middle HTC branding
bouncer that bit of a slopes and hold it
up to your head it's closer to your face
if you have a dedicated facebook button
so you can update your status a full
plane IC spaceport a keyboard any d-pad
you can see that little touch of HTC
Sense three pointer which is doesn't
have but it's got some of the goodness
of it now that you can use to unlock the
device not your android buttons across
the top scores the ones we all know and
love and then two other soft keys I'm
actually looking forward to gina's
almost as a business advice certainly
it's got the facebook functionality but
a full qwerty keyboard with a full-time
dedicated portrait functionality it's
very reminiscent of BlackBerry's this
might find a unintended audience let's
go ahead and wipe this thing up boom HTC
and now it is booting to go through all
the standard boot up stuff there's a sim
card in there 3.5 millimeter headset
jack our lock button in the upper right
hand corner I've got a volume rocker
living on here somewhere I assume there
it is on the left hand but didn't go
ahead and do up and down and this is a
first look at the HTC status to be
actually pretty decent phone but we're
running to the bases and be the official
judge of its niceness where that it has
a nice a tube or without it preserves a
spot in your messaging loving pockets I
am jon rettinger this is my lap and i'll
see you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
