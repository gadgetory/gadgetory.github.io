and I'm going for a ride in the Tesla
Model S electric sedan
at the launch event for their new Model
X crossover Tesla was also giving rides
in the Model S sedan which is set to
start reaching customers during the
middle of this year
this is the signature version of the
Model S that slated to ship to the first
customers in the middle of this year the
car features an all electric powertrain
a massive 17 inch touchscreen in the
center console to control over the
infotainment system and access to
Internet services and all the trimmings
including wood - accents and leather
seating the band that the driver was
referring to was Foster the people who
are playing inside at the party to
coincide with the Tesla Model X launch
event which is why we were all down here
in Southern California in the first
place
we got a very short ride around the
makeshift test scores that Tesla had set
out there's a straightaway there's a
slalom and there are a couple of tight
turns and we even got the bonus of
getting to go in Reverse
the sedan is a five seater with an
optional 2c rear-facing jump seat that
can go in the fast back trunk kind of
like the old Volvo station wagons where
the kids are riding in the back facing
the car behind them
you
I'm not gonna lie I wanted a model s
before I got a ride in one and now after
having ridden in it I wanted all the
more too bad I can't afford it but hey
at least I got to see foster the people
up close and for free much much more on
the Model S and the brand new Tesla
Model X over on TechnoBuffalo calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
