you of the second generation ipod
shuffle
sure you've all probably seen it in
stores this is the one that has the
built-in clip as opposed to just a
nine-yard that hangs so give you a walk
through a little bit of the device
before I tell you about it you look it
just got a very simple um
simple front with a play/pause button
right there on the top you've got a
volume up and volume down and then track
forward and track back on the back good
device you've got two little toggles the
first one here first one here it turns
the power on and off and this one turned
shuffle on and off otherwise we'll just
play the song in order that you put them
into an iTunes front we've got a 3.5
millimeter headset jack so I'll work
with any headsets and on the back it
just says iPod and it's got a really
great clip that you can just clip on to
anything right now they're only one
gigabyte so whatever amount of songs
that is a couple hundred I guess I've
had this one for a couple months and I
love it it's great for going on the gym
you can clip it just kind of right onto
your sleeve you know and go for a run or
goal it's whatever you want to do it's
real handy weighs nothing I mean things
game tell it's there so if you're a
runner you like to workout or just want
something small to carry with you the
iPod shuffle is great it does not have a
screen though so I really don't know
what songs are coming next in iTunes you
can set the order for them or you can
just set it to autofill for music from
your iTunes library
pick random songs or instead of
playlists just for the shuffle and just
import those songs for overall I really
like the shuffle I think it's a great
addition to the iPod family on the lower
end of the scale looking for something
just to play a couple songs and throw in
your pocket small and weighs nothing the
iPod shuffles for you alright guys
that's it nice and quick any questions
let me know thanks for watching thanks
for subscribing and have a good day or
afternoon wherever you
all right talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
