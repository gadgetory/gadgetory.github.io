from TechnoBuffalo here Android wear
devices and other wearables are coming
out at a crazy clip but this guy caught
my attention more than any other Mobile
World Congress a few months ago this is
the Huawei watch I used it for eight
days five days with the galaxy s6 edge+
and the Moto X pure edition in three
days with iOS so I want to share my
thoughts and opinions and most
importantly answer the question would I
buy it I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo this is my review of the
Huawei watch so right off the bat this
is a gorgeous looking wearable and I'm
probably to say that a lot throughout
the review so creating game if you want
but it's a best-looking Android wear
watch I've ever used when reviewing an
Android wear watch it's kind of simple
because the software is all the same on
here save for a few watch faces so we're
gonna focus on some different things
we're gonna look at design performance
battery and other kind of features so at
a starting price at 349 this is not a
cheap wearable but it is a bonafide
computer on your wrist
the screen is 400 by 400 it's a complete
360-degree circle no no flat tire on the
bottom 360
it's a beautiful AMOLED display it looks
really nice it's the best looking screen
I've ever seen on a wearable 1.2
gigahertz Snapdragon 400 chip 512
megabytes of RAM 4gb of onboard storage
this is essentially a phone on your
wrist really quick I never noticed any
sort of lag never notice any service
stutter I never felt at all any lack of
performance here very nicely spec watch
it's kind of weird thing to say about a
watch so I mentioned I'm gonna say is a
lot but the design it's it's gorgeous
it is easily the best-looking Android
wear watch I've ever used and I loved
this play just goes all the way around I
will say though it does look a bit weird
on smaller wrists it is very thick so if
you've got thinner wrists I would try it
in a store before you buy it
the button noir crown if you want to
call it at the 2 o'clock position feels
really nice and I know it's weird to
kind of gush about a button but it feels
nice got the right amount of click dude
to let you know you're actually doing
something and it looks like an actual
crown on a typical watch so hats off to
wall way this is their first watch that
they've built they've had other
wearables but this feels like a fifth
sixth or seventh effort design gears is
really incredible I talk about the
screen a little bit earlier but it looks
incredibly sharp here at 400 by 400 it's
one of the highest resolution screens
out there and you can really tell things
just looked crisp and clear the watch
faces look great
also it's coated in sapphire crystal so
if you accidentally hit up against a
door or desk or something you are more
than likely not going to scratch it so
very durable here but not everything is
perfect in Huawei watch land there are
some weird things here as well so it has
does it expect an optical heart rate
sensor it's obviously on the back but
it's not gonna continuously check your
heart rate on other devices like you
might see on like a Fitbit charge for
example or the Apple watch it's it's on
demand so you have to actually do it if
you want to check your heart rate
go through and do it manually the
settings menu might be big deal for some
might not be a big deal for others but I
thought that I'd mentioned if you like
to always know what your heart rate is
sort of at a glance you're gonna have to
keep going through settings and open up
the app and then check it scan all the
sensors you'd expect for modern wearable
hear things like gyroscope accelerometer
and the barometer as well now
fortunately though there's no GPS like
you might find on other watches like the
Sony SmartWatch 3 and moto 360 sports
also if you're planning picking one up
for a workout watch I probably wouldn't
recommend it will though track basic
activities like steps distance and
calories burn so that's important to you
and will at least do that I would have
liked it seeing NFC here as well for
mobile payments but it's not here also
not a mission is no ambient sensor so
you can't won't automatically detect the
light and change itself you got to sort
of go through and set it so strange
omission on otherwise really nice watch
so I mentioned at the beginning that I
used it for three days with iOS I should
have been more specific instead I tried
to use it for three days the last time I
tried it with was the iPhone 6s plus and
it would hold attention to that either
battery life was about we'd expect us
able to get through a day and a half
without charging it for me though if I
get through a full day that's all I need
I can charge it at night but for the
kind of person that like to charge your
watch every
with three days look elsewhere but you
can deal with plugging every night
you're going to be fine so the question
I try to answer in all my reviews was
would I buy it yeah I would absolutely
buy this watch it looks incredible it
almost looks like a normal watch and the
the hallway faces that come with it are
gorgeous if you're a fan of classic
watch complications those are gonna be
in there you can customize image to look
very nice so yeah I would buy it the
only thing that would maybe give me some
pause as a price starting at 349 it's
not cheap and it goes up to 400 plus
dollars depending on the band that you
want like this blingy metal band that we
have here so if your price conscious
there are other options out there you're
gonna get a similar experience for less
money
the current generation Moto 360 the
first one that comes to mind but I do
love the screen I love it it's a full
360 it's a beautiful watch to look at
it's bright clear text looks awesome and
I've really enjoyed wearing it so if
you're not put off by the price jump in
who always got a big winner on their
hands here just just I'm trying using
with iOS anyway what do you guys think
up to your thoughts on it leave the
comments down below until next time I'm
John render from TechnoBuffalo hey guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
