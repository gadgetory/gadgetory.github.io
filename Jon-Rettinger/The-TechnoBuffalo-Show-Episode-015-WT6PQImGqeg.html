techno Buffalo show I'm live your three
house for today Sean ani I'm the
editor-in-chief of techno Buffalo i'm
joined bags i could editor mobile Todd
Hazleton everybody and executive editor
of gaming joy Davidson what's up guys I
we are missing one host today yes weird
the Shah beard has departed for the
surface Sean beard experience that
actually was the name of my doors cover
band in the apologies to everyone I was
not thinking when I scheduled this
episode that I realized as I look over
them listen USA in Germany are just
about to play so apologies everyone but
we had to have the show at some point I
mean you can do both that's what I'm
doing hey and yesterday we had google
i/o so that precluded us from being able
to do this you know and that is going to
be the majority of the show and I think
we should start off with the biggest
story of the day that Google builds
killer robots and they're hiding in the
curtain be on you yes I I actually Joey
I was gonna make a sign i did have time
it's a google killer robots and put it
on the sheet i just spoke to jon
rettinger a little bit ago on the phone
and he said the the first protester he
really could not hear what they were
saying the second protester though just
went on and on about google builds
killer robots you know where's their
morality didn't Google like a choir
Boston Dynamics forever he did you know
yeah so like I guess tin foil hat
wearers have an inkling of evidence that
maybe like maybe they are building
killer robots they're probably building
robots that can walk on run really well
yeah here's the thing that gets me a
little Google unless you repress it cost
nine hundred dollars to get into I oh
yeah these people spent nine
dollars come in and shout well but
didn't they run in from the back or
something that I'm not sure I don't know
either but that's what it seemed like
John said after the second protester
there were security guards in every
aisle oh yeah iPad ridiculous though I
don't know but beyond the protesters it
wasn't interesting google i/o I think we
can just go around the table here and
you know Todd let's start with you what
was the one one thing that really stood
out to you is the the big announcement
well anyways will tick tick this off
from Sasha Mahal cuz he asked what's the
what's the thing that wowed you most and
least yes all right thank you i will do
that there we go we go uh temple to me
it was more of like the whole take away
the theme of the event which is sort of
very much android everywhere because you
know they talked about android wear
android auto in the car android TV
Google Google fit the health platform so
it's like Android literally everywhere
and I think that was the biggest
takeaway from me because we haven't seen
it in other places like that before in
the past where you know Google tried
with the Nexus Q to have this like home
always laugh at that product this
central home hub then you have the
chromecast which you know they don't run
Android but now this is like
android-powered stuff so that's what my
big takeaway was I love the fact that we
still have the nexus q in the irvine
office upon a shelf like you hey
but forgotten Google product bowling
ball that thing weighs so much yeah and
you know also go on I was just gonna say
real quick tada I have to I have to echo
your sentiment here like Android
everywhere is kind of a was a big theme
yesterday and it was something that was
I almost thought was kind of cool just
because I am I am kind of ready for a
unified platform across everything and I
was joking with Sean like yeah during
the show but like Android kitchen like I
could totally see that in reality you
know like five years from now well we
just we got a press release yesterday
from whirlpool about
they were releasing a new washer and
dryer that will talk with a nest
thermostat and the thermostat will tell
it okay they're out of the house you've
run your cycle maybe you should run
another quick cycle to freshen up the
clothes oh weird well yeah and I also
will it will tell the washer and dryer
okay we're going into a high energy
usage our don't run right now right yeah
that's cool and so that's what well
that's as I was saying that that's kind
of what you were saying joy I think
that's where we're going I think we're
we are going to get for right now
there's going to be a couple competing
platforms but at some point we are going
to get one platform where everything is
connected I mean and just to piggyback
off of that even further it's like I
mean maybe i'm weird i don't know if you
guys do this but like I cook a lot and
my kitchen my thermostat which was like
just because our building is really
narrow like it's tall it's three stories
but it's really narrow um so the only
place for the thermostat was like in the
kitchen which is just the which is the
worst you should never in the kitchen
because that's that's the room that
fluctuates the most with temperature
right like we might cook something in
the kitchen like the thermostats going
up but it'd be really awesome if I had a
multi-platform device that told me
basically like hey right now if you use
it's getting really cold outside now
would be a good time to bake bread or
it's really extremely hot and we're
taking a lot of energy to cool the house
down don't bake right now you know what
I mean like that would be awesome very
cool well I I think that's a great idea
and you know I when you mentioned
Android kitchen Joe a me yeah I kinda
cold at first but the thing about that
be damn awesome mmhmm yeah well you
think about apples home kit which is
sort of the platform to connect all
these devices also so I mean whether or
not they'll call it a kitchen or not you
know is one thing but I really do think
that yeah I mean this is all about the
connected devices and in every room even
though it sort of starts with the living
room it seems like these days my
hesitation on this is just the this this
year this year fact that none of us are
made of money
it means that this this connected
lifestyle like having Android auto
having the nest home stuff having your
phone having Android we're having Google
class everything mm-hmm it's such a tall
order to have that infiltrate the market
all at once like you're basically asking
your customers to go buy new watches and
new cars and crazy weird ass glasses all
this year and then you do it this year
or else it doesn't work yeah right now
did anyone plan interesting that we
there was no mention of google glass
yesterday yeah I did that's crazy I
think another site that Paul did the big
elephant in the room but it really was I
mean in previous they've had previous
ayahs they've had people skydive in
wearing class like it's a huge thing and
then not even a peep yesterday like
Irish baby unless unless classic can
have its own event soon the biggest
thing about glass yesterday was how many
people in the audience were wearing the
wearing it yeah the only people going to
iOS fans are probably explorers oh yeah
yeah definitely I would say for me the
biggest thing I definitely Android wear
demonstration if it works as well as
those demonstrations Wow I think that
will it looked awesome and now i know we
also have a question in here somewhere
and i will find it but of the three
Android wear devices that were shown
yesterday here it is from Nolan Oh Nolan
I'm sorry there's no way I'm going to
say that last name correctly inc so what
is your favorite Android wear device
which of the three impressed you the
most Joey we'll start with you this time
I mean it's a moto 360 and it has
nothing to do with the actual attack of
the device it's just the design I mean
we've talked about it before Shana I
know that I've set it on this this show
before that the big hurdle for me when
it comes to a SmartWatch and wearable
tech is aesthetic attractiveness I think
that the Moto 360 needs a better band I
think the one that that they have on
that demo unit that John shot a video of
or Jonathan the almighty Jonathan shot
shado and I thought like I I didn't find
that attractive but the shape of the
device the round display the fact that
it looks like a watch that's what I want
I don't there's a reason why people with
google glass looks so silly and it's
because it does not look like glasses I
do not want something on my wrist that
does not look like a watch I want it to
look like a watch it needs to be a watch
and moto 360 is is and just because I'm
a big fan of the circular faces on
watches anyway that's just the one that
speaks to me the loudest yeah i agree
with you that's the one I want the most
I want it with the I ordered the G watch
yesterday and really the only reason uh
and because I don't think either the G
watch or the samsung look particularly
good at all the only reason I went with
the G watch is because it had a slightly
bigger battery and I know that the one
reason the one thing i hate about
wearables is poor battery life and i'm
not expecting much out of this i know
some people were saying like 36 hours if
it's always on and more if you have the
screen going on and off which it just
looks weird so I don't know what it the
two things that I was Ben shun him I
mean I want you to pick your favorite
but maybe we can segue into this yep
every life at cost now we know that the
LG G del gggggg 200 right that's 199 to
do it for the LG G watch yeah with a
more cheaper based on what Google's
already done with like the Moto X and
everything we don't know I think it's
gonna be the most premium product
actually really i mean yeah and there's
like all the talk of wireless charging
and all kinds of fun stuff with that one
but Google's I mean it so they've almost
gone amazon recently with with their
products the chromecast the Moto X like
ignoring Nexus line but just the Moto X
the chromecast they've just kind of said
like let's lower the barrier of entry no
I mean I hope so they haven't announced
the price but to me it just looks like
the most premium just like you're saying
to you with aesthetics so I'm guessing
it's more but I don't know it makes me
sad I am NOT spending three hundred
dollars for
smartwatch i'm sorry i was ivory
hungered but who knows i would save the
3a the 360 it's gorgeous it's absolutely
gorgeous I did end up ordering a G watch
yesterday like Todd I went with it due
to the battery it was thirty dollars
more than the gear live but the battery
was a big selling point to me now the
gear live said on its page its
information page it said one day battery
life the G watch should not say how long
it would last but concerning it's got a
bigger battery in a smaller screen i
would say probably 36 hours like you
said ton yeah that's what the like a
product manager was telling people i
guess which I mean I don't know that's
that's still really bad actually like
charging a watch every day is the most
annoying thing in the world and I also
didn't go with Samsung gear life because
that heart rate monitor like if if
anybody's buying it for that you're
crazy because it doesn't work well on
the other while I mean it kind of works
but like it's not good and they can't
use it when you're running or anything
so there's no point I don't I don't
really if I can be completely honest
with you I think that heart rate
monitors are some of the more ridiculous
pieces of tech that I just don't see its
crate like heart rate monitor monitors
manometers nama nama nama trees and Papa
Papa animates q uq harry potters and
pedometers a debt pedo pedo pedo meters
yeah i had to get away you pedo meters
off the charts is that a measurement of
him don't stop yeah love it stop it oh
boy your pedometer iso be better pieces
of tech i mean like if you're gonna go
for a run go for a run like you don't
need a heart rate monitor to know that
you worked out for 30 minutes like if i
go run a 5k and i do it in 29 minutes I
know that I've worked out oh you're
still heart rate like that was
my heart rate have to do with it it's
true keep all laughing about pedo meters
yeah now here's the thing though I mean
yesterday what we saw of Android wear if
those screens are as good as they showed
amazing absolutely amazing and I have to
wonder how pebbles still going to fit
into everything I mean I I wear a pebble
I love my pebble vice I but the price
isn't that big of different special it's
definitely live and the pebble steel is
pretty close to the G watch hmm yeah
thing that pebble has going for it is
battery life super huge ecosystem of
apps already and I know that androids
gonna have tons coming to UM and then
you know a pretty solid fan base I think
and so people that already have pebble
might be like yeah you know it works for
me and I don't really want anything else
I don't know how they're gonna compete
in the future I mean I think color is
going to be huge and features but who
knows maybe I mean why we can't rule out
that maybe pebble would become a partner
one day right like seems like they
should have a great game now we have a
question from a John Q I am I'd only
pick up a smart watch if it has really
really good fitness integration EG
Fitbit level good are there any out
there right now not yet but google did
announce google fit yesterday and we
think we may have already seen the first
leaked images of the first Google fit
watch but in google announced that
they're opening up the sdk for android
wear for everyone to so it's it's going
to be limited by whatever third-party
developers put out there if google makes
a first-party like run tracking like
like RunKeeper runtastic although
runtastic scott an awful um if they make
something like that like a first-party
one for a watch it'll be game over i'll
be so jammed up they do that if they do
like if they do a run like an exercise
tracker and uh like a calorie counting
fitness app i'll be super psyched but
who knows I mean what it would but
between Apple and Google like what are
the benefits to their fitness center
things anyway like what is it health kit
or whatever yeah well health kid go
ahead and take it Todd well sorry i
think i misunderstood the question so i
was also reading an email RunKeeper
it's coming to android where grace chang
told me about that yesterday Joe hey
it's grace yeah so that'll be cool um
what was the question though is it Apple
what what what are my perks for for uh
Google and apples like proprietary first
party health apps their health systems
um well we haven't all we've seen with
apples is health kit and health uh
what's it it's not a health book what
they end up calling an effort yet in iOS
8 no i mean so but that's not really
like active yet it's not doing anything
so we're kind of waiting to see what's
going to be used to populate it but we
already like there already are
third-party health products that work
with iOS so though that'll be tapped in
there too then with google i don't know
yet that's we're going to see with
Google fit really it's like that it's
the starting days of this all right now
like we don't really know which one's
going to come out on top or how good
they're going to be I mean if if who can
leverage their third party support and
and make a really good fitness center
and incorporate all of that into Android
wear it could be really really good for
fitness stuff I didn't heart rate
monitor and pedometer I just don't need
that stuff but just a nice tracker maybe
maybe I can keep my phone in my pocket
or whatever or in an arm band unplugged
and then be awesome yeah well phones
already haven't built in now I think it
was part of the Snapdragon 800 processor
or at least some of the newer
snapdragons where they do track steps
and stuff like that's like the HTC One
m8 a galaxy s5 and a lot of the newer
handsets sort of act as pedometers
themselves they're not accurate though
at all they are not accurate at all
which is which is what yeah which brings
us back to you know a series we want to
do I guess next month Sean right where
we're going to talk about health gadgets
and how important it is for them to
actually be right because when they're
wrong there's no point to them I don't
write and sometimes you end up somewhere
you don't want to be right now Samsung
has this it kind of went overlooked by a
lot of people um last month they
introduced the sim band it was called it
sits at platform 2 SI m band
man and it's just watch with like
different colored lights and lasers that
run through and go through I guess they
shoot through your wrist and depending
on what you're doing it can actually
monitor like blood oxygen levels I think
it could do I forget but I had like a
bunch of awesome stuff it's like the
most advanced health platform I've seen
yet what I think when it was a clean are
we crossing over into like hypochondriac
level of fitness awareness here like why
do I need to know my blood oxygen levels
at all times in my heart rate of my
blood pressure like adults arrival time
I'm looking at it now real-time UK g ok
and that's a great question two years
ago when we were at CES i came down with
the flu and I told you know the rest of
the staff yo I'm not going to make it to
the show floor today I'm running a
temperature of 102.6 and it like a year
later Rory if I think goes how did you
know that your temperature was 102.6 I
was like I travel with a thermometer it
is he goes why I was like I travel a lot
you get sick on the road your
temperature kya kind of helps tell you
what's wrong going on yeah yeah but you
have an excellent point though joy I me
at what point will we all turn into
hypochondriac because we have all these
things monitoring us at all times and
sometimes very correct the end yeah but
the health stuff it's just like it's
like I need a SmartWatch because I want
to be on death watch 24 7 like am i
dying right now is th you have fourteen
thousand eight hundred ninety three days
left smarty and jelly your blood oxygen
levels pretty low your cholesterol super
high you're gonna be dead in two months
you know what but for people with like
diabetes and stuff I think it's super
cool because like my brother has to
watch his blood sugar levels like crazy
like all day long and he has these
different they look like blackberries
like these other devices to monitor it
all the time and if you could just do it
all from a phone and have it accurate
and be dead on or
could his wrist and that would be pretty
cool I think I'm not this is not
directly at your brother Todd so please
don't worry am what is with this is
getting so boxy as crap and I'll step
off quickly but what is with the state
of society if we have to like if a big
concern for market domination for these
companies is monitoring frickin
cholesterol levels like oh yeah yeah
it's true the fact that they even that
they're even going after that segment of
the market says a lot about the state of
health here in the world generically
it's just ridiculous that that this is
like one of the features of these new
phones is monitoring how close you are
to death because you eat too much well I
know it is crazy like like who needs to
know that if you have regular blood
pressure I think you're supposed to get
it checked like once every two years
yeah like why do you care your wrist
like wake in the morning good to know
got chicken in that's ridiculous no I I
tend to agree with you you know I mean
now that being said my parents who are
getting older and do have a lot of
health issues I could see some of the
stuff for them but for your average and
for them they're like oh it's too
complicated I mean in general holder
pegler like exactly yes that is exactly
where I was going it's way too over
their heads I love my job luckily they
don't watch the show but I can do I'd go
he's master of netflix i get 15 colton
gone how does this take my blood
pressure again to do i read wrap it
around your neck dad just right there
first engage button oh my pedos do a
watch is it okay to leave the house you
know me oh your choice oh we going Lee
decides it's too humid pentameters are
great it's a natural pedo bear deterrent
haha thank you my watch my pet o meter
is buzzing it orchard in here by
bloopers oh man
oh this the shares gone so off the rails
yeah from Vincent Monsieur who wants to
watch a world cup you've got us talking
about pedobear from Vincent Messina what
do you think is a reasonable price for
the Moto 360 that's a great question
because we've been saying here
discussing that yeah what is wrong well
we need the feature set first like if it
stands out more from the other products
yeah like it can't just be round so I
don't know but watch me as I work if I
hope they let us customize man I really
hope they do is if it's like it's three
hundred dollars and you get a black
rubber watch I'm gonna be like no yeah
right I have a feeling it's gonna come
in around 300 oh I have a feeling that
that's kind of what is that real is
crazy that these things have Snapdragon
400 processors and then I know we're out
of which was that like the top of the
line phone process well it came out in
the family when Snapdragon was
introduced with like 200 400 800 but um
I don't know like how much more powerful
is it then like the s4 pro i guess and
all that stuff that was these are a
couple years old I don't know it does
I'm am go to the phones and emerging
markets easy what's up did those come
out in the family or the family that the
family yes like 200 400 800 sort of like
the family that was interview stunner
right right no I mean it's crazy to me
that these things are running Snapdragon
400 so I'm just like is three hundred
dollars is three hundred dollars
reasonable to hit Vincent's that because
I think that's a key point here what's
reasonable like what is for consumers
and what's reasonable for for google for
that for that watch when I paid
yesterday for the g watch 229 that was
pretty much my upper limit for what i
would pay see that's too much for me i'm
down 18 to 34 watch everyone and 23 it
it was a tough call for me I mean I I
flip back and forth between the g live
and area the gear life yet yeah the
giver lives thank you and the G watch I
don't know how many times going
because I would have preferred to have
paid 200 but god I'd love to know a
breakdown of how much it's costing them
to make that watch Oh probably not much
no I can't it can't be like the screen
is the time either I mean a snappy
greens are probably like ships that
broke off the manufacturing line for the
phone so they put them in the water my
knees yeah the watch blocks are there
this one's not quite fit right watch box
yeah exactly reasonable for me like I
have a dream price if they come out
there like moto 360 is a is a hundred
fifty dollars i will just be like yes
honey here it is that'd be awesome it'd
be awesome that they keep dreaming
unfortunate it'll never happen that's a
place just wait a couple wait a year
it'll be 49 bucks 49 bucks at bent on
yeah we will have refurbished yeah there
you go yeah oh we have a ton of question
so let me let me jump back in here and
thank you all for all the questions
thank you for pouring yourselves away
from the World Cup to join us from the
that guy with a Mac took me a second to
figure out what all the letters were
there uh you think the Android L preview
will be suitable as a daily driver on in
nexus 5 Todd that be that's what I'm
trying to figure out I mean it's not
it's not out yet it's coming today right
um yeah we haven't installed it I hope
so and if it is i'll probably buy a
nexus 5 who is ours is going out there
but i'd love to play with the android
hell especially is like it advances i
assume into the fall it see him i don't
see me i tell you though iOS 8 has been
so bad i went back to iOS 7 over the
weekend because i could not deal with
iose next model my phone um i was
sitting in a restaurant i went to enter
in my passcode and it kept telling me I
was wrong and then it was like yes try
again 90 minutes and I was like that's
it I'm done with this no Todd that's
nothing but I ose is terrible so I hope
it's not that buggy because yeah we
don't have any questions and I'm
I don't have a question from joey
davidson here on the side but what do
you guys think about uh what is it
material yeah cereal what is what did
they call it material design i thinkin
actually first came out can I tell you
that when they first came out and they
started talking about it and the della
that they showed the verbiage that they
used I thought they were they were about
to unveil like a cap at like a screen
that dimpled and stuff like that am i
right I know so did I it look at the
waving screen I was like oh my god are
they guys come out with the tech guys
going here yeah yeah and then they were
just like Lolo someone did ask about it
Christopher miles asked about me yes no
I agree through Joey as soon as I saw
that up on the screen I was like oh my
god what have they done and then they
just slowly just like troll a little old
us and just said yes kidding its its
shadows yeah it's fancy for shadows it
seemed like I get it you can develop in
another dimension I guess I don't know I
everybody's super miles this question do
you think the new material design
aesthetic is going to lead to a redesign
of Chrome OS or even the Chrome browser
they seem like the odd ones out at this
point I think so yeah here you language
ooh they'll start in one thing and then
they'll move it across all their
products so if this is their new idea
for design this material design then
yeah I think we'll eventually see it
move across all the products right
here's a close question ahead if either
you guys really played with chrome OS uh
yeah my sister-in-law's has a Chromebook
very much just like the chrome browser
yeah well I I I ended up picking up one
of the sous chrome boxes again for my
family because you know they're getting
older and they don't move around as much
I i hook it up to our television and
then that way they can sit on the couch
and use it and it's kind of nice I
really like and when they talked
yesterday about being able to now use
android apps on I was like oh that was
cool this just got way more interest
I gotta tell you that if it if it wasn't
for the fact that it's missing video
editing software um and like recording
it software for podcasts like doing
gaming videos for me like I would be on
the chrome like the Chromebook train
just because it what going to
conventions I really hate lugging around
my macbook like it's you know I just
don't want to i'd rather have just
something that just gets me gets me to
technobuffalo is back end and lets me
write whatever I want and then get out
and then that would be awesome but
that's what I want to more of just like
this simple super simple and that's what
that is I know I wish it had video
editing that's like the one thing that
holds me back to the same same sickles
brother and the battery life seems great
on them right yeah and it's a gorgeous
simple design too I mean I just you know
it's just yeah the price is right for
the samsung ones what is like for our
bucks for like a decent yeah it's crazy
no I mean if you if you're somebody that
isn't in like our field and you have to
do a lot video editing and photo editing
and all that if you're just like an
email web surfer go for a Chromebook
yeah my sister-in-law's one loves it so
yeah I for your average internet user
knock yourselves out it's called the Red
Machine and then that would be that from
Eric broman what are your thoughts on
the new look of android l and any idea
is what the L will stand for as for what
it will stand for the prevailing thought
right now is lollipop mm-hmm but uh so
yeah we are oh yes you did you know did
you notice Todd that the the home button
and the return button and all that were
redesigned yeah yeah easily into rounded
PlayStation logos yeah like I uh exactly
what it looks like yeah it looked a lot
like PlayStation yeah override I mean we
really didn't get to see that much of it
and we'll know more once we can update
our Nexus 5 today and i'm debating
updating my nexus 7 i haven't decided
yet
but yeah I mean what we saw looked
interesting but it really i think was
just like a taste mm-hmm well any
obvious they didn't even named it yet
official yeah you know the only
shouldest screenshots and stuff which i
think is about the first time they've
done that Todd where they just called it
by the letter yeah yeah they had a lot
of crap going on yesterday what did the
thing run 22 hours 45 minutes oh it was
insane well and it was packed to the
brim with there was really very little
filler and I'm wondering you know what
is this just a case where they didn't
have the time to literally announce
everything so they kind of had to pick
and choose yeah that's possible but also
that's the other thing that was
bothering me yesterday a little bit I
get this as a developer show um but they
literally had nothing finished like it
there wasn't a real chromecast update
yesterday like it's just all this stuff
coming this fall which is great but I
kind of wanted something yesterday I
mean like last year it was like
chromecast or whatever I don't know well
I mean you got your watch yeah we got
the watches but that was announced back
in March so we've been waiting for that
for a while too I don't know mean this
yeah I kind of agree with you but you
know at the same point I think that it
is a developer's conference which is
awesome people were jammed up when they
were like coding and we're just like
yeah we're like one is I don't know I
had to say we got to the coding section
I could hear you all zoned out I'm
saying they're going whoo no I at one
point I just turn to tar Sean and I'm
just like dude I got I got video games
to play man I gotta go okay what is this
I gotta go I can't do this what once
again showing that that joy has the best
job ever I'm sorry I've got to go play
video games too many video games just
showed up gotta get out of here
something we really haven't touched on
from Sasha Mahal what are each of your
thoughts especially Sean's on Android TV
and how does it contribute to gadget
overload the first thing that struck me
wow it looked a lot
fire TV what does a lot like very I'm
going to have to wait until I actually
get my hands on it before I make any
sort of final determination because all
right great so you can you know oh it
knows what you're watching you can pull
up information on it okay well what's
the past's are going to be on that which
systems does it work with you know am I
just going to patch my DVR through it
and then do a pass through the
television there's a lot of questions
about it I I think when they said the
ones that will be built in the
televisions though that interested me
more than a set-top box in this
particular situation yeah yeah they
might be supposed to do it right because
while webos from LG looks pretty good
but Smart TV features are terrible we've
gone over this and other shows before
but they're so clunky so Android could
be a good option there every every
manufacturers built-in smart stuff is
clunky as all get out what I think
Google is trying to do here with between
the television and the auto stuff I
think that they're just saying like I
feel like they had an internal power out
like these guys are doing garbage jobs
at creating these platforms let's just
step up and make one that all the
manufacturers can use they can stop
spending money on R&amp;amp;D for for platform
design and we can just come in and say
use our service and then all of a sudden
you have a win-win for both parties and
especially because they're already
markers in mobile like when you look at
Samsung LG Sony yeah yeah why don't you
just let us build your your TV OS is on
our own and then you guys don't have to
worry about spending that money and and
Roku kind did the same thing this year
at CES they announced that some
televisions were going to come with Roku
built in but yeah the see I was kind of
in the market pro television this year
I'm going to hold off now and wait till
next year and see what's up especially
with sharp Oh sharp had some gorgeous
television since here at CES yeah they
did and you know now they're saying you
know that they'll be coming with you
know android TV built-in though it's a
definite
deciding factor for me mmhmm yeah so
Android TV I'm going to have to wait and
see what's going on before I make any
sort of decision there now let me look
through here I i know we've gotten some
stuff about Android in the car and we
have not touched on that yeah I cannot
believe how much there was yesterday it
was just one thing after another after
another yeah but uh well while i'm
looking for an android car question here
I mean what do you guys think about the
idea the the basic idea that your phone
will be powering oh it's cool that's
really cool and it's really similar to
the way that Apple's doing it kind of I
mean the fact that it's all powered by
your phone and then the automaker I
guess building like sort of support in
for it but like I think there was a lot
of confusion when Apple launched carplay
that like this was a console like sold
by Apple which is not true it's actually
actually I kind of ice cream I placard
the question from Christopher miles is
Android auto or car play the more
elegant solution in your opinion I
actually am leaning towards Android auto
looks good I don't know I feel like it's
people you know whatever ecosystem
you're in which is it's really becoming
a huge battle of the ecosystems and
really whatever one you're in yeah it's
divots like demanding pockets ruse well
what what intrigued me about Android
auto was the fact that it everything is
kept on the phone so if I let's say I
you know I go out to irvine three or
four times a year and i run a car the
idea that i could get in a rental car
plug in my phone and boom it's all your
sexting thing i have at home exactly
yeah that's a really cool idea yeah that
being said though how many people are
switching cars that often and you know
at home I Drive a 99 Tahoe has
absolutely no fancy features yeah my
Subaru doesn't have a screen so exactly
yeah i was like i have a two thousand
one for explorer yeah i mean so until i
buy a new car
which you know honestly I love my tahoe
so much I going to make sure that thing
drives until it's falling apart oh I'm
running mine into the ground Andrea
straight into the ground yeah okay
here's the fine thing you wanna know why
I will continue to drive this Tahoe as
long as I will no center console that
stretches out its far back so it doesn't
do the full length like a lot of center
consoles do now and so the because of
how tall I am my knee if I'm in a car
with a stretched-out center console my
knees banging into the center console
all the time yeah basically been a
problem so yeah the room on the tahoe
we'll keep tracking that till the end of
time easy now I have my own carplay and
android auto right now I just kind of
put it into a little dashboard mount yep
yeah it's quite nice actually as I have
really well thousand nine thousand cords
hanging from it yeah so well right you
know that they were talking about
Android auto and they talked about how I
could you know read your text messages
out loud I was like a message her I was
like that's going to be awesome for
anyone that's in a sexting relationship
well I'm just gonna send in whenever
John is testing his stuff I'm just gonna
start texting him pedo meter Wang Oh
Peter Ward hang it yes mam I would be
happy to drive you to church in the
grocery store on Sunday get in the car
with me i just plugged my phone first oh
geez that's awesome incoming message
from Janelle thank you for last it was
amazing helotes respond creepy was that
dude leading the Android car demo that
was yeah that was just awkward there's a
lot of funny stuff yesterday Eric
Schmidt like the the mid-level developer
did you see that yeah Eric Schmidt
there's another guy
chairman of Google Eric Schmidt and then
developer comes on stage we have Eric
Schmidt I was like that's not him mother
so for anybody like I was writing and
listening and they say like Eric Schmidt
I'm like well he's on stage in and of
course it's nothing righteous I am me
and said I don't like to hear Roy and
sexy in the same conversation yeah ray
just imed you oh there is a right way
hey sorry we we won't mention you and
sexy in the same conversation a kid Oh
Chang oh my uh let's see here from
Nolan's y'all what'd you say his last
name Joey what no one's nuoc thank you
right do you think manufacturers will
ruin the new interface introduced with
Android L when they add a custom skin
yes yup absolutely samsung it's part of
the reason why I've been so jazzed about
this moto x Todd yeah cuz they didn't
just as much it's like look it's a phone
enjoy Bali was that awesome features on
top of Nexus I mean of T cat yep well
you know and that's a lot of the reason
you know it takes so long to get an
update to a lot of these phones is
because they got run it through the skin
and then they got yo do the testing with
the carriers and all that you know hats
off to HTC I mean the fact that
yesterday announced that 90 days after L
comes out you will have it yeah me I was
on time eight awesome now in Joey's case
with the Moto X you'll probably have it
within a couple days yep yeah seriously
sometimes ahead of the Nexus which is
all yeah that's without al caso but yes
to Nolan's question yeah they're totally
going to ruin the new design that's what
the OEMs do mmm so good at it too I
wonder if anyone samsung has on their
business card winner of Android design
yeah great we make jelly bean jelly bad
hahaha oh my oh my uh oh here's an
interesting question from Nathan Golders
Reich man guys I I am horrible with
pronounced I have a last name ani and I
feel horrible just say Nathan he Nathan
GE any chance you guys will make a video
on how to install android l developer
version for us newbies who just want to
check it out um hadn't really discussed
it but that might be a possibility do it
today Jenna you do it Todd I gotta do it
I gotta send this nexus out to
California oh yeah hold up I got it hey
I'll just go ahead do it hey who knows
so there's a rumor right now we're
covering that there might be a yellow
nexus 5 so if that happens maybe that's
all and then all of it wait there's a
yellow Nexus 5 Todd bright spot hasn't
lined up yet I always say this though
because when the red one came out I was
like oh I need that in never bought ah
another question for Nolan do you think
android TV will be more successful than
Google TV or an chromecast has to be
more successfully Google's more
successful in Google TV I think I could
build a more successful yeah Sean TV
John TV coming soon um cardboards
already more successful google cardboard
i love when you link that to me but I
was just like oh what's that I super get
it it's just like it's like one of those
quick she'll be like yeah it's a joke
yeah I know okay what's the point I know
it's like what I love it I worship took
45 minutes of their press conference
yesterday which is just google execs
folding cardboard on the stage I know
how much that cost six dozen when I used
to have my colleagues door of course we
sold comic boxes it was amazing to me
how many customers would end up coming
back like an hour after they buy going
do you know how to assemble this
really yeah it would take me yeah I was
like boom boom boom boom here skadam I
said get out of my shop get out yeah we
got that point when we sold a box we've
just immediately go would you like me
though some blood for you man but ok so
yes I do think android TV will be more
successful in google TV chromecast
that's an interesting question because
chromecast has only been thirty-five
dollars so cheap yeah you're talking
about wildly different markets I think
yeah and different products a lot more
than chromecast does yeah um yes to
Google TV not sure on chromecast yeah
it's tonsil you believe Shawn TV will be
launching in fall 2015 you know I'm just
scrolling through ink you must have
referenced the help stuff as we were
talking to it he said you don't
necessarily need to know blood pressure
etc but I bet Google would love to have
access to that info yeah which is
exactly right it's such good okay so
let's you're dying can we recommend oh
there's a joke how I so so bad right now
but this is a family friendly show yeah
yeah i mean that's actually somewhat of
an interesting question so let's say
that the android wear notices your blood
pressure's high you jump on your phone
you see a ad for blood pressure
medication totally true your erection
has clearly lasted longer than four
hours no no meet her that's off the
charts and you're entering a school zone
makes you better haha that's gonna be
the end of the chauffeur yeah that was
we lost Joey what location awareness oh
god
