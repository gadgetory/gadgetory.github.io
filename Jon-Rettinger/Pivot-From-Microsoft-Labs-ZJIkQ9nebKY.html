TechnoBuffalo and in this video I'm
gonna show you something really awesome
that just came out of Microsoft labs
it's called pivot and it allows you to
analyze massive amounts of data to help
you make decisions and right now it's a
free download I'll post a link on
TechnoBuffalo on how to get it just kind
of wanted to give you a demo of
different ways that you could use this
awesome new technology so here we start
with the collections which are
collections of data that Microsoft has
pre-populated the idea is that if lots
of people like this they're going to
come out with more collections they'll
create tools that will allow you to
import your own data so that you can use
this program so let's go down to dog
breeds I really like dogs and I want
some help in trying to find a dog that
is right for my lifestyle so I click on
dog breeds and then I immediately get
this really beautifully organized grid
that is organized by group of dog and up
here I can sort by different parameters
I can sort by approximate lifespan so I
can see right off the bat which dogs are
expected to live longer than others and
for me that's a good place to start so
I'm gonna go down to to lifespan down
here on the left side and I'm going to
say that I only want to see dogs that
live longer than say 15 years I want the
dog to be around for a while so here we
go these are the dogs that live for more
than 15 years now I also live in a in an
apartment so I want to make sure that
the dog doesn't have crazy exercise
needs that they won't get bored and
start eating the furniture if I don't
take them out for a run for an hour a
day so I'm going to check off minimal
and low for exercise needs and now we
are drilled down to a couple of dogs but
I also want a medium-sized dog I don't
want a little kick dog that I'm gonna
trip over when I walk in at night but I
don't want a huge dog that's going to
you know intimidate people when they
come in so I am going to go into size
and I'm going to check off medium and
now I'm drilled down to just three dogs
that fit all of my criteria and I can
zoom in with my mouse I can move it up
and down kind of like
you know you're browsing on an iPhone
and all of these look pretty ugly except
for this one I like that dog you can
click on it it tells you what the name
of the dog is some information about it
you get some web links for more
information and that sort of thing so
that's one example of how you can use
pivot to help you find a dog that is
right for you let's go to discover more
collections and this time let's go to
concept cars I really like cars and I'm
always curious to see of the cool
concepts that come out so right off the
bat we get this visual display that
shows us the different sort of body
styles but of course you can filter it
by different parameters let's see I want
to see kind of the more recent
turbocharged cars concept cars so I'm
going to go to production here and I'm
going to filter this out by just in the
last 15 years or so
so pivots going to regenerate and now we
have a smaller list of choices I'm going
to go down to aspiration I just want to
see the turbocharged concept cars I
really like turbocharged cars I like the
sound that the turbo makes when it
spools up and let's see what else I want
to change body style I want to I want to
see all of the coupe's and here we go
here are all the coupes so we can go
through and these are all the
turbocharged coupes concept cars that
have come out in the last few years and
we can kind of move around on the screen
very intuitively and elegantly just a
really awesome way to sort of look at
data and be able to find quickly
information that you want let's do one
more I'm going to go back to discover
more collections and this time I'm going
to go to Xbox Marketplace I haven't been
to this one yet so I'm curious to see
what it looks like so wow this shows all
of the games that are available on the
Xbox Marketplace we can sort by genre I
want to go to release date I want to see
sort of the older games that came out
let's say in 2006 so we can drill into
any of these columns go to 2006 and we
can also use the zoom tool up here to
kind of move back or you can use the
zoom tool on your mouse and we see all
of the Xbox titles here that came out in
this year now I want to see only the
racing games and flying games that came
out in all of these years here they are
and let's look at price I want to see
sort of the
the most expensive the hottest games
that came out here they are and also I
want to see game ratings games that
really are made for or for everyone so
I'm gonna check off efore everyone and
then we're left with just a few titles
that allows me to really drill down and
see the games that I want to see that
are for everyone that came out in the
last few years that have to do with
racing or flying this makes it really
easy and intuitive to look up that
information so again guys just a quick
look at Microsoft pivot I think it's
going to be an awesome thing in the
future especially if it gets a lot of
traction it really helps you analyze a
lot of data quite easily in a very
visually pleasing way that makes it
easily digestible so again we'll post a
link on TechnoBuffalo on how to get this
and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
