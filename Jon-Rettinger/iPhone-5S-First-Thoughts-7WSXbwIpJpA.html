technobuffalo here and I want to talk to
you about apples just unveiled iphone 5s
I got a ton of thoughts on it of course
it might change totally once I get in my
hands but I love talking about
technology and I just thought we could
have kind of a discussion together about
it i'm jon rettinger the iphone 5s talk
the person let me recap everything that
Apple announced in case you missed it if
you want to see a full recap of the
event I'll put a link right down below
my pants region you can catch up on
everything updated processor a 7 so the
redesigned chip is 64-bit which is crazy
fast offers twice the power and twice
the graphics performance as the asic so
that's the iphone 5 apple also made a
big point to say that is now 56 times
fashion the original model in almost all
cases which is a lot of times faster
going along with that a7 chip is
something new called the m7 motion
coprocessor the new cpu worked with the
a7 to measure all your physical
movements the m7 sports a gyroscope
compass accelerometer and way more
anytime you move the phone that m7 is
working you got the obvious stuff
improved battery life improved camera
and throw the rest of the kind of things
that you would expect but the big one
for me is touch ID it's the new
fingerprint scanning sensor and because
of that alone I think 25 25 s is the
biggest s upgrade which you've had you
know from 3g to 3gs and for 24 s you
know the 4s got Siri but this one is a
really big deal for me so a lot of
people are looking at a thing like cool
it's another way to enter my password I
can just put my finger on it it'll
unlock and I don't have to worry about
memorizing a four-digit pin I think it's
much more than potentially much much
much more than that so Apple sort of
scratched the surface and you be able to
buy things from itunes using gesture
fingerprint which is incredibly awesome
and infinitely more secure than typing
in a pastor or somebody can go over your
shoulder and see it or can somehow be
learned through subversive measures to
get in share accounts this though is
your finger your finger is unique to you
and assuming nobody hacks off your hand
or your little digit no one is ever
going to be able to use that no matter
how hard they try it's not stored in the
cloud it's stored only on the device and
supposedly almost completely unable to
be accessed by anybody except for the
phone that
being used so I think we really cool a
police is an API for this thing if you
want to buy something from Amazon on
your phone just using your fingerprint
or you know rent a movie just using your
fingerprint and it could be a really new
way not only keep things more secure but
also easier usually more secure things
get the more steps in oops you gotta
jump through this is just infinitely
easier so I really give Apple credit for
this I think they've done a really nice
job with it and I'm excited to see how
it works in practice obviously an idea
it sounds like it could be really cool
but in practice of totally other story
the color thing is also very weird the
white one is now silver the black is
space grey and the gold is gold I guess
I've got space grey hair I have to try
but I do think this is a big big upgrade
and a lot of new things are in the
obviously the phone looks the same the
same cases are going to work for it
aren't really that many sort of external
differences but I think internally
there's a lot of cool things be excited
about and the camera is something a lot
of people use I think all the iphone
pictures look great having slow-mo and
burst mode or nice additions that
fingerprint sensor sounds really cool I
remember trying it on the original Atrix
4G and it worked very poorly hoping
apples done a really nice job they're
upping that technology they bought a
company it focused on fingerprint
technology i believe back in 2012 and
i'm guessing this is the fruit of that
labor overall though it seems to be a
very nice upgrade if you're looking to
go from you know maybe an iphone 4s is a
great upgrade from you if you've got an
iphone 5 if you want to sit this round
out and wait till the iphone 6 it's
never too early to start those rumors I
wonder you guys think about the iphone
5s are you excited my way off base the
fingerprint thing gets be super jazzed
up I do wish though we still had you
know NFC would have been a nice dish
into it oh she had a bigger screen and I
wish I os7 did a lot more stuff but it
is what it is in reality is a world we
live in so iphone 5s you can get one
worth the upgrade I would love to hear
from you with them in the comments right
