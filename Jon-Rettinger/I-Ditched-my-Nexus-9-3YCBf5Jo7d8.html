brought to you by domain.com what's
going on everyone Jon render from
TechnoBuffalo he foreknew to the channel
and been following us for years I like
to share what device I'm using in my
personal life I know I've got the
distinct privilege of being able to try
everything out there so that I'd share
what I choose to use for the past four
to five months for my dedicated tablet
at home I've been using the Nexus 9 I
previously used Apple iPads either the
iPad Mini or the iPad iPad air all the
way through till it first came out as
the only tablet and I really took a
liking to the Nexus 9
I think Android on tablets really
matured with the Nexus 9 particular with
lollipops really excited to use the
Nexus 9 and I've absolutely loved the
heck out of that thing I traveller that
came with me absolutely everywhere I
went and it had been almost flawless I
was the kind of person that was checking
every six minutes to try and get the
five point one a bit on I didn't want to
force it over I wanted to come sort of
organically over there like everybody
else so I waited and I waited five put
one finally hit and I was excited I
installed it and then things start to go
downhill with my Nexus 9 Google Play
server to start to just totally crash on
me all the time I would say I have to
redownload services YouTube stops
working all the Google Apps I use all
the time would just log me out the
tablet got really buggy it start to get
warm and just started to go from great
experience to a not so great experience
so if I didn't have the opportunity to
switch tablets often I would stick with
the Nexus 9 and probably be fine because
I do have the opportunity I decided to
try something new that I would
necessarily think to try and that's this
guy this is the Dell Venue 8 7000 series
marked the review on it now a few months
ago I wanted to try something that I
wouldn't ordinarily pick up and use and
Dell is definitely not the first thing I
think of when I comes to tablets I
wanted to give it a shot I've really
liked the Android experience on a tablet
so I wanted to stick with that I didn't
want to go to Apple or something
different so if you're not familiar with
this guy it's an 8 point 4 inch screen
it's 2560 by 1600 so it's qHD it's kind
of a weird design though let's get this
big chin hump we've got a camera down
below you've got three intel realsense
cameras and odd locations so everyone
try and take a picture one of your
fingers is going to be covering the back
of it I've got the 60 gigabyte version
here they've got a higher capacity I
believe 32 now this one starts at 309 so
it's relatively inexpensive to get into
the
tablet tablet world and it's one of the
thinnest tablets also going at six
millimeters thin it's crazy thin just
got upgrade the lollipop so I figured
it's 5.0 - it's not 5.1 yet so let's
give it a shot
also I hadn't really use anything with
an Intel Atom chip you know regularly
for months after months after a review
so I wanted to try this guy to see how a
performance got the quad core Atom chip
in there and I've been really impressed
with it it's only been like now about
five days since I made the switch but
overall it's been a really good
experience before before everybody yells
at me
Adele's not paying me to say this I'm
just trying to tablets I liked it I'm
the opportunity to try it my wife and I
watch netflix every night before bed and
I was kind of worried about this big
speaker grille on the bottom when you
hold the tablet your hand is covering
the speaker so I thought that sound
would be muffled but there's some sort
of wizardry or magic in here where the
speakers sound fine but also very weird
for tablet that sort of metal coated on
the back it doesn't get warm
which is surprising we've got an idea
for next great website domain comm has
you covered they woke you up with a
great offer save 20% on domain names and
web hosting when you use coupon code
TechnoBuffalo that's all capital letters
one word at domaine comms check out I
think domain names think domain.com when
issues I had with the Nexus 9 was
battery drink got really bad the battery
life so far this guy has been pretty
nice I would have liked bigger storage
as the entry point 16 gigs is not that
much just have an SD card slot
I put an SD card in there it's all the
few apps on it but mostly I'm still
relying on the internal storage here one
of the things that I liked and this core
true with any Android tablet now are any
Android device or iOS device I guess for
that now matter is the new Photos app so
I can get all my photos that I use from
an iPhone or from Android device and
they'll catch up with my tablet over the
cloud that taking up storage which have
been really cool I will say the
realsense technology which lets you do
things like focus after the fact all
kinds of other camera stuff I've had
zero use for the back is also black and
glossy looks like when it's nice when
it's clean but it's hardly ever been
clean but I will say I like the tablet a
lot I wish it was a little bit bigger
they do offer a 10-inch version but it's
got a weird sort of like battery handle
hinge you can use for a keyboard dock so
this is what we're left with 8.4 inch
screen it's been
nice and relatively impressive and I'm
excited to keep using and see if my
opinion on it changes but overall it's
been really good I will say if you're
thinking about getting one
I ordered a case from Amazon my thought
would be fine a little flipped case but
turns out they had the thing in Reverse
so when you put it in to open it up like
a book it opens reverse and that was
very annoying so if you get one make
sure you check the cases that you buy
Dells happy to send you a very
overpriced one for like 50 bucks
so anyway else you guys know what I
think mark let gettin's review so I'm
curious to to try it I will say though
the 5.1 update does hit it while I'm
using it not so sure I'm going to hit
that upgrade button I think I want to
know about this let me know anything you
want me to test you know it's got the
Intel chip in it it's made by Dell which
wouldn't expect I'm kind of enjoying it
and then you guys like to know what I'm
using if this one doesn't work or starts
to suck I might go back to the Nvidia
shield tablet I really like that guy too
but I figured in CEREC tested that ahead
and tried this one I'm gonna give it a
whirl
and I thank you guys for watching hope
you enjoy if you want to know what else
I'm carrying what else I'm using let me
know I'll be sure to sort of to update
videos if I try to switch something
different if you like to video too big
subscribe button I appreciate it until
next time Jon render free TechnoBuffalo
i'll talk to you friendo in the next
