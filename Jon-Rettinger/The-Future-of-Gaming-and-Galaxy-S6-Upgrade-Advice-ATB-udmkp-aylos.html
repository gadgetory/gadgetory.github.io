brought to you by domain.com what's up
everyone jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo here and welcome dear
friends for the episode of ask the buff
like to imagine that you're sitting
right here I got my arm around you not
in a creepy way we're just chatting
about tech answering questions first
questions comes from my friend and one
of the great technique troopers out
there at Detroit bored you should
definitely check him out he asked at
John for lakers what tech items do you
consider essential what is the really
the only things you absolutely must have
day-to-day hashtag ask to Buffalo it's a
very easy one when I travel I try to
sort of pare it down I need a phone that
I can tether off of an external battery
pack everything I can make anything work
outside of that usually I'll carry a
tablet with me as well maybe a laptop if
I had to pick one thing it's a phone
that I can tether from and i am happy if
i have to manage aside and do it from
the phone forgot to log into wordpress i
can do it from the phone forgot to check
in on the site or check in electrotistic
so i can do all that on the phone so for
me it's a phone it doesn't matter
whether its iOS or android can do both
their apps for each but it's mostly just
a phone in a battery pack cuz i burned
through battery fast and I like my
screens bright but what about you Mike
what do you need challenge you to leave
it answer down below next one comes from
at Cedric PR who asked at John for
lakers what do you think about USB
type-c coming two phones I am really
excited that we won port has one you
haven't been following what's been going
on in the port world and why would you
it's kind of boring Thunderbolt three
point 0 is using the USB type-c size and
connector as their standard turning
Thunderbolt 3 will fit USB type-c
connector which means you eventually be
able to charge your phone and your
tablet and your computer using the exact
same chords are going to be pretty
awesome beyond that it can do fast your
data speeds you can carry more power and
it's just one corner you in traveling so
I'm really excited about USB type-c and
its really excited about ports these the
ones on phones so i think i should be
looking forward to it as well you've got
an idea for next great website domain
com has you covered they won't hook you
up with a great offer say twenty percent
on domain names and web hosting when you
use coupon code technobuffalo that's all
capital letters one word at domain comms
check out I think domain names think
domain.com with e3 going on to seem like
a perfect question at DJ
unreal nycs at john for lakers what do
you think about the future of gaming
especially since e3 is here it seems
like it's virtual reality whether you
got oculus with their rift or Microsoft
showing Minecraft on the hololens that
you haven't seen that you should check
it out i'll put a link link to it down
below it is unbelievable at hollins
going to be able to do way beyond
anything google glass ever did anything
we've ever seen before it's friggin
Holograms on a wall or in real life it's
like we're really looking at Princess
Leia asking your obi-wan for help and
i'm nerdy i get it but it's absolutely
awesome the geek and me cannot wait to
try it out last but not least at oh-nine
NOS who asked at john for lakers is it
worth upgrading to the galaxy s6 or
should I sick with the s5 Thank You
smiley face a big upgrade from the 52
the sixth reasons not to upgrade though
if you need to move about it or
expandable storage if you don't need
those things and yes absolutely upgrade
the galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge are to
the best phones out new build new design
it'll feel like an actual upgrade do it
if you don't need those two things thank
you guys for watching hope you enjoyed
if you want to ask you a question you
can really ask me any time send it to me
at john for lakers or at technobuffalo
just use hashtag ask the be until next
time dear friends I am John render from
TechnoBuffalo doctor you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
