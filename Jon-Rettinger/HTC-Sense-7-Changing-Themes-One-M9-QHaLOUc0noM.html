Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here
with the HTC One m9 we already brought
you a hands-on with it we have a lot of
comparison videos on the site but now I
wanted to come back to a little deeper
dive into some of the customization
options you can do inside of Sense 7 one
of the awesome things inside sin 7 is
the ability to change themes so you can
see right now I have a pretty standard
home screen layout here and then I have
a grey kind of theme different wallpaper
icon set but if you want you can hold
the home screen just like that sort of
tap and hold click change your edit home
and then here we have a different theme
so we'll just choose the one that's
downloaded but there's tons to choose
from
we'll use even the sounds of the new
theme and apply it and here you go you
can see the icons have changed
completely you can see the colors here
it actually happens to be grey
well sometimes change will go in here
the background this is where the colors
have changed again and up top and then
of course the wallpaper changed too now
here let me show you we go back to
change your item there's a whole catalog
of themes to choose from and we can't
download them here because we're on the
show floor and the phone doesn't have a
connection and these all have some
different bug icons if your wallpapers
different fonts you can see here you can
bookmark your favorite ones you can also
create different ones yourself so look
if you go to my themes and plus now
we'll choose the home page image we'll
go to the gallery let's just pick one of
the selfies here I don't know
let's say we want to say that's a friend
of ours and we want to create a theme
using that picture and it basically
creates a theme based on the colors of
the picture so styles change the icon
sounds and font and then it changes the
different features of blinkfeed and
shows you what it's going to look like
ahead of time so if we wanted edit it we
could change textures and colors so it'd
be like the green one maybe instead
where it shows that it's gonna use that
instead of the purple that we saw you
know let's use a different icon back
that one looks funky we'll just use it
for fun you can change the sounds which
we want you right now and we can also
change the fonts HCC theme font preview
it finish it and now we've created our
own theme based on that image but it
could be a lot more fun say if you have
an image of the beach that you took and
you want to create a custom theme based
on that then the neat thing is too you
can actually share these themes with
anybody so now we've applied this theme
and I'll go to the home screen and
there's the funny background image of
the custom theme I just made but you can
again you can create all your themes
that you want share them with friends
and stuff like that so really neat new
feature of sense 7 and something I think
makes this phone stand out in a lot of
ways and just makes it easier versus
other phones on the market that's a
quick look here at the themes in 10 7
