from TechnoBuffalo and if you're on the
market right now for a laptop I'm sure
you've noticed bass internal storage
options are not that high this is
partially because we're trying to always
make laptops thinner and because SSDs
aren't the cheapest so today I wanted to
give you guys three alternative storage
options that'll give you guys more space
to do more of what you want first and
probably my favorite alternative storage
option is the Samsung t3 now this is an
external SSD it's very fast uses USB 3.1
and in regards surprising you can get a
250 gig model at 97 dollars off of
Amazon you can get a 500 gig model
currently at 169 and you can get a one
terabyte model at 360 nine dollars so
prices might fluctuate but that's where
we're at right now so it's good
affordable external stores that is very
very fast I actually edit a lot of
videos off of the t3 so you can most
definitely work off of it the downside
here is the downside you're gonna have
with any external plug in SSD is that
you're gonna have this thing dangling
from your laptop so if you're working on
planes or trains or in the back of a car
or something it's not the most
convenient it's not really a hassle
given how light the t3 is but definitely
something to bear in mind that's
definitely a cable you're gonna have
sticking out of your laptop unlike the
other two options we have coming up next
we have the SanDisk Ultra fit 128 gig
USB 3 flash drive this is different from
the t3 in a sense that it's pretty much
just a dongle the trade-offs are making
are going to be for size and speed so
while the ultra fit is smaller the read
and write speeds are much slower versus
the t3 in real-world usage this means
that while you may be able to work off
of the t3 without even having to think
twice you won't be able to work off of
the SanDisk Ultra fit as smoothly I had
a couple times where it unmounted and it
would get super super hot it works well
as a storage archiving device just to
back up a couple files or to transfer
folders and projects and video clips
really quickly and with the 128 gig
version starting at only $30.00 I'd say
this is a great and very affordable way
to get into external additive storage
however I would just say going with
reasonable expectations this is not
going to be some crazy workhorse of an
SSD and last but definitely not least we
have the TARDIS expansion via SD
card slot situation you insert this SD
card looking thing and it merges with
your existing hard drive so it doesn't
come up as a separate drive on your
computer you just store stuff the way
you would normally would and it
effectively either doubles or expand
your storage as much as you have bought
so I have a 500 gigabyte SSD internal on
my macbook pro it expanded me up to
seven hundred and twenty-five or seven
hundred and fifty gigs issue in theory
because it merges both of the drives
speed differences are supposed to be
negligible setup was pretty easy and
quick there are a couple steps you do
need to quit all applications reboot
three or four times so it's not a
plug-and-play system completely however
it shouldn't take you more than five or
ten minutes additional benefits are that
the TARDIS sits completely flush up
against your laptop so once it's in and
set up you will completely forget about
it but it's not all perfect here
obviously the downside is that you lose
all functionality of your SD card slot
which is very important to some of us
and that someone is me in addition to
that it is super expensive the one we
got for my macbook pro the 15-inch
was 399 dollars for 250 gigs of storage
so it's not affordable but once it's in
it's not really in your way like the
other storage options were it just
doesn't work for me because I use my SD
card slot a lot however if you know for
a fact that you're not going to be using
your SD card slot and you want something
that you're not gonna have to think
about ponying up the extra money up
front might make sense in addition you
also lose the flexibility of being able
to take it in and out whenever you want
I try to take it out just for a test in
my entire computer crash so don't do
that and so that's it for this video
guys those are three alternative storage
solutions each one is good for a
different user for me the t3 is best
given the pricing and how fast it is and
how quickly you can work off of it let
me know in the comments down below which
one is best for you and what you thought
of this video gives a thumbs up if you
liked it hit subscribe if you want more
tech content and coverage and we'll see
you guys in the next one thank you so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
