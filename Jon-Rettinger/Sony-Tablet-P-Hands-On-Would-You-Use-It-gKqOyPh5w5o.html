John Retton gherkin TechnoBuffalo here
live from Sony's booth at IFA 2011 and
this is not a smartphone this is a
clamshell tablet he just announced Sony
Tablet P a little bit skeptical when I
heard the tablet P we've seen it leaked
from months and months and months ago
and actually in person it's a pretty
unique device let's go ahead and take a
quick look let's open it up and take a
look at it it's - 5.5 inch screens kind
of interesting we dig a look we'll go
ahead and jump home here first you can
see the interface streets it has one big
screen
despite this big gap in the middle one
of the concerns I had was how is it
going to feel when you're scrolling up
and down over it and the answer is about
we'd expect it's not completely smooth
there is a bit of a ledge right there
this part of the screen is a little bit
higher so you feel your finger go over
it if we're browsing a website that they
were at TechnoBuffalo here for example
you definitely can scroll we don't have
much of a problem but you do clearly see
that line there so if you're reading an
article and you're scrolling on through
you're going to have to judge whether or
not that's going to be a bother for you
or not
something I could probably get used to
easily adjust it with just moving your
finger but it's certainly going to be
prevalent in there we'll go and jump in
and take a look your thumb above these
back close we mentioned it does have
those two 5.5 inch capacitive screens
with a resolute
you might instigating see it for
yourself 1024 by 480 of course content
this does have cellular connectivity
from any carrier announcements yet does
have support though for AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+
network so without the standard that's
used pretty much all over the world so
hopefully it'll come to your carrier
similar specs with the other Sony
tablets that we've seen so it's being
powered by NVIDIA Tegra 2 by megapixel
camera on the back with HD capture
you've got a huge a camera living
somewhere on the front there it is right
in there so you can do your front safety
video chat so what is this work that
you're going to do for you oh it's a bit
odd first I kept trying to rotate it see
how an accelerometer would work I wanted
to look at afraid of an angle and I
couldn't get anything to rotate so what
does this work back there going to be
good for let me show you one of the
applications that don't exploded on here
scroll on down to the bottom when the
reader plane for a book this is a very
interesting form factor let's go ahead
and open up the jungle book for example
I see what Mowgli and Baloo are up to
it's pretty a good port vector for
reading actually you're not getting that
much text as it is a very narrow screen
I just scroll through you can see others
and potentially be a nice addition
obviously we change the font size you've
put different books on here download
them on different things but this is
really where this habit drives
differentiy in itself it's in these sort
of reader functions so I'll go ahead and
jump on there and keep things rotate
right on back so we do have Sony's skin
on here you can see it when the
applications go and sit there right
there they asking they've got sort of
their media scape as things on here no
kids to zoom it like we have on the
movie escape
you I on the Xperia Arc S firstly I've
been to do in the browser but we're on
the home screen to to not other than
that it's a pretty standard honeycomb
here you can see you know we're at home
you've got your back hero's your
multitasking right here two jumps at
different applications let's go ahead
and jump back into iOS a game crash
bandicoot this has support or
Playstation one agent certified it so
he's calling it that it can play a
pretty decent cache of ps1 games so if
we see in the tablet when I'm most
worried about is a design let's go ahead
and close this up let's take a quick
look at it one more time there's that
five megapixel camera that time was on
the back and I would sits on the front
it's pretty thin you can see it right
here in my hand I'm going to take this
standpoint that's where it locked up
charging port it does not charge with
micro USBs guy use a proprietary
charging port we have right here became
a unplug
there are few other doors here though
you can stick it though it gets open
with micro USB see that right there and
the volume up and down then you've got a
power and lock button
3.5 millimeter headset jack you've got
some microphone and then you've got
those hinges they're not got a very
chunky hinges though these feels pretty
light in the hands it's a very
interesting proposition
go ahead and answer Crash Bandicoot and
jump back home I want to know tablet you
guys are interested in are you excited
about this Sony Tablet gives it a four
factor that expect you it doesn't excite
you
I've got it here on the table and it's
feel like it's all that solid so you
might want to know there are some rubber
feet on there or hold it down really
hard you can see the piano black matte
finish around here this thing is turned
into an absolute fingerprint magnet I
will say don't wear in a lot of direct
light it's got great visibility so as I
move it all around I don't see any sort
of distortion at all so hats off to Sony
for doing that go ahead and jump back to
the web browser pinch-to-zoom
works very very well you know as you'd
expect from a pretty well specs modern
Android device so I'm John Renner
TechnoBuffalo that's been a first look
and hands-on at the brand new Sony
