to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
walk back to the pisode of ask the
Buffalo I'm Ernest John Rangers to show
her you could ask me any question that
you've thought of that's through
technology not technology whatever it
might be this is show you can ask it's a
lot about Apple this week's and you know
just announced a few new stuff but also
what it's like to be tech journalists
and where I might be in a few years so
we're gonna talk some iPhone 6 iPhone 6
plus
some Apple watch sprinkle in some Moto
360 in there talk about the best part
about being a tech reviewer and where I
see myself in ten years it's gonna get
started first question comes from
Twitter ads Danny 3d asks questions I
got quite a bit this week 6 or 6 plus
for you I have set it for a very very
long time I love mop phones big and I
cannot lie so 6 plus I mean for me but
of course we'll be testing both but if I
have to pick one that I'm gonna use
regularly the 6 plus will be the one
that will find its way into my pocket a
little pick up is a big portion in my
pocket that'll be the one that's gonna
live in there next one comes from at and
new Wragby 56 us at John 4 Lakers iPhone
5s vs. iPhone 6 which is a better bang
for the buck and to you I say dude dude
dude you know if it was the iphone 5 vs
iPhone 5s a big man touch ID big
differences though usually with Apple
from their number jumps so from four to
five so obviously big differences in the
phone's screen size aside you get a
little better specs better processor
you're gonna get some new features
crammed in there as well but for me the
screen size is a big enough reason to
upgrade anyway four inches is just too
tiny go ahead make your jokes oh wait
it's a good time to upgrade
that's all I got to say about it next
question comes from at Q 8 we who asks
at John 4 Lakers what is the best
SmartWatch is it the Apple watch or moto
360 will sir to you I say are reviewing
360 is coming out this week so you will
see the Apple watch we haven't tried yet
you know I had a chance to get some
hands-on time with it at the Apple event
but
change quite a bit from now until
whenever in 2015 what actually ships so
I can to that question I assumed we'll
see some new features announced as well
I will say though it's a pretty easy
gauge on the Moto 360 you can try any
Android wear device and see if you like
it or not and assume was going to be
that experience but just look way better
which I guess is kind of encapsulated my
review there the Apple watch so we
really don't know yet
it's got a cool pressure-sensitive
screen you can send your heartbeat to
someone if you want to you can draw a
little things on it which let's be
honest you're all going to use to draw
dirty pictures and say them with your
buddies during class but you know we'll
see as we get closer to release stop the

TechnoBuffalo back to the questions a
question comes from at AFG cr7 at john
for lakers what's the best part about
being a tech reviewer that is very easy
for me first the fact that I do this for
a living I still I wake up in the
morning whistling this is gonna be a
dream on to wake up so gonna be worked
at the job I hate I get a play with toys
for a living and I get to talk about it
and for whatever reason people care what
I have to say about it that is hands
down the best part for me I I can't say
this enough I get to live my dream I
talked about technology which I would do
for free every day anyway I love gadgets
I love interacting at the audience and
the fact that I get to do it for a job
is incredible to me last question comes
from at David banther who asked at
Jennifer liquors where do you see
yourself in 10 years I'll be old in 10
years
I just turned 34 I'll be 44 years old
that is old because I'm if you're older
than 44 I apologize you're plenty young
50 is the new 40 is what I hear in the
60s and you're 50 and and so forth
I hope I'm still the opportunity to do
this I hope Tecna Buffalo's grown to
wear I hope it can be hope I'm still
sitting here talking about tech that I
hope that you still care probably have a
few more kids I hope as well I hope I'm
healthy you know but I would live I'm
still sitting here in ten years I'll be
very very very happy
