Google knows that I think they're kind
of after changing it
I'm our first Center and this is the
google onhub the on hub is Google's
first foray into the connectivity space
and it's kind of a pretty one
the device itself is a sort of handsome
deep blue with a smooth outer finish
Google intended for this thing to not
get shoved into a closet or cabinet or
whatever and it really kind of shows
it's a pretty looking device it's got
this kind of gentle blue glowing ring up
at the top lets you know things are
going smoothly everything's coming right
along and you've also got a speaker
grille up at the top of the device as
well which you're gonna use for pairing
to your phone haven't seen it used for
much else just yet
that blue outer shell slides off to
reveal the inside of the device which
houses the port's that you would expect
from a modern router but we'll get to
which ones are there and aren't in a
moment on the back you're gonna find an
input for Ethernet but only one other
output for the Ethernet so if you've got
multiple devices that need a hard line
you're gonna have a little bit of a
tough choice to make you'll also see the
as of yet non-functional USB port which
again we'll get to in just a second the
on hub features a whopping 13 and 10a
antennas and 10 Moltres mold more than
one antenna and you can absolutely feel
it the on hubs range was fantastic our
our bedroom is through a wall and on the
other end of the apartment from the
router I had to airport extremes head up
set up in the apartment and I got rid of
both of them and replace them with the
on hub which was all the way on that far
end of the apartment worked no problem
did not need the airport extreme
repeater in the bedroom super super
happy about that our speed didn't change
all that much though the onhub touts
some really impressive intelligent 2.4
to 5 gigahertz frequencies so it's both
on one network and it'll intelligently
decide which device needs to be on which
frequency so you don't have to worry
about a separate 5 gigahertz network
like you do with a lot of routers the
speed tests on all of the devices that I
tested on were basically the same is
before but that's kind of a good thing
isn't it you know the speeds weren't any
worse and we were already getting decent
speed before the rain just really was
killing us
the major killer feature here with the
on hub is the on hub app though the app
lets users keep an eye on their home
network see kind of all their devices in
real time all their usage in real time
and even administer all the stuff that
you need to do you can do everything
right from the app it's even got a sweet
little floating action button right on
the home screen that'll let you run a
speed test right from there the apps
most useful feature is probably the
ability to prioritize devices for up to
four hours anywhere from one to four
hours prioritizing a device limit to all
other devices on the network to three up
and three down to ensure that the
prioritize device gets as much bandwidth
as possible worked perfectly fine in my
experience worked as expected well we
don't normally have issues at home with
streaming since we do have 50 megabits
down the onhub did ensure that the ps4
had a good consistent connection in
Netflix and I didn't notice any hiccups
at all whatsoever
now for the disappointing parts one
Ethernet port is just not enough it's a
really big downer you know like if it's
a modern router you better have more
than one port i plug in my smartthings
hub so knows my ps4 all plugged in hard
line directly to the router so one port
means I need to buy a $10 Ethernet
switch and if you've got a crowded
cabinet already that's not gonna do you
any favors plus that USB port doesn't
work yet
and without that working it's basically
a non-starter for me that's where I plug
in my Plex library I've got a huge
library of movies and TV shows and all
kinds of stuff on an external hard drive
and I plug it into my router that's just
I mean I can't use this device then the
port is gonna be enabled later this year
but that's like the number one reason
why I can't use the onhub at home as my
permanent router if it goes on sale I'd
say definitely pick one up if you only
have one device that needs to be
connected via a hard-line you know
that's totally a no-brainer
alternatively if you're really really
hard up for better range and throughput
the 200 bucks shouldn't break the bank
and if having more than one Ethernet
port is really that big of a deal for
you can go ahead and grab that switch
but the range of reception really are
fantastic on this thing so I'd say
or me pick it up anyway ride that wave
into the future
those are my thoughts on Google's onhub
their first router what do you guys
think do you think this is something
that you might actually want to purchase
200 bucks does seem a little bit steep
for a nonworking USB port and just one
Ethernet port but like I said man that
range damn range doh anyway thank you
