to you by Netflix and the letter D
welcome back to their pursuit of retinas
rancis the show where a rant rave get
all red-faced about something that's
bugging me in the wide world of
technology up this week we're gonna talk
about Android and why setting up a new
Android phone is such a pain in the butt
this is writers rants it's time to get
your antes in a bunch so the nature what
we do here at TechnoBuffalo is we test a
lot of phones and I use every phone that
I review as my daily driver for some
period of time five day seven days 10
days however long it might be in setting
up a brand new fresh out of the box
Android phone is a gigantic pain you've
ever used Android you know exactly what
I'm talking about
recently the sim reader in our HTC one
broke so HTC replaced it for sense it's
a new one and I was all excited cuz I
got to use HTC's awesome back up to
where it supposedly does full backups
restores that right to your phone not
the case the 18 team does not come with
HTC's backup installed on it you got a
download as an app and it just doesn't
work all that well as it does if it was
pre-installed right out of the box so it
got me thinking why is it so easy to
switch devices on iOS get such a
gigantic pain in the behind to do it on
Android so before all the routing folks
get out there and say John if you root
your phone you do it very easily I know
I've done it I've routed and I can do
backups very easily you can do full OS
backups you do it with CyanogenMod a ton
of others totally get that and
understand that but for the average user
who's not doing any sort of routing or
even jailbreaking on the iOS side
switching Android phones like gigantic
pen it's a big hindrance for people
upgrading and why people still stick
with iOS if you don't have another phone
to look at and reference how you like it
each phone is going to be different and
I find that to be very annoying and gets
a fundamental problem with Android one
of my wish list for Key Lime Pie was
that Android and Google in particular
would make skin simply that just the
skin the way skins are now it's sort of
a lightly used term it's really a full
different OEMs of Android released by
Samsung or HTC for cents there's really
no way to turn it off
I am hopeful I know this is pie in the
sky that would key
line PI Google say you know what really
gonna make these skins and we're gonna
release a full automated backup solution
not talking Google's weird backup
solution now it doesn't really back my
stuff up or sync stuff in the cloud I
want to be able to restore my phone
exactly the way it was on a new device
so if I switched from an HTC device with
samsung device I wanted to look the same
the icons can look different from sense
to touch was that's fine but everything
that is the same I want it to be I don't
understand why we can't do that yet now
try and look at offense perspective of a
layman someone who just bought a new
phone they walked into 18t t-mobile
Verizon Sprint sort of it might be
they've got let's say a galaxy s3 they
want to upgrade to a galaxy s4 and they
turn it on it looks nothing like their
old phone looked and they don't know how
to do it it'd be great if you could log
in say Oh restore from backup hit a
button and boom your phone looks exactly
the way it did on your old device
regardless of what previous manufacturer
you use I don't feel like I should have
to root or go that road in order to get
a backup I love Android androids my
preferred operating system but like most
things in life it's far from perfect and
I think that would be another step to
getting it towards that perfection and
to get it to be a step closer to the
incredible OS that I think you can be
selecting your guys thoughts what do you
think androids missing for me that is my
big one I did a whole video on key lime
pie features that I wanted to have you
can check look at that attacking a
buffalo comm suddenly exhale step away
and think our friends and sponsors at
netflix you know him you love them it is
the premier way to watch TV shows and
movies streaming directly to your TV

console at home Xbox 360 ps3 Nintendo
Wii or Wii U you can get Netflix you can
catch up on all the shows that you want
to watch have you heard a lot of good
things about Mad Men but you want to see
what happened in the first few seasons
