and much-hyped unboxing for you right
you guessed it 10s and 10's max Abba
waiting in line for better part of a
decade I've got a little little older
when we're tired but I'm back and we
finally have the phones to unbox in all
of our classics including the original
Senor stabby are here if you've been
watching TechnoBuffalo since the old
days since that original iPhone video
let us know in the comments and give the
video a thumbs up we're gonna start with
the 10s is a 256 and then we got the
same storage on the Macs both in gold so
they look different where should be like
an old school fun unboxing there's a
billion iPhone videos out there so we
thought you know why not have some fun
we're gonna doing a giveaway though of
either an iPhone 10s or the 10s Mac so
be sure to subscribe to notifications on
so you know when that is coming also I
kind of apples you know they got the
notch to the proud of the notch but
they're not just kind of hidden on the
box kind of found out a bit interesting
but the box is pretty much like the same
as last year's ten and here we've got
the 10s in gold and I will say we saw
one of these earlier the sides look
awesome in gold the back in person looks
a little kind of pinky but the sides are
absolutely awesome in case you want to
know what the cameras look like the
cameras are the big difference here
especially at the 10 and the 10s the
shot you see right now looking right at
me is actually being filmed with a 10 s
and the shot straight down is being
filmed with a 10 so you can see the
difference in the quality but again the
big difference here is the cameras in
the telephoto camera will give you about
twice as fast on the autofocus but the
telephoto camera is exactly the same
than both our 12 megapixel so this is
the 5.8 inch iPhone 10 it looks almost
identical say for the color to the
iPhone 10 but these next to each other
can't really tell the difference PPI is
the same here as well
actually the PPI is the same on both
phones is 458 so digging in in the box
we've got ear pods not air pods with the
lightning connector
and we got the this is not gonna charge
your phone overly fast but it is um it's
USB a in here
and then we've got a lightning cable
inside and the stuff that usually get in
a box hello it's also kind of
interesting it tells you place an iPhone
with screen facing up on air power or
she's certified wireless charger so
still hope that we will see air power
come out got a sim removal tool and the
box is always nice to have and flicker
Tory apple stickers so let's put all
this back and let's take a look at the
ten s max which kind of phone that I'm
most excited about it's the one that I'm
going with just because it's different
it's a 5.8 inch screen versus a 6.5 inch
screen on the Macs in case you were
wondering so open this sucker up so here
is a max person I've actually held a max
it feels like the plus models did again
the same gold color on the back but it
does feel good a big difference here
between you know the the six plus and
the other plus models that we've had a
plus is that it's edge to edge which is
really nice you get this bigger screen
size so again same stuff that we had
with the last phone the other difference
here you got louder speaker is a twelve
Bionic and then that kind of stuff but
nothing nothing giant just want to kind
of do a fun unboxing old-school style of
the iPhones again of course you're doing
reviews to do hands-on impressions
comparisons versus all the rest of that
stuff but again if you've been watching
for a while let us know in the comments
and give the video like we appreciate it
and giveaways coming up of one of these
phones so again subscribe tariff
occations on so you know when that is
coming well could have some fun is kind
of it felt like like an old friend
giving one of these old unboxing videos
again we've been done this in a very
very long time and I realized how young
I looked many years ago graer hairlines
moved back a little bit but I got the
same passion for tech my voice is a
little West monotone than it was back
then so do you guys pick up an iPhone 10
let us know you just like not to pick up
an iPhone maybe you're an Android person
let us know in the comments down below
we'll have some fun if you like these
old-school style of videos want to see
senior stabby make his comeback also let
us know hope you guys enjoyed I'm John
Rhett injure and for one last time
