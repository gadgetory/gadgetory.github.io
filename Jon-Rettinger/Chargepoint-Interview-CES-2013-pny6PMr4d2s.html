and I am here at the charge point booth
at CES 2013 and I have with me here the
president and CEO of charge point Pat
and we're going to talk about the charge
point network so Pat how big is the
network for charge point and and what do
we expect to see in the the growing
future so Roy right now we're coming up
on 11,000 charging ports that are
provisioned on the network in North
America alone we do have an
international presence to give you an
idea there are about 72,000 cars on the
road right now in the US as of the close
of the year that have a plug we should
see over a hundred thousand new cars
come on to the market next year
and if the charging stations continue to
grow proportional with the penetration
of those cars we should over double in
size just to have enough capacity to
have all those cars charged wow that's
great so I know that we saw the level
three Chargers and we know that network
is changing and evolving with newer cars
and newer technologies what what kind of
things should we expect and and what
happens if let's say the standard were
to change or the network were to change
well there's some good news for drivers
the standardization process that all of
the auto manufacturers have been working
on for a lot of years is sort of kind of
come down to two standards
there's the chidomo standard that many
Japanese automobile companies have on
their cars and then there's the SAE
combo connector that you're seeing come
out on most American manufacturer or
European manufacturer cars so it's very
likely that in any given market for the
foreseeable future there'll be no more
than two connector types that'll deal
with the DC charging you do see some
Chargers already like one from one of
our partners DBT that supports both the
SAE combo and the
dynamo connector in one charging station
it's kind of an either/or thing you can
pick either one in charge your car we
know that there's many players in the
market blink is another one GE what
differentiates charge points network
from say any of those competitors so I
mean there's a couple there's a couple
major things the most important is that
we focus primarily on our network not on
our hardware even though we make very
good hardware we are completely open
network and we have invited every
hardware manufacturer out there that
makes charging stations to bring their
hardware onto our network and be part of
the charge point offering if you look
around our booth here for example you'll
see a lot of hardware with logos on it
that are not ours not from charge point
so it's first it's the most open network
out there it's the only one that accepts
hardware from just about every vendor
out there now if you if you look at our
business model our business model is we
we like to tout ourselves as the largest
network of independently owned and
operated charging stations and that
independently owned and operated is
really crucial the perf the in the
business that decides to put these
stations in front of their business
decides the pricing model who can access
it etc so we're kind of the glue that
binds this community of charging
stations together but we allow the
freedom for the business owner that's
actually paid the money for the station
that is providing that service to their
drivers to set it up the way they want
but it's still for a driver one card so
your charge point card works anywhere
right one mobile app you know just one
account on line one
payment method all that sort of stuff so
we we keep it simple for drivers to be
very flexible for stationed arms
potentially I could go and purchase my
own charge point and be a part of the
network yes oh wow yeah so let's say you
owned a retail store you could decide
that you wanted to put eb charging out
in front you would either buy our
hardware or someone else's that was on
charge point we actually don't care
whatever works for you you would pay for
our services as a subscription on an
annual subscription you get a web portal
it basically lets you control the entire
charging experience for your customers
and decide who can use the station at
what time and how much they're charged
you hear that John we can get our own
charging station at the offices so if
I'm driving around my car my electric
car people stop me all the time and they
ask you know three questions it's always
the same three questions how do you like
it how long does it take to charge and
how much does it cost in terms of newer
technologies or expanding the range on
on vehicles how do you expect to change
your business model how do you expect to
help people move their cars faster along
so the next person can get in and in the
future yes so there's actually two
really good points there first of all is
as in in the near future batteries might
get a little bit bigger but I think the
auto manufacturers want to make the
price point a little more accessible so
as battery technology gets better
they'll more likely put the energy into
making the car cheaper at the same range
versus expanding the range although at
the high end of the product line I'm
sure people will give expanded range as
well there
strokes for different folks the
interesting part about how people drive
EVs is very different than gasoline cars
you do not wait to you're on e and then
go charge it up and then wait say you're
on a again so whether you have a battery
that goes 300 miles or 50 miles you're
gonna top it up everywhere you see a
plug and so the amount of time it's
going to take to get you back to full
isn't going to change much depending on
the capacity of your battery because
most of the time if you were full at
home and you showed up at work and you
had a 20-mile commute to work and you
plugged in at work you're going to put
20 miles worth of charge back in whether
your battery was a 300 mile battery or a
50 mile battery so that should change a
ton what will change I think from a
business model perspective is you're
just gonna see how much broader number
of V's out there at a much much broader
set of price points and you know
there'll be elements for long haul
charging in in highway applications
where they'll be more DC right now
there's very little DC charging deployed
there'll be some but I think the
workhorse will continue to be the level
2 chargers and most locations where
you're parked for an hour or more so
what's up next for a charge point what
do we expect to see in the next few
years well I think what you're going to
see is your game is first of all you're
going to see a lot more you've already
got a good percentage of the hardware
manufacturers on the network we're going
to continue to add more hardware
manufacturers to the charge point
network to give them more flexibility to
our station owners you're going to see a
lot more services for our drivers you're
going to see some new mobile
applications that I think are going to
have some great features you're going to
see just lots of features that are going
to help that driver find that station
get connected with the business owners
that have put those stations out in
front we've already released a feature
called charge point connections to allow
those business owners to connect to
those drivers and you know offer them
potentially charging perks and things
like that from patronizing those
businesses lots of stuff along those
lines
we're going to continue obviously to
support the deployments so we're gonna
we're going to expand internationally to
a larger degree than we've already
expanded so I think you should see some
pretty exciting things so thank you
again for taking time to meet with us
once again we're here at the charge
point booth at CES 2013 meeting with Pat
Romano from charge point the president
and CEO like to thank him for his time
check us out on TechnoBuffalo comm for
the latest CES 2013 news and we'll see
you soon
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
