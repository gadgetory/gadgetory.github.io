all of our Chinese speaking friends out
there I open and mangle that too badly
what is going on everybody this video is
going to serve two purposes one it's a
review of this here TV set su it's
kicking off my series on connected TV
the future of TV watching what is T
duh so a lot of the Netflix apps for
set-top boxes you can't search and pick
new content you have to manage your
queue somewhere else but the the app
here on the vizio set actually lets you
go through and pick new stuff to watch
which is really pretty cool so if I
wanted to watch let's say the office
which I'm not even this might actually
be in my queue although we already
watched whoops I hit the button twice
and wrong oh well could we go back one
let's go back one
what's retrieving some is we'll just let
it play so I'll charge up the center ok
there we go so this is not on my instant
queue right now as we've already seen
the whole BBC show but you can just go
through and add things right to your
queue which is very cool I think and you
can go through and pick which episode
you want to watch and again not all the
Netflix app Netflix apps let you do that
so plus 100 thongs up for vizio on this
functionality now the problem that I've
had with the Netflix app is that not on
it's not on all of the content but on
some of the content there have been lip
sync issues I've had lip sync issues
watching shows via Netflix streaming on
this TV and then I'll go and watch the
exact same show or the exact same movie
on my Tivo HD box / Netflix streaming
and not have the lip sync issues on the
TiVo so I'm not quite sure what the deal
is but sometimes it happens on here
sometimes it doesn't there's what we've
been watching Veronica Mars which look
man some of the teen shows I like
Veronica Mars not the best show ever but
it's addicting and that just been
consistent all the episodes no matter
how many times I start and stop there
have been problems with that yeah you
can see Ricky Gervais is yeah his mouth
and his voice are a little off sync and
it's not just because the clown knows
definitely some issues going on with the
lip-sync here which is too bad because
the rest of the functionality is really
nice the scanning forward and back works
very well three speeds the remotes
responsive the retrieval time generally
pretty good you know again my network
about 15 megabits per second sound
now the lip-sync looks to be a little
bit better so and the app very very nice
so that's one of the things with Netflix
you know the app itself great the UI
terrific I've had some issues though
with lip syncing being a little bit off
a TV Guide I mentioned you've got Amazon
video on demand you get a $5 free credit
when you link up your TV with your
account and Emmas I'm bidding on demand
we're not going to go too in depth on
what they offer and don't offer but one
thing to mention about Netflix you do
not get it's not free with the set the
app is free but you have to have a
Netflix account that supports streaming
media if you need to watch instantly
function if you want to use it on this
set that you have to pay for separately
eight bucks enough I believe is what it
costs here's the Amazon video on demand
let's go HD movie rentals see if you can
watch a little preview here so I don't
know assault can i what's going on here
today's top offers hit the button and i
watch the preview yeah watch the preview
so 5 bucks for an HD 24-hour rental SD
is 4 bucks buy the movie for $15 watch
the trail HD 5.1 the TV will do 5.1
surround sounds pass through it's got an
optical audio port in the back if you
want to do that so some of the streaming
services support it some don't obviously
with Amazon the HD videos look like they
do or at least some of them so here you
can see I've got a full connection
the quality is good you know the quality
looks solid for streaming media it was
pretty quick to come through again it's
going to depend on the speed of your
home network and your internet
connection so pretty good stuff the
other app that I found really
interesting is the Vudu app I'm kind of
new to using Vudu but so far from what
I've seen really really good really
compelling service again you know it's
video on-demand they offer full 1080p
video streaming video it'll do it on
this set but the 1080p is kind of you
know a little bit lost on a saw on a
screen this big so I think you know if
you've got a larger set up a whole home
theater set up to 1080p they call it HDX
very interesting let's see we'll do
let's do the same movie why not compare
apples to apples as they say we'll watch
the trailer free preview so it's
actually nice trailer so again five
dollars HD four dollars and SD fifteen
dollars to own but then the HDX the Full
1080p is six bucks one of those things
about voodoo is they pull in the Rotten
Tomatoes rating as well as their own
community rating which is cool and you
get a five dollar nine cent account
credit came with the TV which was also
kind of nice not a reason to buy a TV
set but you know kind of nice so I
actually did this before I don't know
why it's saying the first time but I did
have enough bandwidth for the HDX so
let's watch two minutes in the movie and
see what happens so this is downloading
the full or streaming I should say the
full 1080p experience color looks good
image quality is pretty good a little
bit of pixelation up real close
it's a compressed 1080p you know
so this isn't a trailer this is actually
a two-minute preview of the movie Oh see
I went past the two-minute park so it's
not gonna let me all right so there you
go kind of a quick look but the Vudu app
very nice and we can hit similar and it
gives me you know a lot of a lot of
options for other movies that can buy or
rent Julian PO I've never heard of
Julian PO mysterious Wanderers y'all
Christian Slater interesting some of the
other apps the web video is a little bit
limited it's it's a little there's no
YouTube app which is the one big thing
missing here you've got its got like rev
three it's got it's got some of the
network's like Showtime but the no
Showtime shows it's just you know just
kind of behind the scenes stuff and
trailers and that kind of thing
you know Fox WB similar kind of stuff a
lot of online video you've got Vimeo
you've got Reb 3 I went through this
before I didn't watch that much because
there wasn't all that much that was
compelling Howcast you know so this is
really kind of more hit or miss I don't
think it's a reason to get this set but
if you watch you know a lot of web TV
then you might find some stuff in there
of interest to you and then the Yahoo
widgets framework will also potentially
open up to you know other you know I
don't want to say hacking the TV set but
possibly some other other avenues for
getting online content via media will
let you play things through the USB port
it's got the blockbuster app now it's
got Hulu Plus and so there you go one
other thing I wanted to show and then
it's got the Twitter app which again you
know for reading your stream is one
thing for I don't even know if I signed
into the Twitter app yeah I did okay so
here no I didn't so here's the public
timeline you know so you can read tweets
but I can't imagine that you're really
going to want to do a lot of updating
your stream punching through the
virtual keyboard you know with the
remote so again you know you're gonna
have to punch through everything and
then we'll look real quick at Hulu Plus
again this is more content that you're
gonna have to pay to actually watch the
content but having the app on the device
you know built in is definitely pretty
nice so here we go we're gonna hit know
you got a referral code but doesn't
really help you get a one a free
one-week trial and we'll hit Family Guy
we'll just watch a little bit of this
just to show the the UI and the process
here of course you get at so you're
paying 8 bucks a month and you have to
watch ads which it is what it is I'm not
a big fan of that so I've only got SD
options on this clip but anyway there
you go
so overall you know my experience with
the set I think the the software they've
got going here is really nice again the
the lip sync issues with Netflix I found
to be a big pain because of the you know
three things I really wanted to watch
there were lip sync issues on two of
them
one of them I just watched anyway cuz
like I said I was sick in bed and so I
just I watched the characters eyes
instead of their mouths when when they
were talking and you know that made it
bearable the other one you know I was
able to watch it fine so it's on some
content not others but the UI for
Netflix is awesome it's one of the best
Netflix streaming experiences that I've
ever used off of a computer the other
functionality looks great Hulu Plus is
new to the new update Vudu I think is a
very cool service the 1080p again is a
little bit lost on a set this size for
your streaming medium that kind of thing
the flipside of the 1080p is that you
can use this as a computer monitor with
you know pretty good resolution so if
you're in a dorm room or a bedroom or an
office or some of that that you can kind
of have the dual functionality which is
cool then again if you're using this as
a computer monitor do you really need
the apps baked in because you could just
run them off your computer so you know
it is what it is I guess you could if
you're using the computer up close but
then you know you have a couch or your
bed or something and you want to like
kick back and just use the remote to
watch a video content so there you go
all in all with the set you know I think
for $200 the speakers are a big issue
otherwise picture quality is really
quite good and perform well for watching
other stuff just as issues with the
straining but off sale more like 270
$300 for a 22 inch set you know that's
kind of small the Senate replaced in
here was actually 23 inches and I
noticed the difference so and that set
also had better speakers so I don't know
for that much money you could look into
getting a LCD set that maybe wasn't
1080p didn't have the apps built in for
under 200 bucks and then you could get a
separate box with it I don't know the
convenience is nice though if you can
fire for $200 you know I just be aware
that Netflix lip syncing issue because
that's kind of an
if you watch a lot of Netflix like I do
there you go
it's the vizio razor series 22 inch LCD
LED edge backlit 1080p TV set with the
via built-in Internet apps
overall it's a reserved thumbs up with
some you know some issues like I just
described getting a thumbs down and it's
also the beginning of TechnoBuffalo
series on the future of TV all the
different ways you can watch TV at home
on the go over the Internet you know etc
etc much much more here on the channel
on YouTube youtube.com slash John for
Lakers guys the way YouTube does partner
