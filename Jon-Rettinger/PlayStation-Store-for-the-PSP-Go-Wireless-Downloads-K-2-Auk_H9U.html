to give you a walkthrough of the
PlayStation Store on the new PSP go this
is UMD less and it's got no physical
optical drive so the only way to really
get new content onto it it's either to
put it on manually from your computer or
to download it via Wi-Fi from the
PlayStation Store so the success of this
new PSP is really dependent on how good
the PlayStation Store is so I'll give
you some opinions as I walk you through
it but let's go ahead and get started so
here is the PlayStation Store we'll go
ahead and launch it up and for those you
that have a PlayStation 3 this is going
to look very familiar to you so you can
walk through and it's broken down into a
few categories right now wearing games
there's a video section as well which
I'll show you a little bit later it's
sectioned by new releases downloads
PSone classics PSP add-ons demos media
themes and view all so you can get brand
new PSP games from here on out all games
are released for the PSP will be
released in two formats digital and with
UMD suppose you that don't know um DS
those little weird sort of medias
looking things that shipped with older
versions of the PSP so there are a ton
of new releases that are available so
let's go ahead and take a look at one of
them for example here is Gran Turismo
and right now if I want to buy grant
threes mode will cost me $39.99 and the
way billing works need to set up an
account and it automatically charges you
it's a pretty seamless process actually
fills you that have used the PlayStation
3's PlayStation Network it works in much
the same way so this is 937 megabytes
and I've got a relatively fast Wi-Fi
connection here and I will tell you that
to download a 900 megabyte file it's
going to take you about 25 minutes once
you download that you're not in the
clear you actually have to install it as
well and to install that's going to take
you about another 10 minutes so it's
from no game to a new full game you're
looking at probably anywhere from a 30
to 40 minute process nothing that's that
but it's something that you need to be
aware of so you can view some pictures
of the game you can sort of learn more
about it let's go back and check out
some of the other new releases that they
have here and there really is a
relatively full catalog that launches
with the PSP go which is quite nice you
can see that there are over 126 games
that are right here and some of them
range in price from $1.99 all the way up
to $40 and the price for the new release
games are generally the same price as
what they would be for the UMD version
on the older PS PS now if you download a
game when your PSP crashes Soniya saying
that they will be a way for you to get
the game back on your new device so just
because you're only a digital content
you still are owning something something
to keep in mind let's go back and keep
walking so use all the new releases or
the ton of games you can download and
we're going to go back to downloaded
games and that's going to show you sort
of what you've what you downloaded and
here we've got downloadable games and
these is really a list of all the games
that you can download new releases PSP
add-ons and a ton of other content it's
broken up really nicely and pretty easy
to navigate
we got PSone classics these are games
that were playable on obviously the ps1
and then a ton of good ps1 games here
you know I didn't have a ps1 definitely
a lot of these games that I was a fan of
so here's blood omen
here's Castlevania and these games
generally run about 6 bucks you can see
these here are $5.99 and I do like how
they tell you the size of it so you can
anticipate how long your download time
is going to be this one here is 335
megabytes
I can say that's probably going to take
me about 12 minutes to download
something nice to keep in mind and all
the downloads go to the 16 gigabytes of
internal storage although after the OS
is on top of that you're only going to
get about 14 gigs you can also take
advantage of the expandable memory port
on the side and put into these much
memory as you'd like but for now 16 gigs
seems to be quite enough there are also
PSP add-ons and these are sort of using
Xbox you know what the Avatar add-ons
are
these are just sort of additions to to
the game sort of an extra level or two
but give maybe your character a green
hat there's nothing really that big here
but if you're into add-ons they are here
you've also got demos which is a really
cool feature for a mobile device so I
can actually go through and download
demos of new games I want to try that's
a feature that I really like on the Xbox
and the ps3 take a look at there you can
see demos from some of the new games so
if I want to say maybe play NBA ten and
go ahead and get the demo of that game
as well there's a rock band and go ahead
and download the demo of that there
really are a lot of demos and a lot of
the new release games have demos for the
PSP so you can give them a whirl before
you want to buy them and I think that's
going to be a huge success for the PSP
imagine sort of sitting in bed
downloading the demo reel if you like
the game and you can actually buy it
right on your device you don't have to
get up and go anywhere which is either a
great thing if you're a little bit lazy
or nice to you know convenience from a
convenient standpoint let's go ahead and
keep navigating through here
here's media this you can view movies
and TV shows that you have but we'll get
to the video side later
this right here is more a game related
media themes and wallpapers got what
you'd expect themes and wallpapers and
you can view all now one of the really
cool things I think about the PSP go is
in addition to being a fantastic game
device it also has a really solid video
library so you go to the top and go over
to video I think look at some of the
video content that we have here I've got
movies TV shows top TV episodes and rent
and you can actually rent movies right
onto your device let's check out some of
the new releases we'll do new release
movies it's either quite a ton year so
here's x-men origins Wolverine that one
was just released on DVD and blu-ray so
you can rent it either in the SD version
which is really the only way to to rent
it on here if you do it online so via
the ps3 you can get an HD version but
here it's only standard definition and
it's 399 - rent for
most movies you have to cart and you're
good to go but keep in mind the size is
a big deal this is one thousand seven
hundred and forty five megabytes so
that's going to take you quite a long
time to download just something to keep
in mind so we'll go back so some more
movies non-si all new releases but a ton
of movies we've got TV shows so here's
Hiro's actually a big fan of Heroes so I
can download actually full seasons and
watch them right on the PSP it's also
broken down by top movie downloads top
TV episodes and you can actually buy
these as well if you'd like so you can
you can own some movies although there's
actually much more to rent I think then
there is to own at least right now and
as a PSP go sort of build an audience
and Sony can gauge what people are
looking for this store is only going to
grow this is just sort of a quick
overview of what you get with the PSP go
and what the PlayStation Store looks
like overall I'm extremely impressed
with it it's quick its elegant easy to
navigate and things download considering
you're getting a full game over-the-air
sort of fast the install time was a bit
of a surprise I would expect them to
automatically be installed and they were
downloaded but that's not the case if
you are debating between the PSP go or
the PSP 3000 difference is going to come
to whether or not you want to own the
actual disc or not for me I like having
the smaller form factor and I like to be
able to debilitate to download things
just remotely right to the device so
it's really going to come down to a
matter of personal preference and
certainly both these have a different
look and feel this with a slide on
mechanism down below and the psp-3000
has the more traditional PSP design so
guys hope you enjoy it is going to be a
ton of more PSP go content so be sure to
stay tuned to the channel for that for
