the iPhone 10 as Mac so I got some
thoughts some of them are good some of
them are less good let me tell you about
it before it gets started
I want to thank audible to get your free
30-day trial go to audible.com slash
TechnoBuffalo or just text TechnoBuffalo
to 500 500 if you guys saw our retro
unboxing you saw that I got the gold
version the phones I'm surprised at how
pink the back looks it's not as true
gold did expect true Gold is definitely
the sides and I love the way the sides
of the phone look but the back a little
bit of a different color so bear that in
mind if if gold is your jam so a few
things are different with the phone
first the size I loved the size the
iPhone 10 and 10 s so this still feels
like a big phone which is okay if you
get big phone advantages things that you
would think would be here aren't here at
least aren't here yet side-by-side
multitasking for example things just
look big and blown up the output boot
logo looks huge apps you just see giant
err things I would like to have more
features that played into the larger
screen size least as of yet and they are
not here that makes what was really nice
to use one-handed phone kind of a nice
to use to edit phone so just bear that
in mind I got kind of hold with one hand
to swipe down now there are features
like reach ability and things here but I
don't really use them too much low key
feature that Apple put into the 10s and
10's max there's a lot more band support
in addition to gigabit LTE so my parents
live in between Hills and I never got
any cell service there I'm on t-mobile
but I went to my parents house with for
the first time with the 10s max I got
four bars of 4G I wasn't getting like
fast data speed draining but I could
definitely make phone calls so I wasn't
really nice to see huge improvement and
I went to the Rams football game over
the weekend then generally despite
having full service I can't upload
pictures it's hard for me to send tweets
and that kind of thing and I could do
that
without any issue with the 10s max that
was really nice to see but again it's
gonna vary on where you live in the
carrier but at least where I am and on
t-mobile I saw a nice difference I had a
weird Wi-Fi issue with my phone tuna
might be just my phone let me know in
the comments if you have the same issue
was forgetting Wi-Fi networks so I kept
it to my home network leave and come
back and it wouldn't reconnect itself
again that was kind of strange the
speaker's here also way louder than
latched and that was kind of nice to see
and Siri is way faster than before it's
not any better than it was before but it
is definitely faster than I've ever seen
on any iPhone it's hard to talk about
battery life and the four days up and
using the phone usually I'm using it
really hard so with the caveat to have
using the phone probably more than I
would after the first three days battery
life seems about the same as what I got
with the iPhone 10 not better like
apples claiming but again the first free
day is usually hitting the phone pretty
dang hard the cameras though is where
you see a giant difference and I still
maintain if you have an iPhone 10 you
could probably skip this generation but
it kind of fun anything older you will
really notice different especially when
it comes to the cameras the picture
quality is absolutely awesome the
front-facing camera really big
improvements here it does to do some
weird facial smoothing I'm not not the
same extent like Samsung does with
Beauty I'm over it looks like you just
think airbrush yourself but there's
definitely a little bit going on there I
love dynamic range the camera is two
pictures always look good the videos
look absolutely incredible I love the
camera on the iPhone 10s max and that
might be a reason you might consider
upgrading if you get if you have an
iPhone 10 I still skip it but the camera
is a big change here for was already a
really solid camera setup I haven't
noticed too much difference in the
performance with the eight twelve Bionic
and the additional RAM a fast phone
still seems like a faster own Apple kind
of being vertically integrated most
their phones are generally pretty quick
I was twelve I used it sort of
throughout all of its betas nothing here
is giant mean ooh I do really like the
shortcuts app I've use that quite a bit
I love the fact you can use third-party
password apps to fill passwords that is
an under-the-radar feature that is
absolutely awesome to have iOS 12 seems
like the phone itself it's a nice
evolution and makes a good OS family
even better alright so speaking of iOS
twelve my home screen I could try to
keep a little bit minimal and keep the
apps right there that I use all the time
and one app that's been there for the
better part of two years is audible I
use it all the time I've been on a John
Grisham kick recently I'm about a
quarter of the way through the
confession you can see all the books I
look
- over the years I went on a historical
fiction kick for a while there I loved
audible it's a great way to pass the
time in a commute when I take a walk to
the office when I try to work out
everybody's got a commute you can learn
something new you could listen to a book
you've been wanting to check out for a
while I think you guys should give it a
shot and also show some support for the
channel go to audible.com slash
TechnoBuffalo or even easier to just
tech the TechnoBuffalo - 500 500 you get
a 30-day free trial you can download an
audio book of your choice you can access
the two audible originals those are
exclusive audible content created by
really celebrated storytellers thinking
people like film makers journalists kind
of everyone in between I really love
audible and I'm not just saying that
come on to the video this is an app
again that's legitimately been on my
home street for two years I like it
thank you guys will to get a shot so a
lot of things still to go through as we
get to the review Benilde impressions
are generally pretty positive nothing
groundbreaking I wasn't expecting
something huge that I didn't see before
with the 10s or the 10s max it's a good
phone and it made a good phone even
better whether that's worth your a lot
of money that is yet to be seen again
our full review will be coming let us
know in the comments down below if you
want to see us check out anything in
particular until then I am John Randy
