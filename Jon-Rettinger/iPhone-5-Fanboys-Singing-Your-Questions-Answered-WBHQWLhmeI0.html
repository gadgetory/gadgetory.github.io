TechnoBuffalo here and i missed you it's
been a while since i was in front of the
camera four ish days and i am happy to
be back and I thought what better way to
come back from a nice little break then
by talking to you saying hi see what's
going on it ain't drinks up your
questions so up on the website we put up
a ask the Buffalo posts where you can
ask me anything you want and I will
answer it so I'm going to turn my head
yes direction when I keep it funky fresh
and casual I'm pointed out of screen you
can't see it right here I'm going to
read some questions and just answered
you guys could ask anything you want to
from tech to personal whatever it might
be and if you like this kind of video
segment let me know in the comments and
we'll keep doing regularly I'll do them
Noah do them maybe junkie will do them
uh we could serve all just keep the
lines of dialogue up to the flow and I
love to know sort of what kind of things
you guys you're looking for um just a
chance to talk you know it's fun I happy
to like you guys I'm so and I hope you
guys like me too all right that was so
all right so it's going some of the
questions I'm just going to read this
the names of the people you love to
comment on technobuffalo website I'm
just gonna pick some at random here I'll
user Josh just wrote question when we
have voice-activated technologies in our
homes I'm not sure what kind of voice
acted in technology you're talking about
things like that actually exist you
could say lights on and boom let's go on
you could say fireplace on if you have a
fireplace that will go on it's very
expensive technology though and maybe
you're referring to when is it going to
become cheaper hopefully soon all over
looking for inexpensive cool technology
might I recommend clap on the clapper um
all right hey John where the best ipad
game you've played since you've got one
um that is definitely the easiest
question to answer and it's probably the
simplest and perhaps most obvious Angry
Birds I'm an angry birds at
if you guys follow me on Twitter you'll
know that I'm also a bit of an insomniac
so when I'm not sleeping at night
generally I am killing pigs trying to
get eggs back and if you don't know the
context of angry birds that is a very
strange thing to say I realize them
let's see what else we're going to stass
a John what Mac web browser to use and
what is the best that's from Hull and
yah know a paul i use firefox has my
daily browser however i also have chrome
and safari installed on my map I do like
chrome i think is pretty fast but i've
just gotten used firefox over the years
let's sort of become my browser of
choice all right let's go ahead and go
on you think it's worth buying an iphone
4 now or waiting till I suppose an
iphone 5 um so against two different
questions there I don't know why I
pointed at the camera but I decided to
uh so iphone 4 on AT&amp;amp;T or iphone 4 on
verizon now it's probably fun to say
that not have to be like married to
becoming doo doo doo that was my
dramatic look um I you know if you've
waited this long T and iPhone
traditionally apples really cycles on a
yearly basis every june or july and
we're in january so that makes it
februari march april may june so we're
like right smack in the middle of the
release cycle so if you want the newest
latest phone it's an awesome phone
really not sure what the iphone 5 is
going to have other than maybe some
contactless payment probably more rain
and some other fun stuff probably
top-ups another video you know go ahead
and get it's really a personal question
if you've waited this long in your phone
works and probably wait another six
months and see what you can get at least
then you'll feel good you'll have the
newest phone for a year then you feel
bad again when in about six months after
that you start hitting rumors the new
phones unless you have unlimited pockets
it's going to be really hard to keep up
the latest technology iphone for now is
an awesome phone the questions for the
verizon folks who've been waiting very
very very patiently I'm very hand
animated today for their phone is it
worth waiting for perhaps an iphone 5
LTE version we don't have a release
cycle history to pull from for verizon
so the correct answer is um you know i
love to sort of say
give you advice but in all I want to see
anybody who gives you advice or anybody
who says otherwise is lying to you we
don't know we're speculating just like
everybody else the general thought and
the consensus is that we will see an LTE
iphone 5 or 4gs whatever they want to
call it probably 4G I guess it makes
sense in the june or july timeframe
released on both ET t and verizon but
that is just speculation alright so
let's go ahead and ask about some more
questions Patriots are best 83 what are
your thoughts about functionality of the
talked about 7 inch screen on the ipad 2
and how I didn't go translate I haven't
heard about 7 inch screen on the ipad 2
i'm going to be the same size so don't
know John what beauty is for making
TechnoBuffalo videos camera lighting
software etc i'm currently using a sony
HDR sr 11 to film my videos i'm hoping
an update tent that update that update
that to a newer camera I've had really
good luck with Sony cameras I know a lot
of my fellow tubers out there use DSLR
just for their videos I like a standard
video camera so that's what I'm
currently using I've had really good
luck for Sony in the past so I'll
probably stick with Sony or the next one
all right let's talk to nick alexander
what made you become interested in tech
reviewing ah the big answer to that is I
am a humongous nerd and if my nerd
glasses didn't give that away um you
know in all honesty when i was in middle
school high school college and after
whenever I would get stressed i wrote
about this in my top five way to know
you're a geek post i would just walk
around best buy it relaxed me just look
at technology and see what was out you
know I used to religiously it's
religiously is probably the right word
but regularly you know read all tech
blogs watch high tech videos I'm just
into technology i love it you know i
love or anything about it I don't know
why I just always resonated with me so
when I saw a maybe an opportunity to try
and get involved and sort of do
something which I thought was my dream
is my dream you know I tried to pursue
it and pursue it with everything
I could and every day I wake up with a
smile on my face knowing that I get a
talk about technology review technology
for a living i'm just a nerd who loves
tech and i'm just i I'm just happy that
I get to talk about it and somebody has
to listen to it so thank you for
indulging me I'll answer a few more
questions I don't know how long this is
going to get this video will there be a
console wars between the three DS and
the PSP two from Conroy first name
Connor lasting roi ah possibly you guys
want to see one we do have season two of
the console wars coming out done by the
man the myth the legend himself LP he is
coming at a retirement like rocky for
one final round of console wars action
might not be if I'm around maybe we'll
do rocky 6 um we don't have any on the
schedule for a DS vard whatever versus
PSP 2 3 DS vs PSP too but if you guys
want to see it perhaps you will those
products aren't released yet so we can't
really do a counselors on but once they
are out released and announced I guess
in the PSP 2 k's up perhaps we will all
right so let's talk about another one
will contain about 44 presidents in
order no I can probably barely named the
last six presidents daughter which is I
probably shouldn't admit on camera um I
love the new additions to TV when is
john from me God junk you going to do
live shows I may be a little junk you do
smile a show like him our very own and
editor-in-chief Sean piane asked who is
the de manha fighter of and the day man
clearly clearly fights the night man
nightman fun okay a bad always sunny
joke ah alright so gadget team if a
person is in the market for macbook pro
would be a good time to purchase right
now with Apple product it's very rarely
a good time to purchase rumors have
upgraded core chips making a waste
macbook pro so if you'd waited now and
you can wait another two months ish i
recommend deleting this is start i'll
make you Paul through question here
let's go to load more questions what
kind of music do you like from andy a
lot of people
one name uh-oh music right now on my
ipod which is also my phone I've got
just the beatles box at all that's it
that's why I listen to in the car I rock
out blue yellow submarine and makes me
feel happy what am I Drive yeah you can
picture me the shoulder thing like this
people look you like a crazy and they
look at me while driving at that red
light and I just wave and I looked even
more crazy okay let's keep sorry uh
let's keep going what is your favorite
bone of all the phones from logans 11 so
the king of all the phones i am an
iphone user i'm using the iphone since
first came out in two thousand seven
abeb not to say it's my favorite phone
at least for right now it's sort of the
best phone for me but the OS is becoming
increasingly stale and I've got one I
did that when I staring straight at the
motorola maker atrix rather coming out
for AT&amp;amp;T which i think is going to be my
new daily driver I was really enthralled
by the new 4g offerings a TTT is coming
out with Android offerings the AT&amp;amp;T and
verizon are coming out with in the very
near future so I'm looking at you
Thunderbolt I'm looking at you atrix I'm
looking at you unnamed the Samsung
device which probably needs a name
there's a lot of really cool android
devices coming out i think the next
phone that i use my daily driver
probably will be powered by this guy it
seemed right there that's an android guy
eating a technobuffalo guy if you like
that by the way if you look at
TechnoBuffalo icon scroll down to the
bottom there will be a wallpapers paid
you can get that image framing it for
you right there I also teach you two
more questions before I stop boring
everyone to death do you remember
meeting me at CES I talked to you about
my iphone app yes Jesse I do meeting it
i do remember meeting you it was a
pleasure ah let's see is it good time to
buy macbook pro me always answered that
one i love what you guys are doing with
technobuffalo are you going to be doing
mobile applications and this is the
question I get quite a bit yes yes and
yes if you go to technobuffalo com
on a mobile device right now you'll see
we have a mobile version it's a very
bare base mobile version right now but
first priority is to sort of juice of
that mobile version that you can access
from your web browser probably in the
next few weeks will start the celluloid
things new feature show up there just
kind of cool and then right after that
is development on mobile applications
primarily we will be focusing on iOS and
Android so stay tuned for down signups
on that last question and I don't know
why one means last question one more
question ah perhaps um of the Ford major
mobile operating system iOS Android
Windows Phone 7 and webos what you think
has the most promise for the future
which will prevail is the king of the
mobile market I drink crown for king I
would love to see webos and come back I
love bug alas it was really cool i love
the card interface but the keyboard on
the pre and the pre to was really hard
to use screen was too small milk quality
wasn't outstanding and the hardware
which was unfortunately powering a
pretty kick-ass operating system was
under powers that really didn't get the
market penetration not to mention there
was creepy commercials and only launched
on carrier I would love to see what the
lesson come back and that this
necessarily sure I think it's going to
happen I think it's always going to be a
dogfight between iOS and Android for
that number one spot now that iOS on
another carrier I think we're going to
go see those numbers kind of go ahead to
end so I think it's fun when the
companies compete like Google and Apple
other consumers with whether you are an
apple or whether or not you're like
Android it's great time these two
companies sort of going going
head-to-head and I do want to say it's
because II you use something that's
actually make you a fanboy at some point
you have to like something or you have
to be using something yet to just pick
one you can't carry two of everything so
I mean that's not these people are
screaming fanboy at each other um yessir
you use the supplement at your
preference does it mean that you dislike
something else you know I like hot
tamales as a candy but I also enjoy york
peppermint patties mr. Lee say if I went
to the store and picked one make the Hot
Tamales on one day that's are they hot
Molly's fanboy I might also be a york
peppermint patties fanboy I also liked
them both this looks really bad on
camera um so that is it this was the
asta buffalo super informal me just
wanted to chat talk to you say hi again
hi my friend right is that it was like a
super big wave um so Roy if you're
watching that was for you uh and I guys
hope you enjoyed check out another
addition I've asked the Buffalo coming
soon on technobuffalo and the Buffalo
does have been named by the way are new
to the site we did a contest to name the
Buffalo a while back his name is Shia
LaBeouf love which was always kind of
funny and maybe laughs so anyway that's
it nothing fancy jon rettinger
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video
