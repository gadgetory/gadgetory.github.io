test for you between the macbook pro and
the macbook the macbook pro are looking
at a two point five three gigahertz
processor obviously intel core 2 duo
with four gigabytes of ram the macbook
on the right hand side right there is
2.4 gigahertz with two gigabytes of ram
both are spitting 5400 RPM drives and
both are using the same nvidia graphics
card this is the macbook pro they leave
runs about seventeen hundred dollars and
the macbook is actually no longer
available at figuration it was the first
unibody model to come out it was a
higher-end that was offered so let's do
a speed test for boot up certain we
expect the macbook pro to be faster but
how much faster I suppose we'll see
MacBook Pro is obviously brand new it's
just an info review for a few days and
the macbook is just pushing a year old
but does have a fresh install of snow
leopard on it done just about a week or
so ago so let's turn these on and see
how much faster the macbook pro is then
the macbook so try and hit the power
button at the same time here without
getting my big face in the camera and
again obviously we're looking at the
macbook pro vs the macbook and there's
already a significant difference just
based in boot up time
and the macbook pro is all ready to go
the macbook is still booting so there's
definitely a difference with the macbook
pro in the macbook if i can't really
expect that from a newer higher spec
machine so let's do some basic stuff
let's open up a browser for example so
let's open up firefox and see how it
works on each so I've got Firefox here
in applications so we get it ready to go
there we'll get it ready to go on the
macbook pro and we will watch them at
the same time ok so just doing some
simple web browsing see if there's any
speed difference at all they're both
connected to the same Wi-Fi network so
certainly the macbook pro was a little
bit faster the screen brightness is
turned down a little bit let's turn it
up so you can sort of get a fair
comparison of the screens I will say
though about brightness for brightness
the older macbook it does appear to be a
little bit brighter brightness for both
are turned up all the way alright next
let's open up ital again I just want to
demonstrate some of the basic tasks that
you probably doing on a regular basis so
i'll open up ical on each and opens the
same time it's harder than you think
there we go well that wasn't so Fair but
it did open up quite quick so at the end
of the day the macbook pro is certainly
faster machine and just doing everyday
test you're going to notice a little bit
of speed improvements however when you
start doing some gaming if you'd like
whether you're going to run windows in
boot camp or virtualized via parallels
or vmware fusion that's what you're
really going to see the difference of
the speed in everyday tasks probably not
going to be that noticeable but it is
definitely there so just a real short
speed test hope you guys enjoy and i'll
have a few more macbook pro videos
coming up in the next few days before i
have to send the review unit back and
I'm guys hope you enjoy it for exclusive
