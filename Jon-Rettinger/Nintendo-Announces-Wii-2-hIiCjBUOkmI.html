TechnoBuffalo here and it is time for
some Nintendo Wii to wii HD news last
week I put out a video speculating about
what might be Nintendo's next-generation
console we now have just a teeny bit of
actual information Nintendo today this
is up on TechnoBuffalo put up a press
release on their Japanese site which
read to whom it may concern regarding
wees successor System Nintendo company
limited is decided to launch a 2012
system to succeed the wii which a
company has sold 86.0 ones over 86
million units on a consolidated shipment
basis which units launched in 2006 in
the end of march two thousand eleven we
will show a playable model the new
system announced more specifications at
the e3 expo which be held on june
seventh through ninth 2011 in los
angeles so a lot of reasons to get
excited about III we now looking at the
microphone 11 look at the camera have
some more information on what will be
the wii too which is supposedly
codenamed project cafe we also ran late
last week some images of what might be
project cafe so nintendo has sort of
gone on the record and saying there
hasn't been enough I'd adoption of 3d
television technologies to necessarily
make 3d be a big push behind an ex
console although they are promising some
sort of new innovation so what's being
speculated is that their controllers are
actually going to have screens inside of
them you can see it right here it's
going to push unique content directly to
those controllers initiative sort of
that new thing it's supposedly going to
have current generation HD graphics so
on par with the xbox 360 and the ps3
supposedly it's going to sell between
350 or 400 bucks so certainly higher
than the current generation we will
reflect the probably the increased
hardware costs reportedly be running
AMD's are 700 GPU architecture so a bit
of give it a little better graphics
anything currently running out there
there while pushing 1080p HD and will be
capable of stereoscopic 3d although the
TVs are going to have to have that
support as well original leak in the
Kings indicated system will be able to
stream content individual controllers
and some of them speculate the power of
the system would allow it to play
different games on multiple controllers
eliminating a common household argument
of who is really next in line to play
which is kind of neat to look at these
mock-ups here you can actually use this
as a portable console and get the game
sent right to it kind of interesting not
sure if it's going to be useful or not
but i will give nintendo this they do
have a history of innovating they have
brought really neat technology to the
mainstream currently motion gaming
existed before the wii but the we really
brought it to i think brought it to the
masses you know we had the was at the
eyetoy i think with the ps2 but it
didn't have the same adoption rate as
the wii and selling was it 80 odd
million consoles is very impressive so
what do you guys want to see you at the
next generation nintendo console I'm
open for HD and I'm hoping for more
third party game support I just wanted
to talk about this sort of an informal
video i think is really neat to to see
these new consoles coming out with
presumably the next xbox and next
playstation upcoming until a 2013 2014
time frame nintendo is definitely going
to have a tremendous head start on
what's going to be the next generation
game consoles i'm still kinda used to
saying next-gen for xbox 360 and ps3
those guys have been around for years
now so what do you guys want to see 3d
do you care not care do these weird cons
controllers with screens like
interesting to you you're going to hear
a lot about this project cafe coming is
it really going to be the wii 2 i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see in the next video goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
