TechnoBuffalo here I have had the
Samsung Galaxy s4 Google Play edition
for the better part of two days and I'm
using as my daily driver
I've really enjoyed using it but the big
question I had on my mind was how does
it compare to the regular carrier s4 so
I'm not gonna put these two guys
head-to-head in a full comparison
because there's really not that much to
show what I do want to talk about though
is a speed differences the performance
differences sort of overall performance
and experience between both these
devices let's get started so having both
these phones and white is gonna make it
super confusing depending on which one
is which but if my memory serves me
correctly the phone in my left hand is
the unlocked Google Play edition running
a very unskilled on nothing naked
Android 4.2.2
which means this guy right here is the
galaxy s4 this is a sprint version they
both have the same Snapdragon 600 chips
clocked at one point on gigahertz
they're both running Android 4.2.2 same
two gigs of ram same camera same 2600
milliamp hour battery same everything
except for the operating systems that
are on them and the skins that are on
top or the lack of skins in this case so
the first thing I wanted to do before I
get the personal opinions I was curious
with the benchmarks are going to be so I
picked three benchmarks No so the
obvious caveat here's benchmarks don't
carry everything they don't test
everything they don't show every aspect
of nuance of a phone so they can depend
on your personal usage but I did test
the three that most people used you know
the most often so we tested quadrant we
tested Geekbench and we tested 3d marks
with the ice storm game playing on it so
Before we jump into the results let's
play a game let's start with quadrant I
use quadrant and all my phones and it's
a little antiquated benchmarking tool
it's not the most accurate out there but
which one do you think got a higher
score the unlocked galaxy s4 Google Play
edition or the carrier version of the
galaxy s4 TouchWiz on top of it go well
if you were like me I fully expected the
unlocked Play edition phone to blow this
one away and I had to run the test
actually four separate times to make
sure what I was saying was correct the
TouchWiz version actually beats the
Google Play dish which is quite
surprising so the score I got on the
Google Play edition was eleven thousand
four hundred and seventy
four on the touchwiz phone it was 12,000
287 so that was kind of interesting so I
thought maybe we might be seeing a trend
is TouchWiz better optimized and
Google's own native operating system so
then we went to a geek bench same game
what do you think Google Play edition
TouchWiz which one was better well the
score on the unlocked Google Play
edition was three thousand two hundred
eighty five versus 3098 so Google Play
edition was better there and last but
definitely not least we've got 3d mark
with ice storm Google Play edition
eleven thousand eight seventy three
versus TouchWiz eleven thousand two
ninety three so out of two of the three
benchmarks that I did the unlocked
Google Play edition was faster so
alright that was kind of mathy and I
don't know maybe a little bit boring for
it let's talk about my experiences with
both so I used the Galaxy s4 from daily
driver for better part of three weeks
and then I switched over to the HTC one
so it's really excited to try sort of
naked unadulterated Android on this
incredible hardware so before everybody
gets in the comments saying you can read
and put the wrong one yes absolutely of
course you can do that this is the
experience that comes right out of the
box those aren't comfortable routing
don't want a route or just want the
unlocked device with the unlocked
baseband and the route just ready to go
for them this is going to be a really
good choice I love stock Android
I love stock injured with little
sprinkles and a cherry on top it runs so
buttery smooth on the Google Play
edition I love the fact that enough to
deal with any sort of annoying beeps and
Boop's and water droplets or any sort of
notifications that comes through I know
it's called be turned off but fury ate
me know sort of animations no carrier
bloatware I really liked
I love the default Mail app that comes
on Android and I love Android as Google
intended to be and I also like that
freaking photosphere is back here what
kind of annoyed me a bit though is the
camera interface on stock Android is
super clunky I don't like do you have to
sort of hit that wheel and move around I
can't tell if the icons mean so I
definitely prefer the camera interface
on the carrier version of the s4 but it
comes to everything else that's about
all I prefer the carrier version for I
have loved having stock Android the
biggest surprise to me has been battery
life so my general battery used
usually off the charger around 7:00 7:30
in the morning usually about 2 ish hours
of phone calls to emails being pulled
down and checked every 5 minutes some
heavy social media some really heavy web
browsing some video viewing on their by
time I put the phone back on the charger
night around 11:00 usually I'm at about
25 to 30 I've got about 15 percent more
battery than I had on TouchWiz version
on the Google Play edition it's the same
battery thing 2600 milliamp hour battery
in each so less resource-intensive
perhaps going over that TouchWiz needs
but it's been really nice to have it's
like I can easily go 2 days on this guy
I keep my brightness on about 80% so
that's been really surprising other
things I really like and just obviously
tweak and change these things on the
phone to make sure that you suit your
needs but out of the box I love that
holding down the home button gets me
right to Google now and doesn't have to
launch any of that s voice stuff which
is antiquated and doesn't really work
all that well for me anyway so that's
something else I really really enjoyed
overall though I had a very positive
experience with the Google Play edition
in fact I'm gonna keep it as my daily
driver Samsung's got a gorgeous screen
the hardware feels really nice and light
especially coming from the HTC One I
just really liked using it so if you
guys are baiting what phone you want you
don't know if you should go and you know
pick up a Galaxy s4 on contract or maybe
pay it out right you might want to look
at the Play Store and pick up one of
these guys are gonna be shipping out the
first batch on July 9th so very soon and
get your hands on one of these on your
own and for me I think it's probably
worth it so when you guys think I'd love
to hear your thoughts leave your
comments down below please give the
video a thumbs up we must definitely
appreciate it I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you next video
bye bye
