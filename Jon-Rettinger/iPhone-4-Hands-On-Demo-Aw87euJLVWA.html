the message likes one away but you can
see they're all lined up here so instead
of having to go up with you levels and
back down to the inbox you can see it's
all available there from the top level
and a universal inbox into an inbox for
you for the different mounts as well
then again will show up in our video but
you probably saw that all the icons up
really nice you can see a lot of detail
background there
this is also showing holders which is a
new feature if you want to set one up
like that and then drag an icon on do
another one
it makes one called it travel that's
clever and you can dump more stuff in or
back out like Steve shipment you know
you can also put a folder down into the
end there and then wherever you go you
can have a access to you know some key
apps and
well so we have ibex in the iBooks for
iPhone so there's the books you have
downloaded I'm making some a new feature
of objects on iPad 2 is you can go to
find bookmarks or highlighted areas that
you sound so here's a highlight that I
made earlier today you can see that
he's gonna really be back good here's a
note we can highlight some text and put
a note and you can also set a bookmark
for any page you want to get to with
mark this page you can go like that and
then if you get back out in the bookmark
if you have
we're set up on both devices you can
it'll sync between all your devices
and highlights another new feature here
is that we support with PDFs in the
bookshelf here it's really nice right
but that's gonna be menus here
the state of seafood so that's a new
feature yes what else we got oh I'll
show you multitask
so somewhere on here we have Pandora I
miss it
Pandora
okay so before you could be playing a
radio station and when you got out of it
the music would stop time but now with
multitasking we can click down here
here's the interface for multitasking or
you can put out and the music will keep
playing in the background
and you can do something else if you
want to get back to here you can scroll
over and here's music controls off the
left side you can hear this on your
video you can started to stop about and
so this will be the controls for any
kind of audio that happens to be going
on also pressure would work for a
life-changer iPod yeah well you know the
iPod iPad as a physical switch for
locking it to a portrait or landscape
hardware-wise what is this at the top
right here the little grate or a pair
right above a guru speaker oh I think is
that when the proximity sensor proximity
sensor is right here
yeah proximity sensor so it makes it the
screen turn off when you clear up your
face
that one's hard to see on the black one
because it kind of disappears and so
we've got a front and rear camera you
can take a picture this away or use this
icon here to switch to the other one and
to see yourself below
if we go this way you can press this
button to turn on have the flash be on
the flash this way it's good all right
there is that some of the new stuff
thank you
yeah you're welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
