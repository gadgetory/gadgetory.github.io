unboxing for you of the blackberry curve
8900 for AT&amp;amp;T this will run you $1.99
after hundred dollar mail-in rebate on a
two-year contract now we've seen this
device for t-mobile this is the 18 t
variant this slots in right below the
bold it lacks 3G but it does have the
bold high-res display and a little
different keyboard layout as you guys
will see in addition to Wi-Fi and GPS
let's go ahead and dig in and see what
we got
couldn't hack it open that's some
suppressed material lift the box itself
here you throw that off to the side
alright so here is the blackberry curve
8900 it certainly looks relatively
similar to t-mobile's offering but att's
network and some of the bundle options
in here make it a very different phone
so it's got Wi-Fi I letting you know
that as a quad-band edge phones you can
use it anywhere in the world obviously
since it's a blackberry it does email
probably the best out there and it has a
GPS tell you what's in the box we're
gonna see those in a minute let's take a
look at some of the specs quad band edge
like I mentioned 4.2 nine by 2.3 six by
0.5 three inches weighs three point
eight seven ounces it's got a relatively
capable 512 megahertz processor talktime
they're saying is up to five and a half
hours and standby time up to 15 days if
you get that high standby time when
you're not connected to a 3G network
which is certainly a battery suckle got
a high resolution 480 by 360 pixel color
display which is actually very nice 256
megabytes of flash memory external micro
sd Wi-Fi with 802 11 B and G and
built-in GPS and the rest of the
BlackBerry features that people love
blackberry messenger and the awesome
email client let's go ahead and dig in
and see what we got here
and this was just released about a week
and a half to two weeks ago
the blackberry curve 8900 getting
started guide Blackbird user tools this
has the desktop management software on
it important information about hearing
aid compliance ratings here's the phone
as usual will push that off to the side
for just a second and see what's under
them we've got a little slip case let's
see if it's leather or what it's made
out of it is not a leather case but it's
a pseudo leather case and this has a
built-in magnet so when you slide your
device and automatically will turn off
the screen which is very nice but it
does not have the holster so it's not
going on your belt we have a USB key
looks like they are using micro USB with
this device there's a standard here is a
pair of stereo headphones with a 3.5
millimeter headset jack since the device
has that and just your standard wall
charger box let's take a look at the
actual phone here we go initially is a
it's a very nice looking phone it's got
a very nice weight to it and have to it
he's like the batteries already in there
so here it is it's got your full
front-facing qwerty keyboard with your
typical array of blackberry keys your
send button your BlackBerry button your
scroll ball that you can push into
select back button end button and you've
got all of the rest of your hotkeys that
you're used to on a blackberry
then push the camera in just a little
bit more on the left side of the device
you've got a programmable
excuse me a programmable hard button and
on the right side you've got your volume
rocker up and down another programmable
button your micro USB port your 3.5
millimeter headset jack the back of the
device has that pseudo metal feel that's
actually plastic flanked by a 3.2
megapixel camera with flash but no
self-portrait mirror so let's go ahead
peel off the front plastic and we'll
power this thing on and see what it
looks like
does only plastic that was on there
let's go ahead and turn this on he
turned on by using the and a button and
one thing I like about black burgers
they are very quick on I let's see
there's a SIM card in here say the
battery's about to die no there is a SIM
card in the device and you get that bold
esque interface sort of the new
BlackBerry OS and the high-res screen
does look very nice so as I do with most
phones I'll use this for a week or so
and give you guys a full review and see
how it compares to the other phones and
AT&amp;amp;T stable and compares to the other
blackberry curve 8900 out there and I
hope you enjoy for exclusive content be
sure to follow me on Twitter twitter.com
slash John for Lakers I'll see you guys
in the next one buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
