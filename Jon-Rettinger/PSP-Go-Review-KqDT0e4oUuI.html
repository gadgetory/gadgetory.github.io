long overdue review for you of the PSP
go from sony this sucker is going to run
you 250 dollars or - $49.99 what's new
and revolutionary about this is that
Sony is taking the portable gaming
console lease the dedicated portable
gaming console to what I consider to be
the next generation that's relying
completely on a digital download
distribution system gone are the optical
UMD discs that were found on the PSP
1000 2000 3000 instead this relies on a
newly revamped PlayStation Store for
download of games so any new releases
that comes out will be released in
tandem with the PSP 3000 so you go to
get a physical UMD disk for the older
models and the new downloads will be
available on the store so that's sort of
positive and negative you can download
games in one of actually three ways you
can download them directly to the advice
via Wi-Fi you can download them on your
computer and then trench them over or
you can actually download them on your
Pillai station three if you have one and
trench them over to the device as well
so three different ways I think for the
most part you're going to be relying on
Wi-Fi on your device so you need to make
sure you have a quick enough connection
I ran a test to download about a gig
game took about 15 minutes and then
after that to install it looking at
again another 15 to 20 minutes so from
deciding you want to game to getting a
game looking at probably close to a 30
to 45 minutes depending on the size and
network speed it's definitely something
to keep in mind so let's talk about the
design of the PSP go everything about it
is completely smaller than the outgoing
PSP 3000 and outgoing I should clarify
the ps3 3000 is going to be sold in
tandem with the PSP go everything is
quite smaller and experienced a complete
redesign with that redesign you have
brand new controls so you've got your
typical d-pad but your analog stick is
moved to what I consider to be a very
awkward position right to the right of
that d-pad when you're trying to play
game feels a little bit cramped and a
little bit stiff it's not nearly as
natural as the psp-3000 was with the
d-pad on the other side of screen and
analog stick right next to it there's a
bigger room to hold your hands and
that's certainly a victim of size so
speaking of size and construction about
this everything about it is very thin
and like I said completely redesigned
and with that complete redesign you lose
the ability to access any of the older
PSP accessories so this is going to need
a completely new accessory line
something to keep in mind so with any
slider whether it's a phone or in this
case a gaming device it's always a
little bit of concern about the sliding
mechanism how it's going to hold up with
abuse over the years what was sliding
this up I can tell you right now that I
am NOT encouraged by the build quality
even they giving this a little bit of a
shake I don't know if you can hear that
but the screen has a lot of give back
and forth and I definitely would be
worried that the screen could crack or
fall off after some extended use if your
gaming and you're holding it in academia
op it and it falls on the screen I think
you're definitely going to have a broken
device on your hands so that's just
speculation but I'm not overly impressed
with the build quality of the PSP go
battery life is going to be just about
the same as the PSP 3000 the claim
you're going to get about five hours of
gaming which I got and I think was about
accurate and pretty fair you're getting
the same resolution screen as the PSP
3000 but are getting a little bit
smaller size you're not losing out on
any pixels you're just dealing with a
smaller screen I did a full video
demonstration of PlayStation Store so
you can check that out if you want to
know how to download games I'll put a
link to it in the sidebar in case you
are interested so what I recommend the
PSP go well yes and no I recommend it if
you really want to be on the cutting
edge and you are comfortable relying on
digital distribution and no physical
media if you're not comfortable I think
having a physical disc is probably at
least at this juncture the appropriate
way to go if you look at recent examples
for example thinking of t-mobile
Sidekick it's a phone where all the
device man from
and is stored online and downloaded
t-mobile lost although users information
I'd be concerned that if I spent
hundreds and hundreds of dollars
downloading games right onto my PSP go
and if it broke or had to send it back
to Sony that perhaps I could lose those
games Sony's claiming that's not the
case but I'm still a little bit
skeptical there's no doubt that digital
distribution is going to be the future
and Sony is definitely leading the way
by relying on that with the PSP go I
just don't feel like the infrastructure
is there quite yet so two new PSP buyers
save the money go buy the PSP 3000 comes
in about 140 bucks you're going to save
you know probably close to $100 not only
that games that are available for
download are not discounted for example
you can go to your local Best Buy Target
or Walmart and you can find PSP games
that are discounted right by that store
so you can get a new game for 10 or $15
off we're here you're stuck with Sony's
pricing another downside of the PSP Go
which I assume will be rectified later
on this is the Sony's PlayStation
Portable has a huge gaming library PSP
games been released for years and
unfortunately all of those games are not
available as of now in the PS
PlayStation Store which is quite
disappointing so if there's an older
game that you want and I can be able to
play it on the PSP go at least for right
now certainly that should change as the
store matures so overall it's a good
device that does exactly what I expected
it to network speeds were fast
video playback was fantastic I was able
to show pictures and does a lot of
little things you also get these mini
games that somebody's calling
PlayStation Mini is quite obviously but
I can't wholeheartedly recommend the PSP
go I think you're better off saving your
money and getting a PSP 3000 which i
think is a fantastic device as well so
do you agree or disagree or is the PSP
go and if something are going to run out
and go get anyway or are you going to
look at the ps3 3000 or you're going to
wait to see how the go platform matures
certainly there will be a PSP go mm at
some point when they update the specs
and perhaps improve build quality but
that's just speculation
so text or video response and kind of
curious to what you guys have to say
