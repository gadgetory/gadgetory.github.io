Lakers khamir with a browser speed
comparison for you of the iPhone 3G and
the t-mobile g1 both are running 3G
networks the iPhone here just has two
bars of 3G and the G one actually has
four bars of 3G but it should still be a
relatively fair comparison so I'm gonna
go ahead and low it up John for Lakers
combi we'll check network speed and
rendering so without any further ado
let's go ahead and get the started we'll
start on both at the same time there's
John for Lakers I'll release my finger
alright and we are off like the G ones
got it well iPhone caught up G ones
loaded the header and the iPhone has
loaded the context of the page looks to
be neck-and-neck actually still going
alright the G one is done and now the
iPhone is done so just a little bit
behind not far I did hit the G one just
a second before the iPhone so there was
relatively close so let's check default
rendering here the iPhones are very
familiar browser you're probably all
seen it renders it immediately in a web
view format so you can see all the text
right here and it looks just as it would
on a computer and your zoom is done by a
double tap to zoom in double tap to zoom
out and you also have the pinch zoom and
pinch zoom out and you can pan around
with your finger so here on the g1
it actually loaded the page in a
relatively zoomed format but it did show
it with just the text right here so it
actually zoomed in on just the text and
left the images and such to the side and
scrolling is done the same way on the
iPhone nice and smooth no delay and it's
a flick scrolling so it keeps going
after you lift up your finger and the
zoom is done with this plus and minus
arrows here so you can zoom in zoom out
you tap the screen the arrows will show
up and I can zoom out with those arrows
the zooming is not as fluid as the
iPhone but it is definitely usable and
actually is very nice
now the g1 has something cool that the
iPhone doesn't have in the bottom right
hand corner here you have these little
arrows and if you click those arrows you
get a little window sorry I'm looking at
an angle your eye didn't quite click it
there we go you get a little window
right here and you can move that a
little magnifying glass to move it
anywhere you want let's move it over
those bars when you let go it zooms in
right on that area it actually is very
cool and it's not so much of a gimmick I
actually found myself using it so very
impressive a nice little feature that
Google has added there also one cool
feature that is on the g1 let me go
ahead and show you guys actually has
Windows similar to what's on Chrome so
you can have different windows open at
the same time and you can go back and
forth the iPhone has a tabbed interface
or actually a multiple window interface
as well you can scroll back and forth
through new windows hit new page hit the
window button hit the window button and
you can go back and forth kind of doing
one page at a time
here you get a layout where you can view
four at a time just different ways to do
the same thing six half dozen have
another I'm actually very impressed with
the browser on the g1 it actually is the
most full-featured user-friendly browser
I've seen on any non iPhone or not Apple
made device certainly kudos to Google
for putting out such a stellar browsing
centrosymmetric device I use the browser
a lot and I am able to use the g1 just
as I would my iPhone which is my primary
daily driver certainly give them a big
credit anyway guys it's a real short
video comparing browser speeds I hope
you enjoyed and I will see you guys in
the next video bye bye if you want some
exclusive content be sure to follow me
