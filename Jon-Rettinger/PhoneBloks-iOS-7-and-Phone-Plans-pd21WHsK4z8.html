to you by full sail university hello
internet and welcome back to another
episode of ask the Buffalo the show
where you can ask me ashley scott that
any question you might have from the
wide world of technology every tuesday
we put up a call for questions on
TechnoBuffalo calm you can leave your
question in that post comments otherwise
you can send them to me anytime of the
day or night at TechnoBuffalo or at
ashley escaped on twitter just use the
hashtag ask the be so i can see it and
usually answer between three and five
questions every episode let's get
answering this is ask the buffalo
twitter user fayez Helani asks hey what
do you think about the phonebloks
concept will they become real could they
really be useful Thanks well I think
phonebloks is a really nice idea think
idealistically yes it would of course be
great to sort of put together your
phones and have this sort of motherboard
in the middle and then you sandwich
everything together with your favorite
parts idealistically great idea
unfortunately I think realistically it's
not exactly a great plan because here's
a couple of hurdles that you're gonna
have to get through you're gonna have to
get through OEMs making parts for this
so we'll I'd say you want a Lumia camera
so well now nokia has to make a camera
that is compatible with that in addition
to having those pieces you also need to
have a software kit that's going to be
able to be programmed to recognize all
of those parts really at the end of the
day I think that it's a really good idea
but unfortunately I don't think we'll be
seeing anything like that in your future
however I do think that at some point in
our lives putting together a cell phone
is going to be the same type of process
as building your own desktop computer
who knows maybe we'll use a linux OS or
something that's also open source you
could use Android to build your phone so
it'll be a really interesting thing to
see if it happens at any point but I
don't know that foam blocks is something
that will come to pass officially
twitter user demerit says how important
is iOS 7 adoption to Apple well they
drop support quickly for older versions
or do they care I think that we know
that by iOS 7 you can't use
with some older devices so that's
something that you have to think about
if you've got a first-generation iPad
you're not going to be able to use iOS 7
if you have an older iphone 3gs or
earlier you can't use it then again the
thing is is to move forward I think
Apple and every other OEM whether it's
Android Windows Phone or other
understands that at some point you have
to drop older supports so for example
with the Xbox a lot of people were
really upset that it doesn't support
backwards compatibility but on that same
note don't we want to move forward I
mean it's a sacrifice to be made but at
the end of the day I would rather go
forward and have more bells and whistles
and amazing things on the device itself
as opposed to saying okay well I can
play my old games on this when you
remember that the xbox 360 is 10 years
old so I don't think iOS 7 adoption is
that important Apple I mean obviously
they have already surpassed the most
recent version of Android adoption just
because it's easier for them to push
that update I think they just say hey
here's the software take it or leave it
Daniel asks what are some good prepaid
cell phone plans I'm starting to price
smartphone plans which is hard because
I'm not on a family plan just wondering
what you recommend Thanks my
recommendation is actually something
that I've recommended quite a few people
recently a tmobile actually has a
prepaid plan it's kind of hidden on the
website 30 bucks a month you get a lot
of data you get unlimited data it's a
whole bunch of data or up to I think
it's like up to five gigs before they
start throttling you um and it's 30
bucks a month and you get like a hundred
minutes I'm not one who uses my phone to
talk a lot I just use data all the time
so it's a great plan for anybody who
doesn't really use their phone as a
phone or if you have a device that
supports Wi-Fi calling that's another
thing that you could totally use on
tmobile i'm so that one's really good
and then AT&amp;amp;T also has a pretty good
prepaid plan but it just depends on what
your service is like in your area so i
would just poke around I really like
t-mobile's prepaid that 30 bucks a month
is a really good little sim card and
obviously AT&amp;amp;T has it has a pretty
decent one too lastly josh asks what do
you do with your old iOS devices when
you upgrade your phone or tablet to the
latest and greatest well two things if
it's really
recent for example the iphone 5s i will
be picking up our I've already picked up
at this point in the game hopefully
fingers crossed I sold my iphone 5 to
somebody on craigslist put it up on
craigslist sold it same day super easy
cash in hand able to pay off my phone
again like I kind of use that to sort of
subsidize my own devices if that makes
sense but if I have anything that I
really am like well I don't know that
will get a lot of money out of this and
someone in my family can use it I will
give it to someone in my family I know
that many members of my family have have
benefited from the hand-me-down Ashley
asked either program the technology
program that that I run it always makes
me feel like a little Oprah to be able
to like give somebody something really
cool piece of technology so yeah I so
that's what I like to do and sometimes
I'll even you know give a phone away on
a podcast or something like that I gotta
interrupt this episode for a quick
little shout-out to full sail university
obviously apps are huge they're
everywhere and we've all had those
little ideas that make you say I should
totally build that app right while Full
Sail University's online mobile
development bachelor's degree program
can teach you how to make an app from
concept to post launch marketing even
better you do the whole thing from the
comfort of your own home via full sales
online education platform with full
sails mobile dev program you learn both
sides of app development for iOS and
Android creating your app with advanced
programming languages and then launching
and managing the business of your app
once it's complete but Ashley you say I
don't have a good enough computer to run
lines of advanced code and I can't
afford all that expensive software you
know what that's okay because full sales
project launch box program gives
students a macbook pro preloaded with
industry software plus iOS and Android
devices to test your app on now if
you're ready to make that killer app and
you're interested in learning more about
full sales online degree program head
over to full sail edu slash
