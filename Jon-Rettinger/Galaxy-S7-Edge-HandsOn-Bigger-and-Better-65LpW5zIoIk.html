from TechnoBuffalo here we are at Mobile
World Congress 2016 take a look at the
latest from Samsung
this is the now larger galaxy s7 edge
packing very similar specs to the galaxy
s7 which we also did a hands-on video
you should click here and watch this
afterwards so what's new with the galaxy
s7 edge well for starters it's gotten
bigger it is now five point five inches
curved cut with it's beautiful 2560 by
1440 pixel display any available in
black onyx my favorite gold and also new
this year is silver aside from the
larger size this thing is now ip68 water
and dust resistance so can out go in
five feet of water for up to 30 minutes
which is pretty impressive for a device
we usually see an ip67 but it's it's one
IP better so it'll be more waterproofing
well the big features people have been
missing with last gens phone is
expandable storage and it is back
supported for up to 200 gig microSD card
support for now but Samsung says build
upgrades up to higher capacity when it's
made available because you can put an
external card 32 gigs of storage is now
going to be standard at least in the US
on the camera front samsung brought
their big guns is a 12 megapixel dual
pixel sensor has fully been using DSLRs
it's got a brighter F 1.7 aperture lens
with larger 1.4 micron pixels but that's
give me three of those things are gonna
autofocus very very fast it's also gonna
capture 95 percent more light than the
last gens x6 with each camera pixel of
56 percent of the larger but John and
what about performance versus the last
gen well I'm gonna tell you the CPU is
30% faster and the GPU is sixty four
percent faster than the last gen s6 edge
batteries also bigger this time around
we also now have the latest fast
charging Texas in traduced in the note 5
and galaxy s6 edge+ so it'll charge
super fast
another cool improvement we now have an
always-on display will show things like
notifications calendar it precise it
really any way you want we're still
learning all the release information and
pricing but expect it to be available
very soon on every major carrier
the us okay I think about the Galaxy s7
edge is a bigger size more appealing QQ
not waste get your Android loving hands
on that beautiful Kirby screen want to
hear your thoughts on it 50 video a
thumbs up but I'd appreciate it until
next time I am John rent your protect no
Buffalo talk to you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
