to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys the mark and Sangan from
TechnoBuffalo and today we're gonna be
showing you how to install oxygen OS on
your oneplus one using a Mac if you're
on Windows there will be instructions
down below on how to properly flash
oxygen OS yesterday we give you a brief
overview of what's new in oxygen OS so
if you guys haven't seen that video yet
check out the links down below
now the install process is fairly easy
you should be done in about 25 to 30
minutes so step 1 make sure you've
installed a adb drivers for your Mac or
Windows machine just download the file
which you can find in the video
description extract an Android dot zip
file and place that Android folder on
your desktop now open up terminal and
type CD space desktop slash Android just
like how you're seeing it on-screen
next up is to install the ADB and
fastboot files so type in your command
prompt or terminal dot forward slash adb
- install - mac sh now of course this
will be different if you're using a
Windows machine step 2 is to download
the oxygen OS zip file and that's warp
custom recovery image file which you can
find in the video description below
place a tour of custom recovery image
file along with the fastboot and adb
files inside the Mac folder and then
transfer the oxygen OS flashable dot zip
file to your oneplus ones download
folder by using an app called Android
file transfer step three is to enable
USB debugging and uncheck the update CM
recovery let's access this on your
oneplus go to your settings about phone
click the build number until the
developer option is enabled going to
developer options and turn on USB
debugging and uncheck the update CM
recovery step force unlock your
bootloader turn off your device and boot
it up into fastboot mode by holding down
the volume up and power button for a few
seconds until you see fastboot mode on
your screen plug in your device and go
back to the terminal window and type in
dot forward slash fastboot space om
space unlock just like how you're seeing
it on screen now this will reboot and
wipe your oneplus one automatically so
you'll need to set up the device again
step 5 is to re-enable USB debugging and
unchecking update CM recovery turn off
the device and boot it up into fastboot
mode again plug in your device and this
is where we can install the twerp
some recovery image file go into your
terminal window and type in CD space
desktop / Android / Mac and once you're
inside the Mac folder type in dot
forward slash fast boot space flash
space recovery Bay's TW and press tab
and it should automatically fill the
file name for you but in case it doesn't
make sure the file names are the exact
same now once you've done that reboot
the device by typing in dot forward
slash fast boot space reboot now after
that's done you should have a custom
recovery installed on your oneplus one
step 6 boot into recovery mode by
holding down both the volume down key
and the power button and once you're
inside the custom recovery first thing
you want to do is reset your device now
again you'll lose all your data so make
sure you backed up everything or an
important stuff that you don't want to
lose after you're done resetting your
device go to install go to downloads and
click the oxygen OS file and then swipe
to flash
now after your flashes reboot your
device and you now have oxygen OS on
your oneplus one so for those who are
wondering if you'll be able to go back
to using CyanogenMod well the answer is
yes although you will have to reflash
the rom in order to get it up and
running on your oneplus one if you guys
