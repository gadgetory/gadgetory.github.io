TechnoBuffalo here and today we're
taking a first look at the brand-new
late 2012 21.5 inch iMac this came with
a bigger 27 inch brother to take a look
at next week
let's go a take a look at the specs of
this iMac which I've named max and we'll
see what it's got whether not it's worth
your money
alright so the first thing I noticed
least by staring directly at the screen
is not much has changed while he's just
looking at it I Happ has done quite a
bit to remove the glare from the bezel
and from that standpoint they've done a
very good job there isn't that much
glare coming across off of this black
bezel but we start to notice the real
hotness I'm going to turn this guy on
its side and you see that max here went
on quite a diet it's not as thin as you
might think at least we look at it from
the side you think well how did they do
that then you start going on in you've
seen that actually there's a decent
amount of thickness towards the middle
of the device there is a ton of port
options of plenty on this guy so we've
got for now USB 3.0 just quite awesome
you can't really tell you to be 3.0 they
didn't use the blue or put it through
point over there but you'll know cuz I
told you I've got two Thunderbolt ports
gigabit ethernet SDXC so for all your XD
card slots which is pretty incredible at
the SD card slots actually one of the
thinnest parts of the machine that the
car can fit in there and of course your
audio in the 2720 1.5 inch model does
not have a slot for upgradeable ramps
draw an upgrade your RAM gonna be
limited to the 27 inch model it's gonna
have a little slot right here where you
would be able to access that Ram I'll
put this guy back so this is the
entry-level model which is gonna set you
back about 1,300 bucks it is being
powered by instead of me just telling
you let me show you a 2.7 gigahertz
Intel Core i5 that is quad core the
basic configuration you're getting 8
gigs of RAM I believe that's on 2 4
gigabyte DIMMs and it's 1600 megahertz
ddr3 RAM I can get a 1 terabyte hard
drive which is gonna spin very slowly at
5400 rpm talk about that hard drive in
just a minute but you can get the fusion
drive which is gonna pair different
regular spinny drives with a solid state
128 gigs so you get one big volume but
you get the speed of an SSD with the
storage of a traditional a little spinny
Drive kind of nice power this guy
graphics li is nvidia geforce GT 640 m
with 512 megabytes of RAM so don't think
I'm gonna play games and crazy max out
specs cuz you're not gonna be able to
now certainly you can play your World of
Warcraft Starcraft 2 whatever else you
guys want to do on lower settings it'll
work fine but if you really want at
gaming powerhouse and you want to stay
on the Mac side this is definitely not
your computer so let's go ahead and
check out some of the things that it can
do
we ran disk speed test using black magic
and we got not very impressive results
again 5400 rpm drive about a hundred and
102 ish per second on the right and on
the read it was 97 so not super faster
either what is this gonna mean to you
probably nothing but if you do what we
do with our computers and that's a lot
of video editing and a lot of importing
an exporting is definitely gonna be on
the slower side if you're just you know
watching videos playing back you're
browsing the internet not gonna do as
much of the speed so don't worry about
much about a 5400 rpm drive unless
you're doing something that really
relies on read/write speeds in which
case you can want to update our upgrade
rather to the fusion drive to get that
sellouts a performance so I'm gonna keep
in mind speaking of performance we also
ran Geekbench and this guy is for me not
set in a world on fire but it is gonna
be fine for every computer our benchmark
summary gives us a score of 9000 151 so
pretty respectable it's not you know the
fastest speeds in the world but you've
got a computer the entry-level price
here you're not really looking for the
latest and greatest specs although at
1,300 bucks it is pretty comparable to
what you get for other all-in-ones the
screen here though is absolutely
gorgeous the resolution everybody's
gonna be screaming we wanted retina we
wanted retina but it does look
absolutely beautiful with the resolution
of 1920 by 1080 the screen is probably
one of the best in the all-in-one
designs so rounding out the specs here
included in the box you're gonna get of
course the Magic Mouse which is the
unheard anomic multi-touch mouse an app
like the ship with the products then
you've got the wireless keyboard here as
well you can option up to have a wired
version
the ten key on the side but for me I
prefer the external stuff have a
Logitech MX Pro Mouse that I love and it
was a Logitech keyboard with a full 10
key and solar charging makes it very
fancy and helpful but for general
computing this is gonna be a great
computer for you even if you do like
video editing you play around in iMovie
you want to edit pictures and iPhoto or
aperture whatever you want to use this
is gonna be a great computer for you
this is not a computer for heavy gamers
a hard core of video editors are folks
to do a lot of 3d rendering anything
else so this is going to work great it's
also gonna work wonderfully as a Windows
machine which sounds a little bit weird
but you can use a piece of software
Apple include is called boot camp which
lets you run to upper instance um so you
can easily purchase or download Windows
8 or Windows 7 or any previous version
of Windows and sell it on here and be
able to run all your Windows
applications as well what's missing here
in part of a big a mission for some
folks is the lack of any sort of HDMI
you can finagle an HDMI connection by
getting an adapter which I Belov to do
plug into that Thunderbolt port and no
more cd/dvd drive so if you lie a lot in
physical media you want to pick up you
know another add-on tad here so if you
don't want to use a super driver pick up
a certain super drive you can use remote
disk applications we can actually
piggyback on somebody else's cd/dvd
drive and it's applications that way for
me though I haven't used a physical
media in quite a while so it's not gonna
be that big a problem but if you know
that you're the kind of person that uses
a lot of disks like to burn CDs or DVDs
then you may want to look past this or
at least add on another 100 ish hundred
$20 for that super drive add-on or just
can sit nicely right here over all the
computers been very nice to use it's
been quick it's been fast it's gonna
work pretty well for everyday computing
I am over excited to see you with the
spec tout 27 inch model I was gonna look
like which we'll have in next week and
of course we'll have an unboxing in full
comparison with that guy and give you
the full rundown on what it can do for
now though I'm John wrench from
TechnoBuffalo be sure to check us out at
TechnoBuffalo comm for latest greatest
tech news I'll see you guys the next
video
buh-bye
