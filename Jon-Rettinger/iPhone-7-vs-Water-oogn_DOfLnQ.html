thrown around quite a bit especially
recently when it comes to mobile phones
the iPhone 7 is ip67 so I want to
demonstrate what that actually means
before I do let me break down each of
those terms mean the IP stands for
ingress protection which is a rating
system used for dust and water
resistance for devices the six an IP 67
signifies the dust resistance for the
iPhone 7 and the six means it's fully
dust proof that's good the seven
signifies is water resistance and what
the seven means in this case is that it
can be submerged in one meter of water
for thirty minutes not waterproof by any
stretch of the imagination but is water
resistant now the caveat is that's only
for fresh water chlorine or salt water
the results could absolutely vary it's
recommended that you don't take it in a
pool and recommended you don't take it
in the ocean
but it's a beautiful day here in
Southern California we got a pool behind
us I got some showers and fresh water in
front of us let's test how
water-resistant the iPhone 7 actually is
the first test was fresh water first we
use a hose signified perhaps a really
heavy rainfall if you're out making a
phone call you have to worry about
hiding under umbrella hiding under an
overhang it's actually gonna work and
work pretty well with a lot of water
hitting it let's say you want to browse
the web in the shower you want this to
music in the shower whatever you want to
do in a shower it's going to work it's
tested it and a shower here outdoors and
a phone perform final dude read it off
we had no issue whatsoever and I
mentioned chlorine it's not recommended
it's more caustic of course than regular
water but we did have a drop in our
kiddie pool here and it works fine tell
me took the phone out of the water we
had no problem we let it dry off a
little bit before we plugged it back in
it's able to charge that issue as well
well not you drop your phone in a puddle
you can only drop it in a pool maybe you
drop it in the toilet or whether or not
you just want to rinse it off under the
sink because maybe I spilled some soy
sauce on it like it actually happened to
me in the past the iPhone 7 is gonna be
okay it's a little bit jarring to throw
your phone into water but it worked it's
certainly not waterproof interesting
imagination I wouldn't take it swimming
with me and wrap it onto my shoulders
into music but if does happen to fall
into water come in contact with water
you have to worry nearly as much you did
with the last generation so what do you
think
iPhone 7 7 plus there's a water
resistance enough for reason for you to
buy it
in the comments down below Neelix want
to see his test on the waterfront be
sure to let us know the next time John
