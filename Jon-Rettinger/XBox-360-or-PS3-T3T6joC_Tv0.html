all doing very well so purpose of this
video is to give my take on the whole
xbox 360 vs ps3 battle I've seen her
raging in a few of my videos and I
thought that I'd give my take on it and
before I do like your one console over
another doesn't mean the one console
worse it just means it suits my needs
better and it could suit your needs
better without disparaging the other one
so attractive everything civil anyway
I've owned the xbox 360 and I own the
ps3 so I can give a pretty reasonable
comparison i think i had to 360 since it
first came out and i sold it i believe
this march so had it for a few years
first off the xbox live i know you have
to pay for it which is kind of a con but
xbox live is amazing the playstation
network doesn't even come close xbox
live is just seamless data actually year
to get it together maybe that's the
reason but xbox live I think really
makes this system is absolutely an
amazing experience graphics it looks
beautiful and a game selection is very
broad ps3 plays blu rays which is really
nice it's actually one of the only
firmware upgradeable blu-ray players
it's actually one of the only reasonably
priced ones as well and you can play
games on it so you know that's
definitely a plus the game quality the
graphics and such look gorgeous I think
just good as the xbox 360 maybe a little
bit better since its plays blu rays the
game developers have a little more room
on the disc to make the games a little
more in depth there at levels or at
longer cutscenes and such but the
PlayStation networks the online play is
not nearly as good as the xbox 360 and
the playstation store they have on lines
not nearly as good as well but my
opinion if i was looking for something
to play games and handle them hi def
movies playstation 3 just the only way
to go you know I still get to play my
games on it and now I get a pretty
kick-ass blu-ray player too for the same
price seems like a no-brainer so if you
guys are looking to only buy one console
you have an HDTV you can I say go with
the PS where you can still play online
all the experience might not be as good
you still get some great games although
you don't get some of the Xbox
exclusives but you still do get a great
library of games the only getting get
better so ps3 my opinion is the better
multimedia and console choice you know
if it came down to just game playing
nothing else you know maybe I'll give
the edge to the 360 but the extra
features of the ps3 I'm going to really
make it nice in addition also has a
user-replaceable hard drive which is
really a cool feature you can slide your
hard drive out pop it a new one boom
you're done you don't have to worry
about buying a 20 gig hard drive for a
hundred bucks you don't have to buy a
wireless adapter for tomorrow this is
built-in give just some really really
nice features so my recommendation if
you have to pick one console you can
afford either go with the ps3 I think
it's going to suit you in the future a
little bit better now keep trying to
keep these comments as simple as
possible if you disagree with me you're
loud tell me why I didn't include the we
in this i also have a have a wii but i'm
just comparing the high def gaming
consoles so that's my take guys ps3 i
think is a better console was my first
PlayStation I've ever owned had the last
generation xbox you know I just think
it's a it's a better choice anyway give
me your take and one thing I made a
video earlier today that I was trying to
figure out how to get my external hard
drive to be viewable on my network and a
subscriber minimum 91 really helped me
out so thank you and thank you to
everybody who posted a video response
but minimums 91 was the other
walkthrough really helped me do it thank
you to him check out his videos and you
guys have a good night and happy common
thing bye and so I kiss I don't forget
here we're always looking for writers
for the site at wwu is calm if you're
interested shoot me over an email
through youtube with your name
your email address and sample post and
we'd love to get Tia and to everybody
that visits the site please support our
writers by leaving them comments I know
they'd appreciate it word up anyway guys
that's my sake sake that's my fake
that's my take that's why I think the
ps3 is the better choice so going to
make some crazy ass comments down here
yikes Oh baby where's the button to stop
the record
looks like i'm taking a crap but I'm not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
