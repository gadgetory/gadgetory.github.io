TechnoBuffalo here as you're watching
this video I am traveling to thought
it'd be a fun time to show you the best
bit of tech for traveling that I have
and that is a tablet in this case it is
my iPad 2 let's go ahead meet the iPad
and show you what I got inside
so I promised I would let you meet the
iPads to say hello hello all right bad
joke let's go ahead and pull this off
and show you what I've got on my iPad
maybe you can see some new apps that you
didn't know existed or maybe in the
comments you can leave me some choices
for things that I might want to check
out all right so we've got sort of your
set of standard these the ones I use the
most that on my homescreen
YouTube I watching YouTube videos every
night my wife and I sit in bed and watch
YouTube videos before I go to bed
we've got photos the stuff that come
standard videos I just downloaded season
two of like a sucker punch I'm gonna
watch on the airplane we also downloaded
season two of Breaking Bad as a great
show we actually just finished watching
Friday Night Lights which was an awesome
show as well check that out but season
two of Breaking Bad is going to keep me
company on the long flights camera apps
standard stuff that comes in there
calculator because you don't have a
calculator on the iPad sometimes you got
to do math when you're super geeky like
me analytics HD lets me track Google
Analytics for the website it can see
trends and helps me direct content
better
yes P and Excel that's pretty obvious
it's extra-large ESPN it's the ESPN app
and all honestly I'm gonna use this one
all that much generally I found espn.com
to be even better on a mobile device all
the video still plays now right from the
mobile websites whether you're on an
iPad or an Android tablet or the
PlayBook it's all going to work pretty
well there for you
The Weather Channel so I'm going to be
traveling to different countries I'm
going to be in London in Paris in Berlin
so that's been super handy to let me
know what I should pack it turns out I
should pack an umbrella Bloomberg for
tracking my stocks Wall Street Journal
for reading cnn.com it's kind of a cool
way to take a look at all the news and a
sort of a cool grid-like pattern you can
see all the stuff here and go ahead and
select it and watch all of your news or
read all your news the daily I really
like that it's an iPad only newspaper
let's get it check out all the new stuff
that's going on with content optimized
for mobile Flipboard like an open X
gonna show people's personal information
but John Quach actually reviewed
Flipboard it's an awesome way to sort of
view all of your social media
amalgamated
- one wheat platform for creating Word
docs essentially I got Pages Keynote and
numbers so for PowerPoint and Excel as
well
- terrific's what I use for Twitter I
tried using TweetDeck which lives right
here but it kept crashing on the iPad it
was awful
nothing else is very exciting your
Kindle for reading books oh I love this
Netflix app and times I wish I could
just pet it Netflix for the iPad or
Netflix for tablets or mobile devices
pretty awesome Netflix a great way to go
good reader if you are an iPad user and
you get a lot of documents that can't
open the opens on the iPad definitely
give good reader a shot it's very cheap
I believe about $0.99 and I'll open up
pretty much any sort of file or
extension this folder it's probably
gonna keep you the most entertained it's
my Angry Birds folder where these birds
are super angry I've got all three
versions Angry Birds Angry Birds HD the
second Angry Birds and then Angry Birds
Rio so super Angry Birds ABC employer
for watching ABC shows I wanted to watch
season 2 of V but they didn't have it on
there so I was incredibly annoying but
you can watch some select ABC shows on
there plants vs. zombies I love that
game I still play that game I'm still
waiting for its sequel please make a
sequel to plants vs. zombies it's
awesome the plants if he did the zombies
at least in my game sometimes I just
keep wanting to play it I love the
minigames I have them they're just an
awesome game definitely check it out if
you haven't it's available for phones as
well there's a really cool game go ahead
and exit out of their atomic web I
should skip the row here Infinity Blade
pretty awesome game powered by the
Unreal Engine it's one of the best
graphically one of the best one of the
best graphics of any game mobile game
that I've seen just pretty awesome
implementation here and it works very
well done by Epic Games give it a shot
it's not expensive side but totally
worth it and sometimes it goes on sale
that is infinity blade I'm moving I've
probably used that on the iPad maybe one
time
GarageBand probably use that maybe one
time just taking up space here
iBooks for when I want to read books
work with friends I play that game all
the time
I don't cheat anymore at words with
friends
I definitely maybe might have in the
past but words of friends awesome game a
great week to play some Scrabble with
your friends atomic web browser just
another web browser it's a great way to
browse the web you get tabs and all
kinds of stuff it's free so if you don't
like Safari try that speed test
I am a speed test nut i speed test every
wireless network I'm on unfortunately
there isn't one for the iPad
this one's meant for the iPhone and I
love to just test networks and see how
fast they are I don't know I can't help
it
so here I'll test my home network real
fast go faster faster faster
looks like we're at about 14 and 7 and F
so that's always fun and I use that
application probably more than anything
the official Twitter app I don't really
use that TweetDeck I would love to use
that but stupid thing doesn't work
finance for managing all my finances are
trying to learn and read and do better
at Sciences I've got Bank of America
research I've got Barclays Capital and
some JPM research kind of boring stuff
but it's what I use
nights and intern essential kind of a
cool alarm clock just helps I can sleep
through most alarm clock so this just is
another way to wake my butt up in the
morning
fan day go for movie tickets Flixter for
movie tickets and movie times Game
Center the Street Fighter this is only
meant for the iPhone but it's meant for
the Retina display or it's blown-up
reaction doesn't look half bad
Zinio this is a way to download
magazines I've probably never used that
this one was jumped watches
recommendation Starcraft 2 cast it's all
kinds of Starcraft 2 game cast sort of
put together in one area just a bunch of
YouTube videos that it's sort of pulled
for you but in viewed top-rated game in
different races when I was really into
Starcraft I used to watch these all the
time
next we've got magic mirror this one's
kind of fun
it puts see if I can if I can do it here
on camera you can see me so what's gonna
do I'm gonna put my face right in there
see if I can work
boom no a tap on the screen well if they
got both of my Chin's in it and you can
go ahead and put hair on you go ahead
and change your glasses change hat
whatever you want just kind of a fun
let's see okay but anyway that's just a
fun little thing so that's magic mirror
that was how I entertain myself
sometimes during some classes this is
kind of neat I 3d a free little
application it shows some ways you can
implement 3d technology using a
front-facing camera so you put your head
in there and it shows you generally show
you on camera very much though next
we've got akinator HD and this thing is
a ton of fun you have to have data
connection for it but you go ahead and
ask ask it a bunch of questions and
eventually we'll guess what you are
looking for kind of neat and it's pretty
accurate so you can get celebrities
people that are dead or care tuned
character characters that are real and
they'll guess who you're looking for so
check it out akinator HD white noise I'm
not the best sleeper in the world so
white noise just plays white noise tiny
wings this is the iPhone game that sort
of blown up it's a fun game my PC this
is the go to my PC application so I can
access my iMac when I'm on the road I
don't know what that icon is though
maybe you guys can can fill me in AI
haven't figured that one out yet
we've got Skype for Skype HBO to go for
watching HBO videos this game was
recommended by soldier knows best
spider-man HD she was a really awesome
game I deftly go ahead and check that
out and obviously Google Plus and that
is it those are my applications what do
you guys think that I miss any is there
something that I think I should have had
on here do you agree disagree

my best apps from what you guys
recommend anyway I'm John Rhett enger'
