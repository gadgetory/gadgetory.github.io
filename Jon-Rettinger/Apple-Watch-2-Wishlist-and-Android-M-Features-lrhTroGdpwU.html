to you by domain.com hello internet
friends welcome back there pisode of
asta buffalo my host John Rangers the
show where I sit on this couch sometimes
I have a dog friend with me an answer
every question you've got from or the
technology and sometimes like way way
like another planet away from technology
so I've got another channel called
inside John's mind eraser a lot of
behind-the-scenes stuff at TechnoBuffalo
and some stuff about my life if you want
to check out the channel or subscribe
link will be down below I put up a video
they're asking our video editor romp
Rida why we don't shoot in 60 frames per
second I'm gay that question quite a bit
if you have a really high top level
answered people wanted to know more so I
figured instead of me just telling you
why we don't you 60 frames per second
let's let Ron himself explain why not
and as a special truth you can see what
60 frames per second looks like this
here video is in 60 frames per second
which is hard to say as many times I
just did so if you want to watch it in
said frames per second you got to make
sure you select it in your browser go up
to 60 frames and you can watch this if
watch on your phone probably not gonna
be able to see it without further ado
Ron come have a seat so you guys saw on
the inside John's mind channel I
explained a little bit about the 60
frames per second just a little more in
depth the gist of it is that as you can
see everything there's very little
motion blur into experience per second
everything looks super super smooth now
that's really good for watching sports
that's really good for video gaming but
what we're doing is we're making videos
and more cinematic style videos and
that's probably the biggest thing it
looks more cinematic so motion blur
something actually really natural for
your eyes and it makes it more
comfortable for viewing when there's a
little bit of motion blur so that's
actually the main reason we shoot in 24
frames per second you can also shoot in
30 frames per second which will give you
a little bit less motion blur than 24
but way more than 60 so I know John was
mentioning that some people just think
that the bigger number means that it's
better that's not necessarily true
especially in this case all the films
you see in theaters are actually shot at
24 frames per second because the blur
makes a little more comfortable to watch
more natural even slow motion shots and
whatnot their shot at like 300 frames
per second and then they'll be slowed
down to play back in 24 so there's not
some jarring effect on your eyes one of
the examples of actually a film that was
not
Sean 24 frames per second is actually
the hobbit may was shot in 48 frames per
second which is kind of weird but they
did it for reason that they found
compelling but a lot of people actually
complained about that they said that it
didn't work out the 48 frames per second
with 3d was very like jarring and after
like two hours would like give you a
headache and whatnot so now that you
know why I look so smooth why when I
move my hands it looks like i am not
blurry let's jump to the next question
it comes from Ed quilty who asks at John
for lakers so now that we have seen the
Apple watch this here Apple watch what
enhancements do you foresee in watch two
and we're going to see a lot of
enhancements this is a hope I don't
think it's going to happen but round
displays my mind look much much better
on a watch then the cube display as I
talked about in my review of the Apple
watch I am like here's ambivalent and
like here's me like I am just like a
step above ambivalent towards really
wristwatch smart which watches in
general that includes Android wear and
the Apple watch maybe watch too could
change that maybe some updates to
Android where I could change that will
have also see a bevy of new sensors on
the bottom the rumor was Apple wants it
include just barometers and all kinds of
sensors built into the watcher perhaps
we'll see that hi we're using OS one
point 0 presumably watch 2 point 0 will
come with a matching number on the
operating system which hopefully will
bring new features may be a better way
to to navigate maybe new app
orientations hard to sort scroll around
those little tiny circles and pick what
you want Siri is just as good or my mind
just as bad as it is on the iphone so
Syria improvements would be really
really nice perhaps with your keyboard a
text where you can actually sort of pact
out something instead of just talking to
it I would also be really cool other
things you expect better battery life
and slim down Apple loves to do that if
you're holding out for price decreases
though I think your disappoint I don't
think we're going to see any decrease in
price so that kind of stinks we stop
real fast and thank our peeps at
domain.com it's a place to go when the
next great idea hits you like in the
middle of the night so one-stop shopping
for all your domain name and web hosting
email needs the main deck calm wants to
hook you up with a pretty sick off or
say 20
domain names and web hosting would use
coupon code TechnoBuffalo it's all one
word in caps at domain coms check out
when you think domains think domain.com
so next question comes for a name that i
am going to Massacre so i'm just gonna
try and i apologize at sat r is Mazumdar
ass at john for lakers with expectations
for Android M thank you for asking that
SAT with me mandar google i/o is coming
up very quickly i will be there the next
thursday seeing what they're going to
announcement he said we're going to see
the Mandarin at least I hinted at it
because we saw Android M on the agenda
for a conference we saw the first
version of Android L which really became
the lollipop I think we're going to see
a lot of interesting things for Android
M I'm hoping for and I say this every
year like I give my iOS expectations a
better backup solution backup and
restore need to be a very elegant and
fully backup restore bowl despite the
skin that's being used built-in visual
voicemail fake the operating system but
also be very nice but more likely we're
going to see like 4000 more api's which
don't sound sexy I'll but make for way
way way better app experiences
potentially better wearable experiences
as well so I think we're to see a lot of
that think we'll see a lot more
integration with android auto Android
Amma things going to filter its way down
to Android where we're going to see huge
updates to Android wear Zumba we'll see
iOS compatibility which would certainly
be nice I think we're going to see new
hardware that'll be running that new
software I think gonna see the Moto 360
to that sort of my expectation something
to bathing dress if we saw the design
language change with the material design
with Android L it's going to look the
same presumably hopefully just be faster
have better better memory management I
think that's sort of sexy killer
features but things that just make
Android get better and better which
we've seen really every single version
so anyway thank you guys for asking the
questions thank you for watching thank
you for just supporting us and putting
diapers on my baby I appreciate it until
next time I am Jet Ranger from techno
buff if you like these videos we hope
you do give it a thumbs up it's a big
subscribe button I don't know what can
be located but let's just call it in my
pants region and see you guys in the
next video goodbye
