the device that we've been asking for
for years its Android running on a
blackberry but there's a lot of
competition out there it's competing in
expensive waters so I had a lot of
questions going into testing the Prive
I'll be using it now for four days and
we're still gearing up to a full review
but I had a ton of questions how is it
going to perform as the size has a
slider how's Android all kinds of other
things so before you guys figure out
whether or not the print is right for
you I'm try and help answer those
questions I'm John Reggie from
TechnoBuffalo these are the top 5 things
to know before buying the blackberry
print all right so let's start with
number 5 the curved screen it's actually
really useful
I love the galaxy s6 edge+ mostly
because a curved screen looked awesome
didn't add much in the utility
department here though really useful you
can pick which side the information
comes on do a simple swipe in you can
customize all this information you can
see your calendar you can jump into your
mail I've got something else set up in
blackberry hub you'll see it all there
set up tasks right from there and also
jump into your contacts really easy
relatively customizable feel a little
Settings icon so finally a curved screen
actually provides utility nice to see
blackberry throw that in here number
four this is almost stock Android
blackberries take on Google's OS seems
way more like cyanogen than TouchWiz
meaning the tweaks are very much in the
vein of Android didn't try and redo or
rethink the UI at all a lot of really
useful software tweaks advanced
interactions for example shortcuts
galore you can have a shortcut for
almost anything you could do with your
phone everything that BlackBerry's added
here has a reason behind it they didn't
throw the kitchen sink actually hoping
you can use one of their featured
presumably you will use almost every
feature that's here so every one of them
seems to be really useful it is based on
5.1.1 lollipop but presumably
marshmallow will be coming blackberry
said sometime next year number three the
keyboards BlackBerry's on-screen
keyboard is one of the best that I've
ever used predictive text is really
awesome and just been a pleasure to type
on it's also surprisingly accurate but
this is the Prive and it's a blackberry
the story it's all about that guy down
there on Yankees it's a type it's sort
of strange going back to the physical
keyboard
I found myself sliding it out quite a
bit but not the type on it's really
awesome as a trackpad you saw this on
the passport but the keys you can use
just to scroll through text
really nice easy elegant way to scroll
through over your doing that even take
your finger and put up on the screen and
perhaps you know cover content over
you're looking at it's a really nice
elegant way to scroll through whatever
you're looking at number two this device
is really thin
chances are it's been a while since you
last used a slider phone so you might
think it's gonna be a little chunky
because got a keeper under there right
not at all at nine point four
millimeters if you hand this one to
somebody who doesn't know what it is
they'll just think it's any other candy
bar phone very thin and the phone feels
great in the hand and the number one
thing you might not know about the
BlackBerry prin it gets very warm for it
starts screaming about a Snapdragon 810
the 808 is in here so not sure if that's
the culprit a lot of phone's been using
it without any heat issues the phone
does get extremely warm no matter what
you're doing whether you're watching an
eight hour video of a fireplace you're
just browsing the web the phone gets
warm it does cool off very quickly also
if you're using it put in your pocket
maybe just weave it around in the air to
cool off for a second otherwise you're
going to get a blackberry logo branded
into you or your thigh so there's a lot
more to talk about about the Blackbird
pro if you couldn't tell I've really
been enjoying it I'm still gonna use it
for a few more days before you the full
review if you're watching this though
way later in the future hello future you
I'll put a card here though once the
videos live to check out the full review
anything else you guys want to see to
make sure we cover we do that review
leave in the comments down below until
next time
