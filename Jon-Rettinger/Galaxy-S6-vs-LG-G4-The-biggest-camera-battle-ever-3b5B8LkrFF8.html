to you by domain.com LG made a huge deal
out of the camera tech inside the g4
when it was announced late last month
when it's updated laser autofocus new
color spectrum sensor and NF 1.8
aperture but the g4 isn't the only
flagship to offer an amazing camera when
we reviewed the galaxy s6 a couple of
weeks ago we said the device is 16
megapixel sensor and F 1.9 aperture took
some of the best pictures we've ever
seen propelling Samsung's phone to the
top of the mobile photography charts
both devices are equipped with high-end
specs and some truly incredible cameras
but which one is better that's what we
here to find out the galaxy s6 is UI is
simple fast and efficient there are a
plethora of settings of toggles to turn
on and off and a couple of cool shooting
modes available that'll let you refocus
an image after the shot along with a
powerful manual mode the LG g4 on the
other hand features three main shooting
modes simple which allows you to take a
photo by simply tapping on the screen
simple auto which allows you to tap to
focus before snapping a picture and
manual which allows the users to take
full control of the camera settings we
tested both auto and manual
functionality to get the most
comprehensive understanding of how these
cameras work we took a few photos
outdoors on a cloudy day and while both
performed well we notice the g4
struggled big-time exposing our subject
properly when there was a lot of
backlight it has a tendency to
overexposed images to a point where
highlights clip which is when the
intensity of a certain area falls
outside of the minimum and the maximum
intensity the galaxy s6 didn't struggle
with this issue in terms of color
accuracy the galaxy s6 seemed to be a
bit more vibrant while the g4 displayed
a more accurate representation of the
subject we were shooting now this is due
to the new color spectrum sensor inside
the g4 which precisely reads the RGB
values in the scene you also didn't
notice any digital noise popping up in
either device as you can see from the
sample photos both the g4 and galaxy s6
take some of the sharpest photos the
laser autofocus in the g4 is amazing and
focused really quick the galaxy s6 is
focusing speed wasn't too far behind
though the galaxy s6 also offers another
neat autofocus trick which automatically
tracks your subject when you move the
camera or when your subject moves
something that can be very handy if you
have a rambunctious kid fortunately we
didn't notice any highlight clipping
indoors though we did notice some of the
g4 shot out of tendency to overexposed
which caused the images to look flat and
dull
there wasn't enough contrast in the
images and black had a tendency to fade
however the g4 did do a better job
handling auto white balance whites were
white and then display the warmth into
the galaxy s6 produced
however the Essex's images seem to be a
bit more detailed compared to the g4 I
didn't like the g-force photos look over
process fortunately the galaxy s6 toned
down its photo processing which resulted
in great images as you can see from the
sample photos one area both devices
really shine is in their manual modes
which allows users to take complete
control of the different camera settings
with the g4 you're able to change the
shutter speed ISO focus and white
balance which is anna calvin temperature
value but then you can also shoot in RAW
giving you more room to edit and post
without the horrible compression and
processing that a JPEG file gives you
the s6 meanwhile only less users change
to focus ISO exposure values and white
balance which came in its usual presets
like tungsten daylight shade in
fluorescent unfortunately the s6 doesn't
let you change the shutter speed despite
the difference in what you can actually
tweak I like the Samsung and LG allow
you to experiment with different
settings however I think LG has Samsung
beat in this category the g4 s manual
mode opens up a whole new world in
mobile photography being able to tweak
all the settings really does change the
way you compose and shoot photos when it
comes to low-light photography both
devices come equipped with OAS to help
prevent shaky shots
however the g4 attempts to bring that to
a whole new level LG cited devising new
OIS system that is better than any other
competing systems including the one in
s6 it took a few photos inside our
studio and we actually didn't see that
big of a difference between the two and
certain shots s6 would provide cleaner
less noisy results and in others the g4
would produce superior images it's
honestly a toss-up
both advices struggle to focus during
this test so low-light performs between
the two is about the same the g4 s duo
is system and F 1.8 aperture didn't
really Wallace we thought I'd perform
exactly the same as the galaxy s6 s
camera and our sample photos show that
there's not a huge difference between
the two when it comes to the front
facing camera the galaxy s6 features a 5
megapixel sensor with an ultra
wide-angle lens while the LG g4 featured
a higher 8 megapixel sensor now despite
the g4 not having an ultra wide-angle
lens like the galaxy s6 the image
quality we got with the LG g4 was better
the LG g4 shots were more contrast the
sharper and they didn't lose as much
quality when cropping in thanks to that
bigger 8 megapixel sensor the
advantage I see the Essex has over the
g4 is ultra wide-angle lens it's the
best we're taking the ultimate group
selfie and it's far more flexible when
it comes to framing the shot nonetheless
both are equipped with great
front-facing cameras and both have their
individual perks it just depends on
whether you prefer better image quality
or a wider field of view I personally
would rather have the wider angle lens
just because I can frame my shots better

it's all one word in caps at domain
comms check out so when it comes to the
video quality both the g4 and s6 or able
to film in 4k 1080p 720p and slow motion
but the slow motion on the galaxy s6 is
probably one of the better slow motion
features I've seen in any Android device
it's smooth and allows users to control
we're in a video the slo-mo starts and
ends now with the g4 you can't really do
this instead it'll just play back the
entire video in slo-mo so as you can see
for the example videos the slow motion
video we shot on the s6 looks much nicer
than the g4 they're the same 720p
resolution but the g-force footage look
more pixelated and muddy now when we
shot 4k video with the s6 and g4 we
didn't notice that much of a difference
other than the white balance though the
g4 footage was definitely much sharper
to a point where it looks a bit over
processed the galaxy s6 on the other
hand featured a much more subtle look it
wasn't overly sharpen like the g4 though
it still suffered from that white
balance issue we mentioned earlier the
g4 s new 3-axis o is system seems to
work great in 4k and much better in
1080p while the s6 struggled a bit with
4k in terms of stabilizing the shot
however bringing it down to 1080p we
noticed an improvement with all the
little quirks aside the galaxy s6
offered a slightly better video
experience key word slightly I enjoy
having the better slow-mo feature though
LG seems to do a much better job in
terms of stabilizing shots whether it
was in 4k or 1080p
now if LG could fix the over-processed
look in 4k and fix the muddy visuals in
it slow-mo feature I'd pick the g4 over
the s6 since the g4 seems to be more
stable in 4k and 1080p compared at a
slightly shaky video on the s6 overall
we found that the galaxy s6 produce much
better photos using auto mode while also
offering better slow-mo videos however
the LG g4 produced better pho
using manual mode since LG gives us
users the ability to have full control
over the shutter speed the g4 had a
slight advantage over the s6 in this
department Samsung has done a really
good job enhancing the user experience
and quality of its camera over the past
few years and it's really hard to beat
what the company's doing LG has stepped
up its camera game as well but it still
needs a few more tweaks in order to beat
its more popular competitor if you want
to see a full gallery comparison between
the galaxy s6 and LG g4 make sure to

enjoy this video make sure to give it a
thumbs up and we will see you guys in
