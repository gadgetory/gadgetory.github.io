membership today what's up everyone John
Ritter from TechnoBuffalo here with a 3G
iPad showdown we are going to be
comparing network speeds and real world
tests on AT&amp;amp;T 3G network here on the
iPad 1 and Verizon 3G network here in
the iPad 2 now I know what you're saying
John that's not a fair test iPad 1 vs.
iPad 2 not gonna be accurate well I'm
going to show you that the specs between
the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 the difference
in the processor in the RAM aren't going
to affect the download and upload speeds
of the network which is all that we are
testing right here so let's go ahead and
dig in and to show you that the tests
are going to be run fairly and the
difference in specs isn't going to
affect these results at least let me go
ahead and show you what we're working
with so we got everything closed on each
with the exception of settings and I'll
show you why in just a minute I've got
the 3G radio is turned off on each let
me show you that both are connected to
the same Wi-Fi network so connected to
say D here and it should be connected to
say D here as well both are running the
newest version of iOS version 4.3 to do
this test we're going to use actually
the iPhone version of the speedtest.net
app works very well and it's pretty user
friendly it also it's got a nice looking
UI fun for video all right so let's go
ahead and start with the iPad one I
don't want to do at the same time not
that I think I don't reload the servers
but I want to keep it as fair as
possible and it'll ping the same a los
angeles-based server where I am so fine
and close the server will go ahead and
begin test so the speeds that I get on
this network tend to vary on the time of
day but the speeds this should be
relatively similar between the two you
know within half a megabit per second or
so so we're looking right now at about
seven point eight megabits per second
down and nine megabits per second up
let's go ahead and
run the same test on the iPad to go
ahead and begin test and we should get
speeds that are relatively similar and
again this is the same a los
angeles-based server that is pinging now
look at that we're actually getting
speeds that are even slower so the point
being in with this illustration is that
the strengths don't really affect the
download speed the network is what's
gonna affect the download speed here
that both 802 11 and so the download is
actually much faster on the iPad 1
versus the iPad to upload relatively
similar alright so now I'm going to turn
Wi-Fi off on each and I'm going to turn
all in the cellular network so I'll do
this all live on camera so you can see
that there's no funny business going on
here we'll go ahead and kick Wi-Fi off
will turn on cellular data on the iPad 2
which is a Verizon flavor give that a
moment to turn on we'll do the same
thing here on the iPad 1 turn off Wi-Fi
and we'll turn on cellular data and this
is going to be AT&amp;amp;T the iPad 1 you only
get the option for AT&amp;amp;T cellular data
built-in I pad too you can have your
pick between a verizon or AT&amp;amp;T so let's
take a look at signal strength here on
AT&amp;amp;T I generally undulate I like to use
that word
undulate between about three or four
bars of service on Verizon I generally
undulate between two and three bars a
service just want to give sort of full
disclaimer alright so now let's run it
the same speedtest.net app will start
with Verizon this time and Wi-Fi has
been turned off so it will ping the
network just based on Verizon 3G let's
go ahead and begin test and this is
going to be in megabits per second so
we're looking right now at a little bit
below one and certainly speeds are going
to vary depending on where your location
is how many people are on the network at
the time there's a ton of mitigating
circumstances that can determine your
speed but this would be at least a
decent sense of what your speed might be
wherever you are located so we got about
0.5 9
down actually not about we got exactly
point five nine on the down it looks
like we're going to get about point one
three point one four ish on the up 0.15
alright let's go ahead and test AT&amp;amp;T and
I'll do the same test here it's going to
ping the same la-based server and I will
say that I've run this test even when
the Verizon had four five bars of
service and the speeds were relatively
similar let's go ahead and begin a test
right there and now this is going to be
AT&amp;amp;T and let's see if this is any faster
it's already we are actually above one
megabit per second almost that too
actually
now we're over to four like I'm calling
a sports game here now we're over to two
point two three on the downs so that is
a noticeable difference in speed now
we're looking at 0.2 or so on the up so
relatively similar on the upload so two
point two three and point two one on the
down so there's already a huge
difference being seen between the speed
between eighteen T and Verizon and if
you were going to comment on the specs
this is still the iPad one versus the
iPad 2 so the next thing you're gonna
say is probably about the signal
strength but there's not much I can do
as far as towers and receptions
unfortunately I'm generally in about two
to three bars of Verizon service and
generally close to the same in a TMT
let's go ahead and try this one more
time and see if the speeds were accurate
maybe it was just a one time shot and
the speeds were different or go ahead
and try Verizon one last time and we'll
probably get something relatively
similar speeds that I've gotten were
generally in the 0.4 to 0.62 maybe 0.7
range so this is very representative so
it looks like we're going to get almost
exactly the same results here with 0.48
and on the upload looks like we're going
to be pretty similar as well so it was
18 Keys Network really that
much faster than Verizon's well that's
going to vary again depending on where
you are we'll do some tests now on
websites let's actually go ahead and run
this one more time on 18t and see if we
really do have that big a difference all
right so we are going to get this loaded
now it appears to be a little bit slower
but still noticeably faster than Verizon
we're at one and a half whereas we were
over two before so still there's a
noticeable difference in speed ranging
from anywhere from four times faster to
three or two depending but you're
definitely looking at at least double
the speed so 1.91 in this case and it
looks like the upload is going to be
relatively similar 18t being a little
bit slower this time on the upload
alright so let's go ahead and move on
over to real-world browsing tests and
this is where the specs of the device
might come into play so we're gonna go
ahead and load up TechnoBuffalo here on
each and we'll do a refresh test and I
will refresh the cache in the next test
this is the cache has not been refreshed
on either these cookies haven't been
cleared
none of that let's just see if there's
any sort of difference now you would
expect the iPad 2 to be faster because
it can pull in and analyze the
information a little bit quicker than
the iPad 1 this isn't a test of just the
sheer download speed and upload speed
like it was in the speed test app this
is actually illustrating content so the
specs are going to come into play just a
little bit more all right so now let's
go ahead and do a refresh and this is
with the cache uncleared and see if we
have any sort of speed difference so
we'll go ahead and get that ready to go
right there and we'll get this ready to
go on the iPad 1 will it go at the same
time go and go and let go and see if we
have any sort of difference then we'll
run the test one more time
so despite the much slower Network speed
we are seeing content load first and
quicker on the iPad 2 it looks like the
iPad ones make it a pretty decent
comeback you almost look neck and neck
right now
both are showing content in about the
same place and they finished it almost
exactly the same time
oh it's very interesting really goes to
show the speed improvements from a
hardware standpoint of the iPad 2
despite the much faster network speed
found in the iPad one in 18 T's the
network in this case so let's go ahead
and clear the cache and see if that
makes any sort of difference and again
I'm gonna do all this live on cameras
there's any funny tricky work going on
here let's go ahead and jump down to
mail our Safari rather go ahead and
clear cache I'll go ahead and clear
cookies for good measure and I'll do the
same thing on the iPad one jump it to
settings go down to the far T well clear
clear cookies and we'll clear cache as
well alright and this will be the last
test let's go ahead and give these
suckers a twirl
but go ahead and open up Safari it
should start loading the pages at
exactly the same time alright so it will
do the same thing here and the same
thing here let's go ahead and hit go go
and let go and see if there's any stir
of difference now with the cache cleared
they look to be again almost exactly the
same they almost look like mirror images
showing content both are showing the
same content now the iPad 2 actually
looks to be way far ahead
I've had one is making its late game
come back as it did last time content is
shown and visible on both and is done on
the iPad 2 and still loading on the iPad
1 it's still loading and just finished
so this is really going to go to show
you that despite the network speed that
you might get the specs on the iPad 2
when it comes to real-world usage so
actually using the tablet browsing
internet and using internet intensive
applications this going to make a
difference from a spec standpoint the
speed test that we ran was just from a
network standpoint which is a little bit
different so if you're considering
upgrading from the iPad 1 to the iPad 2
definitely know that the iPad 2 is going
to give you a little bit faster results
if you want to pick up the 18 T versus a
Verizon version as we saw right here at
least in Southern California 18 T
Network speeds were noticeably quicker
so now let me do a really cool magic
trick for you
we'll do some stop-motion I want to take
a minute to thank our friends at Netflix
