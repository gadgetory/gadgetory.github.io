technobuffalo here it's been just about
a day since Apple took the wraps off the
iphone 4s and I wanted to give you my
unadulterated unedited thoughts and
impressions about what the iphone 4s
means for the cell phone industry means
for Apple and means for the three
carriers in the US that are going to be
carrying it so sit back relax and get
ready for a rant iphone 4s came to us
yesterday amidst a ton of hype I got a
lot of things that I wanted to talk
about here I purposely didn't write down
any note so we are going one hundred
percent off the cuff so please as a
warning deal with my stream of
consciousness alright so first let's
talk about the design let's just go
ahead and get it out in the open you
looked exactly like the iphone 4 looks
just like this guy same design it's
gonna come in white it's gonna come in
black nothing different apple now has
established a pattern of design changes
every other generation so the original
iphone iphone 3g was different yay
iphone 3gs wasn't different boo iphone
four different yay iphone 4s oh so that
seems to be the general feeling amongst
the tech loving world so the iphone 4s
for all intensive purposes is a new
phone they not only Dumbledore more than
doubled the horsepower of the phone
improved the camera putting on a new OS
with one of the killer features sri
which we'll talk about in just a minute
but they didn't do was change the design
and changing the design was what a lot
of folks were looking for whether or not
that actually we've been a positive step
or a smaller step Apple is a victim of
their own innovations in the past we've
seen Apple changed a mobile space with
the iphone we've seen Apple change the
tablet space with the iPad we've come to
expect apple to change some other space
with the new products we became victims
of the rumor mill just like apples
become victims with their own success so
we kept typing it up hyping up hyping it
up Apple is under no obligation to
release a redesign phone despite what we
might have wanted so while I am
personally extremely disappointed that
we need at least get a bigger screen
where
certainly would have kept the phone on
par with the ever-growing attack from
Android and I think they coming
onslaught from windows phone 7 got back
there they didn't do that so certainly
there going to be competitive they could
have called it the iphone poo and put an
apple logo on a piece of it and it still
probably would have sold millions and
millions of units so volume isn't the
issue for Apple selling units isn't
going to be the issue for Apple but they
didn't wow us like they used to so
imagine if you walk into an apple store
and you say hey I want to get an iphone
they say okay we've got a free 3gs we've
got a pretty discounted $100 iphone 4 or
you can send four hundred dollars on
iphone 4s you're going to say what's the
difference well they're gonna say speed
better camera and an assistant you know
what you can talk to you which sounds
weird to some people I think a lot of
folks that aren't you know need the
cutting edge they just want to play
Angry Birds want to make phone calls
movie browse the web can care less about
the differences between the four and the
4s the iphone four still probably give
you the right choice for them so apples
going to lose out i think on a lot of
potential market share from folks that
would go in so i'm looking for a phone
that can do everything kids are they can
be redirected to an android device
depending on what store they go into
just my thoughts so what an apple do
right so this really has gone under the
radar apple now has made one phone the
iphone 4s for all carriers so that is
going to come this is gonna get sort of
businesses so let me try to make it
quick essentially what Apple is doing
now is they are eliminating the to
production design costs that they had
they had its cdma model that a GSM model
they have two separate chains that used
to go out to produce that now it's just
one for both so their costs and
component costs have gone way way we
down like tremendously down and that I
think went behind the scenes is one of
the biggest wins that Apple did do was
unifying their product so the consumer
we don't really care very much we just
want an iphone but what that's going to
mean for apple's profits and bottom line
is going to be tremendous a lot of folks
and I've read all the tweets that come
out in the comments on the videos are
saying Apple just looking for an excuse
to make more money
from their customers know they'll put
out a phone and people will buy it well
apples a company they're not a charity
they're not a not-for-profit company
their job is to make money and people
say that like it's a bad thing like oh
this company is trying to make money or
oh this company has more cash reserves
in the US government well that might be
scary it's certainly well within their
right to do so and for people to say
that they shouldn't try and make profits
is asinine and it's certainly showing a
personal osq you know one way or another
that's sort of another issue to talk
about is the personal feelings and the
either love random awesome people have
for Apple and I think people are
developing for Google and Android you
know it's one camp or the other and no
matter what Apple was going to announce
some people are going to hate it some
people were going to like it personally
I was extremely disappointed I just
wanted a big screen I've been in awe of
4.3 4.5 and now larger screens coming
out and I really wanted to see something
new from apple i'm a former iphone user
I've always loved using an iphone I love
Andrea as well and there's becoming a
really big fan of Windows Phone 7 back
there I was hoping for something that
could compete yeah we got better specs
yeah we got surrey which okay let's talk
about Suri for a minute it's got I
mentioned this in my recap video first
of all it's very cool and I mentioned on
twitter that hey Android had this
feature I believe three or four versions
ago and I was mistaken so the difference
here between the Android offering and
what Apple is doing it's not just
transcribing your words so you're not
just replying to an email now push the
microphone button hey mom I'll be home
late it'll type out hey mom I'll be home
late what Suri does that's a new is it
actually interprets the word and does
something with them so you can say you
know send a text message tulips and a
text message to you can say check the
weather and it can check the weather so
that's neat it's novel it's going to
create a whole new level of I send this
before douchebaggery I feel bad for
folks that rely on public transportation
because people are going to be screaming
into their phones which was bad enough
they were talking to somebody but now
there's you can be talking to themselves
phone why is the guy next
being an ass and the phone's gonna say
because he has Suri uh I don't know what
something I'm never going to use it's
kind of cool I probably feel silly using
out in public maybe I would do it in
private but it might be one of those
things at three or four months from now
I say wow I don't know how I ever lived
without this virtual assistant so you
guys care are you excited about Suri are
you not excited about Suri um you know I
love to hear your thoughts on that so at
the end of the day iphone 4s I think was
a big disappointment now Apple certainly
brought a lot of stuff to the table and
brought a lot of improvements dual-core
processor better camera that's
supposedly we'll see when it comes out
shoots amazing pictures iOS 5 which
brought a ton of new features but we
knew about all those features in iOS 5
it wasn't that exciting perhaps if we
had seen iOS 5 get unveiled yesterday
then that would have been a bit more
exciting but the excitement just wasn't
there with his event and they opened the
event by talking about application that
makes greeting cards that probably could
done with the press release and not 25
minutes out of a keynote is extremely
boring and as Tim Cook's first sort of
for a onto the stage as head of Apple I
was definitely disappointing for that
aspect as well certainly this isn't his
doing he just came on a little while ago
you know the iphone 4s obviously has
steve jobs and companies prints all over
it as well products that are going to be
coming out for probably the next 12 to
two years so Tim Cook doesn't deserve
any sort of blame for this or sort of
blame heaped upon just him but it does
add a bit of pressure for Apple to do
something interesting with the next
iPhone the iPhone 5 which we may see in
june of next year and sort of reset now
this launch period of always being every
June I would expect that we'll see a new
iphone so the big winner in my opinion
there were actually I think there were
two kind of winners so the big winner
yesterday with sprint sprint not only
now can offer the iphone 4s to its
customers Sprint's got at least where i
am in southern california has an
awesomely reliable network it's crystal
clear it works great and now they can
also offer an iphone 4 that went under
their radar too so Sprint's got both
that they didn't have before and I think
18 tu is also a winner they got the
hspa+ varieties now you can get 14 for
megabits per second down which is almost
twice the speed of what you could get
with the iphone 4 it's been depend on
where you are and with that speed is
actually going to be but that's a
tremendous potential improvement to
double potentially at least double what
your download speed verizon I think sort
of a neutral they get the upgrade but
nothing really new in different sprint
now can offer the phones AT&amp;amp;T you can
say they're faster data and Verizon can
just say we've got the phone to pick
loser obviously t-mobile not getting to
carry the device and the big loser also
are the blog's the techno Buffaloes
insights of the world I think we were
victims to the hype rumor we hyped it up
and this is all the press you know we
are seeing case manufacturers put
devices or put out potential new designs
we'd seen some large publications talked
about exclusivity on different carriers
and it got to be a lot of fun but that's
all it was was fun and a speculation led
to unfair expectations which inevitably
is going to lead to a letdown which is
kind of what I feel right now I'm gonna
look at the iphone 4s look at the iphone
4 and not go tell a difference until i
push the home button and see if it talks
to me so what do you guys think about
the iphone 4s disappointment are you
excited you not excited you're going to
upgrade if you're on the fence I can't
really see a compelling reason yet to go
out and upgrade I don't think you're
gonna want to sign your name to a
two-year contract for you know two
generations of phones you're gonna have
to wait till it comes out I think you're
gonna miss out on big steps between the
iphone 4s and the iphone 5 whatever that
might be so guys I am jon rettinger from
technobuffalo sure check us out for all
your tech news and I will talk to you in
the next video goodbye
