to you by full sail university welcome
back to another episode of ask the
buffalo i'm your host jon rettinger this
the show where you could ask me any
question you've gone from the world of
technology up this week on ask the
Buffalo we're going to talk iOS 6 and
what happened to all those Google
applications or to talk about what's
going on with mobile gaming in or
eventually handheld phones going to take
away from all the mobile consoles in the
world Sony and Microsoft should they be
shaking a little space boots this is
asked to Buffalo let's go and get start
Mike phone junkie asked hey John we
think about Apple deciding to drop
Google and iOS 6 you think the new maps
app is better than the google maps that
we all have grown to know and love so
i've only used iOS 6 and apples Maps in
beta and certainly beta implies that if
not yet ready for prime time so take all
this with a giant grain of salt the maps
application has not been overly awesome
points of interest said he's always
checking google maps aren't there some
routes i like to use aren't always
showing up in there some new streets
aren't showing up and they're at a hard
time with maps loading maps loaded
slowly and those are all things that
hopefully could be fixed it's really
will be fixed over generations of
software maybe even be fixed by the time
it makes its world debut what I do like
though is a turn by turn navigation
that's actually worked pretty flawlessly
the voice doesn't sound super robotic
actually sounds pretty good so if you
need turn-by-turn navigation you can be
very happy if you use google maps for a
lot of points of interest and phone
numbers all that kind of stuff you might
be a little bit disappointed Lucas
s√∏ndergaard asked hey John should get a
nexus 7 galaxy note 10 1 or wit for the
ipad mini if its shell come out you all
commended on the use of the word shall I
don't know visually for that ipad mini
because we don't know the iPad Mini is
going to have if rumors are true it's
gonna have a 7.8 5-inch screen i'll be
powered by an a5x chip and pretty much
be an ipad shrunk down or an ipod touch
shrunk up set this over and over again
and i'll shout it from the rooftops the
nexus 7 is an awesome tablet it is fast
it works it's running jellybean galaxy
note 10-1 if you want a larger form
factor your enjoy android one
take advantage of some of the s-pen
technology is really another great
option as well then if you're in apples
ecosystem you might want to wait for an
iPad Mini or if it never comes and you
want to spend through be a lower price
than what the ipad 3 years or new ipad i
might want to look at picking up a ipad
2 perhaps used hopefully that helped
answer your tablet quandary user james s
hey john i'm just wondering on your new
video intro has the buffalo gone are you
getting rid of the Buffalo image
completely personally I like the new
video intro so we've got a brand new
video enter up on TechnoBuffalo we
debuted about two ish months ago sort of
a sneak preview of the look and feel
that the TechnoBuffalo redesign
hopefully coming october novemberish yes
the buffalo is gone however if you watch
the new intro the buffalo does make a
very quick cameo in there you're gonna
have to do frame by frame to find him
we're trying to brand a buffalo image
it's sort of difficult to do buffalo use
everywhere and there isn't a lot of
brand value and brand equity behind just
a buffalo so we've tried to do is
actually advantage of the be actually
see the be behind me that be is what
we're trying to make the face of techno
Buffalo increase of brand identity
behind that I love the Buffalo the
Buffalo so the special place in my heart
you might remember that we first
launched TechnoBuffalo we did a contest
to name the Buffalo and for 500 points
anybody who's around then can guess the
name of the Buffalo I will commend you
I'll give you two seconds to guess and
type it in comments where you read it
ready go the winning name of the contest
and in the Buffalo was shyla Buffalo
what I thought was really fun name
before we get to last question I want to
thank our friends and sponsors at full
sail university we talked a lot about
mobile applications and mobile app
stores but someone's got to make them

Steve asks hey John you think that a
dedicated gaming consoles will soon be
replaced with smartphones this is a
question has popped at multiple times
what are your thoughts well handheld
consoles 3ds and Vita soon become a
thing of the past if you asked our head
of gaming joey davidson that would make
him cry he first of all hates tablets
which is sort of a weird thing to hate
and he also hates mobile games he's a
gaming purist and I don't really fall
into that camp I think when you look at
something like a Vita or 3dsxl whatever
it might be that's technology that you
can see very closely coming to mobile
phones we've already had stereoscopic 3d
phones out there look kind of fizzled
out the big issue that I see is game
sighs I'll being able to get those games
streamed over the air certainly not kind
of a phone that can you know pop a
cartridge in or whatever weird formats
Sony decides to use in the future so you
gotta be able to get 500 Meg's gig
whatever it might be onto your phone so
assuming that infrastructure for
downloading Wi-Fi and perhaps LTE can
handle it yes I absolutely see those
devices converging and perhaps seeing
the official xperia vita thank you guys
