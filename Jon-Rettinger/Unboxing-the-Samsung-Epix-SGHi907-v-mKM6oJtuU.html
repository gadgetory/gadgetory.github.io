lakers calm with an exclusive unboxing
for you of the samsung SGH i907 also
known as the samsung epix on a tease
network this phone is not replacing my
iphone it was just sent to me as a
review unit for a couple weeks so i'll
use it play around with it on the
weekends for a day or two and let you
guys know what i think and then send it
back so let's go ahead and go over the
specs here again it's on 18 tease
network it's running windows mobile 6.1
it's tri-band UMTS hsdpa it's got 256
megabytes internal rom and up to 150
megabytes internal ram it's got a 320 x
320 screen qwerty keyboard with an
optical mouse actually it's got an 1800
milliamp hour battery GPS Bluetooth
media player and all kinds of other good
stuff so I'm not really a Windows Mobile
guys this will be interesting to use for
a little while and see what I think but
i'll give you guys an honest review of
it so let's go ahead and get to the
unboxing first thing i will show you
guys the box here let's go ahead and
move this down so here is the box with
the SGH i907 on the front AT&amp;amp;T logo
letting you know that has Wi-Fi gps and
male capable and has a camera top of the
box same thing same logos and some more
branding on the back we've got some
product specs on the side just some AT&amp;amp;T
business the other side's made T&amp;amp;T
business so let's go ahead and open this
bad boy up and see what we have and this
is the first time this is being opened
we've got looks like a getting started
guide just some windows mobile stuff
which I'm going to need cuz i am not
terribly familiar with Windows Mobile at
all getting started CD with windows
mobile 6.1 software probably going to
use Windows via bootcamp to sink this
with anything got a quick start guide
probably going to need that as well and
here is the good stuff so let's see what
they threw in here looks like a
proprietary adapter
Samsung's proprietary port to a 3.5
millimeter headset jack listening to
music probably never use up like a
seeking cable here again Samsung's weird
flat you proprietor USB to regular USB
the wall charger nothing fancy there
just a wall charger battery whoa this is
a monster monster battery here um think
it's thick I'll show you guys a size
comparison here so here is the iphone by
comparison the battery is to get that
lined up there thicker than the iphone
so let's say big battery 1800 milliamp
hours should get you through a full day
and a half of solid 3g browsing so i'll
be nice put that off to the side here's
the device itself go ahead and move the
camera up here and i'll show you so this
is the samsung going to take it out of
the plastic here it's thicker than i
expected it to be okay so i'll give you
guys a real quick walkthrough of it this
thing right here it's actually an
optical trackpad it treats it almost
like a trackpad on a laptop you move
your finger around a little cursor here
will show up and you can move it you can
also turn that off and treat it like a
d-pad just go up or down left or right
and it is actually a full touchscreen
phone it looks like the black jack and
the blackjack two people are calling it
actually the blackjack 3 but that's not
the official name again it's the epochs
so touch screen with what i believe is
half the feedbacks i mean when you touch
the screen and give you a little bit of
vibrating and this one features what's
called a resistive screen meaning it
registers touches by pushing two layers
of film together not like the capacitive
screen on the iphone which he made of
glass and is used through electron
transfer this actually feels a little
bit squishing you have to actually push
down so let's see what else we got on
the device here there's the front of it
obviously with a full qwerty keyboard
and some shortcut buttons down on the
bottom for internet for calendar for
phone and for email
on the loose left side device here we've
got a power button right there and
volume toggle up and down on the right
side it's like there's the charging port
and the headphone port right there we
all this will also take up to a 16
gigabyte microSD card which is
apparently hot swappable right on the
side they didn't think I didn't get that
one of those included here sent to me by
AT&amp;amp;T spr just to review i'll be getting
actually a couple phones coming through
here to show you guys so something new
for the john for lakers people out of
getting a little tired of the apple
stuff back the phone pretty clean back
with a two megapixel camera and go ahead
and open this thing up here and see what
looks like in the back inside is pretty
much all battery and a little spot for
sim card close that up i'll give you
guys a size comparison with but i
usually compare size wise the iphone
it's going to move this down so here is
the samsung epix which actually
available now on AT&amp;amp;T i believe for 199
with a two-year upgrade and here is the
iphone you can see size-wise they're
just about the same will stack them on
top there not much difference stack on
the other way so you can see I bones
maybe a little bit wider thickness the
epics definitely has the thickness
category one it is appears to be
significantly thicker than the iphone
but it will be interesting to see what
it's like to have an actual hardware
qwerty keyboard again I've gotten used
to not having that for the past few
years on the iphone so guys jon
rettinger with john for lakers calm with
a unboxing for you of the samsung epix
i'll do a first boot up video and i'll
do a review video for you guys and let
you know what i think so i hope you
enjoy leave some questions and again
this is just a review unit not replacing
any of my current phones just going to
give it a shot for a little while and
let you guys know what I think dr. guys
