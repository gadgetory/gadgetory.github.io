QWERTY keyboard this guy I love using my
iPad oftentimes it's my primary computer
for when I'm typing out emails writing
posts or wherever it might be but I
write things at length and the on-screen
keyboard of the iPad sometimes can throw
me for a loop so with that in mind folks
at Negri electronics have hooked us up
with an iPad case with Bluetooth
keyboard attached to it let's go ahead
and get to the unboxing so if you carry
your iPad in a case this is gonna be
just a little bit of extra added bulk
for you it's gonna set you back just
about $70 but you consider what the cost
of an average case for the iPad is
you're probably paying about $40 premium
for the Bluetooth keyboard attachment
now certainly you don't have to have it
integrated into a case you can use any
Bluetooth keyboard to set up and type
with your iPad this one though you don't
have to carry anything extra it
supposedly all in there let's go ahead
and open it up
iPad case with keyboard can see me in
the reflection and my cowboy shirt hello
alright so let's go and open this up
it's a little bit on the heavy side
actually hopefully the case isn't gonna
weigh that much so it looks like you've
got a some sort of plastic shell in
there
things are always harder than box there
we go alright so here is the case
obviously okay we've got some
instructions user manual we'll take a
look at that in just a minute and
nothing else and falling on the floor we
have a cord looks like if you want to
charge your Bluetooth keyboard it uses
micro USB I would've thought that maybe
it would have had some sort of charging
connector built-in to use the power if
you wanted on the iPad but alas there
isn't one so here is the keyboard it
actually looks pretty nice it's sort of
a a rubber feel so think of the old
keyboards that you can serve roll up to
it this doesn't have a hard sort of
rigid feel like you would have on a
standard keyboard like this
definitely feels a bit more flexible
there's a piece of cardboard on the
bottom of it here to prevent it from
bending but the keys itself definitely
have a rubber feel to it and not the
most key throw at least on first blush
you can sort of see what that looks like
right there can you hear the noise it
definitely has a rubber feel to it so
let's go ahead and connect the iPad and
see how this guy works all right so
let's take a look at this manage Emma
and yes I just said manage Emma trying
to bring it back a little probably
unsuccessfully it's got a clasp on top
which is magnetic magnets aren't
necessary the first thing you think of
when it comes to electronics well this
one seems to be fine not going to damage
anything go ahead and lift this up I
actually before I do that let me show
you the additional bulk that this thing
is going to add you can see where the
iPad is in there there's a decent amount
of extra heft and weight that carrying
this around is going to give you however
you are going to get a nice all in one
option and your iPad is going to be very
substantially protected alright so let's
go ahead and open this thing up the iPad
slides in quite nicely on the side
there's a little bit of a flap that
lifts up you go ahead and push the iPad
in and there are openings on either side
so if you like an orientation with your
home button on the left or the right you
can pick whichever is best for you the
keyboard pairing is actually relatively
easy there's a power button off to the
right side right there you go ahead and
flick that on there's a connect button
right there prompts you for a password
when you go into Bluetooth settings on
the iPad and you are good to go so all
it all probably took about 10 seconds to
pair so when you want to use this device
go ahead and lift up your iPad there's a
little bit of a ledge to leave it there
to go ahead and type so I've tried using
this for maybe five or ten minutes just
to get a sense of how well it worked and
whether than I thought I could get used
to it certainly I'll follow this up with
a full review and perhaps my opinions
will change but this is not the most
pleasant typing experience if you're
thinking you're going to get a full
keyboard substitute you are going to be
a bit disappointed if you look at a
full-size keyboard like we have right
here but notice that the key sizes are
quite different if you don't mind
carrying around two separate devices and
you want a true desktop typing
experience - the mouse the Bluetooth
keyboard from Apple or whatever other
manufacturer you like it's probably
going to be a better option however if
you're looking for the all-in-one that
gives you a case and a keyboard you're
going to have to make some compromises
and that's really where this device
comes into play it's a rubber feel and
the short key throws definitely don't
make the most pleasant experience but
it's certainly better when it comes to
typing long emails or long letters I
know a lot of you guys take your iPad to
class and take it to work and you type a
lot of notes on it so if that is you
then this is going to be a device you're
going to want to look at now I know it
seems a bit counterintuitive to talk
about adding physical buttons to a
device whose really main traction its
lack of buttons which certainly is a
good choice for web browsing for looking
at video and music when it comes time to
actual text inputting and if you want to
use your iPad as a laptop replacement or
a laptop substitute or supplement you
are going to need some sort of way to
input text so that was a long way of
saying that if you want an all-in-one
and you want a case it's gonna offer
good protection and you want to keep
wertham in there for good measure this
is going to be a decent way to go there
are a lot of keys here on the keyboard
most of which we could get on a standard
Bluetooth keyboard the most appealing at
least to me as a four-way arrows which
makes it a lot usually when you're
typing instead of having to go ahead and
touch the screen to get to where you
want go ahead and just use the arrow
keys you've got a home button you have
function keys for controlling volume and
media playback as well in addition to
pause buttons you've got your typical
comma buttons period buttons and the
rest of stuff you'd expect from a
keyboard so let me go ahead and give you
a quick demonstration pull us back a
little bit so you can see the screen it
will launch pages and I've got a blank
document here and I'll just type out
very quickly this is a test now I'm not
sure if that noise that the keyboard is
making
is going to be picked up by the camera
you don't get that keyboard clacking
Asst that you get from an external
dedicated keyboard you get more of a
rubber on rubber type sound the keyboard
is usable it wouldn't be my first
preferred typing method however I don't
want to carry something else with me I
don't want to throw a keyboard in my
backpack my briefcase my attache if I
were a purse it's just not something I
want to curate that's vulgar that's wait
so I think that this is going to be a
nice sort of hybrid middle ground for
those people all right guys I'll give
you more coverage in a full review of
this guy links there down below if you
want to check it out or pick one up then
I'm gonna leave this on my iPad for a
little while and see if I like it
hey guys I'm John Rangers and
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you next
video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
