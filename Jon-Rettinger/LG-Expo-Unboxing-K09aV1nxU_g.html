here with an unboxing for you of the LG
Expo for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless this phone is
making a lot of noise for two reasons
the first it's one of the few care
released smartphones to feature the
snapdragon 1 gigahertz processor which
is crazy fast by comparison the iPhone
3GS for example has a 600 gigahertz
processor so this is market ibly quicker
I'll see how that translates to actual
real-world speed improvements or
multitasking abilities the second is
that this is phone also supports a pico
projector which is a small projector
that catches to the back - lets you well
obviously project whatever you'd like I
don't have the projector with this phone
but we'll take a look about how it
handles with the processor it's running
Windows Phone or windows mobile 6.5 as
you might know it and it's going to run
you $1.99 99 after rebates and a
two-year contract so enough of me
talking let's go ahead and dig in we use
the obligatory little knife to this cut
into the FedEx box there's the phone
piece I don't think the projectors in
here there is the phone itself this was
just released we've got some 18/2
information you got a picture of the
phone on the front and your typical AT&amp;amp;T
box letting you know that it's got Wi-Fi
is indeed a touchscreen has GPS which is
I believe assisted GPS so it'll use cell
towers and it's GPS chip and it has a
five megapixel camera and of course it's
the touchscreen version of Windows
Mobile 6 4 5 previously known as
professional Wi-Fi touchscreen ah stuff
we just ran through take a look at some
of the rest of the specs here it's of
course a 3G phone talktime up to five
point three hours standby time 15 days
the Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G bluetooth 2.1 it's a 480
by 800 resolution touchscreen weighs 5
point 2 ounces it's got a micro SD card
goes up to 16
and the rest of the Windows Mobile sort
of slew of things looks like this box
took some beating in transit okay the
phone is still okay I have not used a
phone that's taking advantage of the
Snapdragon processor so I'm really
curious to how it works the same chip
that powers the hd2 and I believe a Acer
phone as well so go ahead and take out
the packaging some information a
QuickStart guide here is the phone
itself which is actually a lot smaller
and thinner than I expect it to be push
that off to the side let's check out
what else comes in the box your
standards lieu of accessories got your
charging headers I assume connects to
some form of USB cable which is right
here and let's see what sort of standard
this is if it's a private area or if
it's appears to be microUSB we've got a
pair of stereo headphones with mic and
looks like a volume control on it that's
quite nice we've got a stylus so this
does not have a stylus embed in the
device you have to actually attach this
they'll think to it the stylus pops out
super annoying hopefully you're not
going to need to use a stylus all that
much there it is you know it just pops
back in its retractable
it's using a stylus because this is a
resistive screen it is not a capacitive
and your battery of size the batteries
here I'll let you get that man at 12:00
time it's probably at least 1200
milliamp hours I would assume let's take
a look here if it tells us 1500 million
power battery this is a quite a big
battery it's actually light as well
let's take a quick look at the phone
here is the touch screen looks like
that's some sort of optical go down to
the camera focus some sort of optical
trackpad
we've got your end button or your call
button your end button and a back button
I don't know if there are some sort of
virtual buttons that will show up there
on the left side advise you've got a
volume rocker up and down on the right
you've got your
camera button you've got a probably a
lock or a smart key and your micro-sd
which is nice to have it right on the
side so I mean it's hot swappable you
don't take off the battery to access it
five megapixel camera with LED flash and
the battery release door does look to be
a quite a nice phone all running through
the full paces and see how it works and
also it's a little bit on the chubby
side because it's got a full evidently
four row QWERTY keyboard one first blush
does look to be pretty nice keys it
looks similar to what we saw on the
touch pro2 they're rectangular keys a
little bit of raising mechanism there
they do feel very nice a little bit of a
squishy feel but not bad I think this is
a keyboard you could definitely get used
to and you've got your sort of weird
arrow navigation keys and some shortcut
keys embedded there for use with the
function button go ahead and slide that
back and if you had the projector the
battery actually comes off or the
battery door comes off projector sits
right on the back hopefully I'll get a
chance to show you what that looks like
at some point stay tuned to the channel
for a full review of how this handles
and how the Snapdragon processor
compared to other devices if you're
looking for a size comparison if you're
considering the LG Expo I'll show you
how it compares some of the more popular
phones out there today
here is the iPhone 3GS here is the
just-released HP I pack and listen also
for AT&amp;amp;T it's a touchscreen
windows mobile 6.5 phone as well
different form factor for the QWERTY
board but you get a thick mist
comparison if you're interested in any
other of these phones here is the xperia
x1 by a sony ericsson which is
noticeably thicker and lastly here is
the original blackberry storm for size
comparison sort of stack all these up
together that one right there is the
expo in case you are keeping track at
home I start to see how they all stack
up in a big cellphone sandwich there the
expo does look to be a pretty nice
you can stack up with the rest of them
anyway guys hope you enjoyed and I will
see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
