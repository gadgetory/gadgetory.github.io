lonely this week doing the show by

to be in person with jon rettinger so we
filmed the roundup together so we could
say that we don't know what the status
is of the chacha oh look at that see
that's why no I'm just I'm just happy to
be here folks our man John Q he's our
post-production editing production
mastermind he made John look prettier

the episode LP awards a point I'm not
going to spoil it you're going to have
to go watches check it out console wars
on TechnoBuffalo calm speaking of wars
what is going on in the tech blogosphere
I'm not one to generally report let
alone condone to report on blogger on
blogger violence if you will but a
former AOL can i call him the superstar
I've never met him but I've heard he's a
good guy got some friends and um I think
he's a superstar a former ll superstar
in gadget editor-in-chief ex
editor-in-chief Josh Topolsky left and
gadget a while back one of the world's
biggest tech blogs of course not as cool
as TechnoBuffalo but you know they do a
good job left a while back to go start a
new site with the folks at SB Nation the
new site which will be SB nation's first
foray into tech reporting is slated to
go live this fall in the meantime Josh
and his crew are working on something
called this is my next it's a tech blog
this is my next calm and Josh brought
some of his engadget friends with them
initially they've been picking up a few
more as they go and in the past week or
so they've just raided the pantry
bringing a bunch more x + gadget folks
and also somebody from switched another
AOL property or former ll property over
to this is my next and presumably to
stick around for when the new site
begins all things D reported this week
that this is my next squad is now up to
16 writers almost all of them former AOL
employees there's one person that comes
to mind not an al l person but everybody
else I'm sure there's more than one boss
how my head I can't think anymore in the
meantime so they've got 16 in the
meantime engadget lost a bunch of people
hired a bunch of new people they're
running with about twenty four writers
right now although by the time you read
this you know the way tech things go
that those numbers could change but what
is going on is it a personal thing
there's kind of this weird thing that
happened with back before Josh left with
Josh and the editor-in-chief of another
blog I'm going I'm gonna let that one
remain nameless for my own personal
reasons but we just kind of went off on
some some forums and in a blog post and
stuff slinging mud at Josh even though
they were both under the AOL umbrella I
don't know what's going on there you
know I've got friends at this is my next
I've got friends it engadget okay
they're not really friends but i like to
call them friends because it makes me
feel good so I'm not taking
as they're both cool sites but I tell
you what if you like tech you like the
internet and you like soap opera drama
keep an eye on this one it'll be
interesting to see what happens within
gadget and this is my next when it
becomes whatever it's becoming later on
this year with SB Nation speaking of
wars speaking of console wars speaking
of consoles here I did that just backed
up to go forward our own joey davidson
reported earlier this week on something
called PSN pass that may or may not
actually be coming to a playstation 3
near you in the near future but there's
something going around in the gaming
community PS somebody discovered
something called PSN paths which I know
details on it but it does make folks
think of EA pass which is basically a
system to ensure that if you buy a used
copy of the game the publisher has a
chance to make a little extra money off
of you by locking you out of certain
features like online play stuff like
that until you buy a pass so basically
the deal I guess the way it works with
EA you know I'm not the gaming expert
that's why you got to go read Joey story
I'm not just trying to get you to go to
the site it's true feels more about than
I do basically you have to pay 10 bucks
to unlock those features that when you
buy the game new in shrinkwrap off the
shelf you get a code and you can enter
that code to access you know online
features and add additional gameplay
features but then you know in the gaming
community life throws you play game
you're done with it you sell it you
trade it whatever you buy used games and
so EA has done something or if you buy
the used game you have to pay 10 bucks
extra to unlock those additional
features it looks like Sony may be
gearing up to do something similar with
their PlayStation games nothing official
on this just a rumor but something
called PSN pass worth keeping an eye on
if you're a PlayStation gamer the cost
and size requirements for entering the
world of high-end wireless audio may be
dropping maybe it's a rumor sonos makers
of and I have when sonus was kind enough
to send me a couple of their s 5 boxes
to check out with their new Android app
and and just straight up in all honestly
they're very impressive still knows that
a wireless music system it runs on their
own net worth is meshed network which
basically means I it's more reliable
than
Wi-Fi it works really well you can play
different music in different parts of
your home on different you know if you
have more than one system then you can
also sync them all up to play the same
music at the same time you're throwing a
party or whatever you know like me and
all my made-up blogger friends when we
have a party exactly anyway but the cost
to entry for sonos is kind of high
especially as compared to systems you
can throw together you know using Apple
hardware or a lot of the android based
phones you can use their systems out of
that kind of thing well apparently there
are rumors kicking around that sonos is
working on something called the s3 or
maybe the s3 play which would be a
little teeny tiny wireless speaker
system with the built in amp perhaps you
know kind of a bedside table size
apparently it's not there's no alarm
clock on the spy shots that have
surfaced on the internet but you know
kind of alarm clock sized which
hopefully would bring down not only the
size of the unit all the s5 i have is
not that big kind of the size of a big
ipod dock but also hopefully the price
because right now the s5 400 bucks great
audio quality but 400 bucks have a lot
for you know one's own of the system
when you have to piece together system
so maybe the s3 will bring down on the
size but the price of getting into the
world so knows and you know I don't know
it's just a rumor but I'm keeping an eye
on an ear on it if you will because I've
had great luck with the sonos system but
I was lucky enough just to have them
send me one it definitely is pricey so
stay tuned for more on that from sonos
if the s3 play does come to life
speaking of right how can I do this
speaking of the number three we're
talking about the sonos s3 Motorola
released the droid 3 earlier this week
and now there are rumors going to keep
doing this because the numbers keep
going back forth now there are rumors
that something that might be called the
zoom to has cleared the FCC if you
remember Motorola Xoom was the first
Android 30 honeycomb tablet to hit the
u.s. big advertising campaign that
started back at the Super Bowl earlier
this year came out on verizon and when
it first came out it was like boom the
first big you know I tablet with android
made for tablets and the whole thing and
then all the sudden the market flooded
with Android Honeycomb tablets and
frankly the zoom now looks a little big
a
little heavy the screens a little washed
out the price was a little high well
Motorola already started doing something
about it by cutting prices this week
zoom the Wi-Fi version to zoom now
available at most outlets for five
hundred dollars some places selling a
cheaper with coupon codes and sales and
whatnot but apparently zoom to may be in
the works with a slightly refined form
factor a little bit shorter a little bit
longer I guess and also this is the big
one the inclusion of an LTE radio 4G
radio in addition to cdma now that would
mark the zoom too if that's what it's
indeed going to be called for launch on
verizon and if you recall when the first
zoom came out the idea was that it would
be LTE upgradeable and then eventually
they would start shipping an LTE version
right out of the box so might we be
seeing that with a slightly reformed
form factor slightly refined form factor
you have to perform the form factor yet
reformer you do with it we've already
seen samsung launched the galaxy tab
internationally the 10 one and then
decide they needed to make a thinner
sleeker lighter version to actually ship
to compete with ipad 2 so Motorola might
be doing you know a similar thing the
tablet Wars definitely heating up did I
mention console wars yeah I did are you
