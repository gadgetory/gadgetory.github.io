TechnoBuffalo here I wanted to share my
first impressions with the first 3d
handheld console the Nintendo 3ds I've
been playing it for the past few hours
and this is by no means a full review
but I do want to share some initial
impressions of it so let's go ahead and
get started so I did not have a Nintendo
DSi or any of its variants the light the
XL or whatever else might have come so
this is my first experience with
Nintendo's clamshell design got to say
it feels very nice in the hand it is a
little bit on the bulky side it feels
like carrying around a rectangle but it
will fit in your pocket nicely it's got
a very high quality build to it alright
so let's go ahead and start with the
question that everybody wants to know
how does the 3d work well unfortunately
I can't show you a demonstration of the
3d it's not gonna quite capture on
camera but I can share my impressions
with it as you saw right here it's got a
very very quick boot up time this is my
first real hands-on with stereoscopic 3d
I had some great productions
stereoscopic 3d and that means glass is
free all right doesn't mean glass is
free but it translates to glass is free
you don't have to wear glasses if you
want to play two 3ds and I will say that
the 3d works really well it works just
as well as any other 3d technology I've
used whether that's passive or active
glasses passive is like when you go to
the movies and just put on a pair of
paper glasses with some film in there
actives they've ever used 3d glasses
with the 3d television you have to
actually turn them on and charge it
that's the active technology no glasses
required here it does work very well
however the stereoscopic 3d does have
some side effects I've got the street
fighter splash screen right here and as
you move the device so if you're holding
it let's say you are in a car for
example you're on a bus or a train and
there are some bumps the 3d it tends to
fade in and out as you move it and
there's a little bit of a shimmer to the
screen the 3d effect works you have to
be sort of staring in the right angle of
the screen so if you're in a bumpy
situation you're going to lose that 3d
effect that's going to come
back and that's all going to translate
to a significant headache using this and
I literally headache not a metaphorical
oh it's a pain in the butt
using this device for longer than 10 or
15 minutes made my eyes hurts
now Nintendo says take a 10-minute break
for every 30 minutes and that sounds
silly you see these warnings on the Wii
and other consoles you really need it
with the 3d s your eyes will definitely
hurt and if you're not holding it at
just the right angle you're not going to
see the 3d and you will get that shimmer
effect I know it's not going to
translate on camera you definitely have
to go try a 3d s in the store to see
what I'm talking about
the gaming experience actually had to
turn off the 3d effect go ahead and turn
it off right there to actually use it
without having that eyestrain and a
headache that has come along with it
this has been reported by a lot of early
users and this is no exception I was
able to watch active 3d and my friends
got a 3d television put on the glasses
were able to watch a movie for a few
hours with minimal eye strain certainly
there was a little bit there there is a
significant amount though again I want
to emphasize that enough
with the 3d s here so definitely try one
in store before you go and pick it up
the 3d like I mentioned does work well
but it's not really giving me warm fuzzy
feelings about all the 3d devices that
are coming out to evo 3d and other 3d
phones and 3d tablets they are going to
really hurt your eyes and give you a
headache now this may be unique to just
me but the only set of eyes I have are
in my head so it's only impression I can
give I will say that I've let other
people look at the 3d essence I've had
it for only 5 or 10 minutes I haven't
had it all that long they've reported to
various degrees the same sort of thing
that I've experienced from a gameplay
standpoint the graphics are pretty
decent you're not looking at a gaming
powerhouse right here but it hasn't
really been Nintendo's bread-and-butter
gameplay is fun just like most Nintendo
consoles this may not be geared at the
hardcore gamer but it does work very
well and you guys are looking at a
splash screen right here the operating
system is pretty smooth and actually I
didn't really have to be the stylus very
much resistive touchscreen was very
sensitive to my
you're in touch but yeah if you can deal
with the 3d effect you can own if you
can see anything change and the camera
as I move that slider if you can deal
with the 3d effect and if you can deal
with a little bit of an eye strain the
3ds might be worth picking up but I
can't emphasize enough going and trying
it first I got the cameras activator
right here you can sort of see my hands
in front of it it will take 3d pictures
so all maybe my opinions will change
they'll for review but I know a lot of
you are deciding whether or not you want
to pick this up sometime this week and I
wanted to get you some first impressions
before the review came out so you can
help make an educated decision for
yourself anyway guys I'm John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo be sure to
check out the website for all your tech
news and I will not see you in 3d in the
next video because I've got the slider
turned off
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
