TechnoBuffalo and today I'm going to
show you guys my top 5 android apps art
and start off the list is the Google
Play Music app and now what this is is
it's a cloud service for music and lets
you stream all your music from the cloud
without ever having to have your music
take up storage on your phone or on your
computer I'll talk about that in a
second as well but it's basically itunes
match for your android device it's the
same service but it's just made by
google and i actually like it better
than itunes match just because they
seemed to sink all the songs more
accurately than itunes match but that's
another story so basically lets you have
all of your all your songs so I got all
my songs in here and lets you upload
20,000 songs so that I did the math and
that's about five thousand eight hundred
gigabytes so I don't have anywhere near
that much but I'm sure some of you guys
do but this is what you have 20,000
songs up on the cloud that you guys can
stream any time you want as long as you
have LTE 3g or Wi-Fi so now this will
use data if you're not using Wi-Fi
obviously so make sure you guys just
stay on top of that and don't go over
your limit but let me just play you guys
a song really quick I think I was
playing Aerosmith before it's going to
click on this it will show you the album
then you can also click on all songs
i'll show you all the songs you have for
them I don't have a whole lot but then
you click on the song and it'll start
playing it right away I'm not going to
play it do to you know song issues but
either way it shows you the album work
you can go back and actually go through
all of your different artists as well
yeah all the artists here you can scroll
over the web see all the albums and then
all the songs as well and again this can
hold 20,000 songs so you guys will
basically be able to upload your entire
iTunes library its alter the google play
services so you do have to go on
Google's website or get the desktop app
to actually start uploading your songs
from your computer but after that you
guys can stream it from your phone from
your tablet from your computer you can
use it anywhere you want as long as you
have an internet connection and it works
great app number two is the clean master
now this is basically just like the
ccleaner on your desktop and because of
ever use ccleaner it does exactly the
same thing is that it can get rid of
your ram get rid of backed up files that
you don't need and all that kind of
stuff it basically clears out the
storage of your phone this is what it
looks like you can go into the history
the privacy the tasks
or the app manager and they all do
different things so I'll show you guys
each one of those the history basically
shows you all the cash in all of your
applications it shows everything that's
been stored from that and what you can
actually get rid of so it scans through
all the apps and then you hit clean and
it'll just actually clear all the cash
out for you and that way it'll clear up
memory they'll clear up some ram so you
guys can use more apps in the phone
won't be as slow so now privacy will
actually show you what apps are hiding
information not really hiding but will
store information for you so what you
have your SMS so you can show all your
text messages all your search history
everything like that so if you want to
go in and clear something such as your
facebook passwords or stuff you click on
this and then you go down to the bottom
and a clear data since I don't have any
I don't think on here right now it's not
going to clear any data but on other
apps like YouTube from the search
engines or your accounts or anything
like that you can go in and clear the
data and I'll actually erase that stuff
from your phone so if you want to give
it to a friend or something that you
don't want them to mess with your
account you can go in and clear that it
will also clear up some storage as well
so the tasks and the app manager
basically just show you what tasks are
running at that time and the app manager
just shows you which which apps are
installed and you guys can uninstall it
that way as well so this is clean master
and it's in the app store so app number
three is pdanet plus and now what this
does is it lets you use your phone as
either Wi-Fi hotspot or a tethered
device that you can stream your 3g or
your 4g internet to your computer or any
other device i can pick up Wi-Fi or you
can also use the USB cable to plug it
into the USB and right up there you got
USB tether and down here you can see
activate Wi-Fi hotspot now this uses
your data connection to actually give
other devices internet connection now
this is free in the App Store but it
does depend on your carrier I've been
using this on verizon and I haven't
gotten any notices about that but make
sure you guys read about your carrier's
make sure you see what did they say
about tethering and I don't want you
guys to get any trouble about this so
but this is one of my favorite apps
about tethering it lets me use it from
my desktop if I don't have any internet
connection around my laptop if I'm out
like on the road and I need a Wi-Fi
hotspot I can use my 4g that's on this
phone and connect my laptop and get
connected that way it's really great
it's free it's in the app store go check
it out app number four is iHeartRadio
and now this app has been up for a while
but I have been you
I do really really like it since I go to
school away from my hometown and I'm not
around my hometown's radio station DC
one I want it because we're wondering
that's my favorite radio station to
listen to I used to listen to it all the
time back home but now that I'm at
school I can't actually access it but I
Heart Radio actually lets you see other
radio stations from around the world
actually and connect to them and listen
in so I'm going to hit maybe later on
this because I don't want to set up an
account right now so you guys can see
down there that I've dc101 save so if I
click on that it will actually bring me
to DC 101's radio station and I can
listen in and settle listen to them so
to click on this it'll start streaming
that I'm going to pause it either way
but this is what it looks like you guys
have probably seen it before you can
like song as you can dislike songs and
you can actually listen in to the radio
stations that you're not near any more
and I use this almost every day because
of dc101 I've grown up listening to them
so I love listen to them and I'm really
happy that I can get this from away from
my hometown so this is iHeartRadio and
once again it's free in the App Store so
the fifth and final lap is google drive
and this is exactly like Dropbox I'm
sure you guys have heard of it before
but the best thing about it is that it
gives you 5 gigabytes of data right off
the bat you guys can use it for all of
your storage stuff I use it mainly for
school and for sending files to
different people but you guys can see up
there I have a school folder so I right
all my class notes on my laptop and then
I sync it through google drive so i'm
going to go into my eye tech folder
which i have synced one of my classes
that I type my notes up on so I can
click on that and actually see what I
typed up on my computer on my phone I
can see all my class notes it really
really helps with synchronizing all my
data and all my notes basically from
school to all my other computers it
sinks it automatically you can get it
for your desktop as well as your phone
and your tablets it works great you guys
can basically upload any file that you
have I have some videos there I have a
zip folder there as well as the dot exe
for a driver installer for my laptop but
I use it for everything i use it for
school mainly to sync my notes between
my computers you give 5 free gigs of
storage to Google Drive compared to I
think it's 2 gigabytes on dropbox you
can upgrade that's like 18 gigabytes on
dropbox but you have to have other email
accounts linked up to it and everything
but this gives you five gigs right off
the bat and you can start uploading your
stuff right away but this is
probably my most used app Google Drive I
use it on all my devices and I use it
every single day so let me know what you
think in the comment section down below
makes you check out technobuffalo com
for all of your tech news my name is
david taylor and i'll see you all in the
next one thanks guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
