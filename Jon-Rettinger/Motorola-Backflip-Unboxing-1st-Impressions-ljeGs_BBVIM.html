John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here with an unboxing for you of the
Motorola backflip this is the first
Android phone that AT&amp;amp;T is carried what
it assume will be the first of many it's
gonna set you back about 99 bucks on a
two-year contract after mail-in rebate
I'll go through all the specs and take a
look at the device but let's dig in I am
an 18 t user and I've been long admiring
other carriers whether it's been the
Droid the Nexus One being able to get
some 3G speeds on Android so I'm really
looking forward to seeing what the
bakflip can do go ahead and thrash into
the packaging hopefully without slicing
off a finger which is never a guarantee
that should be enough to get in there a
decent amount of thrashing I've got the
package open go ahead and slide it out
it looks like AT&amp;amp;T is starting to use
smaller boxes for their devices nothing
else in the package here is the Motorola
backflip sort of a familiar looking box
I've got a picture the device on the
front on the side you get some
information about legality on the back
we got some specs is probably a good
time to go over them it is running
Android OS it's running 1.500 18 t Hat's
said it will be upgraded we're also
looking at a quad band phone which is
quite nice ability that go abroad and of
course running on att's 3G network it's
got Wi-Fi up to 350 minutes of talk time
up to 32 gigabytes expandable a 3.1 inch
high res touch screen there's been
conflicting reports about whether or not
it's resistive or capacitive but we'll
try that in just one minute and this is
running a top of motoblur which is
motorola sort of skin on top of Android
it weighs about fifteen point three
ounces and a screen resolution of 480 by
320 so let's go ahead and dig in I had a
chance to see this at CES a few months
back but it was a pre-production version
so I've got the Quick Start Guide on top
if I never look at that and here we have
you Motorola backflip put that off to
the side for just a minute see what else
you're gonna get in the box
probably the usual array of accessories
you get a USB cable which uses looks
like micro USB the wall charger to plug
that USB cable into the just discussed
and battery and the back of the phone
let's go ahead and take a look at the
phone itself got a very sort of unique
uh form factor here so the reason it's
called the backflip is well the keyboard
flips backwards sending out the phone
closed the keyboard is exposed
they say it's completely sealed in no
dust is going to get into it a little
bit on the thicker side but definitely
pocketable it's not by far not the
largest Android phone on the marketplace
so it probably slots in between let's
take a look at how the keyboard feels on
first blush one of the knocks she always
had on slide-out keyboards was that the
first row was often very hard to type on
because this leads screen split down and
often cover it up a bit
this sort of rectify that problem the
keyboard does feel nice it is backlit
there's a bit of raised and rich trim as
you guys can see so you can feel the
difference right off the bat this
keyboard feels much better than the
keyboard on the droid weirdly there is
the camera with a five megapixel sensor
with it appears to be LED flash actually
on the keyboard since well it's at the
back so go ahead and take a look a rest
around the device on the back is
something very interesting - it's a
touch pad lets you control it almost
like you would with a d-pad on the front
of the device so when you're using it
you can have your finger touching on the
back to scroll along we'll see how that
works
looks like it does come with a micro SD
card of two gigabyte size so that's
quite nice and a SIM card slot so I'm
gonna go ahead and pop a SIM card in
here well boot it up and we'll do some
quick first impressions of motoblur but
before we do let's finish taking a look
at the device on the right side you've
got volume up and down you've got your
micro USB port you've got a camera
button 3.5 millimeter jack got your coal
and buttons not
on the left-hand side and nothing on the
bottom it's actually a very clean design
that's got a thinner than it was back at
CES I wonder if they redid the hardware
so I'm gonna read pop the battery and
we'll take a look okay so the batteries
in before we power it up let's see how
this stacks up to some other Android
devices and it's Motorola stablemates
so here we've got the Big Daddy droid
you can see that the back flip is much
smaller we've got the sort of local
sibling here that have our next go ahead
and stack them on top and you can see
how all three devices stack up from a
thickness perspective
despite its weird layout it definitely
looks as though the back flip is
thinnest ative of the devices and the
obligatory comparison to the iPhone and
see how the screens compare there and
thickness the iPhone starting to look
downright fat let's go ahead and power
this thing on I didn't put a sim card in
but hopefully we'll be able to see
what's going on it's just a quick view
and I'll be doing a full overview of the
phone of motoblur and everything else in
later videos pull off the screen
protector if that satisfying whooshing
noise and we will test what whether or
not this is a capacitive or resistive
screen which is pretty easy to do so it
took about two minutes total for the
first boot up it certainly didn't find a
network or ten means think means it
didn't launch the motoblur interface
sorta have to go through a setup process
but let's check by thought this
capacitive or resistive so I've got a
finger here it says please insert the
SIM card go ahead and unlock the phone
and you use the unlock button on
motoblur that's sort of Foursquare
button so it's saying I can make an
emergency call I can tap it with my
finger and we'll watch that video we'll
go back to lock in the device let's try
and using it a pen which appears to have
no effect which means that we are in
fact dealing with a capacitive
touchscreen shows you that Megan right
now the difference resistive is done by
two layers of film making contact which
is why a pen or a stylus would work
whereas capacitive you
is just a finger so we can put that
rumor to rest it is of course a
capacitive screen for more wafters of
the device and showing you how the OS
works be sure to stay tuned to
TechnoBuffalo comm for all of your
backflip needs I'm John Rhett enjoy and
I will see you in the next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
