from TechnoBuffalo here one question
that I get quite a bit is what do I have
at my desk this is where I work this is
where the business gets run so you know
it's not so special and fancy I don't
have LEDs and lights going on here it's
more of a functional workspace I figured
I'd show you what I've got when I look
at everyday what's on my desk maybe
it'll help you guys figure out something
you might need or maybe you'll be like
John you need to have this and leave in
the comments so I'll be like a thank you
I picked that up so let's get started so
a computer that I use mostly is the it's
first kiss now current generation iMac
with retina display the 5k iMac it's not
the highest spec computer out there but
it works well enough I don't do any of
my own video editing anymore so I didn't
need sort of killer specs it's the four
gigahertz i7 to 16 gigs of ram and the
AMD Radeon r9 on here
kick the to it I've got a ton of
different stuff so I've got each monitor
on two stands I've got a 27-inch cinema
display on here which I'm itching to
replace probably with one of those
awesome new LG Thunderbolt displays but
I was running out of USB ports so what I
did was I picked up two stands that each
have four USB ports on it was really
helpful so I've got no shortage of ports
now I also have an al gato thunderbolt
dock here which is nice to have little
faster power on the USB I've got audio
in and out some more USB ports on the
back
I still do these amount of traveling so
when I travel I would keep these things
here so I can charge them this is like
the gigantic 12 times external battery
pack from mophir the one actually has a
cords built-in I picked up the one that
has micro USB but I keep inside of there
one of the Lightning adapters or the m/l
lightning adapter so no matter where I
am or what device I'm using I can't
which just users whether I'm using an
iOS or another device it's a little bit
on the unwieldy side but it also will
charge a MacBook via USB C so it's nice
to have a battery that big I also have a
Mophie Juice Pack under there as well my
mouse I'm just using one of the old
Logitech MX not using the MX master this
one's worked really well for me I'm
actually moving on over here to the left
hand side this is actually a product
that we
on Kickstarter and it's coming to market
very soon this is the duet charger for
the Apple watch and iPhone so it's
pretty cool you put the Apple watch
charger in there you can dock your phone
next to it and serve a nice elegant way
to charge your charger devices all the
links all the stuff - I'll put down
below so you guys can check it out
including the duet I've got the Samsung
Qi charger here the Galaxy s6 edge is
one of my daily drivers so I'm always
keeping that charged for headphones I
reviewed these a while back and I really
loved them
they are the parent Zeke twos battery
life is not great I do have an extra
battery pack for it but it it's been you
know I plug it in when I leave the desk
and that's pretty much it
over here this is a little Bose
controller I've got two speakers on each
side let's mute and it lets me unmute
and control the volume as well as have
headphones in and out if I want to plug
in and go wired otherwise those geeks
just use bluetooth and then there are
the two speakers further over here on
the left it's just another USB charging
dock with a ton of cords coming out of
it obviously I charge a lot of devices
and things I'm testing so I can keep
them all plugged in there and have to
worry about searching and looking for
USB cords what my favorite things to
travel with review these guys a while
back this is the Keystone essentially
it's a external battery pack you can
plug in and charge like any others but
it's also Qi enabled so you can throw a
device on here that you can use wireless
charging you could charge it truly
without wires and its really cool you
can get a ton of them and put one on top
of another and charge them all without
wire so really kind of cool also like
the way it looks think it looks kind of
slick and it feels nice so go ahead and
put that back and this is my desk this
is what I use it's it's functional it's
like me it's not flashy functional and
it gets the job done anyway thank you
guys for watching hope you enjoyed
something you think that I'm missing it
that I need to let me know leave in the
comments and I don't pick it up and if
something that's kind of cool I'll
review it I thank you guys for watching
again hope you enjoyed til next time
John render from TechnoBuffalo see guys
