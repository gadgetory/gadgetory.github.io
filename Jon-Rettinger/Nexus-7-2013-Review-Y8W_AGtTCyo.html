TechnoBuffalo here's a full review for
you of this guy the brand's new 2013
Nexus 7 it brings a ton of Android
hotness and his little 7 inch form
factor let's go ahead break it down see
if it's worth your tablet buying buck
as I'd like to do with all my reviews
let me give you a disclaimer I use this
as my daily tablet for six days and in
conjunction with an iPad Mini for two
more so make this video very simple I'm
gonna break it out into two parts what I
liked and what I didn't like first thing
that I loved about this tablet is that
gorgeous gorgeous screen it's a 7 point
2 inch 1920 by 1200 screen little extra
there for those on-screen buttons
everything looks absolutely beautiful on
it it's got bright rich colors video
looked absolutely incredible as a
pleasure to watch video whether it was
YouTube or HD content that I downloaded
from the Google Play Store it was
incredible
pictures and text looked absolutely
awesome as well there was no sort of
pixelation as you zoomed all the way and
as you'd expect it just looked really
good the white that was a really white
the black clothes were really black
everything about this screen was
absolutely awesome in fact I'd say it's
probably one of the best screens I've
ever used next thing I liked is the
design it's not the thinnest tab on the
world at point four three inches it's
not the lightest at 10.23 ounces but it
feels razor thin and the weight is
really evenly distributed the tablet's
got sort of a beveled edge to the side
so it feels really thing when you hold
it if ever held one of the HTC 8x phones
or the 8 X T you'll know what I'm
talking about it feels just really
incredibly thin I really appreciated the
thin bezels on the side in portrait mode
as well even as you hold it there's just
enough room for your thumbs on the
outside but other than that everything
else was pretty solid from the design
standpoint I like that as a camera it's
a 5 megapixel sensor on the back and a
1.2 on the front not for taking pictures
at events or much but I likes I can
video chat on an app want to take a
picture for Instagram or Facebook I've
got the option to do that's the
inclusion of cameras regardless of
quality I was really nice
next is the processor the s4 pro is
really fast I went to the two gigs of
rent and made Android run buttery smooth
I never felt I had to worry about memory
management or maybe out if I was playing
up you know memory intensive game or
processor intensive game I was gonna
slow down no issues at all with that it
ran Android really really really quickly
I would expect it's a reference device
for Android 4.3 and it just absolutely
hauls so if you play heavy games you
want to watch HD video have no worries
or qualms about picking up the Nexus 7
someday I don't really talk about that
much of a tablet I talk a lot about it
with phones and that is the audio the
built-in speakers on this sound really
really really good
like almost sounds like I had some big
speaker plug into it
very impressive audio next and that's
sort of one reason you pick up Nexus
device it's pure naked unadulterated
Android I loved I loved making Android
my own I loved downloading the widgets
that I liked and loading you know HD
widgets or anything else that makes a
tablet my own really I just anything
that's naked Android I love it gets me
the ability to customize it's one of the
best benefits of Android and of course
being a Nexus device it's got that in
spades
lastly wireless charging something that
I don't think that much about but I
really found myself using I have a ton
of Qi standard chargers I just do the
tablet right on since I found the right
area to charge just started charging was
really a a very handy thing to have so
wireless charging definitely a thumbs up
but I hope every device moving forward I
can take advantage of that standard so
it's clearly a lot to like about the
tablet but there's also quite a few not
to like about it the big one for me is
Wi-Fi I had similar issues with the
original Nexus 7 the radio had a really
hard time picking up signals I tested at
four different locations at my home at
the office at my wife's parents home and
then at my own parents home and each
time I had a really tough time grabbing
on to Wi-Fi I know room issues when I
was you know browsing the web or
downloading emails but I noticed it
especially when I was trying to watch a
video I made it a real chore about
streaming video on here and if I took it
next to a comparable iPad Mini I closed
all the applications I tried to load a
beta exactly the same time and the same
YouTube app it was almost twice as fast
on the iPad Mini and I read speed tests
showed the speed tests were fine for
some reason the Wi-Fi just would cut out
and the signal strength was not pulling
anything at expect so really
disappointed with the Wi-Fi now
obviously the caveat that might have
just been my one review device we did
not have time to get to device into test
but when we get other devices in if this
is a problem with just one device I'll
be sure to update it so in the likes
comments I mentioned a lot of things
about the design but it's far from
perfect
I loved how they did these bezels on the
side but I did not like these big fat
chunky bezels on the top and bottom they
are absolutely
humongous on really seemed totally
unnecessary it makes a tablet just seems
really really long the next one from
design standpoint I didn't like is this
here power button it feels almost
totally flush to the body it's hard
differentiating the power button and the
volume up and down it didn't feel
natural trying to find it and push it so
I really would've wish there was a more
pronounced hard butt or a different
locations so I knew always that was
power next this is a big issue for me as
battery it's got a 3950 million power
battery which you figure should be great
let me tell you a little bit about my
tablet usage it's connected to Wi-Fi
obviously all the time is to make them
find a Wi-Fi signal and it's my
something to do with a battery issue
because it kept trying to search for
Wi-Fi it's pulling in two accountants
checking emails every five minutes
usually I do some pretty heavy video
viewing and I don't watch a lot of
YouTube video I'd say probably about an
hour and a half to two hours of video
viewing the about twenty to thirty
minutes of light web browsing other than
that I just pretty much leave it on its
own I do keep the brightness up quite a
bit I like a bright tablet that's
usually around 88% at the end of the day
with the Nexus 7 I had about 50% of
battery life 100% charge it's an iPad
Mini in the same usage it had about 75%
of battery life so 25% difference was
really discouraging I obviously get
through a full day be expected with the
tablet trying to get through two or
three days might definitely be a
struggle
now with the Nexus 7 so if you want to
pick up this device definitely be
mindful of the power I turn the
brightness down and I was able to get
much longer battery life so you might
have to sort of change how you use the
tablet I'm hopeful though that a
software update you know might fix the
Wi-Fi issue and I subsequently fix the
battery issue so what is this Nexus 7
tablet get I really wanted to like it I
love naked Android I'm really big on
Nexus devices but at the end the Wi-Fi
and battery were huge huge issues for me
so I got a final score of an 8 if the
Wi-Fi issue gets fixed and the battery
becomes better this easily could have
been a nine nine and a half tablet it is
absolutely incredible I love everything
about it
but it became really hard to use without
Wi-Fi I got a consistent Wi-Fi Wi-Fi
could rely on and if I'm traveling and I
have to be using my tablet all the time
I eat something it's I know is always
going to work and I wouldn't feel
comfortable taking this with me
now again I'm hopeful it was just as
this unit and if something happens I can
get another hand my hands on another one
relatively student I can test it I'll be
sure to
date the review and let you guys know
but at least for right now I got to give
this an 8 which is still a very very
solid score what do you guys think do
you agree I disagree I'd love to hear
your thoughts if you have a nexus own
you had similar Wi-Fi issues leave them
