to you by lynda.com well that's up
everyone John Renji from TechnoBuffalo
it's an unboxing of this guy covering my
face it is the latest Chromebook from
Toshiba it's actually won one of our CES
Best in Show awards it comes in a pretty
awesome 209 price packs a decent
Chromebook punched go ahead open it up
and take a first look I think here is
the box for the Toshiba Chromebook
looking all laptop II but don't confuse
this with a Windows machine this is all
Chrome OS all the time
I just call it Toshiba Chromebook manum
makes life pretty easy ass picture of
the device right there on the front on
the back of it there's another picture
of the device on the spine we list all
the specs but you're not here to read I
will run you through all the specs
anyway let's go ahead and cut the
classic here all right tapes cuts go
ahead and pull up the tab and some
things don't fall over all over me we
will do this right-side up and boom
we've got what I think is probably gonna
be a Chromebook under here alright so
we've got a QuickStart guide for getting
started relatively quickly we've got a
power cable and power cable and power
brick it's a proprietary a little up in
style in case you're wondering
non-magnetic or anything all right but
that's not overly exciting here is the
Chromebook this actually won one of our
best of CES awards because of its price
it comes in at a pretty startling a 299
dollars so you get you know pretty
capable little Chromebook for a
relatively inexpensive price go ahead
and open that pull this thing out and
grand reveal boom Toshiba Chromebook all
chromed out like it just got back from
Pitt my ride so we're going to open it
up and you are looking at a 13 inch
screen I don't believe that as a
touchscreen if I remember correctly but
we'll take a look at that when we turn
it on it's
on the spine two USB 3.0 ports it's got
an Intel Celeron processor in here as
well and it's also gonna come with the
hundred gigs of SkyDrive and a pretty
beastly battery that should get you
about nine hours so you've got HDMI out
as well 3.5 millimeter headset jack SD
card reader which is also a nice feature
then you've got a lock port let's go
ahead Jenna's going on and see it looks
like so you got the computer all set up
and I will say the keyboard feels really
really nice as I mentioned it is
definitely not a touchscreen it's HD it
appears to be just 720 so it's typical
Chrome OS here
you've gone sort of a display of icons
you can pick what you want down there
if you go into your essentially your app
drawer you can see what's here again
it's all sort of web enabled and web
cactus but I think Google's in a really
nice job and it seems to be getting
better and better you've got a file
explorer now here and things of this
sort of become important to using a
regular OS the server gets closer and
closer to being a regular operating
system but of course Chrome and all of
its chrome glory is here the keyboard is
really nice to type on feels like any
full-size keyboard the touchpad here
isn't the multi-touch and scrolling is
really really smooth on it it has sort
of almost like a plasticy clicky feel to
it and it's sort of hard to translate
over the video but it works really well
on a giant so probably one of the better
touch pads i've seen on a Chromebook
again I do wish there was a touch screen
option here to scroll but for the price
you can certainly live without it so
this has been a first look and unboxing
at the Toshiba Chromebook any particular
