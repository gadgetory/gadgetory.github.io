from TechnoBuffalo here and i want to
give you an overview of the new Xbox 360
dashboard update that went live today
August 11th and there's a lot of big
exciting things here so I'm gonna go
ahead and walk you through some of the
main ones the first one that Microsoft
announced was the Avatar marketplace
gives you the ability to customize your
digital self so let me go ahead and show
you what that looks like so there's my
avatar you can see I got the Nirvana
look with the 70s - pretty badass I know
I would go down to customize advert art
and essentially what you can do here is
you can customize well your little
digital person with apparel from fashion
designers you can also purchase
interactive props like a little halo
word hog for example I will spin around
yet and you can also earn avatar reward
items from playing games let me show you
what this looks like so you go down to
marketplace and it loads up here and
here you've got your marketplace you
view it by some adidas stuff Star Wars
Clone Wars I'm not even gonna try and
pronounce that tody coo-all most popular
it's better most popular and see what we
got
Splinter Cell outfit can look like a
badass ninja I can be Star Wars and the
rebel assault here give myself a little
bit of a camera you see the cameras
interactive it kind of jumped around I
can play with it myself some new kicks
got some adidas there let's say I want
to be in Star Wars some of these things
are gonna cost you uh Microsoft Points
some of them are not so you can see
right here this one is gonna cost 80
Microsoft Points I have no idea what
they're weird conversion is but know
that some of these things are going to
cost you some of them you can earn by
playing games but definitely be aware
that none of this of course is free
let's take a look at some of the other
things that we got here there's a
Bioshock helmet Jedi shirt or um say I
downloaded it do you know you guys can
see sort of what is what is here and
where your choice starts let's go back
check out some lifestyle collections
and you can view some of the big brands
here let's check out adidas and you can
see some of so if they have so I can
view a tref truck or hurt
truck or a hat and I can look a little D
baggy but that should look in style then
there you go you can download it and you
can play around of it so let's go ahead
and move right along to the other big
update well go ahead and exit this and
watch your little avatar will do with
dance meter done whoo point to the sky
the next big update our games on demand
these aren't just demos or just old Xbox
games for the original Xbox
these are full-featured Xbox 360 games
and this is actually really really cool
and Microsoft is the first company it's
actually allowed you to download full
modern console new games let me show you
what this looks like so go to game
marketplace and we can scroll on up to
this new games on demand and if you
select it you can pick just from a nice
selection of Xbox 360 games some of them
are a little bit old some of them you
might not want to play like Star Wars
The Complete Saga the Lego addition I
think it's a really fun game and I
really liked it Call of Duty 2 a great
game
Bioshock I haven't play but I've heard a
lot of great things about it you
download these directly to your hard
drive so you may want to run out and
update your hard drive if you got an
older Xbox 360 with a smaller hard drive
so you're gonna take a decent amount of
space let's take a look at one of them
so I haven't played Bioshock that
probably a fun one to play we'll go
ahead and click it so you can buy it you
can get demo and you can see that it
cost just about 30 bucks for the game
which is not bad it does say remotely on
to your hard drive so you know if you're
interested and you want to do games on
the man you're sitting at home you
really want to play something they
haven't played yet for 30 bucks you get
a digital copy which is not bad
considering most games you're gonna run
around 50 bucks those are a little bit
older so maybe you can find them actual
a physical disc for the same price but
it's nice
you have the choice and I assume that
something like this is gonna get updated
much more regularly and I wouldn't be
surprised to see even new games be
available for download ah the day
they're released that's certainly
nothing that's been announced yet but it
would definitely seem like a more
natural progression for things to follow
so let's go ahead and check out some the
other things the next thing that we now
have are user ratings you can read games
and features and you can make them on a
five-star system and you can sort by
rating so if you're looking for
five-star games you can search for
five-star games so they can actually
check out we can go back to games
on-demand you can see top rated now you
can see how these games are are all
rated here you can see that we've got a
five-star system so here's C go back to
Bioshock and you can see that's got a
lot of rankings up there right above the
price it's got almost 5 stars up there
so that's kind of neat
the next thing that they updated was
improved party invites now you can
launch a party with just one click and
you can pull up a game right from the
achievements browser which is kind of
neat and they also just increase a lot
of speed so they claim and a lot of
stability you can now have I believe
more than 100 friends which was a
limitation of the older architecture so
that is quite nice as well although that
may not have been a fully rolled out but
that is in Microsoft's plans the next
thing to know is and one of the things I
like about 360 one of the big reasons I
got it was for Netflix on demand if
you're holding out hope that Netflix on
demand would come to the ps3 would come
to the Wii you are going to be waiting a
very long time because with this update
and I'll tell you that Netflix is
exclusive to the Xbox 360 and not
exclusive like it was yesterday when it
wasn't on any other console exclusive
like Microsoft probably bought the
rights to have the console of streaming
ability for Netflix something something
to keep in mind and I just wanted to
give you away
sort of sure it's sort of in depth
walkthrough of the new Xbox Dashboard
update if you own an Xbox turn your
console on it'll prompt you to download
it seems to be worthwhile even just for
some of the cool new features hope you
enjoyed what do you guys think
the update any features that you want
that you didn't get is it worthwhile for
