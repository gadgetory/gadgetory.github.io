and from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
video we'll be showing you guys three
android launchers you should check out
for the month of July we've done a few
videos before showcasing other Android
launcher so if you guys haven't seen
those videos yet make sure to check out
the links in the description below so
the first one on our list is the Nokia Z
launcher which is free from the Google
Play Store when it comes to Android
customizability is a key factor to the
user experience
there are many launchers to choose from
but there's only a select few that are
as minimalistic as the Z launcher and
not only that nokia promises intelligent
minimalism for starters the nokia
launcher reduces your home screen to be
as minimal as possible the top portion
of the screen has your basic information
like the time and calendar events and
right below that it'll display 6 apps
contacts or web links that it thinks
you're going to want to use over time
the launcher should learn your habits
even depending on what time of day it is
and change what it displays to best suit
your needs beyond the home screen dirt
also an app drawer to the right where it
shows all of your apps in alphabetical
order and a new edition in Z launcher is
the new widget home screen to the left
which means you'll be able to add any
widgets you have installed on your
device so what makes the Z launcher so
different well the hidden talent of the
Z launcher is its gesture control to be
able to trace a letter on your home
screen and it'll show you apps web links
and contacts beginning with that letter
trace another letter and it'll narrow
down the selection even more it's pretty
accurate and it's pretty snappy to use
as well of course the gesture control of
the Z launcher is something that we'll
need to get used to but it's definitely
an interesting take for an Android home
screen the nokia z launcher is still in
beta so a lot of what we're showing you
today could be different when the final
version hits so the second one on our
list is nova launcher which is also free
from the Google Play Store nova launcher
as you may all know isn't a new launcher
at all but quite recently it's been
updated to fit the overall look of
Google's material design there are new
animations new wallpapers and new icons
to fit Google's material design as well
nova launcher is probably one of the
most popular launchers in the Android
ecosystem I personally use nova launcher
on a daily basis because i can customize
pretty much everything on my home screen
and with the updated app there's a ton
of new features that i think are really
cool with the latest version of nova
launcher you now have the ability to
search inside the app drawer which is
super convenient if you have a lot of
apps installed on your Android device
and the widget picker also received the
same treatment you'll now be able to
quickly search for a widget and
also see what widget was installed
recently if you upgrade to Nova Launcher
prime for five dollars you can unlock
new features such as gestures which will
allow you to launch certain apps for
example if I swipe up on my app drawer
icon it'll launch Nova settings but I
can also change that shortcut to launch
other apps and launch other shortcuts if
I'd like you'll also be able to hide
apps in your app drawer to hide
unnecessary bloatware ad unread count
badges so you'll never miss a message
and also add custom app drawers to show
your favorite apps front and center
other than that you also have the option
to change the icon size to make your
icon smaller or bigger the font and its
size scroll effects animations and the
ability to change how many rows and
columns you'd like to have on your
desktop so you can pretty much customize
everything on your homescreen which is
really nice if you're looking to
customize your homescreen and you want
to be able to hide apps and use gestures
to launch apps you can't go wrong with
Nova Launcher so the last one owner
lists is action launcher 3 which is also
free from the google play store while
action launcher may look a lot like Nova
Launcher from the get-go there's
actually a couple of cool features that
action offers that other launchers such
as Nova doesn't offer one of those
features would have to be the slide-out
app drawer it's somewhat reminiscent of
the old Windows menu bar where it shows
you the list of apps you have installed
on your computer it's very similar to
that and while it takes a little getting
used to it's a really fast way to get
apps that aren't on your home screen
you'll still be able to use your app
drawer if you'd like by adding the
widget to your home screen but a single
swipe to the right will reveal your apps
right away so there's really no need to
add that widget unless you must really
have it on your home screen another
feature that stands out in action
launcher is the way widgets work just
like any other modern launcher you'll be
able to place widgets like normal in any
of your pages but that takes up space
what action launcher did was allow you
to swipe on an icon and have its widget
appear on top of your home screen this
feature is called shutters and it'll
change your life for example I swipe
down on Phoenix it'll show me my Twitter
timeline and I'll also be able to tweet
without launching the app which is super
nice the cool thing about this feature
is that you can choose which widget you
want it to launch when you perform the
swipe gesture there's also covers which
will allow you to launch apps and
shortcuts without compromising the look
of your homescreen
it's essentially a folder and an app all
in one similar to shutters if you swipe
up or down on an app that has covers it
will reveal your folder but if you tap
on the app
it'll launch the app right away
something new in Action launcher 3.5 is
a new customizable search bar called
quick bar it essentially allows you to
add app shortcuts to the search bar
making it so much easier to access your
favorite apps there's a few presets you
can choose from that are dedicated to
social media
music productivity and one for Google
search customization is also a big
factor in action launcher while you can
use different icon packs and use
different fonts there's a feature built
into action launcher called quick theme
which uses material designs color
extraction technique on your wallpaper
to apply the appropriate color schemes
throughout your homescreen from the app
drawer to the quick bar status bar and
appleís it's all customizable the only
thing about Action launcher 3 that I'm
not necessarily a big fan of is that if
you want to fully enjoy this launcher
you have to upgrade to the plus version
which costs $4.99 the price is a bit
steep but if you're looking for a
simplistic launcher and you rely heavily
on widgets and you don't want to
compromise your home screens look the
plus version is well worth the extra
bucks anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
