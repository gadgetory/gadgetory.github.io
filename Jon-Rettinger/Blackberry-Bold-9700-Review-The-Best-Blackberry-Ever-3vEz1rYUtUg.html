here the view for you of the BlackBerry
Bold 9700 for t-mobile this is going to
run you about 129 bucks on a two-year
contract after rebate so I would start
off my phone reviews or the discussion
of the cult quality because no matter
what these things do or how much they
can handle if they don't make good phone
calls you're going to be of little use
to you
so t-mobile service is gonna vary from
region to region where I am in Southern
California I have five bars of 3G and
fantastic call quality
I had no white noise on my end callers
have no white noise on the other end and
it sounded almost a landline ask quality
wise I know drop calls in the time that
I was testing this and even transition
from 3G down to edge the call kept going
without being dropped which was quite
nice so the big thing with the
BlackBerry Bold 9700 got a few internal
upgrades but sort of the big upgrade the
one that I was the most skeptical about
was the loss of the trackball and the
addition of this optical trackpad
admittedly I wasn't quite sure Alice is
going to work I've tested a trackpad on
a few other phones smart reserved
specifically the Samsung epics a little
while ago and I did not like how it
worked that was in a Windows Mobile
setting a here we've got of course in
the BlackBerry OS actually it becomes
quite natural works really nicely
definitely took about a day to get used
to it if you're used to soar the old
trackballs I'm going to want to spend
some time figure out how much to swipe
your finger left or right you can adjust
sensitivity to receive you the best but
actually became very natural and fit and
really nicely with the BlackBerry
operating system you can see right
here--an is going through menus sort of
one swipe up or one swipe left to right
is all you need you sure done with that
scrolling of the ball at I'm going to
keep on like this and like this it's it
becomes a lot easier to navigate so
actually was very impressed so if you're
worried about the trackpad as I was you
can sort of put those concerns to rest
one of the places where I think it comes
in most handy is in the browser now
certainly BlackBerry's browser is a bit
on the anemic side although they did
demonstrate
a WebKit which really is the same basis
for the browser on the iPhone and the
Android devices so full HTML fidelity
they demonstrated this new browser at
this year's Mobile World Congress there
was no really set data when it was going
to be released but you can expect a
better browsing experience but for what
you're going to get with this phone the
trackpad works quite well as far as
navigating it's much easier it's a bit
more natural scrolling almost like you
get on a laptop trackpad and you can
zoom in just by tapping it and it has
the same functionality as a baldon you
can push it in and activate you know
zoom or some many functions that way so
I've been a pretty big blackberry fan
for a while but I haven't used a phone
with a dedicated keyboard in a while and
I also forgot how much I missed it the
keyboard on the bold I think it's going
to be either a love-hate thing for you
but for me I really enjoyed it the
keyboard was very easy to use there was
a bit of a learning curve and sort of
training my fingers where to hit there
are these metal sort of rod you can see
extending through the keyboard often
times I would hit that metal piece
instead of the keys but after about a
day and a half to two days I was hauling
through it pretty accurately let's go
ahead and show you how the keyboard
works here go ahead and start a new
message we'll close out of this and I'll
just type through my standard this is a
test
so pretty accurate I typed very long
emails on this like I said it took me
about a day or so to get used to it but
I did very quickly so if you're a really
a bold user you're used to the previous
generation Boulder you're upgrading from
the curve the keyboard is going to be a
very nice experience the keys have a lot
of tactile feedback sure about a weird
design they're slanted in a few
directions but you will become a natural
Adam so blackberry is really known for
one thing and a really one thing only I
think they do better than anybody else
and that is email if you are an email
power user if you rely on email for
everything you need sort of file
management and the ability to arrange
your emails and surf track up and star
them and to send them up any way you'd
like there is no better option than a
blackberry and the bold 9700 sort of
reaffirms that I'm a dedicated iPhone
user and using the email client of
blackberry really made me remember how
bad the iPhones email client is things
came through using BlackBerry's push
services immediately I was able to serve
star and flag messages come back to them
later able to set up folders it just
made for a much more seamless experience
although you're gonna have to read those
emails on a relatively small screen
am ia to zoom the font and a pretty big
be able to read enough god I've got nice
eyes that that work relatively well so
you know if you can deal with a little
bit of a smaller screen and email is
important to you I'm going to be
hard-pressed to find the device does
email better than the blackberry 9700
the 3.2 megapixel camera on the back
with flash takes pictures about as good
as you'd expect you know average quality
nothing you're going to hang on a wall
I'm not going to be Ansel Adams with
this thing but you can take you know
shots of your friends drunk at a bar and
send them off later as blackmail won't
be a problem there are a few other sort
of additions to this phone
there's inclusion of visual voicemail
which is quite nice so if you're used to
individual voice mount other devices
you'll have access to that of course on
the bold 9700 you also get a ton of apps
in BlackBerry's app
that you can download and sort of
improve your device as you'd like
so in conclusion it's a blackberry and
it's probably the best BlackBerry out
there so if you know you're getting
yourself into if email is important to
you you want to slim form back you need
a QWERTY keyboard you can deal with the
bit smaller spring and you get on a
dedicated touchscreen device like the
storm you're not going to find much
better than being bold in 9700 t-mobile
service was very strong this is a apply
for Mesmer release on other carriers so
you can share this review for those as
well but at least on t-mobile service it
works very very quickly and I was very
impressed so on a one to five scale I
really be hard pressed not give it a
five it does exactly what what you know
it's going to do it doesn't pretend to
do anything differently the BlackBerry
OS is sort of tried and true and if
anybody's picking up a blackberry you
really know what you're getting so guys
