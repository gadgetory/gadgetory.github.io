technobuffalo here the holidays are
quickly approaching and one of the items
that are perhaps high on your list of
things you want to receive or maybe you
want to give to someone is a new
smartphone but there are a ton of
choices out there and it makes it hard
to pick the best one for you so an
effort to make that easier i'm going to
run through the top three smartphones on
each of the four major US carriers let's
get started every phone on this list is
currently available so you can walk into
your local store and pick it up and if
you want more information on each phone
their links going to be down below so
let's start with the big v verizon
that's my v is the droid x is my number
one phone is one of my favorite phones
argued in 2010 4.3 inch screen is
perfect for those that don't need a full
qwerty keyboard but one a lot of screen
real estate it's rockin 8 megapixel
camera and Android going to be a really
solid choice you're going to see Android
permeate this list completely the second
phone is for the user who maybe does
want a full qwerty keyboard it is the
droid pro it offers a traditional
keyboard form factor with the keyboard
below the screen a similarly what you
find on a traditional blackberry thing
was lightning fast not the best on
battery life so you may also want to
include an external battery he uses a
mobile hotspot and really is one of the
most solid Android offerings on the
market and the third is a variant you're
going to see probably throughout this
list as well the samsung fascinate this
is the galaxy s variant for verizon
Super AMOLED screen which is absolutely
gorgeous really have to see it it's got
a 4-inch display it's rocking a 1
gigahertz hummingbird processor which is
screaming fast again if you don't need a
full qwerty keyboard and you want a
little bit smaller than that 4.3 inch
form factor the samsung fascinate is an
awesome choice for the verizon wireless
user alright let's jump over to the
nation's largest gsm carrier and that is
AT&amp;amp;T number one on this list should
probably not be surprising anyone in
these films are not in particular order
just the top three is the iphone 4 it's
running iOS all
apps you've come to know and love the
gorgeous Retina Display front facing
camera for facetime rear facing camera
for normal pictures it's a fantastic
phone a lot has already been said about
it you probably know the iphone it's
definitely on the recommended list for
18t number two is the Samsung Focus it
is a windows phone 7 that's got that
same gorgeous super amoled screen on the
Galaxy S series of devices it's got a
4-inch display 5 megapixel camera I
really like Windows Phone 7 is actually
one of my biggest surprises of 2010 the
live tiles really do add additional
functionality to the phone app that sort
of dig through menus get your
information and it's only going to get
better as new updates get pushed out so
the samsung focus is the number two
phone i recommend to give or receive for
AT&amp;amp;T and the third is a galaxy s variant
this is the samsung captivate simpler to
the fasting for verizon it's got that
gorgeous 4 inch Super AMOLED display
hummingbird processor and again very
very very quick let's go ahead and jump
on over to sprint number one is probably
my favorite phone of 2010 actually would
be the phone that I would pick up if I
wasn't on AT&amp;amp;T for my primary phone and
that is the evo 4g the 4g in that name
being tremendous it is a 4g phone using
sprint's and clears wimax networks
you're going to get blazing fast speeds
it's got a 4.3 inch screen it's rocking
Android it's got a front-facing camera
first facing camera and really offers a
very complete package evo 4g is one of
the best phones available on the market
next is the epic 4g and this is that
galaxy s variant once again this time
for sprint with a little bit of a trick
up its sleeve this one offers a full
qwerty keyboard that slides out in the
landscape orientation I wasn't the
biggest fan of the keyboard but if you
do want that full tactile feel of a
phone actually show a real keyboard on a
phone the epic 4g is going to be a great
choice and you are going to get that 4g
speeds and all the rest of the awesome
galaxy s stuff including the Super
AMOLED display next is the blackberry
bold the 9650 it's a blackberry and
you're not going to get some of the best
web browsing experience you're not going
to get the most intuitive user interface
we are going to get is probably the best
email clients known to man push emails
are going to come through take a breeze
you're going to get great battery life
we're going to get a really really solid
keyboard and are going to get a
fantastic all-around package black bears
are popular for a reason and they do a
lot of things very well so if you use
your on your list is a very email
centric the blackberry bold for sprint
is going to be a great choice let's go
ahead and jump over to t-mobile the
number one choice is going to be the HTC
hd7 windows phone 7 yet again it makes a
comeback it's got an awesome 4.3 inch
screen so it's nice and big it's got a
dual LED flash packs a lot of cool
windows phone 7 features and if you
haven't checked out windows phone 7 I
definitely recommend that you do so the
number two choice probably not
surprising as a t-mobile g2 bringing
Android back to this lists got an
awesome 3.7 inch screen it's got a
surprisingly fast 800 megahertz
processor which is the second generation
processor the software is really
optimized for the hardware and this
thing is an absolute screamer I not to
mention hsdpa plus so you're going to
get really really fast data speeds and a
fantastic a qwerty keyboard in the
landscape orientation with the kind of
coolest slide out so in case you are
looking for that type of phone when the
g2 is going to be an awesome choice for
you and the third choice probably
unsurprisingly is t-mobile galaxy s
variants these samsung vibrants variant
vibrant you're going to get again if
beautiful 4 inch Super AMOLED screen
hummingbird processor really fast speeds
and a great overall package so Android
really sort of his is all encompassing
on this list do you guys think I left
anything out is there sort of a phone
that you think definitely belongs on the
top three recommended list in case you
are looking for a phone for anyone I
hope that these recommendations really
help you guys anyway i'm jon rettinger
from TechnoBuffalo and i'm going to see
you in the next video bye bye
and one of the items that perhaps are
high on your list to get or perhaps hi
to give out ours aid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
