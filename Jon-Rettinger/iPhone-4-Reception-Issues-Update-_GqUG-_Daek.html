John Breton German TechnoBuffalo here
yesterday I made a video detailing the
reception issues on the iPhone 4 and
have you called it supposedly you're
going to get a signal degradation well I
didn't was able to replicate that I
didn't have some of the problems but
it's brought to my attention that
perhaps I was holding the phone wrong in
a way that wouldn't replicate the issue
so I'm going to go ahead and try this
one more time and hold it the way you're
supposed to do to try and get these
problems right now you can see that I
have about four bars of 3G tends to go
in and out of four or five bars with
pretty good service I'm going to go
ahead and pick the phone up put it in my
left hand I'm going to hold it in the
way that you're supposed to to see to
get this segregation you can see I'm
making contact on either side and I'm
pushing in relatively hard so there goes
one bar there goes two bars got two bars
remaining see if anything happens to
those
now generally when I try to replicate
this after it was brought to my
attention I was doing it wrong
I get it down to one bar and that's
where it stays I haven't had the no
service yet although maybe we'll get
that for a first time here on camera
then I'm gonna try and see what happens
when I make a phone call and see if it
loses the phone call over there I hold
it like this or if I try and address the
problem with the bottom left hand corner
and see if we can replicate that so
that's how things sort of dropped
quickly when I take my hands off put it
back on the table let's see how fast or
how slow the signal comes back you can
already see that it's starting to sort
of come back I got three bars back four
bars back and now we actually have full
five bars of reception so I'm gonna go
ahead and make a phone call here I'm
gonna go ahead and call the I've got HTC
EVO next to me I'm going to go and give
that a call
as soon as that rings I will answer
there we go okay so now I'm on a call
let's see if that reception she was
going to result in a dropped call so
you're walking you're talking you're
holding your phone very tight with your
left hand let's see what happens
call failure let's see if we can do that
one more time let's see if maybe that
was just a one time thing it's not gonna
happen again
so I'm going to call the Evo again
all right enter the phone call all right
so now I am connected to the other phone
and if I leave it right here it's fine
no drop calls but if I pick it up and
right now it's got about three bars at
service let's see what happens dude it
holds on to the call or if it drops it
again maybe that first time is just an
anomaly you can definitely see the
signal going down still going down
down to one bar
and it looks like we're still okay but
we have degraded down to 1 bar and no
lost calls there's another problem some
people are having with the bottom
left-hand choir and I'll keep holding
this one on talking to see what happens
but if you hit it sort of right down
there have your home your a hand rested
right down there you're gonna lose a
call let me try that go ahead and put
that sort of right in the middle of my
hand and hold the phone nice and tight
like I was before I'll see what happens
to the phone call it looks to be okay
I mean you definitely have a huge signal
loss right there I went from four to
five bars now down to one a little call
is still going on so I don't know if
getting a bumper is gonna fix this
whether a software update is going to
address this up and there we go
we lost the calls looks like we are two
for two confirmed that this is indeed a
problem and if you hold your phone tight
in that manner you are going to drop
your phone call hopefully this will be
fixed in a software problem I haven't
had a problem using this in real life
holding it like that
I generally hold the phone with my right
hands but is indeed an issue you can see
the signal went all the way back so
share this video guide of people
considering getting an iPhone 4 it's
worthwhile that they see it because
there may be a really legitimate problem
going on anyway I'm John Rhett enger'
from TechnoBuffalo I'll see you the next
video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
