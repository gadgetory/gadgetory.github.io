TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the newest flagship Android phone from
Sony Ericsson this is the Xperia Arc in
a slew of Android competition let's see
if this guy stands out so this is only
available as an unlocked unit in the US
thank you to the folks at clove co uk
for sending us a model for review if you
want to check them out links going to be
down below on the front of the box we
have a picture of the device this was
one of the highlights of CES 2011 the
thinness of this guy was really
impressive but that was back a few
months ago when there's been a lot of
phones announced since so let's see if
this is still one of the creams the
Android crop so Exmoor for mobile HDMI
QuickTime Wi-Fi DLNA and some stuff
about what the phone can do but we'll
talk about all that let's go ahead and
dig in I'm excited to see what this guy
looks like go ahead and pull off the box
go ahead pull it out here this will have
support for us 3G network on AT&amp;amp;T phone
is extremely thin you can see where it
gets its Arcanum from obviously it's got
a bit of an arc to it very very very
light I don't assume the batteries in
here let's go ahead and push that off
and see what else we're going to get in
the box
so warranty information important
information in my first hour all that
stuff that you're probably not going to
read but there it is
ah here is the battery it was not in
there it is a 1500 milliamp hour so
didn't see you that right there push it
off to the side let's see what else
we're gonna get looks like sony ericsson
was nice enough to include a mini HDMI
to HDMI cord very nice he expected a bit
of premium accessories when you buy an
unlocked device you're paying a premium
for the phone I'd expect accessories
like this to be included so it's always
nice when they oblige you're gonna have
a pair of headphones we've got those
jelly rubber tips on them and there's a
microphone and there's that Sony
Ericsson silica stuff so it doesn't go
bad
you're gonna have a microphone with the
volume controls on it and they button on
the back for sending and ending your
calls we've got a wall charger if you
are in the u.s. we're probably not going
to want to use this one but it's just
HDMI so anything will work and then
there is the like a right-angle mini
HDMI cord a screen protector kind of
neat okay so enough of the accessories
blah blah blah let's go ahead and take a
look at the phone most importantly
because this is where all the action
happens so I'm going to go ahead pop in
the battery and while it's booting up
I'll run you through the specs all right
so the back comes off very easily just
flip your fingernail under there and
pull off a little bit of plastic comes
out you're gonna have an 8 gigabyte
microSD card installed let's go ahead
take the battery pop it in and let's do
a power and boot up and I'll walk you
through and show you what you can expect
with your Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc so
the power button I'm assuming is going
to be living somewhere on here there it
is in the upper left hand corner alright
so this will boot up and I will run you
through the specs to this guy because
there is actually quite a bit here so it
has a bit of an odd screen size most
ones we're seeing are four inches or 4.3
inches this guy is actually 4.2 inches
diagonal with a pretty high resolution
of 480 by 854 it's got support for Sony
Mobile BRAVIA Engine in its not support
it's got it in there supposedly you're
gonna get much much much better graphics
going to get very sharp images pictures
text everything is going to look quite
nice from what I remember from CES the
images and video on here really did look
very good it is running Android 2.3
Gingerbread with sony ericsson's
Timescape UI on it it has on its hump
and 8 megapixel camera which of course
will autofocus and LED flash it also has
a smile detector so if you're a grumpy
it's not going to take a picture of you
will record video in 720p however at 30
frames per second and we're looking
right here at the Timescape UI home
screen it's the same UI we saw with the
Xperia Play
being powered by a 1 gigahertz scorpion
processor and that is a single core but
this guy should be relatively quick
we've got three buttons here across the
bottom so what Sony Ericsson is doing
with their Android phones now we don't
have a search button but you have sort
of standard looking Android buttons at
least you've got your back your home and
your menu button a little bit of an odd
order what we don't have however is a
front-facing camera so you're not gonna
be seeing any of that here on the left a
3.5 millimeter headset jack and follow
that slim and slender body it's like a
supermodel
all right so you go alrights all of my
bad jokes aside on the right hand side
we've got what's becoming now an
uncommon power or a camera button so
we've got a dedicated camera button
there on the right we've got a volume
rocker up and down and you have what
looks to be a proprietary charging port
doesn't necessarily look like micro USB
like we've seen and if you look at the
charging cord that came with it it
actually is so something to keep in mind
it is standard just happens to look
weird on the top you've got your HDMI
out underneath a little bit of a door
there we go get that door pulled back
there you can see it haha
and you've got your power and lock
button so let's take a real quick look
at the time to keep you eye and of
course we'll walk through all this when
we do our full TechnoBuffalo style
review so let's unlock it at least in
theory unlock it and that's supposed to
set up where we are what we are not
there we are in the US next please
insert sim card and restart your phone
well I'm not some card in there
beautiful I'm probably agreeing to have
my location tracked and people always
know where I am here we go ok so you've
got some time scape e goodness let's go
ahead and jump into settings let's make
sure that this is indeed running
Gingerbread so one of the things that I
don't get at least with Sony Ericsson's
Gingerbread Timescape devices one of the
best things at least for me about
Gingerbread is gonna hit the menu button
you get a task manager and you can see
what's running we'd hit the menu button
here you don't get that all you get are
wallpapers and settings find that a
little bit on the annoying side
all right so you get that little bit of
a white color that shows up at the
bottom let's go ahead and check out
about phone Android version two point
three point two so we are indeed running
some J bread let's go ahead and look at
some images so let's go to wallpapers
see what stuff looks like on here let's
go to sending erics at wallpaper see if
they put any pictures in here so the
screen does look nice I mean it looks
relatively high resolution it's hard to
tell just kind of on a first blush test
but there's a lot to see here if you go
ahead and do a little pinch to zoom and
actually pulls in all the widgets you
can see what you got there it's called
an overview mode kind of neat we'll go
ahead and exit out of this move around
you can see all your home screens if you
don't like it nice thing about Android
is you can customize it any way that's
you choose so this is a really really
really thin phone let me show you how
thin it actually is let's bring in the
Samsung Droid Charge a 4.3 inch phone
very similar form factors let's go ahead
and stack these guys and there's like
BAM skinny sister fat sister I mean this
thing is really really really thin and
still extremely powerful so go ahead and
push that off to the side and let's see
how it looks next to an iPhone 4 another
phone beer app you might across shopping
it with to go ahead and do a little
stack job again boom see how thin it is
it's like a smart phone sandwich
you can definitely see how thin the
Xperia Arc is so I'll be doing a full
review and overview of this guy and
showing you some of the features telling
you what I like and don't like about it
and all the rest of that business
anything particular that you want to see
be sure to leave them in the comments
down below I am John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
