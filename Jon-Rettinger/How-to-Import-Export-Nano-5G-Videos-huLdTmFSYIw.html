raspy voice I'm a bit under the weather
one of the questions that I've been
getting quite a bit the last few days is
how to import video from the new ipod
nanos something to go I'm just show you
how to do that and how to export it even
in full wide screen resolution so the
first thing you need to do is record
some video on your nano with the nano
horizontally so the video records in
widescreen next thing you're going to
want to do is just plug it on in and
once you plug it in if you're on a Mac
you're going to get an icon on your
desktop that says whatever your name of
your iPod Nano is if you're on a PC just
go to my computer and you'll see the dr
mounted there so go ahead and open that
up and once you open it up you're going
to get a few files the one that you're
going to want is called DCIM right below
contacts and right above notes so open
that up be a leather folder they're
called 000 Apple open that up as well
and here you're going to have all of the
video you recorded in mp4 format ignore
all these image bad things that are
really mattered but are going to have
all your video right here you can open
it up preview it and see what it is but
let's say this is the one that you want
I just drag it off to your desktop close
that up and open up whatever your video
editor of choice is mine in this case I
movie so I'm go ahead and open up by
moving I already have it open here go to
file import import movies and here's the
one that we just selected we're going to
import that it's a video I did a test
demo of love my cat Mercedes total go
ahead and import it and you can take it
and edit it and do what you want so let
me go ahead and and drag it up here so
let's say this is the video i wanted
export go ahead and hit file I'm trying
to go ahead and hit share export using
quicktime
project as whatever you like and let me
show you what your setting should be as
well this may be helpful to some for the
resolution make sure your video is set
to MPEG four basic data rate five
thousand these are my settings image
size of 128 x 720 HD I have unselected
the preserve aspect ratio you can sort
of check all these settings here 24
frames file format mp4 hear the audio
settings if you want to mimic these as
well audio format AAC data rate 320kbps
channel stereo sample output rate 48 and
encoding quality better and streaming
1450 bytes and 100 maximum packet
duration that's all you need go ahead
and hit OK it's going to export it
you're going to have a full widescreen
video to upload to YouTube or wherever
you like hope you guys found this
