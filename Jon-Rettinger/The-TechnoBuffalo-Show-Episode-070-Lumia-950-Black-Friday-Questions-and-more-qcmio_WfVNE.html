Buffalo show I'm I'm your to host for
today's Sean ani editor-in-chief of the
site and i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazleton everybody are you
doing today todd i'm good getting ready
for the holiday here in the United
States thanksgiving that's the day i
decided to jump on a plane and fly back
to the country where we escaped from
that's right uh so first topic I wanted
to get to you know after last week's
show I you know you really you turned me
around and I really I've decided that I
I need to own an urbane too yeah and why
are you laughing Todd because they
really didn't recall it they canceled it
like you're not going to sell it it was
like 24 hours after the podcasts where
am i gay I really like it kind of
spoiler um it's cool you know I couldn't
believe when we got that even yeah and
so I emailed right back like okay wait
is it like safe to wear and they're
really good no problem and I guess what
they're saying is that something i saw
another article i forget who was
financial times maybe saudi said like
they reached out they figured out it was
something to do with like the display
over time wouldn't work as well as they
wanted to and because of quality
concerns blah blah blah you know their
decide not to watch it so it must have
been pretty major I mean that's a that's
expensive to probably have millions of
these are hundreds of thousands or
thousands or whatever six well and it's
not only the inventory costs which I'm
sure they had you know them ready to
roll because they were so close to
launch but it's also the machining costs
rd costed canceling a product at the
literal eleventh hour is not a cheap
prospect yeah it was almost like the
12th hour because verizon AT&amp;amp;T were
already selling it at least eighteen t
definitely was which is crazy and it
makes me wonder like did did a carrier
notice this or something like how did it
get so far I didn't see consumers start
to know it notice it and reviewers you
know for the most part people who had
reviewed it all
didn't have much complain about and to
be honest like I was wearing it every
day it doesn't seem like a
forward-facing you no problem and yet
it's apparently very serious so I don't
know that just that really took me by
surprise when we got that email and to
was like what yeah especially when it
was the day after we had spent a good
chunk of a podcast discussing it but
c'est la vie it's what happens it's
unfortunate no I just I find interesting
that they definitely implied in the
email that we may never see this watch
right they were like you know it's not
launching now and it might just never
launched that is really surprising
witchy and you have to think because LG
makes the plastic OLED the P OLED
screens so if it involves that it's
something they've built but you know
earlier devices have these plastic OLED
screens too so what's wrong there maybe
it's like the wiring I just can't figure
out like how how bad this really could
have been well I think we can definitely
say that we know what every LG employee
is getting is there you're in bonus
she's all right cuz they're still safe
to wear yeah exactly so there will be a
whole lot of LG employees wearing urban
kids but uh well unfortunate I feel bad
for LG that that could not have been an
easy call to make yeah now and
especially around the holidays you know
big time to buy these things yeah yeah
exactly so unfortunate so this is the
last episode for two weeks as I will be
off on vacation next week but we will
return after that but before we head off
into the holiday season we're going to
discuss a course was going to be the
biggest day this week not turkey day but
Black Friday yeah yeah now do you ever
go out in the stores are you an online
shopper or do you just ignored actually
haven't shopped in the past but this
year I've got my eye on just a simple TV
because there seems to be so many of
them for so cheap like probably 32 inch
which is what I have in front of me is
unbelievable how cheap the televisions
are going to be this year yeah like I
think you know I've seen plenty priced
around a hundred fifty bucks so I would
just give this I want a second one over
here maybe just two I mean you could buy
the TV in front of me was probably like
closer to 300 bucks now i can buy two
more for 300 bucks and finally sort of
outfit my desk with these 30 too much
things i mean my wife will kill me but
that's what I just wanted to do so no
better time to do I I'm running to
addition to my 27 inch imac I have to 24
inch monitors but the televisions have
gotten at least Im black fri they've
gotten so cheap they're cheaper than a
monitor which makes no sense to me I
know well I feel like the monitors
because they they have much sharper
resolutions like Here I am with this TVs
you know i'm stuck at 1080 which is okay
at 32 inches sitting this close you know
I can definitely see some pixels and
stuff but it's good enough for what i
want and i think that's why they get
more expensive and they're definitely
these compared to these tvs brighter
right I mean but I mean it in my case
you know the two monitors you know the
left one is running real-time traffic
reports for the site and the right one
is just running tweetdeck you know so I
these are not high resolution things
that I'm dealing with right yo so yeah
it would be great I I'm trying to figure
out if I have enough room on my desk for
2 32 inch televisions but on hundred
least room now of course a being black
friday though I'm sure that you can pick
something up cheaply that will just
immediately be marked for return um but
no I mean I used to do black friday yo
in person you know i'd get up at like
2am and head to walmart it you know and
be there at like 3am until the door
busters would start at seven I haven't
done that in years I don't plan on ever
doing that again there is a point where
you get to an age where you're like nope
I'm done yeah it's almost like okay I'm
willing to pay the difference and just
not show up and not deal with the crowds
well and the thing is there's so many on
deals now them you know even if it's not
the exact same model and that's one
thing here's a tip for a lot of people
when you're buying on black friday now
in Todd's case he's fine with buying
whatever you know he's just looking for
screen real estate mm-hmm but a lot of
times those televisions are made
specifically for the black friday sale
and so there they'll have the majority
of the model number will be the same and
then it will end with like a w or be w
RB feo ends with some different letter
code that's because like they've made
one less hdmi port or they've done
something different to it so you think
you're getting the the regular model
alright but you're actually getting the
Black Friday it didn't cost us as much
to make model right so that is something
definitely to be careful for if you're
heading out for black friday this year I
you know the the other thing that is
coming I mean folks I have to be a
little careful here I i I've got some
things I've been told under embargo so I
can't be too specific but believe me
there's gonna be some great phone deals
no I keep your eyes peeled for those
which is a bizarre concept to me you
know it's almost like phones have become
a gift-giving item and that's so odd to
me because to me a phone is such a
personal item yeah you know I can't
imagine you know even with my parents me
going here I bought you this phone now
you have to live with it for two years
right it's weird except for parents that
might not know like you know what
they're missing out on and so you give
them I don't know get my Nexus 5x right
you're like check it out it's got a
great camera its Android you haven't
used this before and then they they're
like oh thanks that's really cool and I
can live with this for two years because
I haven't had it before but you also
then you look at a kid who's like you
know reading the site every day and he
wants the 128 gigabyte now
sis you know 6p and then you get a moto
G oh well ESPN has brought some home ah
but you know then then you can see where
they're like then it's not the personal
item it's not what they wanted all kinds
of pain the blood stuff but yeah yeah no
I it's very odd to me the idea of giving
a phone as a gift it's just yeah it was
always and then the carriers have done
this for years right like they have
there you know I think in the past aids
on holiday deals or I remember when
they'd have like the red blackberry for
sale and you'd get buy one get one but
it was like always with a contract so it
never really made that much sense like
unless you were up for an upgrade it was
like okay well you can't buy a phone for
somebody but that's changing now because
of unlock devices where you go you spend
a hundred bucks 200 bucks 800 bucks
whatever it is you're trying to buy and
you actually can gift a phone because
it's unlocked and there's so many more
options in that market now than there
were before so that now it's starting to
you know make a little more sense in
that regard but you have to know what
you're buying right like you can't go
and buy I don't know the oneplus X right
and give it to somebody on 18 see who
might want that LTE ban that's missing
like that's kind of a bad move so you
have to know what you're doing and
research it first oh definitely well and
such a mall asks SEO is it worth it to
go black friday shopping and I think I
used to think it was and now i'm not
talking about online shopping i'm only
talking about in person shopping i used
to think it was but to me the whole
issue is as I've gotten older time has
become my most valuable commodity I
never have enough time hmm so if I'm
saving twenty dollars on a television is
it worth me interrupting my sleep
schedule getting up going standing at a
store or spending three four hours there
to save twenty dollars and to me
unfortunately it's really it's not it's
not worth twenty dollars
yeah you know because you're talking
about basically it's almost a game paid
four to five dollars an hour right and
now and especially in the day and age
you know where sales are actually
happening like all year long amazon has
something and you have amazon prime and
it's here two days or in some cases
today by 8pm you know it's kind of like
you that's always in the back of my head
too and I'm like okay well maybe I'll
just wait something I also come up it
won't be too long well and that's the
thing I mean so many companies now are
having a like Black Friday in July well
and their sales going on 12 months a
year now but you know and black friday
is just I don't know it's it's become
more of an institution than anything as
items I don't know I'm not that the I
just can't ever imagine going to the
stores again I feel like and also we
keep in my I think it's also like a
tradition for people kicks off the
holiday season shopping you know for us
it's about tech but for a lot of people
it's also about you know I'm gonna go
jcpenney you get your sweaters and stuff
like that you know well anyone that
gives clothes for Christmas should be
you know taking out and flogged yeah but
uh oh good grief but I do you have it I
I think for me you know yes I I do some
online shopping and normally what i do
is i pick up like some video game that
i've been waiting on yeah but I don't
know I usually use the Black Friday time
to like think about the gifts that I
want to get my family cuz I'm kind of
tech guy so it's like Oh what do I get
them so you know look around what's
cheaper than it usually is that we've
been following what do people need my
family maybe it's a kindle or something
like that you're like okay seventy-five
bucks vs. a hundred bucks is probably
now it's probably a good time but that's
when I start to think about buying as
opposed to like you know for myself when
the only thing I really want right now
so speak
TV's well yeah and the i forget what
retailer was it was one of the ads we
looked at on bfads.net that uh the
fifty-dollar amazon tablets gonna be
thirty-five dollars on yeah exactly it
some retailers man by a stack of those
just give them out of stocking stuffers
yeah seriously people I've you I like
the tablet I mean no it's not a
powerhouse you're not going to do a ton
with it but you can use as an ereader
you can use it as an email ill reader
you can buy a couple and leave them in
different rooms of the house so you
never have to carry anything around a
bathroom tablet is what you're saying
basically and at $35 why not yeah you
know that is the one thing this because
I already thought was a great bargain at
fifty dollars 35 it's a freaking steal I
know yeah and Roku yesterday was
tweeting out that um you know their
prices and they're marking down like the
roku 3 by like twenty dollars for black
friday and they're also marking down the
roku 2 or no the roku le and the again
the show's not sponsored by Roku Roku
streaming i think we're going to see a
lot of streaming deals this year you
know streaming devices you know so if
you've thought about you know cord
cutting or jumping into streaming at all
you know this is definitely the
possibility for your year mm-hmm and we
have a question here from Justin yell
say I kid you not Nexus 6 is 288 for the
32 gigabyte model on newegg with this
pricing drop so extreme does this drive
any prospects for future phone sales you
see in the future um possibly I mean I
think yeah as we know android phone
sales are dipping there you know I see a
lot of people going on the type of
station of Android no it's a sales dip I
think a lot of companies you also have
to remember the Nexus 6 is now
considered an older phone you
got the 6p out you got the 6x out by
Beck CFO sure I'm so so yeah there's a
good chance that you know they want a
clear San inventory out or they may just
realize they still have a great phone
they can sell you know I does it
influence future pricing I just I don't
know I think it's some yeah I don't know
a future phone pricing book current
pricing I mean you have to wonder how
our companies like you know one plus can
react to that price I think Nexus 6 is
probably solo for exactly what you said
like they're trying to get it off the
shelves it's probably you know end of
life for them in regards to selling a
new hardware so let's get rid of it
David noonas ass what is the worst Black
Friday purchase you to have ever made
and Todd did you return yours I don't
know if I've ever made like an actual
Black Friday purchase I I've bought a
lot on black Fridays some were great
deals i got my folks a 17 inch HP laptop
one year and that thing last I was
ridiculous how cheap it was I can't
remember how much it was now but nothing
lasted I'm like four four and a half
years Wow and that was great but what I
always love is the the vacuum cleaner
sales Viva they like try yo get you any
oh well we're gonna have super cheap
vacuum cleaners you get there it's like
the most bare-bones model you've ever
seen in your life and when you're my
grandmother had me pick one up for it I
was like so in a month when this breaks
you let me know and I'll go get you a
real vacuum and yeah sure enough it
broke um I didn't feel bad about that
one though because it wasn't for me uh I
don't think what one year I bought a I
bought a gamecube which i never was a
huge gamecube fan i probably did not get
my money's worth out of the gamecube i
hated that controller I think that's the
it though for me and embed Black Friday
purchases
my I just haven't really done black
friday in the past because I just not a
big fan of crowds and stuff and go to
store but this year like I said it might
be my first year and i'm sure i'll
return something yeah probably well
shifting gears a little bit you want to
discuss the Lumia 950 a little bit how
are you liking it so far yeah I like it
um want to talk about it because I had
it last week but it was under embargo
which lifted on friday and i did a quick
article on the site just um here it is
by the way just you know five things to
know about it um yeah I'm not going
after other sites or anything but we got
it on monday we had it till friday for
me it wasn't a lot of time to to
actually play with it i mean we have to
remember this windows 10 so this is a
lot it's it's similar it's almost
identical but a lot has changed so
there's a lot to play with and it's very
buggy right now so I've actually been
emailing back and forth with Microsoft
hey you realize this is happening as a
testament 15 minutes before the show you
got something to finally work you don't
have to say what it was but I mean that
that tells you this has not been an easy
process yeah and last week I was working
on my blackberry preview and I thought
oh this would be a lot of fun I'll work
on that review in word from continuum on
this which is when you know you can plug
this into a dock that they provide us
with the reviews has got three USB ports
HDMI USB see uh in and out so under the
phone and then DisplayPort kind of a
heavy little break so anyway I hooked it
up the computer hooked up a mouth too
picky born I was trying to work and then
it crashed and not only did it crash
word it then read the whole Philip phone
rebooted this happened several times and
I've had other bugs for like apps i
actually just emailed microsoft apps are
like um they won't update properly in
the in the app store so you know like on
any phone where it's like 21 apps have
updates and then like but on this like
six of them or whatever two of them
depends on the day will just fail either
just stop it won't update and you give
err so I've had bugs like that they're
frustrating and I couldn't get skype and
messenger to work it did work that's the
one I fixed with you earlier I don't
know there's a lot the problem is
there's a huge potential here like
continuum is awesome the idea of it of
hooking this up to a display and having
multiple tabs open and working reliably
is very cool to me but there are so many
mind-boggling things that don't make
sense for example continuum crashing so
if continued crashes and Microsoft is
pushing this as a device where people
can work that makes no sense to me I
mean how could I possibly rely on it
second Microsoft is pushing their apps
that span to continuum so like word and
outlook and other apps group me for
example which is owned by microsoft you
plug this into the dock and put it on my
1080p display for example and you get a
full screen you know its scale so the
full screen it's not just blown up but
actually like a user lap well skype is
left out of that which makes no sense to
me microsoft-owned skype you know and
they're saying that all these developers
should be creating apps to span and work
with continuum and yet they're not doing
it for their own that that is one of the
most bizarre things that you pulled me
because Microsoft 8000 come on
developers get ready for continuum it's
gonna be awesome and then you get it and
you told me how hey a skype doesn't work
and i was like what yeah especially for
like we use Skype every day for work so
other people must yeah although i find
it hilarious you you Roy and I are the
biggest skype users yeah everyone else
would I want to talk to him on skype I'm
like log in please yeah but you Roy and
I almost use it like an intercom system
yeah but so those are like big things
and I feel like a lot of it sort of has
been either glossed over by Microsoft or
other you know I don't know it's just
these are important and I and I feel
like as I'm working on a review I can't
just sit here and bash the Holy I mean I
should I really should because this is
available for public review right now
except i think that software updates are
going to fix a lot of this and i want to
make sure that you know either they're
coming or they're not coming before i
say you know skip on this phone entirely
because other things are great this
screen quad HD the camera is pretty good
we have samples up a windows hello is
awesome I don't have glasses I know
people are having issues with that but
it scans your iris so it recognizes me
when the phones locked is he looking for
you it says and then I just stare at it
says hello Todd it's unlocked so all
that stuff is really fun but just
everything else is holding it back in
its I know for folks that listen to the
podcast I've said I just want the
smallest device I can actually work from
and for me this was it like I could just
throw it my backpack and then sort or by
pocket really would have liked the doc
in my backpack and hook it up to a
monitor and get worked on somewhere and
now it just doesn't work right so I'm
bummed also it's a great idea mm-hmm but
it has to work as smoothly as possible
yeah and I just can't figure out like I
don't even think it's my software right
because this it's the same software that
everybody else has seen build I just
said I'm pumped I know I I know don't
worry review isn't gonna focus on that I
mean I have to address these issues but
i also want to talk about how amazing
this could be i mean i don't know that a
month from now there's not going to be
some huge passion fixes all these
problems and then here we are with your
review saying the phone is garbage it's
not you know and that's just I'm just
going to extremes there I don't think
it's garbage all as always i forgot to
meet my phone apologize for that
everyone um well let's jump into
questions i can't believe how quickly
the the time is flying by i thought this
week was going to drag since i'm leaving
tomorrow I cannot believe how fast this
week has gone so far yeah oh god from
David Nunez what tips would you to give
it an aspiring journalists to get an
internship or first journalist jump make
sure that
ah i'm going to try to be very careful
about how I say this is amazing to me
when we get young fresh writers who send
us submissions that they is clear that
they have not even made one proofing
pass yeah I make sure that you have your
basics down and I'm talking punctuation
I'm talking paragraph breaks you know
when somebody new is coming into the
business I don't expect them to be as
polished as say tates by any means but I
don't expect to have to teach you the
absolute basics that you should have
learned in junior high English yeah so
make sure that and I'm pleased no one
take offense at that this is a very
common problem and I think it's a
probably a failing more on the schools
than anything but just make sure that
you've got over and over and over and
it's going it shows also amount of
respect you know if one typo gets
through one typo gets through but if I
can't if I read a paragraph and I go
this could then three paragraphs you
have a problem yeah i think that one
recommendation I'd make is if you if
you're at a school that offers classes
that are writing intensive whether its
history political science English
creative writing take those journalism
obviously I didn't study journalism I
studied English but those and just write
a lot I mean that's what our job is but
there are all kinds of journalists video
journalists photographers and writers
and if we're going to hire for our staff
writing is very important and video is
very important so it depends on what
kind of kind you want to do but I would
say you know the journalism that I do
definitely spend a lot of time writing
well our own
and show people that you right there are
so many free places get a blog right
nowadays you know and it doesn't even
have to be online I that was something I
did for year and I still do you know
it's just my way of clearing my head and
all that right something every single
day yeah you know and even if no one
ever sees it just keep writing keep and
also and this was one of the biggest
helps to me when I was doing some
creative writing and you know people
kept telling me it was stiff and all
that as soon as I would get done I
started reading it out loud to myself
yeah and you will be amazed how
different your writing will be after you
hear how it I don't know the exact
wording I don't know if there is an
official word though what I call it is
how it falls on the ear and so sit down
and I don't care if people think you're
crazy read your writing out loud to
yourself and you'll hear where it
doesn't sound natural where it doesn't
flow you'll start to hear your paragraph
breaks and you'll hear your punctuation
in the way that you're speaking mm-hmm
so yeah definitely and make sure that
you at some point sit down and read out
loud your own stuff and it will that'll
be one of the biggest helps to you ever
yeah and read other stuff too ya know
what what who reads but from what's it
worth will continue and be an update
available for older windows phones no
because it requires a snapdragon 808 or
810 right now I believe unfortunately
not surprised by that unfortunately um
from such an Mahal what kinds of stuff
would you recommend buying on black
friday weekend / cyber monday or video
games a good idea to buy them yeah
actually i think video games are one of
the best things to purchase on black
friday weekend cyber monday shopping
bonanza because a lot
x you know you'll see games that were
just out you know within the past couple
months already marked down twenty
dollars pretty much any time a game
comes out in the fall now I just don't
bother buying it until black fri cuz i
know it's going to be discounted by a
third and you can pick up you know like
even your old games for like nine bucks
yeah so why not yeah i think video games
are one of the biggest wins on Black
Friday without question and then just
you know whatever you think this looks
like a good deal now it just it totally
depends on what you're looking for let's
see here did you do live from oh good
grief kook con I hope I said that right
uh what do you think about the Apple
watch doc I haven't seen one in person
yeah I have you know I haven't but we
talked about this briefly on the last
show it just it didn't look like the day
before I wrote it up as a rumor and I
was like yeah I don't know if that's
real it didn't look like much of an
apple product and still kind of looks
like a coaster which I mean they all do
so same here same songs they open i was
charging yell look weird i'm more
interested to see if this leads to
wireless charging the iphone though
because it would be a perfect talk for
that too yeah why else have this stupid
little thing and it's as an Apple watch
gender that would have a biggity dollars
but it's from such a Mahal what do you
guys think of the Star Wars version of
Google products um I like some of them p
to the lightsaber noises on yahoo are
driving me nuts I on YouTube YouTube
yeah that was cute for a while and then
it got really old really fast also the
background picture on gmail is driving
me nuts yeah it's kind of stupid
tomorrow I got to take a three-hour
drive though so I'm looking forward to
using ways and having c-3po guide me on
my route although I know I know the
route by heart so I really don't need to
be else but I use it anyway just so i
could hear Threepio talking to me yeah i
like the idea i think it's really fun
that they did that yeah it's a
an idea I I think some of it's a little
bit of overkill because I mean like
you're watching a YouTube video and you
accidentally move the mouse and also you
hear the lightsaber swishing sound I'm
like oh come on I was trying to do that
last night when I was working on
troubleshooting a plex server like so
I'm watching videos it's like long long
enough like I gotta pause and go back
because I knew you just said yeah now
that it's cute but quite possibly
overkill yeah also from coot con hey
guys you know why the Nexus 6p has an
estimated shipping date of mid mid
December internationally was that the
release date I don't know what the
international release date is and I'm
not sure you know why it was just a ride
no stocks been in and out but that's a
what's it looking at a month from now
yeah oh this is always a good question
especially towards the end of the year
from David Nunez Todd and Shawn any tips
for selling old phones websites that
offer the most websites that sell the
fastest etcetera etcetera thanks guys
the two sites that i always recommend if
you don't want to deal with actually
trying to sell to somebody you know
through craigslist or ebay is either a
gazelle com or I'll amazes me how many
people don't know this exists amazon has
a trade-in program mm-hmm they won't pay
you cash they'll pay you in store credit
but I've seen them give crazy amounts of
money for some phones the galaxy mega
6.3 only in white as I learned
unfortunately if you had a white galaxy
mega 6.3 they're given like two hundred
twelve dollars right now for black
they're giving 12 I don't know why um
but yeah just Google Amazon trade-in and
trade hyphen in and you'll be able to
jump to that page on amazon and the
other one is gazelle like the animal
gazelle com and those aren't you know if
they say they want it that's it they'll
give you a prepaid shipping label and
you're done yeah ebay i've used ebay 24
both options which are just terrible I
mean when I done it with iphones just
fighting scammers every single time and
they went a lot and then but ebay has
they're also their trade in they give
you like the guaranteed price and you
box it up and send it in to them label
and everything one time I had bought off
somebody my dad knew I bought a 1974 Les
Paul guitar nice and I had I at one time
I had way too many guitars and I went to
sell it and I thought oh i paid like 454
you know I didn't know what was really
worth this guy calls me up because I had
my phone number you know my business
number in the ebay auction yeah can you
uh he read me the serial numbers off the
pots I'm like what are the pop oh well
you take the back panel off and you need
to look at the numbers on the back of
the volume control knob so I'm like oh
good grief f it he was just trying to
make sure they were original parts it
was completely original ended up being
worth my time because it sold for twenty
five hundred dollars Wow but yeah I saw
that was not a fun week because I had so
many questions about that stupid guitar
so yeah the idea of trying to sell
phones oh yeah I that that's why I just
like going to gazelle and going I have
this phone do you want a good you want
to give me shipping they won't goodbye
yeah I don't have the original box I
don't know where the charger when give
me 200 bucks fine necklace exactly you
do all that there oh let's see here to
do from Bruges and Franco what do you
think of the show me announcements I
would have loved to get the air purifier
but one hundred dollars shipping fees
made it prohibitive folks I wanted you
to I want you to know that actually I
have a talk today with Todd about
headline writing and I really really was
concerned about the fact that Jacob did
not mention the air purifier in his show
me article headline I should have had it
there you're right I really Todd you
know it
I your department let me down this
morning by not mentioning the air
purifier in the headline uh know about
it okay other than the better than the
air purifier which I'm still laughing
about what did you think of the two new
devices and where was the me five I know
yeah that's I guess a mystery still cuz
we're reading for that the Snapdragon
820 that's rumored to pack so we go you
potentially had the you know the first
time dragon 820 phone announcement uh I
don't know I've never actually used as
yummy phone and I'm excited to try them
at some point I I think it's neat that
they moved to metal and are able to keep
the cost down still so they look like
great devices we just gotta watch you
ever sold in the US then I'd are only be
a lot more excited I don't know yeah I
don't get it ah let's see here to do
sorry there there's a lot of questions
here so I'm just quickly scanning them
from Justin yell say what's going to be
the must-have product this season cut
the cord and TV is irrelevant as of now
um I'm sorry it's not irrelevant um oh I
can tell you what's going to be on
everybody's the remote control bb-8 this
is going to be the hottest product of
holiday season especially once the movie
comes out you're not going to be able to
find this thing anywhere you think oh
it's gonna be like tickle me elmo all
over again man i should get one naryn i
would say i went through the whole
Tickle Me Elmo thing that was insanity
oh good grief go back to the 80s and the
Cabbage Patch Kids oh god for the first
year of Power Rangers that was a
nightmare huh I never wanted as he can't
like the hottest toys I guess I don't
know i don't think my parents gave me an
option really your parents didn't love
you that's what you should that's great
what do I things to me
Susanna I in the realm of electronics or
really it's hard anymore for anything to
be the hot item I mean they make
millions upon millions and because of
their their high dollar value you know
you're never going to see people going
nuts than yo and like that there was
violence / Cabbage Patch Kids yeah and
it will tickle me elmo but i don't think
you're ever going to see that sort of
thing but i think but like bb-8 you know
the thing is that it's something anyone
can play with you know it's e there's
going to be a two hour over a two hour
long commercial for I'm playing in
theaters all over the world well they're
probably going to sell a ton of those
things even though it's one hundred
fifty dollars dang if you do think cord
cutting is irrelevant I think my wife
and arrogant a quick cut while we're on
that topic go for it man it's awesome
from such and Hall hey sean is disney
infinity 2.0 for the xbox one worth it
for twenty dollars it's on sale /
clearance at my local best buy in canada
they are selling the toy box starter
pack and the marvel super heroes started
pack each for twenty dollars the only
problem with infinity and this annoys me
to no end is that you cannot play the
play sets from 2 point 0 with three
point oh you can't play the 1 point 0
with 2 point 0 and so on you gonna the
figures can go to any generation but the
playsets can't for twenty dollars the
way i would be looking at it is you're
getting two figures for ten dollars each
and you'll get you know five six hours
of play time i would go with the Marvel
starter pack you're going to get five
six hours out of the game yeah I I don't
know that's a tough call because I I
don't understand why they can't make the
place that's cross compatible that I've
had many conversations with the the guys
that I havelange you know interviewing
them or whatever no it's just not
technically possible like come on if the
figures work
why can't the place that's hmm it
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me
but I don't know but for twenty bucks
why not I'll be glad to spend your money
for you such an let's see here from
brazen Franco ARS technica has defined
the 950 as a shirt or the wp fan crowd
but a know by four others would you say
the same thing Todd yeah probably I
think that's probably what i'll come to
you but which is unfortunate because i
think i think that a lot of the features
could be really cool for people and yet
you know they're not yet and that's the
problem so Windows Windows 10 fans or
Windows Phone fans are you know okay
fine they finally have a new flagship
they've been waiting a long time for a
one but it shouldn't have just been that
should have been appealing to a lot more
people because the Windows Phone base is
so small I mean and I'm looking I was
obviously I just finished the Privy
review and I was going through the
passport recently and when you think
about just all the apps that are
available even on the blackberry 10
platform that aren't available for
Windows 10 it's frustrating I mean and
these are just a few that I've noticed
already on Windows 10 but like periscope
and snapchat and stuff like that I mean
periscope now is such a for me has been
very important in a compelling app
especially given the global events and
and snapshots kind of fun and you just
don't get those and Microsoft's just
betting that and this is that they've
been betting for a long time that ok now
developers are building for billions of
computer billion computers running
Windows you know of course they're gonna
build apps that scale to this and that
of course is what bothers me because a
Microsoft's not doing it with skype
hasn't yet and be like I don't I don't
know that they're sure it might be easy
but so many developers have already said
yeah nobody uses windows phone i'm not
going to built it up or they ditch them
I mean look Facebook's on board but
instagram has been on beta forever and
it's just that kind of problem that has
stop at Microsoft's hoping it does but
I'm not sure so sure you know I've SAT
here for I don't know four years and
I've been following Microsoft for much
longer than that but for four years or
so since windows phone has been
available and they've been addressing
this a problem and promising and
promising and promising every single
time and saying this is what we're gonna
do this time this very do this time and
it just hasn't worked so there's a very
simple solution here Microsoft simply
needs to loan developers to these
companies yeah but they've even offered
cash incentives in the past and that's
how they said no faster people are
definitely gonna do it cuz we're gonna
pay them to do it and that didn't even
work because developers rightly so I
mean that's a lot to dedicate resources
to an app that's not used by that many
people that they then have to support
and and like I was saying they can you
know sure they're just gonna build the
windows app and that'll work and I hope
that that you know make sense except
she's building the windows app like CNN
like I never go into like why do I want
to CNN Windows app you know like I never
opened the app I screw the website and I
think that's the kind of thinking that's
just not working on a lot of levels yeah
a quick clarification from Justin yell
say sorry for the structure of that
question I meant to state the
irrelevance of TV major broadcast
channels not cord-cutting I love cutting
the cord and would never go back sorry
for the confusion okay that makes a lot
more sense to me I've really got to
remember to meet my phone uh oh good
