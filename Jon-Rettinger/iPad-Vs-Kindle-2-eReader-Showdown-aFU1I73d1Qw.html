technobuffalo here and by looking at the
set up i'm guessing you can see that
we've got a e-readers showdown for you
in one corner we have the contender
Apple's iPad and in the other we have
the champion Amazon's Kindle too I do a
lot of reading a vigor reader and I've
done almost all of my reading at least
for the almost the past year exclusively
on the Kindle so I was very intrigued by
the ipad its potential and its
ibookstore so we're going to go through
the stores and how they look and sort of
declare a winner at the end of this but
before we do that let's get a bit geeky
and go over some of the specs the kindle
two has a six inch eating display and
you can see it's not backlit it's meant
to look like a book or standard print
paper it's got a massive too weak
battery it really does last that long
the battery is only being drained
actually the pages are big turned when
it's ass playing static content like
this or a page the battery is not being
used and it weighs about 10.3 onces it
is very light the ipad has a 9.7 inch
backlit LCD is a capacitive touchscreen
battery lasts about 10 hours and it
weighs a 1.5 pounds so with the backlit
screen you've got no need for a light
but you do get a bit of glare and
reflection on the kindle on the other
hand you do need to light if you want to
read in the dark but you're not going to
get the reflection that you're going to
get with the ipad so again that's really
going to be which one you prefer bigger
screen real estate will see in a minute
net does come into play so let's talk
about the bookstore's the iBookstore
that Apple just launched has about 60
thousand titles and the certain that
that will grow amazon has a very mature
bookstore uh that's not the funny it's
been out for a while it's probably a
better way to say that of about 450,000
Apple uses an open epub format for their
books and kindle uses a proprietary
kindle format and you might be doing
great Apple using open format I can
an ePub book and do whatever I want used
on multiple devices not true FY used an
open format and close it similar to what
they did with AAC and iTunes so while
it's technically an open format you're
still with an apple walled garden here
so let's take a look at the bookstores
on each I'll go to ibooks I when it
comes to pure eye candy this is really a
no-brainer decision between the ipad or
the kindle larger screen color can show
a lot more so you're created with a
shelf looks like a wood shelf of books
you've got Winnie the Pooh is sort of
the free one that comes included so let
me show you what reading a book on here
looks like and then I'll show you the
bookstore so go ahead and open up whoo
ok so I was just on one of the pages
here navigation is pretty simple at the
bottom of the page you've got that bar
you can move along to any chapter that
you'd like and if you want to turn the
page just as you what I guess on a
regular book you can actually flip the
page over I believe you can just tap the
margins too if you want to change a page
if you don't want that animation but you
do get it if you like sort of get the
feel of actually turning a page over so
we'll go and show you some more of the
options here and you can see you get a
lot of content on just one page now this
does have an accelerometer so you can
turn it any way you like and you
actually get two pages per screen again
you can turn the pages just as you would
anything else so you get sort of a more
book esque feel I'm going to go ahead
and put it back into portrait for
demonstration purposes so you can go
ahead and go back to your library if
you'd like you can go ahead and view the
table of contents and jump right to a
particular part you can view your
bookmarks and jump right to them so
we'll go ahead and just pick later
chapter 2 you can adjust the brightness
ride from here and that's actually
important when you're doing web pages
you may want a brighter screen but then
may also have some eye strain so if you
want to take the brightness down and get
sort of a closer feel to what the ink
looks like you can actually pull the
brightness down right from the display
and the theory behind that is that
you'll have less eye strain go ahead and
put that back up you can change
you font size to the whatever size you
like you can even pick the font that
you'd like and you go ahead and search
for a particular word you've got some
options for the text as well you can
hold down you can pick or get book
market you can search it you can look
forward and dictionary if you don't know
what the word means and you get since
its color you get to the pictures look
as it wouldn't in an actual book which
is nice if you're reading a story to a
child or something you can actually show
them the picture so let's take a look at
the kindle go ahead and push this off to
the side i will take a look here at
let's say superfreakonomics one of the
books that I'm currently reading go
ahead hit okay they're just going to do
a little bit of sinking and that's
something to keep in mind as well the
amazon kindle has something that's kool
go whispernet which actually will sync
your content amongst all of your kindle
devices so you'll always be on the same
page now reading here you're going to
get pretty much same options you get up
your Regan actual book the e-ink display
does create very minimal eyestrain move
that off to the side get a bit
distracted does create very minimal eye
strain is really nice easy format it is
a bit smaller it's six inch screen so it
shows less content pages are turned by
buttons and everything is done by but
this is not a touchscreen Inc sony i
believe has a touch bring one and all
the pages are conducted just by turning
and tapping the button it's a very nice
way to read a book you get sort of a
feel of actually reading real text
because of the display and it's quite
nice now you do get some menu options
some options as well for customization
to go ahead and hit menu you can see
what some of those are you can jump
right the table of contents you can view
the cover and go the beginning go to
your locations you can sync it like I
just mentioned you could view the
description of the book you can search
this book for a particular word add a
bookmark and this also has a built-in
dictionary as well which is nice reading
a book you don't know what xenophobic or
loquacious means you go ahead and look
it up and you know what that is as far
as customization options you get a
decent amount of things with the kindle
to read
did the book back to you and a very
robotic voice and you can change the
font size as well this round is really
good after your personal preference
whether or not you can deal with the eye
strain and the brighter larger display
of the iPad or that you prefer sort of a
more traditional book look of the ink
personally I like being able to have
more text on a page and like being able
to see the images and the animation sort
of appeal to the geek in me so from a
personal standpoint i prefer the ipad
however i have not read many many many
books on this yet as nearly as I have on
a Kindle so I have an experience I
astray that's something to keep in mind
as you do continue to use the device
this one's give me a personal decision
but for me it is the ipad let's go and
check out the bookstores and see what
that looks like so we'll jump back to
the library we'll go ahead hit store and
you get a very similar store look and
feel that you get on the iPad with
itunes or the App Store to go ahead and
do books new books here are about 12 99
a bit more expensive actually on the
iPad than they are on the Kindle
although they do have very generous
previews so let's pick a book here we'll
go silencing opens up you get a
description you get the ratings and you
get samples that one thing i should say
about the samples they're very generous
here sub-samples have you been upwards
of 100 pages samples on the Kindle
you're generally going to get the first
chapter both of which would give you
enough to read and get a sense from that
you want to buy the book but the samples
tend to be a bit longer I can view all
the ratings you can be the first to rate
you've this typical star ratings or just
go ahead and buy and tap that or get
sample go right to the author's page or
if you want to email the book to a
friend there are a ton of free choices
here as well go ahead and scroll down a
ton of free books you go ahead and pick
a lot of the classics actually minutes
sort of been floating in the ether for a
while so let's go back to feature no
download a sample and show you what that
looks like
so here's the bullpen gospels I'm a
baseball fan so we'll just get the
sample so it rotates and it shows up
right on your bookshelf tap it and you
go ahead and start reading it the same
options that we just talked about go
back to the store so like I mentioned
where you're limited to just about
60,000 titles on the iPad at launch
although I applies promise that will
grow and buy time for watching this
video you know these two may be at
parity but for right now the kindle has
a very very large advantage so I you got
some a search functionality works i was
looking up superfreakonomics one of the
again the books i'm reading now you saw
on the kindle just typed it in both up a
suggestion if they have the book you get
sort of the same options that we just
saw before go ahead and go back you can
view by featured new york times
bestsellers to scroll through all those
top charts the top paid books and
whatever purchases that you've made
adventure they don't have any on here
yet so let's push the ipad off to the
side and take a look at the kindle book
store we'll go to back to the home
screen will go to menu and will shop in
the kindle store now it's certainly less
elegant but it's as functional as the
iPads again the ipad has a lot of eye
candy which you may or may not like this
is more of a traditional ebook which is
funny to say traditional with a very
digital format so you can view browse by
books newspapers magazines or blogs same
options new york times bestseller kindle
top sellers and some daily post and some
books ever recommended to you based on
purchases so let's go to New York Times
bestsellers now the ipad i should
mention uses Wi-Fi i'm testing the Wi-Fi
only version there will also be 3g
version which i use AT&amp;amp;T this version
that kindle i'm using is the older
kindle to which
has Sprint's evdo rev a network newer
versions that are global youth AT&amp;amp;T as
well but do not have Wi-Fi so you're
doing just a cellular network so you go
ahead and pick a book here's the girl
with the dragon tattoo and open that up
and you get some information on it as
well you get the customers who bought
this also by and get the ratings and
then go ahead and download a sample very
similar i can mention the samples are
just about a chapter long and search
works just the same type
superfreakonomics again and this does
have a full on screen keyboard the ipad
uses a virtual keyboard here you've got
actual buttons which some people tend to
prefer go ahead and search the sort and
it will pull it up and i can go ahead
and buy that now the options for reading
the books what the home screen looks
like just a gridview and go ahead and
pick the book you want tap in the d-pad
and opens it right up like you saw there
with superfreakonomics so when it comes
down to the bookstore having more books
is better than having i think a prettier
bookstore to look at so i think the
Kindles got it when that just based on
sheer number now if the ipad ever
reaches parity as far as number of
titles I've in the eye candy may be nice
so right now we're about tied up you
know it's getting any personal
preference but not you prefer the larger
screen of the iPad or the smaller eating
of the kindle but there is a big big big
trump card here when it comes down to
deciding which ebook reader you want to
get and that is right here the kindle
app amazon has released a kindle app for
the ipad essentially giving the ipad
access to every book in the kindle book
store and take advantage of its
whispersync network so your books are
always sunk up you can download and buy
any book that you can on the Kindle
right here on the iPad so here is a
superfreakonomics we were just talking
about
and I get that now for this location go
ahead know and i can go ahead and scroll
through page i don't get the same
animations but i can jump right to the
next page as I could on the Kindle
except now I've got a bigger screen to
look at it and I've got access to again
all those same books let me show you
again some about the kindle app will go
ahead and shop in the kindle store and
it's going to go in launch the browser
to take me to amazon com we're
essentially i can buy any book that i
want an amazon native format and for me
this is an absolute killer application i
get not only do i get access to apple's
ibookstore sort of all the cool graphics
i also get access to amazon's entire
catalog every book they have so if i
can't find something in Apple 60,000
catalog I can certainly find it in
amazon's 450,000 from catalog you've
just so many more choices here with the
ipad if you can deal with the backlit
backlit screen and you can take the
brightness down to decrease your eye
strain this one really is a no-brainer
the ipad is clearly the better choice in
my opinion for any reader now something
to keep in mind as well it does weigh
1.5 pounds so can get a bit heavy while
holding if you want to sit on down on
the couch and put on your knees not a
problem or read it in bed before we're
going to hold it the 1.5 pounds can
weigh a little bit more than you may
like so guys this has been jon rettinger
with a head-to-head of probably what i
assume we're going to be the two most
popular eBook readers on the market the
apple ipad and kindle two and in
addition to just being able to read all
the books here the ipad gives you a lot
of other things safari mail and ton of
other things up covered in previous
