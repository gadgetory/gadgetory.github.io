pretty exciting day for apple friend
Zeppo unleashed a slew of new products
and to get ready for the holiday season
so without any further ado let me go
through and rundown what Apple released
and there's a ton of stuff so let's get
started with the imac gone are the 20
and 24 inch models replaced and said
with a 21.5 and a 27 inch model now this
is some crazy stuff here the 21 has a
1920 x 1080 resolution pretty standard
the 27 comes in at 2560 x 1440 which is
insane they've got the st. ports as the
outgoing model the 27-inch has an SD
card slot you're also getting a new
design you've got a smaller chin and the
glass or the black bezel around the edge
is gone so the screen almost feels
completely flush to the edge pretty cool
if you ask me prices are about the same
the 21.5 starts at eleven ninety nine
and the 27 starts at 1700 and the
27-inch you can get a quad-core
processor in there which is pretty
badass so I'm looking down a little bit
so they got some knows these were just
released a few minutes ago so next thing
that will come out with was a new mac
mini same design but essentially double
everything with the exception of CPU so
you've got more rent got more hard drive
space essentially now and it's got the
new nvidia graphics card in it though
eventually now it's a macbook in a tiny
little desktop form factor very small
and now actually it's quite a little
powerhouse machine certainly well suited
for daily computing needs or even as at
home media center the next thing and the
really cool thing is the magic mouse
gone is the mighty mouse in a slew of
legal battles epilogue who lost the name
to Mighty Mouse but this magic mouse
pretty cool and I think really new in
the tech space it is a acrylic
multi-touch mouse with no buttons so
when you want to scroll / and / you just
scroll with your fingers when you want
to let's say do your multi-touch
movements that you
used to you do it right on the mouth I
think it's going to change the way that
we do some computing not only that it's
got a hot little design it's going to
run you 70 bucks and the claimants got
four months of battery life it looks
really really really nice put a picture
of it in this video so that was quite a
surprise the next surprised apple
released was a new plastic macbook the
plastic macbook that's been around for
years finally looks different it now
looks like its unibody aluminum or
aluminium depending on where you are
macbook pro brothers except in a classic
form factor still all white but a really
new hot design get a multi-touch
trackpad you're getting a sealed 7-hour
battery and are getting all that for the
same price of 999 these new I'm map it
should mention by the way are going to
come with the magic mouse so if you want
to get a new imac you don't have to wait
to you know get them out separately it's
going to come right in the package so
just a ton of new Apple products today
guys what do you think are you excited
about them or you get any of them do you
do not care you think apples well
positioned for the holiday season really
curious what you guys have to say so
leave text or video response and i'll
see you guys in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
