episode of let's play i'm joey davidson
the senior gaming editor at
TechnoBuffalo calm and I'm flying mag
runners dark pulse the power to Cory
today this game recently released it's a
first-person puzzler with platform
elements right away it's going to look
really similar to portal which is
probably what you're noticing now with
this kind of test chamber s5 with really
off-putting colors I guess essentially
mag runner is a game that's based on
magnets the storyline is set in a
cyberpunk future with a heavy hand in
Cthulhu mythology that's like Cthulhu is
an HP Lovecraft's mythical monster that
has really played a role in basically
popular modern fiction since you wrote
it back in the early 1900's I haven't
gotten any of the Cthulhu bits yet I
know it's coming I've seen screenshots
where there are monsters and whatnot
where I am now it's just very basically
an intelligent puzzling platformer so
what you're seeing right now and I'm
trying to try to explain what exactly is
going on the beams you're seeing are
magnetic fields that round circle over
there is also a magnetic field basically
your gun controls the polarity of
devices so rather than positive or
negative you have red and green I think
you can change that color scheme and the
options menu as well if you don't want
to do red and green you can do black and
white or blue and orange whatever
tickles your fancy essentially you need
to get the magnetic fields to play nice
together cooperate or oppose in order
for you to traverse a given level and
all the levels kind of in the same way
that I mean portal portal really was a
special game in more ways than just
wanted it yes it was really fun and it
was really difficult and challenging and
the humor in it was really solid and
everything else that we already praised
it for but one of the real reasons why
portal was genuinely influential upon
gaming was because of the way that it
introduced complicated puzzle solving
mechanics
it tests you right out of the gate and
it introduces really tough problems but
gives you enough tools to figure them
out that's what makes these puzzle games
so good and with a first-person puzzle
game in a similar vein like mag runner
it's really difficult to live up to what
portal introduced but they have so far
puzzles are a little bit tougher just
because the polarity of magnets is a
little harder to kind of conceive than
portals for me at least I mean I'm sure
it's different for everybody you're
gonna see me propel across this gap with
this magnet scheme is pretty wild the
aesthetic is really pleasing the
gameplay is really fun what I've seen so
far is solid it only costs 20 bucks
right now it's available on the pc
platform i don't know if there are any
plans to release it on others this is my
only complaint right here there's a lot
of loading in between sections and they
don't mask it very well you know we're
valve would have mashed the loading with
a really long elevator sequence mag
runner masks the loading with nothing
they just pause the action so about to
enter a really really complicated room
word got a lot of time left on the clock
and I figured oh this is how the story
is told by the way you get cutscenes in
between levels that are kind of not
really cut scenes but the Holograms of
people talking to you and then in the
game you actually get people sitting on
your gun talking to you which is kind of
cool and did it take two so anyway this
is a really really long level and rather
than just cutting off half way through i
figured i'd leave it intact but i'm not
going to talk the whole thing you can
kind of see me go through the motions of
solving the puzzles but essentially what
you need to know is that when two
platforms or two objects matching colors
so a green in a green obviously they
share it's kind of the opposite of
magnets which is weird because when you
have a plus and a plus they bounce off
of one another whatever when you have a
green and a green they attract when you
have a green and a red they are opposite
and they push apart so you kind of use
that pole and propulsion to your benefit
in order to solve puzzles this puzzle in
particular was really challenging for me
when I did finally kind of
orient the big space it's because it is
such a big room and it's kind of hard to
wrap your head around what you need to
do in order to solve the puzzle once I
figured out the space I had to figure
out how the heck I was meant to get all
the tools I needed to the door so you
know ourselves a puzzle when a block
comes crashing through a door you see
the door right down there on the bottom
left just a second ago otherwise this is
mag runner dark pulse like I said for
the PC it's currently available on Steam
it might hit other platforms down the
line if you'd like to see more this game
just let us know otherwise thank you
guys for watching let's play you've got
like ten minutes of this video left if
you don't want to watch it I'm not going
to be saying anything from here on out
it's just me solving this puzzle so
enjoy me being frustrated thank you guys
for watching i'm joey davidson see you
next time
huh
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
